The meeting, in Downing Street\u0027s Cabinet Room, will be the last opportunity to make clear criticism and disagreement.  The Prime Minister already meet her ministers inidually last night for a personal briefing on what is in the deal.  She survived that hurdle - if Mrs May had miscalculated her position, rebellious ministers could have resigned on the spot - potentially destroying the plans. The Prime Minister can probably survive one or two resignations - but a mass walkout would almost certainly finish her. What if Cabinet cannot agree? Anyone who cannot agree to the plan or who attacks it after will be expected to resign or face the sack.Much like after the one on one meetings, no inidual resignation will sink the Government but a raft of people quitting could collapse the Government. Aid Secretary Penny Mordaunt, Commons Leader Andrea Leadsom and Work and Pensions Secretary Esther McVey are seen as most likely to resign - but the loss of any would be survivable.Losing the senior Brexiteers in the Cabinet - particularly Environment Secretary Michael Gove and Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab - would be more damaging and possibly terminal. Chances of no deal would rocket as there is little time to negotiate a new deal. What if there is agreement? At the end of the meeting, Mrs May will likely sum up and ask her Cabinet to endorse the plan.Once the Cabinet has agreed, they are all bound by a \u0027collective responsibility\u0027 to defend it in public. If an agreement is reached, the Prime Minister is expected to hold live televised press conference and the full 500 page orce deal will be published.       The Cabinet (pictured in July) will assemble in Downing Street tomorrow afternoon to formally make a decision about whether to adopt the planRatification in the EU, February 2019 What will happen? After the meaningful vote in the UK, the EU will have to ratify the agreement.The European Parliament must also vote in favour of the deal. It has a representative in the talks, Guy Verhofstadt, who has repeatedly warned the deal must serve the EU\u0027s interests.Will it be agreed? In practice, once the leaders of the 27 member states have agreed a deal, ratification on the EU side should be assured.If the deal has passed the Commons and she is still in office, this should not be dangerous for the Prime Minister. May’s battle for Brexit: PM’s fate hangs in the balance as...How Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg joined forces with the...Share this articleExit day, March 29, 2019 What will happen? At 11pm on March 29, 2019, Britain will cease to be a member of the European Union, two years after triggering Article 50 and almost three years after the referendum. Exit happens at 11pm because it must happen on EU time.If the transition deal is in place, little will change immediately - people will travel in the same way as today and goods will cross the border normally. But Britain\u0027s MEPs will no longer sit in the European Parliament and British ministers will no longer take part in EU meetings.Negotiations will continue to turn the political agreement on the future partnership into legal text that will eventually become a second treaty. Both sides will build new customs and immigration controls in line with what this says.Transition ends, December 2020What will happen? The UK\u0027s position will undergo a more dramatic change at the end of December 2020, when the \u0027standstill\u0027 transition is due to finish.If the negotiations on a future trade deal are complete, that could come into force.But if they are still not complete the Irish border \u0027backstop\u0027 plan could be triggered.Under current thinking, that means the UK staying in the EU customs union and more regulatory checks between mainland Britain and Northern Ireland.Eurosceptics fear this arrangement will prevent the country striking trade deals elsewhere, and could effectively last for ever, as Brussels will have no incentive to negotiate a replacement deal.  "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/11/13/18/06DFCE8F000003E8-0-image-m-13_1542132927611.jpg","title":"Who key power brokers talks","story":"      Brexit Secretary DOominic Raab and EU negotiator Michel Barnier have led the teams finalising the deal in recent weeks Theresa May dramatically summons ministers to Downing Street...A draft Brexit deal agreed - but how WILL Theresa May...Share this articleThe final deal is thought to be at least 500 pages long and civil servants on both sides have spent months hammering out the detailed legal language.The treaty includes clauses on the £39billion orce bill, the rights of nationals living abroad on both sides and crucially how the Irish border will work.The key players on each side were:                                                                                                 TEAM UKDominic Raab           Brexit SecretaryDrafted in to replace David Davis in July, Raab was ordered to deliver the Chequers plan as Theresa May\u0027s political representative in the talks.A committed Brexiteer, he was part of the Vote Leave campaign and leading DEXEU was his first Cabinet job.Unlike his predecessor, Raab was explicitly appointed to deputise for the Prime Minister in the talks rather than personally lead them - but has been the point man in Brussels.Oliver Robbins           Prime Minister\u0027s Europe adviser  At around 6ft 3in, the burly civil servant certainly looks like he won\u0027t be messed with, but is best known in Whitehall for his intellect.Only 43, the Oxford PPE graduate has already served in senior roles for David Cameron, Theresa May and Gordon Brown.Brexiteers have repeatedly criticised him for dragging the talks toward a soft deal.Sir Tim Barrow          Britain\u0027s EU ambassadorHaving made his reputation as a Russia expert who wooed the Kremlin as our man in Moscow between 2011 and 2015, dealing with Brussels is unlikely to faze the career diplomat.Sir Tim has shunned the limelight since becoming our envoy to the EU last year.He will have a key role garnering information in back-channel embassy talks.                                                                                                 TEAM EU Michel Barnier           Chief EU Brexit negotiatorA seasoned French official was once called an \u0027enemy of Britain\u0027 for trying to impose controls on the City. Ambitious, he is distrusted in some UK quarters, but is also known as an ultra-charming negotiator.Brexit role has made him a \u0027rock star\u0027 figure in Brussels.

They have increased pilot awareness, they have reminded them of the proper procedure to disable (the automatic nose-down action), which stops the problem.\u0027Indonesian investigators say that the Lion Air Boeing 737 MAX 8 experienced malfunctions with sensors that indicate the angle of the nose on four recent flights, including the fatal one.The Wall Street Journal reported that U.S. and Indonesian investigators are increasingly focusing on the way that the plane\u0027s automated control systems interact. They are also questioning whether the FAA and Boeing adequately analyzed potential hazards if the systems malfunction and send faulty data to the plane\u0027s computers, according to the newspaper."},{"url":null,"title":"Boy 15 caught high speeds electric SCOOTER","story":"The boy appeared in court after being caught at what police have described as \u0027high speeds\u0027 on his scooter.

His only other daughter, Jan Lee, died in 1953 three days after birth.Aside from Joan Celia, or J.C., Lee is survived by his 87-year-old brother and fellow comic book writer, Larry Lieber.Lee revolutionized comics and has helped make billions for Hollywood. He introduced human frailties in Marvel superheroes such as Spider-Man, the Fantastic Four and the Incredible Hulk.As the top writer at Marvel Comics and later as its publisher, Lee was widely considered the architect of the contemporary comic book.     Lee and actor Chris Hemsworth arrive at the Los Angeles premiere of Thor at the El Capitan Theatre on May 2, 2011 in Hollywood          Lee (L) and actor Chadwick Boseman at the Los Angeles World Premiere of Marvel Studios\u0027 Black Panther at Dolby Theatre on January 29, 2018 in Hollywood          Actor Robert Downey Jr. (L) and Lee attend The Los Angeles World Premiere of Marvel Studios Doctor Strange in Hollywood, CA on Oct. 20th, 2016          Chris Evans and Stan Lee attend the premiere of Marvel\u0027s \u0027Captain America: Civil War\u0027 in Los Angeles in April 2016He revived the industry in the 1960s by offering the costumes and action craved by younger readers while insisting on sophisticated plots, college-level dialogue, satire, science fiction, even philosophy.Lee hit his stride this decade when he brought the Fantastic Four, the Hulk, Spider-Man, Iron Man and numerous others to life. Lee scripted most of Marvel\u0027s superhero comics himself during the \u002760s, including the Avengers and the X-Men, two of the most enduring. In 1972, he became Marvel\u0027s publisher and editorial director four years later, 72million copies of Spider-Man were sold.Lee also published several books, including \u0027The Superhero Women\u0027 in 1977 and \u0027How to Draw Comics the Marvel Way\u0027 the following year, when he was named publisher of the year by the Periodical and Book Association of America.    The dapper, friendly comic book genius continued to work into his 90s on numerous projects, including comics, films and DVDs. He is pictured above in 1990          Created by Stan Lee, the first Spiderman comic book, \u0027The Amazing Spider-Man\u0027 which was released in March 1963          Lee was recognizable to his fans with various cameos in Marvel films and TV projects. He filmed a cameo in every Marvel Studios film, with Venom (pictured above) being the most recent          Lee\u0027s death came just one day after he tweeted a photo of himself in his WWII uniform for Veterans\u0027 Day. He served during the war writing for training films before going back to MarvelCBS turned the Hulk into a successful TV series, with Bill Bixby and Lou Ferrigno portraying the doomed scientist from 1978-82. A Spider-Man series ran briefly in 1978. Both characters were featured in animated TV series as well.The first big-budget movie based on Lee\u0027s characters, \u0027X-Men,\u0027 was a smash in 2000, earning more than $130million at North American theaters. \u0027Spider-Man\u0027 did even better, taking in more than $400million in 2002. A Marvel movie empire would emerge after that, one of the most lucrative mega-franchises in cinema history, with the recent \u0027Avengers: Infinity War\u0027 grossing more than $2billion worldwide. In 10 years, the Marvel Cinematic Universe film shave netted over $17.6billion in worldwide grosses. Born December 28, 1922, in New York, he grew up a fan of \u0027Hardy Boys\u0027 adventure books and Errol Flynn movies, and got a job at Timely Comics after graduating from high school.Within a few months, the editor and art director quit, leaving the 17-year-old Lee with creative control over the company, which grew and was renamed Atlas Comics and, finally, Marvel. Lieber changed his name, thinking Lee would be used for \u0027silly little comics\u0027 and his real name would be reserved for novels.His early work largely reflected popular movies - westerns, crime dramas, romance, whatever was the rage at the time. He worked for about 50 cents per page.After a stint in the Army during World War II, writing for training films, he was back at Marvel to begin a long and admittedly boring run of assembly line comic book production. Lee\u0027s direct influence faded in the 1970s as he gave up some of his editorial duties at Marvel. But with his trademark white mustache and tinted sunglasses, he was the industry\u0027s most recognizable figure. He lectured widely on popular culture.Lee moved to Los Angeles in 1981 to head Marvel Productions, an animation studio that was later purchased, along with Marvel Comics, for $50million by New World Entertainment.As sales of comics declined, Marvel was forced into bankruptcy proceedings that meant it had to void a lifetime contract prohibiting Lee from working for anyone else. Lee later sued Marvel for $10million, saying the company cheated him out of millions in profits from movies based on his characters.In 2000, Lee agreed to write stories for DC Comics, reinventing Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman and other signature characters for Marvel\u0027s one-time rival. DC Vice President and Publisher Paul Levitz had nothing but praise when the agreement was made.          The creative dynamo, who revolutionized the comic book, has helped make billions for Hollywood by introducing human frailties in Marvel superheroes such as Spider-Man, the Fantastic Four and the Incredible Hulk. He is pictured on the red carpet in 2004  \u0027With his artistic collaborators at Marvel, Stan co-created the richest imaginary universe a single comics writer has ever built,\u0027 he said.The dapper, friendly comic book genius continued to work into his 90s on numerous projects, including comics, films and DVDs.In the late 1990s, he looked to capitalize on the Internet craze, offering animated \u0027Webisodes\u0027 of comic-like action. Stan Lee Media also sought to reach out to Web-savvy youth through deals with pop artists the Backstreet Boys and Mary J. Blige.The company went bankrupt, and three men were indicted for allegedly defrauding the business in a check kiting scam. Lee wasn\u0027t implicated.After that initial failure, Lee formed the successful Pow! Entertainment company to launch animated Internet-based projects.  "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/11/13/09/05769C9D000007D0-6383599-image-a-1_1542102036716.jpg","title":"Poldark creators new TV drama expose corruption ego greed Sir Philip Green","story":"    The creators of Poldark are producing a new television series based on the rise of Sir Philip Green.

We won\u0027t protect Europe if we don\u0027t decide to have a true European army. \u0027We have to have a Europe that can defend itself alone - and without only relying on the United States in a more sovereign manner.\u0027We should protect ourselves when it comes to China, Russia and even the United States of America.\u0027That last remark angered Trump, who met with Macron on Friday last week and tweeted before the meeting: \u0027President Macron of France has just suggested that Europe build its own military in order to protect itself from the US, China and Russia.\u0027Very insulting, but perhaps Europe should first pay its fair share of NATO, which the US subsidizes greatly!\u0027 The French government insists that Macron meant Europe needs to protect itself from decisions the US makes - such as withdrawing from the missile treaty - and not from an invasion, though Trump seems to have interpreted it differently.Shortly before Merkel spoke, Trump rekindled the feud on Twitter, writing: \u0027Macron suggests building its own army to protect Europe against the U.S., China and Russia.            Trump lashed out at Macron\u0027s comments on Twitter last week, calling them \u0027very insulting\u0027 ahead of a meeting between the pair          Trump and Macron\u0027s spat marks a significant falling-out for the two world leaders, who had shared a cordial friendship despite their differing views\u0027But it was Germany in World Wars One \u0026amp Two - How did that work out for France?

Patton\u0027s 3rd Army and were keen to get to work.Patton\u0027s original plan called for the city to be surrounded but not liberated for fear it would slow the Allied advance down and be too costly.However, de Gaulle insisted that his men be allowed to lead the charge, telling Patton that he would give the order himself if necessary.Patton conceded, and in the end his fears proved ill-founded. Despite Hitler giving orders to defend Paris \u0027to the last man\u0027, resistance was weaker than expected. Many Nazi guards abandoned their posts as they came under attack from both outside the city and from resistance fighters within.General Dietrich von Choltitz, commander of the German garrison, also disobeyed Hitler\u0027s orders to blow up Paris\u0027s landmarks as the Allies advanced, refusing to be responsible for levelling the so-called City of Light.French and US troops entered the city on August 24, and fearful that the Americans would beat him to the city centre, De Gaulle ordered his men to fight through the night.By the morning of August 25, his 2nd Armoured Division had reached the centre, and by the end of the day - fighting alongside the Americans - Paris was free of Nazi rule.

fearing that the plan for an Irish border backstop could keep Britain trapped inside the EU customs union.But she was only promoted to the Cabinet in January this year, is not a household name, and did not play a big role in the Leave campaign as she did not have a parliamentary seat when the Brexit referendum was run.If she does walk now over the Brexit deal then she could be cutting her ministerial career very short.Damage score: 410 Dominic Raab, Brexit Secretary           As Britain\u0027s second Brexit Secretary in six months, Dominic Raab (pictured in Downing Street today)  is a central player in the CabinetAs Britain\u0027s second Brexit Secretary in six months, Mr Raab is a central player in the Cabinet.The ardent Brexiteer was one of the faces of the Vote Leave campaign, and was promoted to his post in June after David Davis quit in fury at the Chequers plan.While he has maintained his loyalty to Theresa May publicly, he has been a  fierce critic of EU. He was furious at Brussels for blocking the UK from ensuring it could leave the EU customs union unilaterally under the terms of the backstop agreement. Losing a second Brexit Secretary in six months would be hugely damaging to the PM.Damage score : 910    Andrea Leadsom (pictured in Downing Street last month) was a leading face with Vote LeaveAndrea Leadsom, leader of the CommonsAnother leading campaigner with the Vote leave campaign, Andrew Leadsom had been a contender for the Tory leadership before withdrawing from the race -

Tens of thousands have taken to the streets in Pakistan to demand that the Roman Catholic farm worker – who is in hiding under police protection – is put to death.Former Tory chairman Baroness Sayeeda Warsi, the daughter of Pakistani immigrants, said that if Pakistan could not keep Mrs Bibi safe, the UK should take her in, adding: ‘We cannot tolerate mob rule.’The claims emerged as pressure mounted on Theresa May to intervene.More than 70 MPs and peers signed a letter to the PM calling for a grant of asylum and asking her to take account of the ‘exceptional circumstances’ of the case.Row over a cup of water that led to murder, riots and global...Making a splash for the wrong reasons!

It said: ‘Britain’s commitment to freedom of religious expression is one of our most important values. We call on you to make a clear and proactive statement that Britain would welcome a request for sanctuary here.’          Mrs Bibi, pictured with two of her five children, was jailed for nine years after a row over a cup of water.

So Asia was sent by her co-workers to draw from the local well. After she drank using a utensil from which everyone was to quench their thirst, some of the women refused to drink from it.They were Muslims and she was Christian, an infidel. Therefore the cup was now haram – unclean to them. It has been reported they even claimed the well was defiled because Asia had drunk from it.That is when her real troubles began troubles that would put her in jail for nine years under the threat of death and now, on release, to fear for her life.The approximately 2.5million Christians in Pakistan are largely descended from low-caste Hindus who were converted by British missionaries during the Raj. Many did so to escape the prejudices and oppressions of the Hindu caste system. Now their descendants find themselves trapped in poverty and fear by a different kind of strict religious hegemony.In recent years, their vulnerability has only increased thanks to the rise of militant Islam.Blasphemy laws introduced by Islamist President Mohammad Zia-ul-Haq in the Eighties, have been used as a stick to subjugate non-Muslim minorities. The most significant in this instance is Section 295c of the Penal Code, passed in 1986. Anyone found guilty of defiling the name of the Prophet Mohammed would face a mandatory death sentence.Asia and her family were the only Christian household in her village, and therefore already vulnerable. Previously she had been harassed to convert to Islam. But the day she drank from the well there was an argument with three other women during which it was alleged religious insults were swapped. A ‘fight’ took place.Five days later the local imam, Mohammed Qari Salim, became involved – and not as a peacemaker. He used his position – and the loudspeakers of his mosque – to whip up hatred against Asia, who was beaten by a mob chanting: ‘Death to the Christian.’ He also filed a blasphemy complaint to police.‘They tried to put a noose around my neck so they could kill me,’ Asia later said of her assailants. But before she could be lynched she was arrested under Section 295c.Her husband and children went into hiding, having received anonymous death threats. He told the BBC: ‘They say, “We’ll deal with you if we get our hands on you”. Now everyone knows about us, so I am hiding my kids here and there. I don’t allow them to go out. Anyone can harm them.’Asia was charged with insulting the Holy Prophet and the Koran, allegations she has always denied. She then spent 18 months in jail on remand.She said the allegations were made up by one village woman who had a long-standing grudge against her. Such score-settling is a common abuse of the blasphemy laws, according to human rights campaigners.In November 2010, at a district court, Asia became the first woman in Pakistan to be sentenced to death under blasphemy laws, and was told to pay a fine equivalent to £2,180. A female farm worker in Punjab earns around £2 a day. At the court, a mob chanted: ‘Kill her, kill her.’ Asia was put on death row under 24-hour surveillance – for her own protection.The death sentence caused outrage outside Pakistan – Pope Benedict called for clemency – but delight among the country’s religious hardliners. Imam Salim, who helped bring the case against her, said: ‘Any Muslim, if given the chance, would kill such a person. You would be rewarded in heaven.’ He said he burst into tears of joy when the sentence was passed.Meanwhile, a cleric in the city of Peshawar offered a reward of £4,000 to anyone who killed Asia if she escaped execution.Some official voices spoke out on her behalf. One of the most important and impressive was the Governor of Punjab, Salmaan Taseer, a long-time critic of abuses of his country’s blasphemy laws.He visited Asia in jail and said he would ask the then president, Asif Ali Zardari, to pardon her. The governor said Asia told him she had not disrespected the Holy Prophet and claimed she was sexually assaulted and dragged through her village by a mob.That sealed his fate.A few days into the January of 2011, he was gunned down by his own bodyguard, shot 27 times in central Islamabad. The killer was hailed a religious hero by many in Pakistan, and when in 2016 he was hanged for the murder, Islamist mobs went on the rampage in towns across the country. His funeral was attended by an estimated 100,000 mourners.Shahbaz Bhatti, Pakistan’s minister for minorities and himself a Roman Catholic, also protested against Asia’s conviction and sentence. He had been receiving death threats from Islamist groups including the Taliban and Al Qaeda for years. His outspoken support for Asia only served to precipitate the inevitable.Less than two months after Governor Taseer’s death, Mr Bhatti, 42, was driving through Islamabad when his car was riddled with bullets. He died in hospital.            Ms Bibi has been banned from leaving Pakistan by the government, which has placed her life at considerable risk as some religious leaders have placed a large bounty on her headHe had foretold the manner of his death in a video that was released after the assassination. Speaking to the camera he said: ‘I believe in Jesus Christ who has given his own life for us, and I am ready to die for a cause. I’m living for my community... and I will die to defend their rights.’With Asia behind bars, attacks on her fellow Christians increased in frequency and ferocity.In 2013, a twin suicide bomb attack on a church in Peshawar killed around 80 people. The following year in Lahore, bomb attacks on churches killed 14 and wounded 70. Christians celebrating Easter in Lahore in 2016 were hit by a suicide bombing that killed 70 and injured 340, while a church attack in Quetta last year caused dozens more casualties.A new hard-Right Islamist party called Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) was established, calling for blasphemers to be killed and their murderers celebrated.Meanwhile, despite the grave threat to their safety, Asia’s supporters fought on. In October 2014, her appeal to the Lahore High Court against her conviction was dismissed and the sentence upheld. The following summer, the Supreme Court suspended her death sentence while the appeals process ran its course.Then, on October 31 this year, three Supreme Court judges, led by the Chief Justice, quashed the blasphemy convictions and death sentence. One said: ‘Blasphemy is a serious offence, but... a conclusion is inescapable and irresistible that the prosecution failed to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt.’While Asia expressed her delight from her cell, Islamists took to the streets, bringing towns and cities to a halt. The TLP party called for the judges to be killed.Having praised the Supreme Court decision and the ‘rule of law’, Imran Khan caved in to the extremists and reportedly agreed to bar Asia from leaving Pakistan, and even have the verdict examined by another court.This caused international outrage, not least from his ex-wife Miss Goldsmith (the mother of his children). She tweeted: ‘Three days after a defiant \u0026amp brave speech defending the judiciary, Pakistan’s gov caves in to extremist demands to bar #AsiaBibi from leaving Pak, after she was acquitted of blasphemy – effectively signing her death warrant.’Asia’s lawyer, Saif ul-Malook, had already fled the country, fearing for his life. His client is now in limbo, having been flown from her jail to the capital. ‘Asia Bibi is completely secure at a safe place in Pakistan,’ a foreign ministry spokesman said. ‘She can go anywhere she wants to, she is a free national ... if she wants to go abroad, no harm in it.’But it is clear that if she is allowed to leave there will be further fury from Islamist protesters – which means the moral credibility of Mr Khan is now in question as her fate is decided.Will he let Asia go, or will he pander to those who would keep her in Pakistan where it is likely she will be hunted down and killed?    "},{"url":null,"title":"What earth possessed liberal Lord Lester","story":"Perhaps the strangest thing about Lord Lester’s allegedly very strange seduction technique is that this outwardly sane, worldly and highly distinguished man could have possibly envisioned it ending in success Perhaps the strangest thing about Lord Lester’s allegedly very strange seduction technique is that this outwardly sane, worldly and highly distinguished man could have possibly envisioned it ending in success.The 82-year-old married Liberal Democrat peer not only seemed to think an elegant women’s rights campaigner three decades his junior could be talked into becoming his mistress, but also decided the best way to pursue this ignoble aim would be to crudely proposition her.That, at least, is the claim made by Jasvinder Sanghera, whose testimony to the House of Lords Commissioner for Standards has mired the veteran parliamentarian in a sex scandal.She has accused Lester, to quote the conclusions of a nine-month investigation, of being responsible for multiple incidents of ‘unwanted touching’, including groping her in his car and the kitchen of his £3 million South London house, and of persistently making sometimes revolting ‘sexual comments and offers’ to her, ‘even after she clearly objected’.After repeatedly rebuffing him, Sanghera says he then decided to offer her a ‘corrupt inducement’ to submit to the creepy advances, saying: ‘If you sleep with me, I will make you a baroness within a year.’Finally, when all else had failed, Lester stands accused of turning nasty: threatening to ‘see to it that I never had a seat in the House of Lords’, before using his power and influence to ensure she was dropped from the guest-list for important parliamentary meetings.For any public figure to indulge in such sleazy behaviour would be deeply unedifying.Sports scientist, 33, develops a brain tumour the size of an...Share this articleFor the supposed perpetrator to be a distinguished Left-wing barrister — an architect of the famous 1975 Sex Discrimination Act, and a man regarded (in the words of a newspaper profile) as the ‘Godfather of human rights legislation’, who has spent his life campaigning for minorities, especially women — it is surreal.Yet just such a conclusion was this week reached by the powerful Lords Committee for Privileges and Conduct, which found that Lord Lester of Herne Hill became so ‘obsessively attracted’ to the younger woman that ‘he completely lost all sense of judgment and propriety’.It recommended that he be suspended from the Upper House until June 2022, the longest parliamentary suspension of the modern era.          That, at least, is the claim made by Jasvinder Sanghera, whose testimony to the House of Lords Commissioner for Standards has mired the veteran parliamentarian in a sex scandalIts decision was laid out in a 130-page report concluding the claims made by Sanghera, who has waived anonymity, are ‘more likely than not’ to be true, on what was described as ‘the balance of probabilities’.Before coming to this ruling, the Committee spoke to ten witnesses. Six of them helped prop up the case against Lord Lester, who continues to dismiss every allegation of impropriety as a ‘pack of lies’. Four spoke in his defence.The events in dispute date back to 2006 when the peer contacted Sanghera to ask for help to pass a Private Member’s Bill that would make forced marriage a civil offence.On paper, it represented a terrific opportunity. Jasvinder Sanghera, who grew up in a strict Sikh family in Derby — before running away as a teenager to escape such a marriage herself — has spent 25 years campaigning relentlessly on the issue. In 1993, she set up a charity called Karma Nirvana to champion the rights of women in minority communities, having seen her sister Robina commit suicide in order to escape an abusive spouse.The award-winning organisation set up refuges in Derby and Stoke, runs a helpline which offers advice to around 600 women a month, and has lobbied against everything from so-called honour killing, to female genital mutilation, to the failure of authorities to deal with Asian grooming gangs for fear of ‘rocking the multicultural boat’. For her tireless work Sanghera, now 53, was awarded the CBE.   She has accused Lester, to quote the conclusions of a nine-month investigation, of being responsible for multiple incidents of ‘unwanted touching’, including groping her in his car and the kitchen of his £3 million South London house, and of persistently making sometimes revolting ‘sexual comments and offers’ to her, ‘even after she clearly objected\u0027Lord Lester’s proposed Bill seemed like a victory for her campaigns, so Sanghera travelled to London to help draft it. Yet almost immediately, she sensed a second agenda.After their first meeting, at Lester’s barristers’ chambers, she was invited to accompany him to Wildy’s, an antiquarian bookshop in Lincoln’s Inn, where, she says, he bought her valuable copies of two classics: Shakespeare’s sonnets and Anna Karenina.Initially, Sanghera, who has three children from two marriages and lives with a long-term partner, assumed the gesture was eccentric rather than romantic. But according to a statement she gave to the Commissioner, things darkened significantly a few weeks later when she met him in Parliament for a series of meetings, plus a dinner, with supporters of the proposed Bill.By the time proceedings finished, Sanghera had missed her train home from London. When Lester found out, he invited her to spend the night at his six-bedroom home in Herne Hill, South London, saying that ‘his wife wanted to meet her’.There followed an extraordinary journey in the elderly peer’s car.‘He kept repeatedly missing the gearstick with his hand and instead very firmly placed his hand on my right thigh,’ she claimed. ‘The first time it happened, I thought it must have been an accident, but when it continued, I realised it was not. I removed his hand and asked him to stop. He just smiled. He continued to grope my thigh for the length of the journey, despite my protests.’On arriving home, Lester introduced her to his wife Catherine, who made them a cup of tea, before he escorted Sanghera to a spare room.‘Once we had reached where I would be sleeping, he said it was not far from his bedroom, which he insisted on pointing out to me,’ she added.The comment so unsettled Sanghera that she went to bed clothed, and ‘scarcely slept’ all night. Instead, she phoned a friend (described in evidence as ‘T’) who told her to put a chair under the door handle to stop anyone gaining access. The friend was one of six people — including a judge, a senior lawyer and a senior civil servant — with whom she would share details of Lester’s alleged harassment over the coming months. All acted as witnesses during the recent Lords inquiry.          In her statement to the Commissioner for Standards, Jasvinder Sanghera (pictured right) said:I attended a meeting followed by a meal in the House of Lords with a number of others including NGOs and Lord Lester. By the end of the meeting I had missed my intended train. I could have caught a later train but this would have meant arriving home sometime in the early hours of the following morning. Lord Lester suggested that I stay at his home in London. I initially said no as I did not wish to impose on his hospitality, but he insisted and said he would call his wife. Shortly after this he said he had telephoned his wife who is looking forward to meeting me, that his wife was at home and that she worked in an area that related to my work, and would love to meet me. I had no reason to be concerned about staying overnight, especially with his wife present and had by that time been working with him for a few months, and so I accepted his invitation.In the car on the way to his house, he kept repeatedly missing the gearstick with his hand and instead very firmly placed his hand on my right thigh. The first time it happened I thought it must\u0027ve been an accident, but when it continued I realised it was not. I removed his hand and asked him to stop. He just smiled. I felt incredibly uncomfortable knowing that I was on the way to staying at his house. He continued to grope my thigh for the length of the journey, despite my protests.When we arrived at his house, we were greeted by his wife who had made tea for us. We chatted, and his wife told me she would bring me a cup of tea to my room in the morning. Lord Lester then said he would show me to my bedroom for the night. Once we had reached where I would be sleeping, he said it was not far from his bedroom, which he insisted on pointing out to me, saying he would not be far from me. This made me feel very uncomfortable, as his remarks and his earlier behaviour made me feel that he had other intentions notwithstanding my unequivocal rejection of his advances.I went into my bedroom and immediately placed the chair under the door I felt afraid, recalling what had happened in the car. I immediately called T, who had been a friend for many years. I was in the bedroom at this time and I told her what had happened and I felt trapped in his house. She advised me that I put the chair under the handle of the door, which I had placed as I feared Lord Lester might come into my room in the night and she suggested I leave first thing in the morning. I scarcely slept all night, sleeping fully clothed.I removed the chair in the early hours of the morning as I knew his wife will be coming to bring me a cup of tea. This she did, and I then got ready and came down to leave for home.By this time, his wife had left, it was only Lord Lester in the house and I went into the kitchen. I went over to place the crockery in the sink. It was then that he came up behind me and put his arms around my waist. I pushed him away. Again, he placed his arms around me and further up my body. I had to force myself away. He pursued me around the kitchen and I pleaded with him to stop. Once he stopped, I told him that I wished to leave. I wanted to call a cab, but he insisted that he went with me. I allowed him to, as I just wanted to get out of the house.Once we got to the train station, he told me that he had strong feelings for me. I responded by saying I did not feel the same way. I said that he should know better as he had a wife. I made it very clear that I did not feel the same way and did not want to be involved with him in any way other than professionally.

Because they\u0027re making too much money being bribed by the leaders of drug cartels.\u0027Lichtman\u0027s statement came after Fels laid out the US government\u0027s case, describing how prosecutors would prove that Guzman rose from a low-level marijuana trafficker in the 1970s to lead the powerful Sinaloa Cartel.Fels said that Guzman, 61, eventually established relationships with Colombian cartels that allowed him to make billions of dollars moving cocaine.He said jurors would see evidence of seized cocaine shipments adding up to \u0027more than a line of cocaine for every single person in the United States.\u0027Prosecutors contend that Guzman spent a quarter of a century smuggling cocaine into the United States.

He faces 11 trafficking, firearms and money laundering charges in what is expected to be a more than four-month trial. The Brooklyn Federal Courthouse is pictured on Tuesday\u0027He was indeed the boss of his organization,\u0027 the prosecutor added, saying Guzman \u0027used planes, trains, automobiles, fishing vessels, trucks, even submarines,\u0027 to traffic drugs to the United States.Lichtman did not finish his statement and is expected to resume Wednesday.In addition to Lichtman, Guzman\u0027s lawyers at the trial include Eduardo Balarezo and William Purpura, who previously defended Mexican drug lord Alfredo Beltran Leyva, once a partner and later a rival of Guzman. Beltran Leyva pleaded guilty to U.S. drug charges and was sentenced to life in prison by a federal judge in Washington last year.Opening statements in Guzman\u0027s trial finally got underway after two jurors were dismissed from the lineup, forcing lawyers and the judge to re-interview potential candidates before the full panel could be sworn in.

He was later convicted of dangerous driving and aggravated vehicle taking for this  Legge has posted a number of images on social media, including of himself larking about with friends and posing with champagne and vodkaProsecuting Huw Edwards, said: \u0027They followed him and, shortly afterwards, the Ford made off and a chase began.\u0027A tyre deflation device was laid out during the chase and his tyres were damaged - but he continued anyway. He was travelling as fast as 90mph on 30mph limit roads, albeit before the tyres were damaged.\u0027The defendant, during the chase, contravened red traffic signals and drove on the wrong side of the road. Eventually, the police managed to pin his Ford car in.          Legge (pictured) served two years in jail for a burglary spree which saw him target around 30 homes.

Damage was done to the police vehicles - somewhere in the region of £4,000 worth.\u0027In mitigation defence lawyer Stella Massey, said: \u0027The defendant understands that these offences are very serious, and even more so during a suspended sentence. He makes no excuses whatsoever.\u0027From the start, he pleaded guilty to these offences. For the first time in his life, as a 24 year old man, he is making progress. He said to me that he has had enough of this.\u0027Also for the first time in his life, he is in stable accommodation and he says that he has disassociated himself from the people he used to hang around with when he got in trouble.\u0027He is not in full time employment, but he has casual work, working for somebody who hires out bouncy castles. He is described as being immature and having a chaotic lifestyle, but he is showing signs of thinking, stepping back and showing maturity.\u0027Although the report says he is at a high risk of reoffending, I think with community work that risk could be reduced. So I ask your honour if you could give him a further suspension hanging over his head and one last chance.\u0027Legge was also banned from driving for a further two years which will start following his release from jail and he will have to take an extending driving test.

You went at 90mph in residential, drive through red lights and hit a police car.\u0027The police hit your car with a stinger but you continued. You were constantly on the other side of the road and it\u0027s only because of luck that nobody was coming the other way, otherwise you or somebody else could have been killed. \u0027You had been put on a suspended sentence and that is a seriously aggravating feature that you committed this offence so close to the last one.\u0027 At Minshull Street Crown, Legge admitted dangerous driving, driving whilst disqualified and having no insurance and was locked up for a further two years. He also admitted an unrelated offence of shoplifting. "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2042048390480835a9433b5cd1132db81155e6c1/0_0_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=691445f59e74decd839a5fe5856f9c35","title":"saffron harvest in greece in pictures","story":"Saffron – the spice so expensive it’s called ‘red gold’ – has brought jobs and money to a region better known for coal mines and unemployment.

Here’s what some of you saidI was blessed to meet him a few years ago, when I was costuming as Wolverine. At that time, multiple sclerosis had really taken a grip on me, and Stan took the time to step away from his photo shoots, sit me down and have a lovely chat. I’ll never forget, when thanking him for filling my childhood and beyond with tales of such amazing superheroes, he told me that people like me in his words, who put disability aside to help others and push through adversity, “were the true superheroes”. Those words stay with me every day. Bless you Stan for being such inspiration. tachikomaI had reading difficulties when I was in primary school back in the early 60s, but over time managed to understand the text and speech bubbles in comics more easily than pages in text in books. Thanks, Stan, for being one of the people who taught me how to read when my school couldn’t and for being one of the creators who gave me a world of amazing characters to engage with at a time when I was a pretty lonely little girl. I still read comics, but also became a voracious reader of books because of them. Madeleine WolfeStan Lee saved my life. Possibly. When I was six, a car hit me as I crossed a road (the man was on green, so I ran. Look both ways, kids!). Just before it did, I tried to jump, as Spider-Man had done in the comic colouring book I had just read. He got a bit higher than I did, having recently been bitten by a radioactive spider, but my tiny leap might have been the difference between flying over, as I did, and going under. Or it could have made no difference at all. But my point is RIP Stan, thanks for the magic. guyfmI was lucky enough to meet Stan a few years ago at a convention in London. He was clearly frail and needed help to walk and steady himself, but seemed overjoyed that so many people had come out to see him and support his work. His enthusiasm for his fans made him appear much younger than the 90+ years he was at the time. Although the meeting was brief and consisted little more of a few words, a handshake and a photograph it was an unforgettable experience. It was a rare opportunity to meet a man whose work had a profound impact on my early life and must be considered among the 20th century’s most influential writers and creators. Marc Casson, college lecturer, north WalesGrowing up in war-torn Belfast, I was lucky for two reason: the local library at the bottom of my street, and my father as a merchant seaman, bringing home a suitcase filled with American comic books, from New York, every trip to sea. I rarely attended school, for numerous reasons, but learned the love of words through Stan’s writing. I always wanted to be a writer, even though I knew I could never become one because of my working-class background. Then I listened to Stan’s advice: “The only advice anybody can give is, if you wanna be a writer, keep writing. And read all you can, read everything.” So I did, and I am! Thank you Stan, warts and all. Sam Millar, writer, BelfastMy favourite recent cameo of his was from the Spider-Man game that came out a few months ago. You tend to expect cameos in all Marvel movies but for some reason the cameo in the game took me by surprise. Even though it was an animated version rather than his actual likeness, it captured all his charm and I was grinning like an idiot when i saw it. Turns out it’ll be the last one released before his death. Fitting that it was Spider-Man. RIP Stan. dsk84A huge escapist part of my otherwise anxious and sometimes fear-driven childhood. I know he sometimes blurred the details of who created what, with Kirby and Ditko especially, but even if he just mostly left him and the others to get on with it, to later become the brash salesmanfront man, he must have been doing something right. Though he didn’t always make the best business decisions. But thank you Stan, for brightening up my young world. PP100I thought it would be nice to share my father’s memories of Stan Lee with you along with a photo of the A1 size drawing of the superhero Stan and Herb Trimpe created during a 1975 BBC Pebble Mill at One interview. Personally I am a life long Marvel fan, as are “Seymour-Man’s” grandchildren so the fact that their grandpa is not only their real life superhero but also a Stan Lee created Marvel one is priceless. The following is my dad, David Seymour’s, fond recollection of Stan’s visit to the Pebble Mill studios:“In 1975, I was a BBC reporter and television presenter working on a daily network magazinetalk show on BBC One called Pebble Mill, named after the the broadcasting centre in Birmingham. I vividly remember interviewing Stan Lee during his visit to the UK, promoting the Son of Origins, which described the creation of several Marvel Comic superheroes. Stan was a great guest both on and off the set. He was helpful, charming, talkative and inventive. It was an extended interview and Stan decided to transform me into a new type of superhero.“I was young, British, black-haired and, Stan claimed, clearly suitable for transformation. It’s 43 years ago, and I forget now what superpowers Stan endowed me with, but as we talked live on British TV, the Marvel artist Herb Timpe sketched out the the new creation: he was called Seymour-Man. I have the sketch to this day, signed by its creators, Stan and Herb. It graces one of our guest bedrooms at home in Northumberland and has always intrigued our grandchildren. Sadly, I never developed the super powers that Stan had described. But now, silver-haired, I’m still Seymour-Man.” Ben Seymour, 42, Newcastle"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fdb48ed2cbe5e9b95bc2f6243a236b90e155d6ff/0_2_2555_1533/master/2555.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fa3d9753def26cca69a034d7f7267edf","title":"stan lee marvel spider man black panther","story":"The comics legend behind such characters as Spider-Man and Black Panther has died at the age of 95.

The weaker performance prompted a review of measures to cut costs and reduce the number of flights it makes, although on Wednesday it said further action may be necessary.Christine Ourmières-Widener, Flybe’s chief executive, said the airline has a “strategy in place that is working” but is suffering from “external headwinds”. A sale is one of multiple options being explored.“We will look at the performance of each route,” she said, adding that reductions in the number of flights is also a possibility as the airline attempts to decrease its fleet size from 78 to 70. Redundancies were not planned because the airline will rely on natural attrition of staff numbers, she said.Union bosses expressed concerns about the airline’s plans. Unite national officer Oliver Richardson said the announcement was unsettling for workers.“Our first priority will be to remove the uncertainty facing our members by seeking assurances on jobs, pay and terms and conditions from both Flybe and any potential new owners,” he said.Flybe is the latest carrier to struggle in recent months, under pressure particularly from higher oil prices.

Government spending was also slightly higher in the third quarter.The trade weakness was partly down to temporary factors, including disruption to car production before new and more rigorous emissions tests that came into force in September, but economists warned there were also some worrying structural developments in Germany.Carsten Brzeski, the chief economist based in Germany for the Dutch bank ING, said the worst economic performance since the beginning of 2013 was “another wake-up call for the eurozone’s largest economy”.He said: “Problems with the emission norms created severe production problems in the automotive industry, higher energy prices completely erased previous wage increases and also don’t underestimate the negative confidence effect from the World Cup.“We don’t dare to predict the performance of the national football team but at least the automotive sector should rebound in the coming months and somewhat lower energy prices should revamp private consumption.“However, the poor export performance, despite a weak euro exchange rate, suggests that trade tensions and weaknesses in emerging markets could continue to weigh on Germany’s growth performance.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2f926b31cf0a751281e0e2f908b9b84024f0e24e/0_26_5172_3103/master/5172.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cf9c593e0a2c9a30779e31c3b462277a","title":"iceland let loose animatronic orangutan after christmas advert ban palm oil","story":"Retailer’s choice highlighting impact of palm oil production is deemed too political for TVIceland is to unleash a life-size animatronic orangutan on the streets of the UK after its Christmas advert highlighting the impact of palm oil production was banned for breaching political advertising rules.The supermarket chain has turned to special effects technology befitting Hollywood to create an ultra-realistic robotic orangutan for a stunt to raise awareness of the plight facing the species from deforestation of its habitat for palm oil production.The orangutan, created by a team who have worked on films and TV shows including Doctor Who and Sherlock, will first appear clinging to a Christmas tree in Coin Street, south London, before moving to other locations, including Oxford Street and several parks in the capital.It will then appear at a number of Iceland stores around the country, including Manchester and Birmingham, apparently “searching for a new home”. The replica orangutan is controlled remotely and by a specialist puppeteer who has studied the ape’s movements. Last week, Iceland’s rebadging of an animated short film was rejected by Clearcast, the body that vets adverts, for breaching rules banning political advertising in the 2003 Communications Act.The ban prompted a public outcry, with stars including James Corden, Anna Friel and Paloma Faith supporting a campaign to allow it to be aired on TV.It has also drawn political attention, with the MP Michael Gove tweeting to praise Iceland for raising awareness. More than 12 million people have watched the ad on Facebook, where UK broadcast TV regulations do not apply.An online petition on Change.org calling for the ad to be allowed to air has drawn almost 750,000 supporters.“Our stranded, distressed orangutan is a stark and potent symbol of the effects of deforestation,” said Richard Walker, Iceland’s managing director. “We are determined to be at the forefront of efforts to guarantee palm oil is not causing rainforest destruction and Iceland will continue to be a driving force until this environmental impact is drastically reduced.”Iceland has been accused of deliberately planning an ad that would be controversial and perhaps be banned, a relatively common tactic among advertisers seeking to get more bang for their marketing buck through free publicity.Iceland has denied this, saying it had booked £500,000 of media space on TV for the ad campaign, although this is not a significant TV budget for a major retailer.The retailer has an extensive range of palm oil-free products that it is seeking to promote across the festive season.Iceland will still be placing TV ads but only 10-second clips that will highlight palm oil-free products.To its credit, Iceland has put ethics surrounding this issue at the heart of the chain. Earlier this year it became the first major UK supermarket to pledge to remove palm oil from all its own-brand foods.“We always try to give people a real choice about what they buy and this was a key driver of our decision to allow Iceland customers to join us in saying ‘no to palm oil,’” Walker said. “I am immensely proud of the work our food development team has carried out to create this new Christmas range without palm oil – a celebration of our commitment to end its use before the year closes.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3c834f04bbca119557875bc5be7be300ce80d21e/0_201_4331_2599/master/4331.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7fd4709391fe442a9f8e537ea34396f8","title":"the dutch cities using walking to tackle issues from vandalism to broken streetlights","story":"Dutch cities are using wijkwandelingen, or neighbourhoods walks, as a hyperlocal way of improving cities, from fixing signs to adding playgrounds “This street sign is crooked,” notes Henny Koot, then stoops down to straighten it.Like many urban areas, Spoorwijk has some obvious superficial problems like damaged infrastructure, noise pollution, speeding cars and flytipped rubbish. But the Dutch are big on what they call meedoen, to participate, and with this in mind, instead of inidually complaining to the local authority or putting up with issues, the residents of Spoorwijk have found an active way to resolve neighbourhood gripes together.Every three months, locals gather to take a wijkwandeling – a neighbourhood walk. Together, they visit problematic areas and discuss what action should be taken. Any resident can turn up and take part, and about ten to fifteen participants of all ages and social groups usually come along.“Engaged citizens take care of their neighbourhood and their neighbours. They don’t feel indifferent, because they experience positive change as soon as they are asked for their ideas, suggestions and opinions,” explains alderman Rachid Guernaoui, a member of the The Hague’s city hall.I joined Spoorwijk’s June wijkwandeling. The route differs each time, and is determined by residents, who can email organisers their complaints and requests in advance or mention issues along the way.If a problem can be fixed on the spot – like straightening a crooked sign – it is. If not, a request for action is sent to the municipality via a community action list. While a single citizen may not have the time to make sure their complaint has been considered, Spoorwijk’s community group sends a follow-up after six months if their request has gone unanswered.But the walk is not all about problems. It’s also a chance to exhchange ideas, joke, laugh and discuss the neighbourhood. On my walk, as well as local residents there are two men from the nearby Laak Centraal neighbourhood who want to introduce the concept of wijkwandeling into their own district. There are people from the municipality who want to find a better connection to the community they serve, and from organisations such as Stichting MOOI, which helps people in need but also runs various cultural events. Representative Meysur Bijl talks about her organisation’s new projects, including a food festival.

There are positive words as well issues raised. “Thank you so much for the new park, thank you to everyone who made it happen,” says community organiser Carlien Nijbroek.Koot takes the opportunity to pass on information about a new renovation project which will affect a nearby street.

Larger projects, such as the need to lay new pipes, are being tackled as well.Although inidual wijkwandelingen are hyperlocal events, they take place in neighbourhoods in cities all over the country, making them an effective motor for change. For example, as a result of a small-scale citizen initiative, Kraayensteen, another Hague district, has been granted almost €1.9m euro for opknapping (beautifying) the local area, and Spoorwijk itself has been granted around €50,000 euro to spend on local projects.One of the most important things a city’s governing body can do is to promote “genuine dialogue, transparent city management and open communication with citizens always and everywhere,” says Guernaoui. And key to this is “taking both big and small topics as important” – an approach that the wijkwandeling movement exemplifies.Back on the wijkwandeling, a new generation of Spoorwijk citizens is already learning that speaking up can make a difference.“What are the things you don’t like in your neighbourhood?” one Spoorwijk mother asks her five-year old son. “The geese poop,” he replies.Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e6b948cccd4e8dae88983268d24a7b311e033594/0_116_3200_1920/master/3200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1da104586407c228c720a81f615ea4d9","title":"theresa may brexit deal mps","story":"This deal is only a licence to proceed into transition, wherein both leave and remain MPs will seek to further their causesSomething, at last, has changed. For nearly a year, Brexit has been characterised by a weird combination of turbulence and stagnation. The outline of an EU withdrawal agreement was agreed last December. The obstacle to its completion was apparent then, too. It was impossible for the UK to leave the European customs union while also retaining frictionless trade and without sabotaging the Good Friday agreement.For as long as Theresa May insisted that was not the case, progress in negotiations was glacial. News from Brussels was rare. Cabinet feuds and backbench posturing filled the gap. There was noise but it was a cacophony of questions: could the prime minister complete a deal and, if she did, could she sell it as a success to her party and to parliament? What would become of her – and of the country – if she could not? Today begin the answers.Ministers will decide whether to hitch themselves to the text that the prime minister has brought home. They will weigh the high historical stakes and factor in some lower calculation, starting with the parliamentary arithmetic. May needs the votes of 320 MPs to get a deal through the Commons. On the basis of conversations around Westminster in recent weeks – and there has been talk of little else – no one thinks she has the requisite tally – yet. And if there isn’t a majority for the deal, if it is destined to be a dud, there is less incentive for the cabinet to invest their political capital in her.The view in Downing Street has always been that the fact of an approved text would transform the debate. Instead of speculating about what should happen, MPs would be forced to confront what will happen if, so close to the deadline, they reject the actual Brexit on offer. No 10 has been priming the spin pump in anticipation of this moment: the heroic 11th-hour clinch of a deal, in defiance of the naysayers, the one and only chance to honour the will of the people and move on. May is also betting that a hitherto disengaged portion of the public will tune back in for the deal, that they will not be too fussed about the details, be glad that the end of the odyssey is in sight and be appalled if parliament looks poised to wreck it. The great Brexit spirit god of JGOWI will be invoked: “Just get on with it!”The problem with that pitch, as both hardline Brexiteers and unrepentant remainers point out, is that May’s deal will not really settle the matter at all. The withdrawal agreement, running to hundreds of pages, covers only the practical moment of separation. It is only a licence to proceed into transition, where questions of long-term alignment with the EU must then be finalised. The document prefiguring that part of the deal, the “political declaration” on a future relationship, is flimsier. Many of the biggest strategic and economic decisions will be kicked down the road. A lot depends on whether MPs see that imprecision as an opportunity or a threat. Some Brexiteers will see merit in bagging the simple fact of legal departure from the EU, with a view to dismantling any remnants of integration down the line.Some pro-Europeans might have the same idea, but with a symmetrically opposing trajectory in mind: take May’s halfway-house Brexit, tick the box of satisfying the referendum mandate, and then start rebuilding bridges to the continent.This is a question of temperament, and appetite for risk, as much as politics. The fate of May’s deal will be decided in a competition between two coalitions delineated neither by traditional party identities nor the more recent remain-leave schism. There will be a camp that swings behind May because there are just too many variables on the other side of her defeat. Each one of them is someone’s worst nightmare: exiting with no deal a general election Jeremy Corbyn as prime minister a second referendum that cancels Brexit altogether.On the other side are those who see at least one item on that menu that is just too desirable to pass up. They will not endorse a dismal compromise plan when their ideal outcome depends on killing it. No one sincerely believes that May has secured the best possible outcome. She had a duff hand, which she played badly. But in a stick-or-twist situation, when it is the nation’s prosperity and stability at stake, a lot depends on how MPs manage their fear of a bust.During the past few weeks two contradictory propositions have been circulating in Westminster with roughly equal currency. One is that somehow a strain of pragmatism that is innate to British politics, coupled with raw terror of chaos, will drive May’s bargain into law. The other is that, with hardline Tories, the DUP and Labour all finding reasons to hate May’s plan, there simply aren’t the votes for it. Only one of those propositions can hold.Overnight, Brexit has ceased to be a haze of slogans, ambitions, pledges and myths. It is now a piece of paper in the prime minister’s hand. There is no more “Brexit means Brexit”. There is a deal that either serves the national interest or betrays it. The detail will emerge in the days to come, but two things can be said with certainty. First, May’s route presents safer passage to the future than is envisaged in the wild fantasy of quitting the EU with no deal at all. Second, the terms that May has negotiated offer inferior status, market access, influence and power on the European continent and in the world than Britain has enjoyed as an EU member. Plenty of MPs know it, too comfortably a majority. The question now is how many have the courage to say so."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0fb70c07d1774fd638a408889fd24fbcba92caad/0_135_4134_2481/master/4134.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0ab560a6f63a2972a8a7ffba31e50071","title":"theresa may brexit deal panel verdict","story":"There’s a deal! I mean not a “deal” deal, but some draft text on a withdrawal agreement that defines the terms of the interim arrangements while we work out our future relationship with Europe and everyone else. We will hear a lot about how this agreement is in the “national interest”, about the technicalities of leaving the customs union and about the political fallout of a deal that fudges it on Northern Ireland, but nothing about how this agreement will fix a ided and unequal UK.The Brexit conversations to date have shown how little this government cares about tackling the challenges that led to Brexit in the first place. Alarmingly, inequality and poverty have not been mentioned once in the Brexit white papers to date. Over the next few days business leaders will be briefed at No 10, but trade unions – representing more than six million workers – will not.As well as demonstrating the priorities of our politicians, this agreement demonstrates how little power we have when negotiating with the EU. This shouldn’t be a surprise: one country versus 27 was never going to be an equal fight. We’ve been living in a fantasy world, and while I believe the Tories have made a particular mess of it, even the best negotiators in the world couldn’t even up this power imbalance.Focusing on the national interest would involve better policies to address the housing crisis, climate breakdown and reversing the damage done by austerity. The Tories’ Brexit is the biggest waste of time and effort and will ultimately expose just how deluded the Brexiteers are. The biggest injustice is that we all have to pay for their political drama.• Faiza Shaheen is the director of the Centre for Labour and Social StudiesThe closer we come to the Greek tragedy that is Brexit, the more horrifying it is to behold. Politicians that we had hoped would eventually see sense are playing the roles they are pre-programmed to play.Jeremy Corbyn affects to be dismayed by Theresa May’s Brexit plan – having all but manoeuvred her into this corner by his steadfast support of Brexit – and the changing will of the people seems to be the last thing on his mind. His support for Brexit has not got the support of 112 Labour constituencies – including his own – or the majority of the trade union movement. Still, he calls for a general election to give the British people a choice between the two main parties offering Brexit or Brexit.I can’t, however, see an election happening, not least because May’s latest plan does, rather inconveniently, appear to pass the six tests for Brexit that Keir Starmer laid out, crucially, protecting workers’ rights. It is the very sort of Brexit that Corbyn said he would support at the Labour party conference earlier this year.Corbyn has suddenly also become a champion of parliamentary sovereignty – demanding in a letter, co-signed by the leaders of Plaid Cymru, the SNP and the Liberal Democrats – that May should allow parliament to express its view on her plan and hold the government to account. Where was Corbyn when I had to take on the government in the courts to uphold parliamentary sovereignty to allow MPs a vote on article 50 in the first place?Intelligent Tory grandees such as William Hague are, meanwhile, prepared to put their intelligence to one side, and are urging MPs to back an arrangement with the European Union that is infinitely worse than the special deal, due to our membership, that we have now. With no sense of irony, he says that the people will not take kindly to being consulted on the final proposal via a people’s vote – completely missing the fact that poll after poll, including of the 67 marginal Tory seats, shows the majority of the country does want the opportunity to review and ratify the final deal. They understand we would go from being a powerful voice in the EU to a powerless one.These are all, however, just the games of here-today-gone-tomorrow politicians. Older and wiser heads that have gone before us drew up our constitution and our laws to protect us from ourselves. We may yet have reason to thank them.• Gina Miller is the founder of the End the Chaos websiteFrom an EU perspective, the draft deal agreed on Tuesday in Brussels with Britain was never a deal. It is an attempt to rein in a country that has gone rogue. In the eyes of European governments as well as the wider Brussels-based diplomatic community, the United Kingdom of Britain and Northern Ireland is now part of Trump country. Frivolous, ridiculous and, above all, unreliable.After over two years of mixed messages, U-turns and eye-watering ineptitude, all trust in Brussels that a British government’s word is worth more than the paper a billionaire-owned tabloid is printed on has evaporated. For this reason the draft deal is above all an exercise in future damage limitation: how to prevent future British governments from cheating their way out of agreed commitments and obligations. The stakes are huge, beginning with peace in Northern Ireland to the rights of EU citizens in the UK to the stability of the eurozone’s financial architecture and the EU economy.One shudders to think what havoc a group of well-prepared and disciplined Brexiteers could have wreaked on the EU. Two years between notification to leave and actual departure is a long time, and the EU is only united over Brexit because the British government could never choose between hard and soft Brexit. Had it done so, unity would have fractured, particularly if the UK had gone about it in a clever way. In spite of savage cuts Britain’s diplomatic corps is still respected and feared around the EU, and for good reason.Alas, the Brexiteers were always more interested in scoring points in the Brexit press than in fighting actual battles in Brussels and other European capitals. The “exit” brand now poisoned across the EU for at least half a decade, Brussels and EU governments have moved on. From an awkward uncle that was nonetheless part of the European family Britain has turned itself into an unreliable neighbour that is to be contained. As Donald Tusk put it right after the referendum result: we miss you already.• Joris Luyendijk is a Dutch journalist who used to live in BritainI voted to leave the EU, but the parameters of this deal were set long ago. Article 50 is designed to penalise departing members. But more importantly, the UK triggered that exit mechanism without first deciding where it wanted to end up. May began with a slim Commons majority and a split party. She then called an election that lost that majority and weakened her authority at home and in Europe.Her isive “citizens of nowhere” rhetoric, and refusal to guarantee EU nationals’ rights, helped crystallise isions rather than bring people together. And despite consistently claiming that no deal would be better than a bad deal, she did too little too late to prepare for that outcome.It wasn’t till two years after the referendum that cabinet actually agreed a vision of the post-Brexit relationship. Having been told by officials that this would unlock decisive progress, the main elements of Chequers were instead rejected by the EU at Salzburg.Meanwhile Brussels has consistently offered the UK a false choice for Brexit. Either a trade deal for just Great Britain, iding the UK by excluding Northern Ireland, or a relationship closer than Norway’s, which would be politically unsustainable in the medium term, entailing membership’s obligations with fewer benefits.In December 2017, the UK reluctantly signed up to the concept of a backstop – an Irish-border insurance policy. Since then, partly as a result of the EU’s one-sided interpretation of that joint text, but also because the UK inexplicably failed to articulate what it thought it had agreed, the backstop has become the key stumbling block.So this is a backstop-shaped Brexit. Unless the final text is very different from what is expected, the backstop will likely substantially limit the range of options for the UK. But what cabinet needs to decide is not whether it would have started from here, but whether it is willing to proceed, given that we are where we are. This doesn’t look like a deal that will pass parliament easily, and although the clock is ticking, we are not yet against a hard deadline. So my decision would be to thank the official negotiators for their work, and then send the Brexit secretary back to Brussels to get clearer safeguards for the UK in any deal.• Henry Newman is the director of Open Europe"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/84f58c41ee15f2598593230025a1c01ed19a589e/0_4_4365_2619/master/4365.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4c35de2c6c523ff55ad8b2a704551d73","title":"tell us what impact is private tuition having on education","story":"We’d like to find out from parents, teachers, students – and tutors about why private tuition is on the rise.

The most fashionable boobs are now no longer in your faceVictoria’s Secret has a whole bunch of problems right now. Last week’s New York fashion show has been overshadowed by comments made by its boss, Ed Razek (for which he has since apologised), about how it would be inappropriate to cast “transsexuals” in a show “about fantasy”. Profits, sales and market share have all fallen over the past year most alarmingly, month-by-month breakdown shows the decline growing steeper still. But neither of these are the brand’s biggest problem. The real trouble for Victoria’s Secret is that it is selling the wrong kind of cleavage.All breasts are beautiful, but some are more fashionable than others. The scaffolded cleavage – hoiked and cantilevered by a push-up bra, twin globes held rigid – is still the style at Victoria’s Secret. On the New York catwalk, Gigi Hadid wore a shiny blue check bra with matching knickers, a billowing tartan cape and a bumbag in the style of a sporran. Kendall Jenner was dressed in a black and silver glitter push-up bra with a multistrap knicker-harness hybrid and frilly wings. There was the odd legging-and-sports-bra concession to athleisure, but the hoisted boob reigned supreme. And, in 2018, this is the wrong kind.The right kind of boob, by contrast, can be seen on the cover of this month’s US Vogue, where Lady Gaga leans towards the camera in a low-cut Brandon Maxwell dress, her cleavage in its natural position, rather than lifted skywards. The no-bra scenario is emphasised by one of the straps of the dress falling off her shoulder. The Vogue-approved cleavage is the natural kind.See also the most famous cleavage of the Instagram age. Boobs don’t get any more political than Emily Ratajkowski’s. At every stage of her journey from Blurred Lines’ semi-naked backing dancer to prominent feminist activist, her breasts have become the story.When she was arrested in Washington DC protesting against Brett Kavanaugh’s appointment a month ago, her choice of outfit – a white cropped vest with no bra – was deemed by many headline writers the most newsworthy element of her detainment. Her friend and comrade Amy Schumer came to her defence, denouncing trolls who rage against “the victims, or a beautiful woman you’re threatened by” instead of directing their anger at the perpetrators of sexual assault.While the new-look cleavage may emphasise the female gaze, the female gaze is not necessarily less judgmental of other women’s bodies than the male one. Celebrating her natural beauty feels empowering to Ratajkowski, but some women watching her feel shortchanged by a sisterhood that calls for the world to respect women for more than their bodies, while still cashing in on the currency of hotness. It feels sometimes as if the age of toxic masculinity has coined, in response, a new kind of toxic feminism.Not wearing a bra has been associated with feminism for half a century, but the natural cleavage seen on Gaga’s Vogue and on Ratajkowski’s Instagram feels in step with fashion.Victoria’s Secret pays Kendall Jenner a stratospheric fee to appear on its catwalk because, with 98 million followers on Instagram, she has a look that young women want to emulate. The brand would do well to look at what she wears on that Instagram feed: among Jenner’s carefully curated off-duty looks there is not a push-up bra in sight. This summer, in a blog post entitled Free the Nipple, she wrote: “I really don’t see what the big deal is with going braless. I think it’s cool and I really just don’t care! It’s sexy, it’s comfortable and I’m cool with my breasts. That’s it!”The proudly bra-less look has become a below-the-radar fashion standard in the same way that a pair of all-white Stan Smiths were once ubiquitous on the front row. Cara Delevingne in a sporty crop top under a blazer at the February Dior show was an eye-catching example of an industry-wide move toward non-engineered cleavage.The push-up bra will always be controversial. When Eva Herzigová starred in that Wonderbra campaign, with a strapline that read like the male gaze with subtitles, many women hated it. But at least then the look had the frisson of the new and daring. The problem for Victoria Secret is that the look has become quaint. You can get away with most things, in fashion, if what you are doing is new, provocative and compelling. But being old-fashioned? That is unforgiveable.The rise of athleisure has affected all of us – even if you think spending £80 on leggings is absurd and you wouldn’t be seen dead in a crop top, I can almost promise that it has affected your silhouette. Trousers in more fluid fabrics and slouchy, fine-gauge knitwear have infiltrated all of our wardrobes, bringing with them a new kind of underwear that works with them. An old-school push-up bra was designed to work under a scoop-neck top, or a darted white shirt the protruding-headlamp silhouette ruins the elegance of a wide-shouldered slouchy jersey piece.But this is not just about clothes. It is also sex, romance and the potency of female beauty. The pushed-up cleavage, as seen on the Victoria’s Secret catwalk worn with excess blusher, knee-high socks and cheesy grins, conjures up a cheerleader-dates-quarterback meet-cute – and that feels like last century’s fairytale. As I say, all breasts are beautiful. But the most fashionable ones are no longer – how can I put this? – quite so in your face."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f794668d9856ff37517282b9d91c788007074c51/0_214_3300_1979/master/3300.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4097763160194e5bfdad79c1e3289569","title":"the shows the thing documentary frank barsalona rock promoters","story":"In new film The Show’s The Thing, the story of Frank Barsalona, who blueprinted the modern concert industry is explored with help from the major artists he helped to the stageTo date, more than 600 people have been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, most of whom are fantastically famous. Yet, somehow, one of the least-known inductees managed to receive one of the hall’s highest honors. In 2005, Frank Barsalona, a concert promoter, received a “lifetime achievement” distinction at the Cleveland-based institution. So, how did a guy who, some might think, simply booked talent, earn such a lofty distinction?The answers lie in an informative new documentary, The Show’s The Thing: The Legendary Promoters of Rock. In colorful detail, the film lays out how Barsalona blueprinted the modern concert business (now a $10bn industry), along the way changing how audiences relate to the music, while also providing crucial support for some of its greatest stars. “No act becomes huge without a key promoter doing his work,” says Bob Geldof in the film.“These guys were as much tastemakers as any head of a record company,” adds manager Winston Simone.“They’re at the center of it all,” said Philip Dolin, co-director of the documentary.In fact, Barsalona was the one who established that center. After witnessing the size and passion of the crowd for the Beatles’ first Washington DC concert in 1964, he began to imagine a full network of concert tours by scores of rock bands. “The 40-, 50-date tour cycle didn’t exist back then because people did not realize that there was a market,” said Irv Zuckerman, who became an early rock promoter.While other agents, journalists and music executives in the early to mid-60s viewed rock as a fad on the wane after Elvis entered the army, Barsalona recognized that “this wasn’t the end of something, it was the beginning”, said Dolin.A key connection in realizing his vision came through the woman who became his wife, June Harris. When Barsalona met her, she was working in her native UK as one of the first rock journalists, scoring early interviews with the Beatles and the Stones. “She introduced Frank to all the British invasion acts and their representatives,” said the film’s co-director, Molly Bernstein.Recognizing the depth of their talent, and their exponential popularity in America, Barsalona left his job as a talent agent to set up his own company. Dubbed Premier Talent, it went on to become America’s first national rock concert promotion company. One of Barsalona’s innovations was to build audience loyalty by treating the music as more than just something for “the kids”. To accomplish that, he and his associates blew up the prevailing notion of rock tours, built on the corny old Vaudeville model where bands simply ran through their hits. “The change was to present full concerts where the main headliner played a long show,” said Bernstein.The expansive concerts promoted by Premier encouraged a new level of awe from the audience, anchored on extended musicianship. The change mirrored ones the musicians were already making. As the 60s progressed, artists began recording, and performing, longer songs, driven by greater ambition. Bill Graham found himself at the epicenter of the iteration that was emerging in San Francisco with bands like the Grateful Dead, Jefferson Airplane and Big Brother and the Holding Company with Janis Joplin. He found great success booking them into his hall, the Fillmore. It was Barsalona’s innovation to link promoters like Graham in San Francisco with others eager to carve out similar scenes in their own cities. Together, they created a tight network of hip venues in converted theaters and ballrooms. In a joking way, Barsalona based his system on the mafia, awarding each promoter his own territory to control: Larry Magid had Philly for his Electric Factory, Don Law, owned Boston for the Boston Tea Party, the Belkin brothers staked out Cleveland with the Agora Ballroom and so on. As one promoter told the film-makers: “It was like the mob, but without the violence.”Not that the promoters were above squeezing out competition within their territories. More, not all of the money always went to the deserving parties. One observer in the film reveals how Graham would count the same number of patrons in a packed ballroom on two successive nights when, clearly, the head count in one was far greater than the other. “He was a very tough business man who took advantage of his position,” Bernstein said.While Barsalona’s Premier team ruled the US, promoter Harvey Goldsmith performed a similar function in the UK. In the process, the names of these promoters became nearly as well-known to fans as those of the bands. “I grew up in Cleveland,” Dolin said. “And every show was ‘Belkins Presents’. You heard their name every weekend on FM radio.”The promoters earned that fame by bringing the fans shows with improved sound, exciting lights and informed billing. Graham used his concerts to educate young rocker fans about the music’s roots by putting older artists like Chuck Berry, BB King or Miles Davis on with hotter stars just breaking, such as Neil Young or Ten Years After. He, and other promoters, then advised the bands on how to put on a show. In the documentary, Carlos Santana explains how Graham would give bands a little report card at the end of a performance, telling them what worked or what didn’t. “He would help a band develop stage craft, making suggestions like, ‘Don’t talk when you come onstage, play a great number first,’” Bernstein said.The promoters also took pains to seed a developing band’s fanbase by putting them on bills with headliners whose fans would probably embrace them. While Premier may have been a national brand, the local roots of the regional promoters became a key way to break bands during the classic rock era. They would help an artist establish a power base at their venues in Philly or Cleveland and, from there, a band could fan out to eventually conquer the nation. Even those who never became national names could create a rabid fanbase in a given region, due to the connections and branding of the local promoters. Southside Johnny in New Jersey, the Michael Stanley Band in the midwest, and the Iron City House Rockers in Pittsburgh, all used this strategy to create strong careers in their day.Beyond the music, the shows gave the fans a new sense of community. “You go to these places and hear the music and smoke pot and you had a family,” Bernstein said. “You’d think, ‘This is what I want the world to be.’”The concerts also provided one of the only ways a fan could see a band at the time. Back then, rock acts hardly ever got on TV and, in some cases, they didn’t even offer photos of themselves on their album covers. The result seeded a gripping sense of mystery. King Crimson didn’t feature a single shot of its members on its first three album covers, meaning you had to buy a ticket and see them in concert to determine if they were even corporeal beings. “Before they saw them, some people thought the Allman Brothers were African American,” Dolin said. “Can you imagine going to a show thinking you’re going to be seeing an African American band and then finding out the guys are blond?”As a result, every fan who came to a show felt as if they were discovering a secret. That feeling was enhanced by the relatively small size of the theaters. “If you see a band live from 10ft away you become attached to them for life,” said Dolin.That sense of intimacy and rarity started to evaporate after Woodstock. The massive scale of that event signaled to the business just how big rock’n’roll had become, ending its innocence. Starting in the early 70s, the bigger bands moved beyond the theater circuit controlled by Premier, and advanced to arenas, and, eventually, to stadiums, most of which featured hellishly bad sound at the time. As a result, Graham shuttered his Fillmores East and West and signed on to book far larger tours. The others followed suit. Barsalona sold Premier to the William Morris Agency in 2005 (he died in 2012). When an organization such as Concerts West came in, creating a uniform national touring system, it destroyed the regionalism, and personal touch, of the early promoters. It also killed the quirkiness of the shows, as well as the low prices. “It was the end of seeing the Who in a small venue for three dollars,” said Dolin.Consolidation of the industry continued to balloon until, eventually, it metastasized into one monster company, Live Nation, which now has a stranglehold on the bulk of the business. For fans, that has meant greater distance from the stars, as well as ticket prices that, Dolin said, “are as expensive as flying to Europe”.At the same time, more people are attending, and presumably enjoying, live music than ever. And the sound and production in the vast arenas and stadiums has vastly improved in the last decade. To the film-makers, the endurance, and escalation, of the industry only underscores the essential potency of the concert experience. “People still love live performances,” Dolin said. “They’re simply irreplaceable.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e984f1fb5f6615b72a18a961da2979b848a53b19/500_1602_6006_3604/master/6006.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=92a68034d43ead09a1e8ccd6c07fadb3","title":"perfect muttar pilau rice and peas recipe felicity cloake","story":"Muttar pilau, made with basmati rice and peas, can be enjoyed as a satisfying vegetarian main or as a glorious accompanimentRice and peas with real peas, or muttar pilau, is a satisfying vegetarian dish popular in Pakistan and northern India, where fresh peas are plentiful, though the frozen sort has made it a year-round favourite everywhere else. Chef Asma Khan remembers her amazement on seeing her first bag of Bird’s Eye peas in Britain, because “in India, peas were only available in winter, and muttar pulao was essentially a winter rice dish”. She describes children being “rounded up to pop the pea pods” before a feast or party.Indeed, Daley adds, though you may find this on restaurant menus as an accompaniment, in the British-Gujarati family into which he married, “it is usually served as the main event” – a satisfying vegetarian main course in its own right, with just a chunky tomato and cucumber salad on the side. Frankly, I’m not sure it even needs that: fluffy rice, aromatic spices and sweet green peas – why bother to gild the lily?Gloriously aromatic, basmati is the top choice here, but long grain will work just fine if you can’t find it just make sure it’s not quick-cook, or you’ll end up with mush. Rinse the grains to get rid of some of the sticky surface starch, then soak it in cold water for as long as possible to soften the grains and minimise the cooking time – the less time the basmati is over heat, the more aromatic the final result. Khan recommends two hours in her new book Asma’s Indian Kitchen, but notes that “even the briefest soaking time makes a difference”.The only recipe not to rinse or soak, from the India and Pakistan volume of Charmaine Solomon’s Complete Asian Cookbook, takes twice as long to cook and, while delicious, the rice gathers in clumps: if you don’t have time to soak at all, then at least rinse (though note you’ll need to increase the cooking time significantly: Solomon recommends using 625ml boiling water, bringing the pan to a simmer, then leaving it covered, over a low heat, for 25 minutes).Patel and Hirani start with a masala paste of green chillies, garlic and ginger, giving their pilaus a more assertively savoury flavour that testers enjoy, “especially if you’re going to eat it on its own”. Khan and Roopa Gulati use onion instead, with the former frying it to crisp golden rings that look rather special scattered on top. It’s another step, but frankly not a difficult one.Patel keeps her spicing similarly savoury with mustard seeds and vivid yellow turmeric, but fragrant spices – such as cinnamon or cassia bark, cardamom and cloves, and, in Gulati and Khan’s case, Indian bay leaves – are more common in the recipes I try. The latter have a much sweeter flavour than the European bay leaf. If you can find them (they’re easily available in specialist grocers and online), they’re a nice addition, but if you can’t, leave them out rather than substituting the kind you might have growing in your garden in the UK.The Hirani family recipe is indeed a feast in its own right, boasting tomatoes, potatoes and boiled eggs on top of the standard rice and peas. All, of course, are welcome, though given the shorter cooking time in the recipe below, if you’d like to bulk it out in this way, I’d recommend cooking them separately and adding them to the pan at the end with the peas.Gulati’s is the only recipe to cook the rice in stock (vegetable, in her case) rather than water, but this shouldn’t be necessary: the masala and spices will provide quite enough flavour on their own.The most popular cooking method for soaked rice is to boil it hard until most of the liquid has evaporated, then cover the pan and let it gently steam in the remaining moisture for another five minutes. It works well, and is far quicker than the alternatives. Leaving the rice to sit, covered, off the heat for a few minutes before serving will give even fluffier results, especially if, like Hirani, you cover the pot with a clean tea towel to help soak up any excess moisture.Serve as a side dish, or on its own with perhaps some boiled eggs or potatoes to bulk it out.250g basmati rice150g frozen peas, rinsed to break up any clumps1-3 green chillies2 garlic cloves, peeled10g fresh root ginger, peeled1 tsp salt3 tbsp ghee (or oil, to make the dish vegan)1 cinnamon stick6 cardamom pods4 cloves1 Indian bay leaf (optional)1 onion, peeled and cut into thin rings1 tsp brown mustard seedsRinse the rice in cold water until it runs clear, then leave to soak in cold water for 30 minutes to eight hours. Take the peas out of the freezer and soak in cold water to defrost.Roughly chop the chillies (remove the seeds if you’d prefer a very mild dish), garlic and ginger, then mash to a paste with a pinch of salt.Heat the ghee (or oil) in a wide, lidded pan over a medium-high heat and add the cinnamon, cardamom, bay leaf (if using) and cloves. Fry until aromatic, then scoop out with a slotted spoon and transfer to a plate.Add the onion to the pan and turn down the heat. Fry, stirring regularly, until golden brown, then scoop out on to the same plate, spreading it out to help the onion crisp up.Drain the rice and boil a kettle of water. Turn the heat back up, add the mustard seeds to the pan and cook until they start to pop. Add the chilli-garlic paste and stir for a minute or so, then add the rice and salt, and stir to coat all the grains with oil.Pour in 500ml boiling water, top with the reserved whole spices and onions, then bring to a simmer and cook uncovered for about five minutes, until almost all of the water has been absorbed. Meanwhile, thoroughly drain the peas.Cover the pan with a tight-fitting lid (put a tea towel or square of foil between the lid and the pan if yours is loose) and turn the heat right down. Cook for five minutes more, then take off the heat, quickly scatter the peas on top, then cover with a clean tea towel and replace the lid.Fork through to fluff up the grains and serve hot.• Muttarmatarwattana pilaupulao: however you spell it, are you a rice and peas fan?

The Italian, who led Leicester to the Premier League title in 2016 and has also managed Chelsea, takes over with the club bottom of the Premier League.Jokanovic has been dismissed after taking five points from 12 matches this season. The Serb led Fulham to promotion last season.Fulham said Ranieri had signed a “multi-year contract” and their owner, Shahid Khan, said: “Claudio is risk-free and ready-made for the Premier League, and particularly so for what we need at this moment at Fulham.“His recent body of work with Leicester City is literally legendary and then you look at Claudio’s experience with Chelsea and big clubs throughout Europe, and it’s pretty evident we are welcoming an extraordinary football man to Fulham football club.”Ranieri – who signed Jokanovic when he was manager of Chelsea in 2000 – was most recently in charge of Nantes, where he left by mutual consent last May after one season, in which the club finished ninth. He was dismissed by Leicester in February 2017, less than a year after winning the title.“It is an honour to accept Mr Khan’s invitation and opportunity to lead Fulham, a fantastic club with tradition and history,” Ranieri said. “The objective at Fulham should never be to merely survive in the Premier League. We must at all times be a difficult opponent and should expect to succeed.“This Fulham squad has exceptional talent that is contrary to its position in the table. I know this team is very capable of better performances, which we will work on straight away as we prepare for Southampton at the Cottage.”The sacking of Jokanovic comes less than three weeks after Khan strongly backed the manager amid suggestions that the Serb would be sacked after a summer spend of more than £100m.“Don’t believe anything you read,” Khan wrote in Fulham’s programme. “The sensational and fictional headlines related to Slavisa I’m in equal parts amused, astonished and disappointed. Optimism comes naturally knowing we have a head coach who not only understands and appreciates the honour of representing Fulham, but also the past two seasons has found the right formula to hit our stride in time for a strong run in the second half of the campaign.”Jokanovic described himself as a “fantastic coach” before last Saturday’s defeat at Liverpool and said his players needed to work harder.Fulham picked up five points from their opening 12 league fixtures with the defence a major concern. Jokanovic’s side conceded 31 goals in those 12 games and had the worst defensive record in the ision.They are, however, only three points behind Southampton in 17th place. After the game against the Saints on 24 November they face Chelsea away, Leicester City at home and Manchester United away."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2da3e59d3bbefc1327da742654f5a31c4601d626/0_211_3418_2051/master/3418.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ef824118aed9ea2cc8c11b3eeac1c43c","title":"referee suspended rock paper scissors coin toss wsl david mcnamara","story":"Referee David McNamara has been suspended for three weeks after accepting a charge of “not acting in the best interests of the game” before a Women’s Super League match in which he used a game of rock, paper, scissors instead of the traditional coin toss to decide who should kick off.A Football Association spokesperson confirmed that McNamara will return to duty from 17 December.The FA said McNamara did not oversee an official coin toss, which is required under the laws of the game, before Manchester City faced Reading last month in the WSL.It is understood that McNamara, after leaving his coin in the dressing room, had City captain Steph Houghton and Reading skipper Kirsty Pearce play a game of rock, paper, scissors to decide who would kick off and start at which end.“The FA can confirm that referee David McNamara has been suspended for 21 days, starting from Monday 26 November, after accepting a charge of ‘not acting in the best interests of the game’, an FA spokesperson said.“This follows an incident in the WSL match between Manchester City and Reading on Friday 26 October, when he failed to determine which team would kick off the match by the toss of a coin, as required by the laws of the game.“McNamara will return to duty from Monday 17 December.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/267dcbacce5048e1d307c760ed98b4f41a2099e2/0_0_5472_3648/master/5472.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=dc85e0c6eac8884d041527920c5b5f47","title":"parenthood readers chidlren child free maybe baby podcast","story":"To coincide with the Maybe Baby podcast, readers reveal why they chose to be parents – or notEvalina, 37: ‘Being a parent is the most intimately emotional relationship’I always had a strong urge to nurture and wanted kids. I briefly considered not having them in my mid-20s after my older sister had her first child. I have a close relationship with my mum and she says the years when we were young are some of the best of her life. I feel this way too about my children: the relationship, the feelings of love, closeness and trust. Experiencing that has changed me and how I see the world.The mental and physical exhaustion is sometimes too much. I fantasise about holidays and travelling, and regular trips to the theatre and the pub. Realistically, though, I am happier now than before I had kids. If I didn’t have kids at the age I am now I would be a bit desperate to get pregnant.Annie, 37: ‘I feel I needed the human contact, noise and busyness parenthood brings’There was never any doubt that I wanted children. Even to the point that I wanted to have two, maybe three. We had three in the end. I’m glad and feel fulfilled. I feel I needed that human contact and the noise and the feeling of being busy that parenthood brings.The relentlessness is hard. There is no opportunity to pause, take a breath, or reevaluate your priorities. I try to be really conscious of living in the moment. The best thing about being a parent is watching your children grow and change, as well as their inquisitiveness and curiosity. It doesn’t tend to be the big things that make you proud or make your heart ache with love. It can be little things like seeing an interaction with a friend, or the way they open their lunch box. It really is magical.Jack, 33: ‘The idea of being childless was the hardest part of accepting my sexual identity’As a gay man, I grew up assuming I’d never have kids, and only discovered there were options for me as an adult. I always wanted to be a parent and the idea that I’d be childless for life was the hardest part of accepting my sexual identity. I wasn’t prepared for the change having children would have on my other relationships, particularly with my husband’s family.The emotional bond I’ve formed with our kids, and the bond they’ve formed with me, transcends genetics and justified my pre-child assertions that love, not lineage, is the thing that matters most.You lose a lot of personal agency – at least for us, things need to be planned and we can’t just change our schedule at the drop of a hat. For us, cooking a lunch for people is a big deal. If friends show up two hours late, everything gets thrown out of whack, but that’s increasingly seen as socially acceptable, even though to us it’s a massive disincentive to be sociable. I love to socialise but my kids take precedence, so there’s always a trade-off.Ruth, 64: ‘My family had problems and I believed I could give my children unconditional love’I never thought of being child-free, I was always certain that I wanted to have children. My original family had its problems, and I wanted children because I believed I could give them unconditional love and that they would know they were loved no matter what they did. For me, a future without children seemed impossibly bleak. Maybe it’s selfish to have children, given the state of the world, at least people often say so, but I wanted to give a childchildren a good life and produce good people.Without a doubt, the worst thing about being a parent is the worry. My children drive and they go out socially. One lives in London, one in Manchester and one in Sheffield. All cities, all with violent crime. The worry also extends to their lives in general. Broken hearts, alcohol dependency, illness, job loss, a sense of unfulfillment – all these anxieties plague me as a parent.Natalie, 32: ‘When I was a teenager I dreamed of having my first child’I always wanted to have children. When I was a teenager, I dreamed of having my first child and had romanticised the idea of finding the perfect husband, marrying early and then having children. The best thing about being a parent is simply being a parent. I guess I didn’t imagine that it would impact my life so profoundly as it did. In our case, we had just moved to another city when our daughter was born, and we had no family or friends here, which made the social isolation worse.I love both of my daughters more than my own life – the oldest one is three and a half and the younger one was born not long ago. I absolutely love spending time with them, watching them smile and laugh and having a good time. Simply enjoying life through the perspective of a small child is magical. I love watching them grow up and witnessing their ups and downs. They truly are my biggest blessings.Lilith, 25: ‘I didn’t want to face the possibility of another miscarriage’Growing up, I was taught that having kids was a milestone in life, until my girlfriend at the time miscarried. After the grieving, I decided to put some thought into whether I wanted to face the possibility of another miscarriage by choosing to have kids. I didn’t want anyone I was involved with to go through that ever again. I’m a transgender woman and I became sterilised in 2017.I love when people are curious about my decision to be child-free. When that’s the case, we can have a proper conversation about the merits of not having children versus being a parent, because I do think that parents can be happy too. I’m not out to change their mind and I hope they’re not hoping to change mine in kind. But if I show them that my life is pretty normal and fulfilling and not dependent on raising children, and if they see there’s another valid way of living outside of being a parent, then I’m happy.Celine: ‘I’m happy that my decision to be child-free is better for the environment’I decided when I was 16 that I never wanted to have children. There was no part of me that ever wanted a child and I was terrified of getting pregnant and then having to get an abortion. I had tubal ligation surgery at 21. After the operation, I felt enormous relief and I have never regretted my decision. I’m also happy that my decision to be child-free is better for the environment, as I care deeply about the planet.Sometimes I’ll tell people my age and about the surgery and they’re often shocked but also often very supportive, asking me about the process or saying that they should get a vasectomy. This makes me happy to give support to other people who want to be child-free. I also like to show people that a woman can make a decision very early on in her life not to have a child and that this decision is valid and should be respected.Rachel, 31: ‘I come from a great family, I have a fantastic marriage and I love my husband but I don’t want kids’People who choose to be child-free need more visibility because it can feel very isolating in a world where having children is the norm. On a planet with dwindling resources, I think we need to chip away at the idea of parenthood as a life pathway by default. It’s just not true anymore. There was a time when most people who didn’t have children were those who couldn’t have them for biological reasons, which I can imagine in that society must have been really difficult, and I feel for them. It’s not that world anymore – men and women now have real choices about their future and I think we need to start talking and remove the stigma.We live in a very child-centric society and we are constantly being fed a romanticised image of family that just doesn’t exist. We’re taught that we’re incomplete without children and I think that’s hugely emotionally damaging and also bullshit. Having a child won’t fix your self-worth, your marriage or your personal issues. I’m not a wretched husk of a woman, I have no emotional damage. I come from a great family, I have a fantastic marriage and I love my husband but I don’t want kids. I love my life and I’m thankful for the choices I’ve made. I am happy.Anne, 27: ‘I want to be a mother to my dreams’Travelling makes me feel alive in a way that nothing else does. Having the freedom and money to travel was one of the biggest factors in my choice to remain child-free. When I think about having children, I feel trapped. I feel like my time, money, emotional energy and creativity would just be sucked away from me. Nothing about motherhood even remotely appeals to me and I’m sick of women having to act as if it’s the be all and end all. It’s not for everyone and I know it’s not for me. I want to be a mother to my dreams, not a child.The internet is a gift for the minority of any kind. A singular word for the reception I received was ‘cruel’. As I got older, I met some wiser people, grew a backbone, and found that when you learn how to defend yourself with reason, you find some pretty good answers and some pretty good people. I’ve known I didn’t want children since I was eight years old. I had been working to get sterilised ever since and finally found relief at the age of 20."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d43eca1a6b41487a2dc036cf37a413ec49ad46ac/0_227_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e2e3b9417f91bf80a09e554878c26884","title":"time management productivity julie morgenstern","story":"Productivity expert Julie Morgenstern was a ‘conquistador of chaos’ until parenthood forced her to get organised. What could she teach our time-challenged writer?You can’t take advice from someone too different from you. You would feel like a dog learning how to be a cat. I might have engaged politely with Julie Morgenstern’s time-management advice – spelled out in various books over the years, including this year’s parenting opus, Time to Parent – but I wouldn’t really have been listening with my whole spirit if the life she described, before her conversion to efficiency, had not been so recognisable. It was like looking in a bloody mirror.“For the first quarter-century of life, I lived in chaos,” she says. “I lived out of piles. I was always late for everything, a real time optimist. Not even time-conscious. People used to lose things in my house – they’d take off their shoes and not be able to find them when they left.”This hit a nerve. I just dropped 200 quid on a new thermostat who loses their thermostat?Such a life, she says, is never entirely unchosen: when you are always 17 minutes late for everything, constantly procrastinating because you don’t even want to start looking for a vital scrap of paper in case you can’t find it, it feels like a triumph every time you are punctual. “I felt like a conquistador of chaos,” Morgenstern says. “As much as I craved order, I was also really afraid of it. I thought it was going to squelch my creativity, make me into this restricted person.”Her road-to-Damascus moment came when she had her daughter and spent three hours trying to get out of the house because there were 18 things to remember and they were all in different places. “I said: ‘I have to get organised. I can be the hero of my own story, but I can’t do this to another human being.”Morgenstern took it very slowly: she spent six months just organising her nappy bag, before she moved on to her kitchen, her house and, ultimately, the fabric of time itself. I, conversely, want to do it all in a week, instituting one of her principles a day and becoming a functioning human who is not imposing her chaos on others by next Thursday.“The biggest obstacle we have to organising time is our perception of it,” Morgenstern says. “We think of it as intangible, relative, qualitative. But it’s impossible to manage if you think of it like that.” Instead, think of your day like an overstuffed closet. First, you need to tidy it: group like with like get rid of stuff that is broken put everything in consistent places excise things that you don’t have room for. This is quite abstract, so it is best to start with space, somewhere you use a lot. Don’t just organise a room you never go in.It felt hubristic to start with a room when the management overlord had started with a nappy bag, but I couldn’t start with a bag because I never use the same one twice. Perhaps this is part of the problem – that the house is rammed with interim hessian bags, each with one thing at the bottom (a hairbrush, a portable charger, a passport) that I never need enough to decant and consequently will never find again.I decided to start with my coat it would become ground zero of my new life. On Friday, I made an inventory for it: keys, wallet and phone in the left pocket vape, vape juice and school-authorised blue pen in the right multi-socket charging cable on the inside, with a lipstick with a tiny mirror. Never anything else, never anything missing.Reader, this changed my life. The final 25 minutes of any house-leaving event, it turned out, were usually spent with me looking for a vital missing item. Out of nowhere, I had nearly half an hour free every morning. I started saying yes to impromptu morning requests – arguing with Nick Ferrari on LBC, making pancakes – that I previously would have laughed out of town. “Research says that the average person loses an hour a day looking for misplaced items,” Morgenstern says. “I’ve been in this business 30 years and, for a disorganised person, it’s easily three hours.” She has given me the gift of three hours, one-sixth of which I have already noticed.On Saturday, I hit the Gordian knot: I couldn’t organise anything bigger than my coat because I didn’t have time and I couldn’t organise my time until I had done my space. But I had a lurking resistance deeper than time, which was the fear that this would end with me having to throw a load of stuff away. It is like calling 111 and knowing they will tell you to go to A\u0026ampE: someone will always want you to get shot of your third beige T-shirt or your second colander.Except this is not what Morgenstern wants. “It’s impossible to declutter if you’re not organised: you don’t know if you have 17 versions of that thing, you don’t know that’s the best of them. And you declutter by category, whereas you organise room by room.”With that reassurance, I had another stab at organising. Naturally, decluttering is really easy when nobody is making you do it. By the end of the day, I had got rid of an electric piano, some prunes in armagnac and loads of books that weren’t mine.“A day is a limited amount of time. We have 24 hours. You’re sleeping eight hours. Let’s say you’re spending 10 hours at work you have six hours of personal time. If you plan more than will fit, you’re just shoving things in. That haphazard arrangement, like a closet, becomes chaotic and intimidating. You don’t even look at your to-do list, you’re just freestyling, because you already know your day is impossible.”On Sunday, I started to cluster similar things. “Work” doesn’t count as a bucket because some of it you will want to do, some you will have to do, some you will dread, some will seem distant because nobody is hassling you for it, and some is very boring. Don’t ide by urgency. Figure out when in the day you feel most creative, when you feel most physically energetic, when you feel most plodding but effective. I ordered tasks by the mood they required. In the space of a single day, I had noticed the difference: a load of expense claims done, for train fares the administrators of niche organisations must have thought I had forgotten two scenes completed of a screenplay about a world where a feminist supervillain has eradicated men, due in September. I even did some ironing! I had forgotten what ironing smelled like.“Here is a revolutionary insight,” Morgenstern says. “It’s very important it comes out of eight years of research. How much time and attention do kids need to feel loved and secure? The answer is this: short bursts of five to 15 minutes of truly unided attention delivered consistently – not big blocks of time delivered erratically.”When they wake up, when they come home from school, when they are going to bed, when they get back from work (turns out this is true of adults as well as children): stop what you are doing and concentrate on them, then leave them alone to do what they want. Constantly hovering over your children, while simultaneously trying to have a fight on Twitter and find a food recycling bag, frazzles everyone.Ah, what a revolution. Finally, I could unleash my ceaseless questions – “How was your day?” “Who was annoying?” “Did anything happen that would amuse me?” “What did you have for lunch?” – and nobody minded because they knew it was time-limited and, at some point, there would be no followup.At bedtime, I managed to start reading my favourite book to my son, after months of meaning to but getting derailed by homework and looking for things. It is The Chrysalids by John Wyndham, about people who become telepathic following a nuclear apocalypse and are persecuted for it. My son said: “This just sounds like a hard-left WhatsApp back channel.” I may have missed his wonder years. If you don’t know what you are supposed to be doing, it is hard to refuse things. And – this is a bolt-on observation from me, the non-time-expert – if you have never known what you are supposed to be doing, you won’t even have the vocabulary. So, sod it, borrow Morgernstern’s: “I’d love to do it, but my time is accounted for right now.” If it makes you sound like a robot with an American motherboard, the upside is that at least you reply to people fast, rather than leaving them hanging for six weeks, agreeing, then pulling out at the last minute, which is my current MO.By Tuesday, I knew not only what that day held, but more or less the entire week: I knew that I was free to go on a school trip with my daughter. Once I was in the National Gallery, I carved out five minutes of parental eye contact to fire at her, which I used to show her the skull at the bottom of the Holbein painting The Ambassadors, explaining how you could see its nose cavity from one angle and its evil from the other.She said: “That’s not a skull, that’s a towel.”“They’re ambassadors. They would have very clean, fancy towels. Also, who takes a towel to a meeting?”“It’s in that one’s bedroom and he’s just had a shower.”I am deviating here from the time-management point, but if you think of Holbein’s core message as being that all things will crumble to dust and that the only everlasting truth is death, it brings us back neatly to Morgenstern: “How we spend our time is how we spend our life. This couldn’t be more important.”The phrase is hateful, conjuring up a self-indulgent fragility, along with hippy smells and meditative loafing. But if you banish all that from your mind and find 20 minutes, twice a day, for something that you want to do – stare out of a window, do a quiz on how well you remember the 90s, file your mini-marshmallows by sell-by date – you experience a heady sensation: “I’m doing this because I want to and I’m in charge,” rather than: “I’m arsing about because everything has got on top of me.”It is the hardest instruction, though: when you still haven’t organised your living space, when you are still routinely setting off for things 10 minutes after they started, when all your adjustments have yet to dent the impression that every day is a race against its end, it is just not that easy to e in luxurious surrender into a novel about an ice-carver who runs a kebab shop and accidentally cuts off his finger.You could spend two years creating the perfect system, but it will never last because everyone in it will change, your work will change, your priorities will change, your children will become larger, your pets will die and you will get new ones that are worse. “It’s not like you’re ever perfect: you’ll be honing and refining this for the rest of your life,” Morgenstern says. So, even a week in, I forgave myself for asking: what is the point of a quest that never ends?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/uploads/2018/10/01/HEADER_V2.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b0e3bd63d2e72ba9feb2b727b1d428c0","title":"the auto innovations driving one of todays most technologically advanced cars","story":"Volkswagen’s new Touareg is packed with futuristic driving aids, including everything from night vision to an infotainment system controlled by gestures – and some models can even give you a massageGreat road trips are all about the drive – but the music you listen to is almost as important. And we all know that there’s nothing worse than a song you just can’t stand blasting through the speakers at the wrong moment, sticking with you for the rest of the day.Forget reaching for the car stereo control, fiddly buttons and complex menus though the new Volkswagen Touareg has a simpler solution to changing track – just wave your hand.The third-generation Touareg’s Gesture Control, which allows you to change audio tracks while using Spotify or to change preset radio stations, is just one of Volkswagen’s technological innovations that is making road trips – long or short – safer and more enjoyable.It’s this ethos to use technology that has driven the design of the Touareg to a “new time and dimension” of automotive advancement, according to Klaus Bischoff, Volkswagen’s Head of Design and the man responsible for putting Volkswagen’s latest technological innovations on the road.The new Touareg, he says, offers an alternative to the establishment with its pioneering and innovative technologies, versatility, and its excellent comfort and dynamic properties.He adds: “The design of the new Touareg makes it unmistakably clear that it is the dominant flagship of the brand. The power of this Volkswagen resides in its amiability and elegance – this car does not need to force anything.”Safety is key to that dominance, says Volkswagen. So the new Touareg boasts a string of class-leading developments that bring the future to the road today. These include a Night Vision system and IQ Light LED Matrix headlights that, when linked to the infrared system, illuminate, by a brief flash, any pedestrians in possible danger zones to make them even more visible to the driver. Perfect for when road trips go into the night.In fact, the new Touareg is “flying the flag” for all the latest technology flowing from Volkswagen’s labs and design studios in Wolfsburg, Germany, according to Brian Luckie, Product Manager for the car in the UK. “From its vast panoramic sunroof to its LED Matrix headlights with 128 LEDs per headlight, the new Touareg is one of the most technologically advanced Volkswagen vehicles to date,” he says.Inside, with its thoroughly modern Innovision Cockpit – which combines a 12-inch digital instrument cluster with a 15-inch touchscreen display on the dashboard – Volkswagen has completely redesigned the new Touareg cabin and infotainment offering. The two screens form a uniform digital landscape in “one-screen design” along a “single visual and operating axis”, while it also includes controls for the car’s four-zone air conditioning system and the operation of seat heating, ventilation and massage – available as optional extras – for comfort.All of this technology comes with a challenge, though. The rise of new technologies and autonomous cars, plus the heralded arrival of the mass-market electric car, is seeing the automotive industry undergo a period of profound change. Vehicles are becoming sensor-rich consumer devices, bristling with “intelligence” and connected to the world around then.But, as they become smart and more sophisticated, what does this mean for their drivers? And how will we safely make use of these technologies, rather than be plunged into a thick data-fog of distractions?Part of Volkswagen’s response is the Innovision Cockpit, which radically reduces the button count on the dashboard. It is also compatible with Android Auto, Apple CarPlay and MirrorLink as standard, making using your favourite apps easier and safer on the go. A driver’s head-up display can also be added as an option to project safety-critical information on the windscreen.Volkswagen has loaded the new-generation Touareg with one of the most advanced safety systems on the road today, trailblazing a future of safer motoring. For example, its optional Night Vision system detects humans and animals in the darkness, using a thermal imaging camera to see beyond the reach of the naked eye. And as with the mapping system, the result can be displayed in the instrument cluster. There’s also Roadwork Lane Assist, to help steer, brake and accelerate. This takes the new Touareg to a new level of automated safety and convenience, making it one of the world’s safest and most convenient cars.It is added to by the new optional extra of Front Cross Traffic Assist, which warns of vehicles approaching at a 90-degree angle – incredibly useful when pulling out at a tight junction or in a supermarket car park. The system will even intervene by engaging emergency braking if you don’t respond to an audible and visual warning on the Touareg’s dashboard.The combination of this futuristic technology, says Bischoff, means the new Touareg is “one of the most concise SUVs on the global market. Tailormade for freedom. That was our objective – no more and no less.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4a295125e6f1afe6e4e547fbe5d945a68d56f6ca/0_0_2400_1440/master/2400.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4cd2d8d98bfad386143e6392637729e5","title":"from the human eye to hubble a brief history of our quest for better vision","story":"Technology today enables us to ‘look’ millions of light years across the universe, but up until 400 years ago we didn’t even have telescopes. The scientific search for ways to improve our sense of sight is truly inspiringPretty much as soon as humans stopped battling to stay alive 24 hours a day, the first thing they did was look up into the sky and wonder about the sun. The earliest religions made the sun into a god. In August, Nasa launched its Parker Solar Probe to take a closer look. And if you want to define what it is to be human – and to explain how we got from baffled apes to space explorers – it’s pretty much all in there. We want to take a look.In psychology, this is called the drive theory of curiosity. It defines curiosity as an internal drive that’s as important to us as hunger or thirst. It’s a naturally occurring urge that has to be satisfied. So, when we’d done inventing fire and shelter and took a look at our five senses, it’s only natural that we’d work on technology to improve sight above all the others. We’re always trying to find new ways of taking a better look.One of the first recorded mentions of improved eyesight was around 400BC – a tossed aside joke in a play called The Clouds by Aristophanes. It’s a comedy, and jokes only work if the audience shares the reference, so using a glass globe filled with water to magnify letters was commonplace enough to get a laugh in ancient Greece.It was almost 1,500 years before the Arab mathematician and astronomer Abu Ali al-Hassan Ibn al-Haitham published the first book on geometrical optics – showing how oval glass could magnify objects. The Venetians used his theories to make “reading stones” and the first European eyeglasses essentially bolted two reading stones together with a hinge around 1300AD. At which point we could finally – in theory – help everyone to see.But we’re human. Once we can see something, we want to see more. It took another few hundred years and some squabbling Dutchmen in the town of Middleburg to exploit nature’s laws and allow us to see things we were never designed to see. These days, Middelburg is a small, quiet town of some 50,000 inhabitants. At the turn of the 16th century, it was the Silicon Valley of improved vision – Hans Lippershey filed the first ever patent for a telescope there in 1608, while his next-door neighbour Zacharias Janssen claimed the first microscope around the same time. Lippershey then claimed the microscope himself proving we’ve never been able to keep our eyes on our own work.Since then sight tech has fell into two camps – improving our vision and augmenting our vision. From the 1800s people had been working on contact lenses with limited success. It wasn’t until 1936 that Brooklyn born optometrist William Feinbloom worked out that plastic, not glass, was the key to contacts.It was a shower of broken glass in a myopic boy’s eye – who found his sight improved after the wounds healed – that helped the Soviet scientist Svyatoslov Fyodorov develop radial keratotomy – eye surgery – to tweak the shape of the cornea and cure the short sighted, eventually developing laser eye surgery.Today there’s retinal implants – attached to the retina that trigger the optic nerve corneal inlays – small, ring-like devices implanted under the eye’s outer surface to correct both near and far-sightedness and augmented reality glasses such as those developed by Stephen Hicks, research fellow in neuroscience at the University of Oxford and founder of start-up OxSight.The company’s lenses overcome tunnel vision and glaucoma, using image-interpretation algorithms and cameras to increase image contrast, highlight specific visual features or create representations of reality on the lenses, according to Hicks – who raised £2m from angel investor Jiangong Zhang in 2016 and plans a launch later this year. The EU’s Retina project, meanwhile, aims to combine synthetic vision with images beamed directly on to the retina to help air traffic controllers see air traffic far beyond normal human perception, even in low-visibility conditions.And here’s where augmentation really kicks in. From the moment we could see the small stuff and the far away stuff we’ve wanted to see smaller and farther. As time progressed, the telescope was improved, notably by Sir Isaac Newton and Léon Foucault, but it wasn’t until the 1930s that we realised we could “see” without using our eyes – or even light. First up, the infrared – or thermographic – camera, developed in the UK by Hungarian physicist Kálmán Tihanyi to spot night-time air raids. It’s the same technology – albeit spruced up a little – that’s deployed as Night Vision in the new Volkswagen Touareg. This infrared camera spots pedestrians, cyclists and larger wild animals at a range of 10 to 130 metres and alerts the driver.The 1930s also saw Robert Watson-Watt deploy the first radiolocation technology – later known as radar – to help the UK’s Met Office track thunderstorms. Also at that time, Bell Labs engineer Karl Jansky discovered that astronomical objects gave off radio emissions, inspiring the radio telescope that could observe everything from gamma-ray to infrared radiation. German physicist Hans Busch pioneered the study of electron opticsthroughout the decade, which led to Ernst Ruska inventing the electron microscope.With this tech, we no longer had to be in eye contact with our visual aids now, we even bury microscopes underground – like the particle accelerators at Cern that hurl particles into each other and analyse the results of the collisions to understand the fundamental building blocks of matter. Or we throw observing tech into space – such as the Hubble Space Telescope and Fermi’s Gamma-ray Burst Monitor. In April, Nasa launched the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite – or the Tess probe – to look for planets outside our solar system, using lenses and cameras that might blow Lippershey’s mind, but which he’d completely understand.And if we didn’t have to be there, couldn’t something else do the actual looking for us? In the 1960s, computer scientists took inspiration from the Perceptron machine developed by psychologist Frank Rosenblatt to pioneer artificial neural networks and work started on designing robots that could see. Indeed, one major goal of artificial intelligence at the time was to recreate the human visual system.This was, at best, a partial success – it gave us 3D modelling and digital-image processing, but it wasn’t until the 1990s that computers could handle the vast data sets involved in understanding and modelling real-time images. It’s worth pausing to realise how amazing your eye is – when a Google AI learned to identify cat faces in YouTube videos they needed 16,000 computers working together. You picked that up before you could talk.Things have improved for our mechanical friends – in 2016, UK based AI pioneers DeepMind began data-crunching retinal scans at Moorfields eye hospital in London after Pearse Keane, a consultant ophthalmologist, asked if it could help with a knotty NHS problem.There are currently more than 600,000 people with age-related macular degeneration – it creates shadowy areas in the central part of vision – in the UK and 200 people are diagnosed with the condition every day. Over the past 10 years, optical coherence tomography (OCT) has revolutionised diagnosis. This uses light waves to take cross-section pictures of the retina. A number of UK opticians already offer OCT scans on the high street but, according to Keane, “they don’t always have the necessary training to read the scans. The NHS is currently getting false positives from high street OCT scans asking us to see the patient urgently. Imagine every GP having an MRI but not being trained to use it.” DeepMind’s AI algorithm helps by checking scans for a telltale sign of the condition, sending an alert to a doctor if it finds one.Autonomous vehicle machine vision uses a similar technique – known as Histogram of Oriented Gradients, which ides images up into tiny pixels and essentially spots the difference in light intensity on different pixels. It’s not quite the system deployed by Knight Industries Two Thousand car Kitt in the 1982 TV series Knight Rider – although David Hasselhoff’s ride did sport collision-avoidance technology that inspired many of today’s vehicle collision safety features.Kitt had one feature we’ve never managed to reproduce in the real world – enough personality to understand the Hoff’s emotional needs. It urged him to trust his instincts or played wingman as he chatted up the ladies. In other words, it could look into his heart and his soul. Perhaps that’s somewhere we’d prefer to look into all by ourselves. There are some adventures where we don’t need better technology – we just need to be more human."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/29154973f074960f0af69cc6dd7f29cd56de0967/0_50_2016_1210/master/2016.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=09e9e989b476cafc49db8d6d0e45625a","title":"guardian passes 1m mark in reader donations katharine viner","story":"Business model showing way for journalism to ‘regain its relevance’, says editor-in-chiefMore than a million people worldwide have contributed to the  in the last three years, with 500,000 paying to support the publication on an ongoing basis, according to  News and Media’s editor-in-chief, Katharine Viner.She said the business model was showing a new way for journalism to “regain its relevance, meaning and trusted place in society”.Viner told the Society of Editors’ annual conference in Salford that many contributors donated specifically because they wanted the  to stay free and outside a paywall, so “progressive journalism can have the widest possible impact”.“Many readers didn’t understand the challenging commercial reality facing all news organisations, but once we told them more, they expressed real interest in wanting to support the ,” she said. “This was helped by the fact that any money made by the  has to be spent on journalism, because of our ownership structure with no shareholders or owner.“This entirely new revenue stream of monthly and one-off contributions is now a crucial part of our plan to get the  to break even by next April.

The former Daily Mail editor Paul Dacre criticised Rusbridger in his lecture on Sunday night.“His record on investigations in the public interest was exceptional, a model for how to hold the powerful to account,” Viner said."},{"url":null,"title":"support the guardian how to make the most","story":"Over one million of our readers have supported us financially, and there are a number of advantages to doing so – including getting closer to our journalists and reducing the number of requests you see on our articles supporters help us keep our journalism open for everyone through regular financial contributions, or single payments.

Npower was supplying the property previously. We requested to switch to British Gas and were told there was a problem. Both npower and British Gas claim they supply us and over the past year both have sent demands for payment and debt collectors’ letters. There appears to be a phantom meter and no one can agree which one is ours. During a telephone conference call last year both argued with each other over whose customer we are. Ten months ago, npower eventually admitted it was not our supplier, refunded our payments and closed the account. We thought that was the end of it and set up a direct debit with British Gas. Then npower once again began sending demands and a debt collection threat. It now claims it is our supplier – as does British Gas to whom we pay by direct debit each month. We have lived for more than a year under threat of bailiffs entering our property and are at our wits’ end. The most depressing aspect of your ordeal is that, in the glare of the media spotlight, it took the companies mere hours to clear up the confusion. British Gas acknowledged that, although it has been pocketing your money for the past 10 months, it is not your supplier. And npower discovered that it made a mistake when it asserted that you were not its customer and closed your account.The fact that both billed you using variations of your address, none of which officially exist, is a clue to the fiasco.British Gas tells me two meters were registered to the property on the national database, one supplied by npower and the other by itself. It acknowledged this should have been established far sooner and, to show its remorse, is crediting you with a somewhat miserly £60 compensation for the stress and the threats, as well as a refund of all the bills you’ve paid them.

Which bits are controversial? And will it get through cabinet and parliament?Theresa May’s cabinet meets later on Wednesday to approve or reject the text of a draft withdrawal agreement drawn up this week in Brussels by EU and UK negotiators two-and-a-half years after Britain voted to leave the bloc.Here is a brief guide to what – as far as we know – the agreement says, which parts of it may prove controversial (and why), how likely the prime minister is to get the deal through her cabinet and then parliament, and what could happen next.Think of it as the separation agreement between the UK and the EU. Running to a rumoured 400 to 600 pages, it covers three main areas:The agreement also includes a much shorter (and non-binding) political declaration, probably of about 15 pages, outlining what the two sides see as their desired future trading relationship – which remains to be negotiated.While some of the detail took longer, the UK and EU agreed reasonably quickly on the so-called orce bill and citizens’ rights (although not to the satisfaction of many of the citizens concerned).The sticking point has been the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic, which after Brexit will also become the border between the UK and the EU. Because of the island’s troubled history, both sides want to avoid a hard border with customs checks that could become a source of friction.The problem has been that since the prime minister promised in her Lancaster House speech to take Britain out of both the EU’s single market (to cease being an EU “rule-taker”) and the customs union (to allow it to strike its own trade deals around the world), customs and regulatory checks at the border are difficult to dodge.Ultimately, the border is supposed to become a non-issue under the terms of the comprehensive free trade agreement the two sides are expected to sign at some stage after Britain’s departure on 29 March next year.But because this agreement may well not be negotiated by the end of the transition period in December 2020, the EU insisted on a “backstop” arrangement to avoid a hard border until a free trade agreement came into effect. The row over the form this backstop should take is what has prevented the withdrawal agreement being signed until now.For months, Britain rejected the EU’s proposed backstop – in effect, keeping Northern Ireland in the customs union and single market – because it would require customs checks in the Irish Sea and other arrangements meaning Northern Ireland was treated differently to the rest of the UK.But the EU also rejected Britain’s suggestion that the whole of the UK should stay in a de facto customs union with the EU, mainly because the government wanted to be able to withdraw from such an arrangement unilaterally and when it chose (which, for the EU, meant it could not be considered a proper backstop).The solution appears to involve concessions on both sides. On the EU side, the chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, has accepted the idea of a whole-UK customs union with the EU, satisfying the UK’s demands that its territorial integrity must be preserved.But in return, Britain must agree that it will not be allowed to exit the backstop unless and until the EU agrees there is no prospect of a return to a hard border. In addition, it will have to accept special “deeper” customs arrangements for Northern Ireland, and the EU’s so-called “level playing-field” conditions for the whole of the UK.These address member states’ concerns that de facto customs union membership without the obligations of the single market could give the UK an unfair advantage, so will require Britain to observe EU rules on, for example, state aid, competition, the environment, tax and labour market rules.Hardly. Conservative Brexiters are aghast at the prospect of Britain potentially being “trapped” forever in a customs union with the EU – so prevented from striking independent trade deals – and appalled at having to continue to accept EU regulations to boot (hence Boris Johnson’s dismissal of the deal as “vassal state stuff”).The Northern Ireland unionists of the DUP – on whose votes in Westminster the government relies for its majority – also fear those “deeper” customs arrangements and additional checks on livestock and food crossing the Irish Sea breach the party’s red lines on identical treatment for Northern Ireland.Labour has said the agreement looks unlikely to support jobs and the economy or guarantee standards and protections, and if that’s the case it will vote against it. Tory remainers – heartened by Jo Johnson’s resignation last week – may also be encouraged to rebel.First, the prime minister must get the withdrawal agreement through cabinet, whose leave-supporting members need to decide whether to put their money where their mouths are. If she succeeds, an emergency EU summit could then be held, most likely on 25 November, to seal the deal.Then it has to be got through parliament earlier rather than later in December. Many observers believe it could fall at this hurdle, resulting either in a challenge to May’s leadership, a general election, or even a second referendum (with staying in the EU still theoretically an option, although that would mean extending article 50).But even if she and her agreement survive, the government will still have to decide before June 2020 whether it wants to extend the transition period, fall into the Northern Ireland backstop arrangement or enter a permanent customs union – and after that, seal a future trade deal on which the two sides remain far apart.Britain’s Brexit battle is a long way – a very long way – from over."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2007/09/28/peter_walker_140x140.jpg?width=140\u0026amp;height=140\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fc860339b06d2ffc500c0473ce6427d4\" alt=\"Peter Walker","title":"brexit deal theresa may conservatives meet decide cabinet politics live","story":"Cabinet will meet at 2pm to discuss draft deal agreed by UK and EU negotiatorsThe Daily ’s chief political correspondent Christopher Hope has tweeted that he’s heard two cabinet ministers will resign today.The pair: international development secretary Penny Mordaunt, and Secretary of State for Work and Pensions Esther McVey.This is putting the pound under a little pressure. Sterling has dipped back to $1.295 against the US dollar, having risen to $1.30 this morning.It seems that Downing Street is aware that the opinions being heard so far about Theresa May’s Brexit plans are currently mainly coming from the two opposite sides of the debate – the ERG and remainers.Hence, I’m told, an order went out earlier today from the Conservative whips for moderate Tory MPs to start tweeting their supportive views. But as one centrist Tory said: “It’s not easy to opine on a deal when you haven’t even seen anything yet.”The MP’s view on initial reports of May’s plan is that it seems not entirely ideal, but is “better than all the other options”.Jeremy Corbyn’s spokesman has made clear Labour’s first priority, if the government’s Brexit deal fails to pass the Commons will be to press for its own, alternative plan.Speaking to journalists after prime minister’s questions, he said if MPs reject the prime minister’s deal, in a vote expected to take place early next month, “our priority is for a different, alternative Labour plan for Brexit, which puts jobs and living standards first”.Corbyn irked many Labour members last week by saying, “we can’t stop Brexit”.Pressed repeatedly on the question, his spokesman laid out Labour’s carefully-constructed position, as agreed in the party’s conference in September. He said:We are committed to respect the result of the referendum - and that’s why we’re putting the case for a different, alternative plan for Brexit.And we’ve then set out a series of steps, which are well down the track, in which all options remain on the table.Obviously, from a technical point of view, Brexit can be stopped, that’s clearly the case. But Jeremy said, “we” can’t stop Brexit. That’s not either our policy, nor our priority, nor do we have the mechanism to do it.He added that if May loses the meaningful vote, Labour would effectively consider it to be a vote of no confidence in the government (which it wouldn’t be formally, under the fixed term parliament act). He said:Clearly, if the government is defeated on this absolutely central part of its program, then it would have shown it was unable to govern, and unable to deliver the most essential priorities for the country.Either these cabinet ministers are excellent poker players, or they really weren’t looking forward to discussing the prime minister’s Brexit deal.At least Andrea Leadsom managed a smile for the cameras:And here’s Attorney General Geoffrey Cox, whose advice could be crucial today:Leo Varadkar, the Irish prime minister, has strongly implied that the backstop for the Irish border does not involve the expiry date or unilateral exit options Brexiters demanded. After being briefed overnight on the detail of the withdrawal agreement, Varadkar suggested in the Irish parliament that Theresa May did not get the concessions she wanted. The backstop “can’t have an expiry date and it can’t be possible for anyone side to withdraw from it unilaterally,” he said in leaders questions in the Dail.Speaking after a two-hour briefing last night on the contents of the withdrawal agreement from Brussels, Varadkar also confirmed that an emergency EU summit has been pencilled in for 25 November if Theresa May’s Brexit deal emerges unscathed from a crunch cabinet meeting today.Varadkar intends to brief the Northern Ireland non-unionist parties, the SDLP and the Alliance, on the withdrawal agreement. In the Dail he also reached out to unionists, saying they would be protected by the deal.I know for the unionist community in Northern Ireland this is quite a difficult time. Many of them may be feeling vulnerable, many of them might be feeling isolated and many of them may be quite worried about what may be agreed in the coming days.EU ambassadors are arriving at a meeting in Brussels for a briefing on the Brexit deal. As the BBC’s Adam Fleming reports, it may go on for a while.This is from Sky’s Kate McCann.The BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg has been watching ministers arriving at No 10 for the 2pm cabinet meeting.In Germany, there was a cautious welcome for last night’s Brexit breakthrough, though most politicians left it up to Brussels to comment. Speaking to the German broadcaster ARD, Manfred Weber, the head of the European People’s party (EPP) in the European parliament and a member of the Christian Social Union (CSU) said:The white smoke is rising. We have positive signals that, after months and weeks of torturous debate, it will now come to an agreement. We Europeans have put a lot of suggestions on the table about what a potential solution would look like. And now we’re really, so to speak, at completion.Concretely that means we will get a transition phase to avoid damage, above all for the economy but also for affected citizens, for instance Germans in Great Britain. And we want to clarify in the long term that there will be no border in Northern Ireland. It was successful. The Northern Irish border will not be set up as a hard border and to that extent we have achieved some of the goals that we have as Europeans.Asked whether he thought the current agreement will be enough for the EU, Weber said:We will look at the text, just the same as our colleagues in the British parliament. I can’t promise anything today.Meanwhile, Katja Leikert, the deputy chair of the CDUCSU parliamentary faction, used Twitter to praise the breakthrough as “good news” and said it was “high time” for an agreement. “Now it’s about getting over a few more hurdles. The next thing is for British cabinet and parliament to approve the draft,” she said.Scotland’s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, has described Theresa May’s Brexit deal as “devastating” for Scotland. Speaking to the BBC, she said that, from what she knows of the deal so far, it would mean “the worst of all possible worlds for Scotland”.It would take Scotland out of the single market, which would be bad enough in and of itself.But it would do so while leaving us competing for investment and jobs with Northern Ireland, which would effectively be staying in the single market.That would be devastating for jobs and investment in Scotland and not something that anybody should be prepared to accept.The SNP’s Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, confirmed this morning that his party’s 35 MPs would oppose the deal in its current form.But Sturgeon insisted that rejecting the current proposals in the House of Commons would not make a no-deal Brexit inevitable, but opened up the possibility for getting “better options like full single market and customs union membership back on the table”.She added that it would also allow those arguing for another referendum to be held on the Brexit terms – as the SNP has done – to make their case.Here is my colleague Rafael Behr’s take on the Brexit deal.And here is an extract.During the past few weeks two contradictory propositions have been circulating in Westminster with roughly equal currency. One is that somehow a strain of pragmatism that is innate to British politics, coupled with raw terror of chaos, will drive May’s bargain into law. The other is that, with hardline Tories, the DUP and Labour all finding reasons to hate May’s plan, there simply aren’t the votes for it. Only one of those propositions can hold.Overnight, Brexit has ceased to be a haze of slogans, ambitions, pledges and myths. It is now a piece of paper in the prime minister’s hand. There is no more “Brexit means Brexit”. There is a deal that either serves the national interest or betrays it. The detail will emerge in the days to come, but two things can be said with certainty. First, May’s route presents safer passage to the future than is envisaged in the wild fantasy of quitting the EU with no deal at all. Second, the terms that May has negotiated offer inferior status, market access, influence and power on the European continent and in the world than Britain has enjoyed as an EU member. Plenty of MPs know it, too comfortably a majority. The question now is how many have the courage to say so.Germany’s economy minister, Peter Altmaier, has warned that both Britain and the European Union will be worse off once Brexit has taken place.Last year, Altmaier was critical of UK ministers who had urged him to help make Brexit a win-win for both sides, something he sees as impossible."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4dbd5d0e6a7b224f4e416a23b22d35c19648d51c/0_167_6016_3608/master/6016.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8b12edcde4ccd77fab0d799d9e320eab","title":"hip hop hull young people poverty city of culture","story":"A new documentary shows one man’s battle with poverty as he tries to bring rap – and hope – to the city’s most deprived areasTen-year-old Jess Baker (not her real name) stands at a microphone in a tiny recording studio behind a hip-hop clothing shop near Hull city centre. “My brain is all messed up,” she raps, “Music is my passion, it makes me not give up”.Running the sound desk and encouraging her as she raps is Steve Arnott, director of Beats Bus, a project running music and arts workshops for young people in the city, which tackle issues including mental health, bullying and political engagement. “The idea of the Beats Bus first came to me about five years ago,” says Arnott. “There were hip-hop workshops already happening across the city, and I’d started doing workshops for young people. But if you come from a family with no money, parents can’t afford to give their children bus fares every day to come into town.”Arnott is the focus of a new documentary following his attempts to bring creativity and self-expression to young people in Hull’s marginalised communities. The film, A Northern Soul, by Hull-born documentary-maker Sean McAllister, is set against the backdrop of 2017, when Hull was city of culture.Established in 2013 by the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, the UK city of culture, awarded every four years, aims to bring the kind of social and economic benefits that Liverpool got from being the European capital of culture in 2008, when it welcomed 9.7 million and its economy got a boost of more than £750m.Hull beat competition from Leicester, Dundee and Swansea to become the second city of culture, after Derry in Northern Ireland won the inaugural bid for 2013. Civic leaders in Derry say that five years on, the effects of its year of culture are still being felt. It was an economic success and has transformed the image of the city, although an audit revealed it did not deliver as many jobs as had been predicted.And last December, Coventry was chosen to be the next city of culture – and was handed £8.5m in last month’s budget to help it prepare heritage and cultural buildings ahead of 2021. The team putting together Coventry’s programme is working with grassroots organisations to ensure events are inclusive. “Austerity is still biting hard,” says Martin Sutherland, chief executive of Coventry City of Culture Trust. “The year cannot just be about a big celebratory arts festival.” As well as tracking the economic impact of the year, Coventry’s team will be analysing the social impact, including on wellbeing, isolation, loneliness and mental health.Hull’s winning bid focused on “a city coming out of the shadows”. Hopes were high for its year as a cultural hub and the potential to transform lives – more than one in three children in the city live in poverty and it is one of England’s 20 most deprived areas. Although the city of culture title does not automatically confer any monetary gain, as a result of becoming city of culture, Hull received £8.5m from the government, £3m from Arts Council England and more than £10m in lottery funding including £3m from the Heritage Lottery Fund to support its programme of events.On the face of it, Hull has reaped the benefits: its year as city of culture attracted more than 5 million people to its events and led to 800 new jobs and almost £220m investment in culture and tourism. “I knew that the city of culture would make Hull really proud,” says Arnott. “The first week was amazing, with thousands of people on the streets crying, cheering, laughing. It raised the pride in our people.”Katy Fuller, an executive producer who helped organise Hull UK City of Culture 2017, now creative director and chief executive of Absolutely Cultured, the organisation running the city’s legacy events, says nine out of 10 residents had been involved in an event during the year – either attending, participating or volunteering.Audiences from the city’s most deprived areas were included in a number of different ways, and performances did not just take place in the city centre. The city of culture organisers, Fuller says, worked with schools, shopping centres and social clubs to put performances in the heart of communities – and one of the year’s showpiece events, the Land of Green Ginger, was presented in six neighbourhoods beyond the city centre. One of the city of culture legacy programmes is supporting theatre companies and artists living and working in Hull, she adds.Yet while Arnott’s Beats Bus colleague Dave Okwesia agrees that the events raised Hull’s profile and brought in both visitors and new businesses to the city centre, he says that the benefits were not felt so much in outlying areas or among grassroots artists. While A Northern Soul is a story about Hull’s year in the cultural spotlight, it’s also a powerful counterblast to the “poverty porn” of TV programmes such as Channel 4’s Benefits Street. Arnott is shown juggling his efforts to get his Beats Bus project on the road with an arduous job in a warehouse, struggling to make ends meet as his debts mount. “In the media, political and national discourse there has been an increase in negative depictions of poverty,” says Campbell Robb, chief executive of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, which part-funded the film. “It became obvious to us that we could not change laws and policies without addressing those attitudes.”Although the film focuses on Arnott, the story it tells of in-work poverty is one faced by growing numbers of people, with one in eight of the UK workforce (3.7 million people) living in poverty. “This film will resonate with everybody who watches it because this is the reality of lots of people’s lives,” says Robb. “While it tells the story of one man, it tells the story of a generation of people.”McAllister says his film is having a zeitgeist moment. Since its premiere at Sheffield documentary festival in June, Arnott and McAllister have travelled nationwide, speaking at dozens of screenings – often the film has been shown alongside Ken Loach’s drama I, Daniel Blake. The documentary will be shown to MPs this month and it is being aired on BBC2 on 18 November.Back in Hull, Arnott has secured £11,500 from crowdfunding to run the Beats Bus as a social enterprise, enabling him to give up his warehouse job and to focus full-time, with four colleagues, on running music, performance and art workshops for young people around the city.“The original idea, which we want to go back to, is approaching communities and estates where kids are knocking about on the streets because they’ve got nothing better to do,” he says. “We want to give them something better to do, give them a bit of advice and maybe stop them getting in trouble, messing about and maybe breaking the law. Youth clubs have been cut – we can be a travelling youth club.”And his ultimate aim is to take the Beats Bus project beyond Hull. “We want to branch out to take it wherever people want it,” he says. “If it works well, it can work well anywhere.”A Northern Soul will be shown on BBC2 at 10pm on 18 November"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b445d028448ba2313c471d73e4887ed3823f25a7/0_123_4380_2628/master/4380.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cad162e704c1e72b81b7b85a46e5406a","title":"world chess championship game 4 carlsen caruana","story":"Magnus Carlsen and Fabiano Caruana are no closer to a verdict in their world championship match after playing to a straightforward 34-move draw in Game 4 on Tuesday afternoon in London.

The champion’s response was somewhat more glib.“Well, I’ll have a look at the video and then make up my mind,” Carlsen said with a wry smile, prompting laughter from the gallery. “We’ll see then.”Carlsen’s manager Espen Agdestein, who initially declined to address the video, later said he believed it was a mistake by Caruana’s camp in a quote reported by leading Norwegian chess journalist Tarjei Svensen.“I think this is real,” Agdestein said. “It can happen by mistake, and we’ve been close to making the same mistake. It’s more likely that it was a mistake than that it was staged.”Norwegian grandmaster Jon Ludvig Hammer said he believed the information revealed was authentic, representing a devastating setback to Caruana’s bid to become the first American to win the world championship since Bobby Fischer in 1972.“This is the opening library of Caruana,” Hammer said on Norwegian television network VG. “This was so much detail and in-depth information on an opening he has already used in the world championship match.“It is obvious that this is relevant.”Both players will look forward to Wednesday’s rest day before the best-of-12-games match, the first world title showdown between the sport’s top two players in 28 years, resumes on Thursday with Caruana playing as white in Game 5."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bfb01e78bea35e5f13d769b29f220a293dc8bb6f/0_211_3051_1831/master/3051.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=026b93dbbafd08a9525ab377648ab73d","title":"novak djokovic v alexander zverev atp world tour finals live","story":"• World No 1 Djokovic faces world No 5 Zverev in London• Federer blows away Thiem in just over an hour• Tweet @JacobSteinberg or email jacob.steinberg@theFirst set: Djokovic* 2-1 Zverev (*denotes server): Pulled to the net, Zverev produces a volley that would be good enough to beat most players.

Join us tomorrow to find out if they do!What a day’s play that was! Sri Lanka bowled pretty well, the pressure they imposed at least partly responsible for the loose shots which cost wickets. But then Sam Curran intervened, and as things stand, you’d bet on that being the crucial period of the match. 12th over: Sri Lanka 26-1 (Karunaratne 19, Pushpakumara 1) Another first-ball single to Karunaratne, leaving Pushpakumara to face the final five balls of the day. He’s immediately beaten but one which spins big, then a drive hits Buttler at short extra - even he couldn’t catch that - and then another pearler dips, grips and jazzes past the edge. The last two deliveries are dots, but this pitch looks an absolute minefield now, and Sri Lanka are in all sorts. 11th over: Sri Lanka 25-1 (Karunaratne 18, Pushpakumara 1) Moeen, so cool he looks windswept in a place distinctly shy of wind, lollops in and this is getting nervy. He’s bowling an attacking line, just outside off so also threatening the stumps, so Karunaratne leaves Pushpakumara to deal with it, getting down the other end off the first delivery he survives, but that’s all he does. “Maybe we should produce five bunsens and play all three,” tweets Adrian Foster. “Spin the Aussies out.”That would be exceedingly hilarious. 10th over: Sri Lanka 24-1 (Karunaratne 17, Pushpakumara 1) Turns out that appeal was a good one - the ball wasn’t going down, but it was umpire’s call on height. “Open the door for him, Leachy,” advises Joe Root what a nickname that is, how do they think of these things? The batsmen take a single apiece. 9th over: Sri Lanka 22-1 (Karunaratne 16, Pushpakumara 0) Four dots from Moeen to Karunaratne, and then one straightens, clunking the pad! There’s an appeal but it was going down another dot completes the maiden. Three overs to go in the day. 8th over: Sri Lanka 22-1 (Karunaratne 16, Pushpakumara 0) Pushpakumara is the nightwatchman and Leach beats him with another beauty there are all sorts of shouts and the bat clips the turf and Foakes takes the bails off, but nothing doing. So here’s a question: who is or are England’s spinners in the summer? Silva never looked comfortable, and Leach, who looks like the patronised policeman in an Agatha Christie, finds a peach! A peach from Leach! The ball slants in, grips on middle, straightens, beats the edge, and kisses the top of middle stump! 7th over: Sri Lanka 21-0 (Karunaratne 16, Silva 6) Ali into the attack, and Karunaratne slides his first delivery to cover for two. Them after two dots, an edge ... but just short of slip ... and a single. This is going well for Sri Lanka, and I wonder if Root might give Rashid a g before the close to see if he can find a magic ball.“This might turn into a full-on, wine-fuelled, over-hyphenated rant,” says Tim Maitland, so wine-feulled as to have forgotten what the OBO is, “but why is cricket (and why are other sports) getting the concept of video review so wrong? Atherton (I think?) was crapping on about ‘how can the umpires give a soft signal when they’re so far away’, but the whole issue should be based (in cricket) on the benefit of the doubt. Curran should have had the benefit of the doubt, so the soft signal should always be not out. The burden should be on the video review to PROVE that the batsman is out (and in other sports, to prove the decision is wrong), nothing else. Even without the footage that clearly showed the ball bouncing Curran should have been given not out, because the dodgy footage they started with only showed the ball going towards the ground and then the ball ending up in Matthews hands. It didn’t PROVE the catch.BTW wasn’t it refreshing to see a sportsman being honest in the way that Matthews showed that he wasn’t sure?”Yes, I think that’s fair - I think Atherton was right about the soft signal in that instance, but can also see why you might have to prove that the batsman was out in all instances. 6th over: Sri Lanka 16-0 (Karunaratne 10, Silva 6) Leach into the attack and Karunaratne comes down ... misses .. and takes it on the back pad. England contemplate a review when Umpire Erasmus rejects their appeal, but he was too far down. And a replay shows that the ball was going over the top, so well done all concerned three singles follow. 5th over: Sri Lanka 13-0 (Karunaratne 8, Silva 5) Anderson goes again - it might be done after this - and Silva is squared up by one, but manages to tilt the face so that the ball runs across it and past third man for four. Anderson responds beautifully, a lifter off a length that Silva gets nowhere near, another that pushes him back, and a third that raps the pad. It’s taken him three overs to get going, but he might not be allowed another. 4th over: Sri Lanka 9-0 (Karunaratne 8, Silva 1) Lovely shot from Karunaratne, stepping down as Curran overpitches and driving four to long on. He’s started well, and will be desperate to still be out there tomorrow morning. In the outfield, Jack Leach is warming up.3rd over: Sri Lanka 5-0 (Karunaratne 4, Silva 1) Jaffa from Anderson first up, 86mph and and shaping away, beating the outside edge. Foakes appeals, but nothing doing. Karunaratne then bangs a single to point, and that’s another over ticked off. To my gross chagrin, Duncan Wiles is back: “I feel compelled to inform you that Dave has been in touch to dispel the myth of his ippon on Putin in Bearpark... So maybe you need to watch your back and perhaps your wife may be right after all (inevitably).”He’d be no match for my terrifying mix of Yiddish and hyphenbantz. 2nd over: Sri Lanka 4-0 (Karunaratne 3, Silva 1) Gosh, Curran almost nabs one second ball! Karnaratne anticipates swing, leaves a gap, and Curran finds it ... but not off stump. Karunaratne is batting outside his crease and also coming down as Curran comes in, looking to cover any swing, and gets one to square leg, the only run from the over. 1st over: Sri Lanka 3-0 (Karunaratne 2, Silva 1) Anderson doesn’t quite find the range first up, forcing Foakes to take a couple down leg side obviously he does, with consummate ease. Karunaratne then gets off the mark to third man, Silva does likewise to leg, and another single makes this a fair start for Sri Lanka.Right then, off we go. How many down will Curran have Sri Lanka at close? Twelve overs to go...“Selfish Curran there denying Jimmy his nailed-on century,” tweets Andy H. In the studio, they’re discussing that he isn’t especially strong, he just times it beautifully. I’m absolutely certain he could take Vladimir Putin. In the meantime, there’s great cricket going on elsewhere in the sub-Continent. I’m pretty sure that hyphen is correct, and the upper case C certainly is....Sri Lanka will have to tell themselves they’d have taken this position at the start, because if they don’t they’re in danger of crumbling. I’ll be back in five to see what happens next. Curran whacks to long off and this time the catch is taken. But what an innings that was - what an inidual he is, movingly brilliant and brave, youthfulness incarnate, and with the most phenomenal timing you could ask for. Chris Gaffaney is saying it looks like fingers under the ball as we can see it bounce, then another angle is clearer still, and yes it bounced. Of course it bounced, Sam Curran told it to. NOT OUT.Matthews isn’t sure, but I don’t think that’s out - I think the ball bounces into his hands. The picture isn’t that clear, but.76th over: England 285-9 (Curran 64, Anderson 7) Curran drives flat to long on, and Matthews takes what might be a brilliant catch. The soft signal is not out - how can the umpires see from there - and upstairs we go...75th over: England 285-9 (Curran 64, Anderson 7) Dananjaya to carry on ... er, ok ... and it takes Anderson exactly one ball to get down the other end. Curran it is, then, and after six sixes but no four - that must be some sort of record - he redresses the balance with a luscious sweep to the fence. Two balls left, in comes the field, and out to square leg goes the ball. This is ragged from the Lankans, and reminds me of how England allowed Kohli to farm the strike in the first innings of the first Test last summer. And that’s drinks Sri Lanka will hope theirs is a stiff yin. 74th over: England 279-9 (Curran 59, Anderson 6) Who wants the ball? Perera continues, and Curran plays five dots, pathetic. The field comes in - will Curran back Anderson, who’s defending well, and go for the rope, or take the one? The answer is neither this time he can’t find a gap and Sri Lanka now have an over at the Burnley Boycott. 73rd over: England 279-9 (Curran 59, Anderson 6) So here’s a question: Curran is clearly good enough to bat in the top six, but is there any point him going there when this is what he does from here? Imagine how demoralising it must be for someone so good to turn up at number 8. And, well, oh dear me. Curran twists to long on, doesn’t go hard enough, and it’s a dolly’s dolly for Pushpakamara. He watches, arms by his side, gets down, and casually grasses the chance ... and you know what’s coming next! YES YOU DO! Six more frasked down the ground, Curran equalling Kevin Pietersen’s record of six sixes in a Sri Lankan Test innings in the process. A leg-bye follows for the fifty partnership, and Anderson has one ball to survive. 72nd over: England 272-9 (Curran 53, Anderson 6) Dilwuran has a go ... good luck mate. I’m not sure what the bowlers could’ve done here Brad Hogg explains that when Curran doesn’t get to the pitch, he just trusts his eyes and his hands. But the fielding has exerted no pressure, allowing the batsmen to ro-tate the strike at will ... and they do it again, Curran taking one off the penultimate delivery, and Sri Lanka will be feeling this match slipping away being slipped away. 71st over: England 270-9 (Curran 52, Anderson 6) The field spreads for Curran, men guarding the rope as though he can’t just go over them whenever he wills it. This is so, so silly ... Curran is batting badly, as I said ... but then Dananjaya drops shot, so Curran shmices him for six to square leg! That’s his fifty! Behind him, Dickwella gently and inadvertently facepalms what can you do. And the single comes next yet again Curran has taken the Test match onto his knee and is tweaking its nose, pinching its cheek and stealing its dinner money. 70th over: England 264-9 (Curran 45, Anderson 6) Dickwella will be rueing that drop when Anderson was on 0, all the more so when Curran plays a hoik to midwicket, misses, and the turn beats yerman to the tune of four byes! You cannot beat lower-order runs v- as opposed to lower order-runs, which sounds masochistic in the extreme. Off Perera’s fifth delivery, Curran finds another gap for one - Sri Lanka have not been good enough at making that hard enough - and Anderson survives the final ball. 69th over: England 259-9 (Curran 44, Anderson 6) Sri Lanka have Anderson where they want him, so he takes a four and one! Shut up! SHUT UP! SHUT UP! SHUT UP! Sam Curran Sam Curran Sam Curran! Dananjaya gives him width, looking to keep him on strike ... so he carves six over extra cover! I swear it! He did! Then another easy single to point, for another over of affirmation and mortification! The partnership is 34.“Whether cricket is too esoteric for the German language is debatable,” reckons John Atherton, “but Harold Pinter’s play The Birthday Party with the line ‘who watered the wicket in Melbourne’, was certainly incomprehensible to one translator who rendered the line in German as ‘who pissed on the city gates of Melbourne?’”68th over: England 247-9 (Curran 37, Anderson 1) SAM CURRAN IS A STAR! He goes again, striking six down the ground next ball! What he’s doing - making Test cricket look pips, immediately and almost all the time - is very, very special. Lap it up, drink it in, slurp it down, because you do not see gear of this ilk very often. This is really close ... from the off side he looks out, his back foot off the ground ... but from behind he’s in! 68th over: England 241-9 (Curran 31, Anderson 1) Perera fires them in at Curran, not really trying to spin him out, rather stop him from scoring to get a shy at Anderson. But then Curran misses one, off come the bails ... and is his foot up! Upstairs we go...“As an Austrian, I object to your long German word.” emails Sophie Frühling. “The organisation is called (or was) Donaudampfschifffahrtsgesellschaft, so you have to put that at the beginning and then you can put whatever comes to mind.”I prefer to always prefix it with “absolute”. 67th over: England 241-9 (Curran 31, Anderson 1) Now he goes! Curran comes down and paggas Dananjaya back over his heed for six! Two defensive shots follow, then another zetz, over long on! Surely the fielders will come in now, but Curran finds a way, tucking off his pads for one. He is rrrrridiculous. 66th over: England 228-9 (Curran 18, Anderson 1) Curran still isn’t going for it, taking a single to point ... which allows us to enjoy Anderson unveiling his reverse-sweep to point for none. The ball is doing absolutely loads now, but the Burnley Buttler sweeps to square leg for one anyway, and then Curran takes a single. How was that allowed so easily?

Linton will take over from Madani Younis, who was named creative director of the Southbank Centre earlier this year.Linton said the appointment was a “great honour” and that Younis had been an inspiration throughout her career. “I have seen some of my favourite ever plays in this building … I cannot wait to lead an exciting new chapter inspired by all the wonderful artists that populate our unique city.’She has a busy few months ahead. After directing the Donmar’s UK premiere of Lynn Nottage’s Pulitzer prize-winner Sweat, which opens next month, she will co-direct Richard II at Shakespeare’s Globe. That production, presented by a company of women of colour, will ask what it means to be British in the light of the Windrush anniversary. Linton, who is of Guyanese heritage, has also commissioned Passages: A Windrush Celebration, a series of monologue films to be released online by the Royal Court next year.Linton grew up in Leyton, east London, and studied English at the University of Essex. Her first professional production as a playwright was Step, which followed two friends leaving east London to go to separate universities. It was presented by Theatre Royal Stratford East and toured schools in 2013. Her other plays include the family comedy-drama #Hashtag Lightie, directed by Rikki Beadle-Blair at the Arcola in 2017 she wrote the play because “every story I had seen about mixed race people didn’t represent my experiences at all”. Linton trained on the StoneCrabs young directors programme and was associate director at the Gate theatre, where she set up the Young Associate company.Younis said Linton was “undoubtedly a fantastic choice” for the Bush. Simon Johnson, chair of the theatre, said: “The board of trustees looked for an inidual who moved and inspired us a leader who is willing to fight for what we stand for and who is unswerving in their commitment to nurturing new writing and new artists. Lynette Linton has these qualities in abundance.”The Bush theatre, which has always nurtured new writing talent, first opened above a pub in 1977. It later moved to its current site, a former library, where it recently underwent a £4.3m renovation. The Bush’s previous artistic directors include Josie Rourke, who left to run the Donmar.Linton – who once said her dream job would be as “Michael Jackson’s backup dancer” – will start at the Bush in January."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9ff8bba8c500347faf78fbf9dbde2c72a31597c0/0_307_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=14e4bc68f35fbeb2e4d31a87677e7670","title":"share your caribbean highlights for the chance to win a 200 hotel voucher","story":"Send us a tip on affordable experiences in the Caribbean, be they places to stay, activities and attractions, or bars and restaurantsPalm-fringed beaches, rum punch and infectious reggae beats … Carnivals, rainforest and a laid-back vibe … The Caribbean is one of the world’s most alluring holiday destinations, and we want to hear your highlights – especially for those not on an A-lister budget.

Some left our block at midnight using secret paths for other camps, especially Kutupalong, where there is not so much fear about repatriation.”Jani, 30, a Rohingya living in camp 14, said the security presence had doubled in the past two days in several settlements, elevating the panic among the Rohingya. “When the sun sets the security teams come to every entry point in the camps and they don’t leave till the morning,” he said. “People are running away and spending days and nights in the forest or other camps.”Rohingya in Camp 15, where 100 families are on the list for return, reported that the army presence was so heavy that no-one was being allowed to enter or leave the camp. However, by the time the security had arrived on Tuesday, every family listed for repatriation had already gone into hiding.There have also been reports of Bangladesh camp officials, known as CICs, assaulting Rohingya who have refused to cooperate. In a video, verified by the , Ata Ullah, a Rohingya leader in Chakmarkul Camp 21 alleges that he was beaten in the office of a CIC officer “with a large stick” on Monday after he was unable to provide them with list of Rohingya in his camp. “They stepped on my neck, I could not stand it,” Ullah said in the footage. “You can see from my face how I was beaten.”It is the latest signal that the repatriations, due to begin on Thursday, may not be voluntary, despite multiple assurances by the Bangladesh foreign secretary and the refugee commissioner that they would not force any Rohingya to go back against their will.Dozens of Rohingya families interviewed by the , who were placed on a list of 2,200 refugees “approved” for return by Myanmar without their consent, said they did not want to return under the current conditions. Many had fled the camps and gone into hiding, while for others the prospect of going back was so alarming they had attempted suicide.Nurul Islam, a Rohingya community leader in Unchiprang refugee camp, Cox’s Bazar, said that up to 50 families in the vicinity hadgone into hiding.“Last week the officials told several families sternly that they would no more be allowed to stay in Bangladesh and have to return to Myanmar and almost all of them have disappeared from their shacks in our camp in the past three or four days,” Islam told the . “Like all other Rohingya they are too scared to return to Burma. So, they have gone into hiding.”Yesterday, UNHCR began interviewing families on the list for return but spokesperson Caroline Gluck said that many could not be located. “Of those that we have interviewed, none want to go back,” confirmed Gluck.Forced repatriation also risks splitting up families. Osiullah, who like many other Rohingya uses one name, said he had gone into hiding after discovering that three of his children, the youngest aged five, were on the list for return while he, his wife and three other children were not.“I got terribly scared to find the names of only three of children listed,” he said. “I’ve heard they will force us cross the border. We slipped out of the camp because I could not take the risk.”The UN has repeatedly called for a halt to the repatriation plans. UNHCR said it would not be facilitating or providing assistance for return, other than interviewing Rohingya on the list and assessing their willingness to go back. On Tuesday Michelle Bachelet, the UN high commissioner for human rights, condemned the “terror and panic” it was causing Rohingya who were at “imminent risk of being returned to Myanmar against their will.”There has been no statement on the issue from Myanmar’s state counsellor, Aung San Suu Kyi, who has been at the Asean summit in Singapore this week. At a meeting with US vice president Mike Pence on Wednesday afternoon, Aung San Suu Kyi was pressed about how those responsible for the Rohingya crisis and “created such suffering” were being held accountable, to which she responded simply: “we understand our country better than anyone”. However, it was Aung San Suu Kyi, not Pence, who requested the meeting.The most vocal condemnation of the Rohingya crisis came from Malaysian prime minister Mahathir Mohamad, who said: “It would seem that Aung San Suu Kyi is trying to defend what is indefensible.”Speaking on the sidelines before his summit address, he added: “They are actually oppressing these people to the point of killing them, mass killing.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b607cd020f2f67f943ce025b530fd8e7b4ab35be/257_546_2987_1792/master/2987.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aaed54e54af5e5e0f178b22fd67065d9","title":"boy gets six points on future driving licence for scooter speeding","story":"Boy, 15, caught by police who clocked him at ‘high speed’ on electric scooter in north-east EnglandIt is perhaps not unusual for overexcited new drivers to clock up a few points on their licence in their first year or two behind the wheel.But pity the 15-year-old boy who, having never put pedal to the metal on a public highway, already has six points on his licence. The teenager appeared in court last month after he was caught by police in Cleveland, north-east England, for clocking a “high speed” on an electric scooter.With top speeds of up to 40mph, the scooters may only be ridden on authorised or private land, and are strictly prohibited on pavements. Police did not reveal any more details of the offence, but warned parents of the consequences of buying scooters for their children.Electric scooters and skateboards are becoming more common on city streets across the UK. But few riders realise they risk arrest and a possible fine of up to £75 for riding what are classed as personal light electric vehicles (PLEVs).The law – based on an 1835 Highways Act, according to scooter maker Micro – lags behind those in elsewhere in Europe. In France electric scooters can be ridden on cycle lanes and the pavement, provided riders keep to a speed limit in Germany pavement riding is legal up to 6kmh (nearly 4mph) and in Austria and Switzerland riders can travel along cycle lanes and on roads at up to 25kmh.In California, PLEVs are road-legal as long as riders are over 16 and wear helmets.Commenting on the Cleveland case, PC Mike Doherty, of the Coulby Newham neighbourhood policing team, said: “These scooters are not toys, and not only can they be extremely dangerous but they are also not legal to ride on pavements and roads, and I think many parents aren’t aware of this.“Under the Road Traffic Act we can report the inidual rider for not having insurance, a licence, a number plate, helmet and MOT for the scooter.“This person will then be reported for summons and will be given a minimum of six points on their licence or future licence and a possible fine.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2ed1e59b9e9db4c84df78d4810100406be6625e5/0_435_1702_1021/master/1702.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1b826e9728d3b8423d0e9eda9d830795","title":"kremlin critic alexei navalny flies out of russia after ban lifted","story":"Opposition figure allowed to leave to attend European court of human rights caseKremlin critic Alexei Navalny has been allowed to fly out of Russia to attend the finale of a case he filed at Europe’s top human rights court, a day after border guards stopped him leaving the country.Navalny, Russia’s most prominent opposition figure, wants to be in Strasbourg on Thursday when the European court of human rights is due to rule on whether his numerous detentions by police in Russia have been politically motivated or not.He was prevented from flying out of Moscow on Tuesday over an unpaid court fine, which he said had been suddenly and illegally enforced as a pretext to stop him travelling abroad.The Federal Bailiffs Service, which blocked his exit, did not respond to a request for comment regarding Navalny’s allegations that its actions were illegal.However, it told the Tass news agency on Tuesday evening that it had rescinded the travel ban after Navalny had paid the fine.The 42-year-old lawyer posted a photograph on social media of himself passing through passport control at a Moscow airport on Wednesday and said he had encountered no problems leaving the country this time."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Group says Ireland has lost sight of humanity of mortage arrears situationBreast-feeding mother\u0026rsquos son taken from her on foot of order by Child and Family AgencyF\u0026oacutersa says no group has monopoly on problems of recruitment and retentionPassenger allegedly grabbed steering wheel of car that crashed into vehicle carrying Tipperary couple\u0026lsquoThe tongue kills like a knife,\u0026rsquo pontiff tells Catholic faithful at audience in the Vatican\u0026lsquoWe do not believe this deal is the best deal\u0026rsquo, says Jeffrey DonaldsonFianna F\u0026aacuteil leader says Brexit has undermined trust that was built up over decadesProf John Boland among leading Irish scientists to feature in SFI annual awardsDirect provision centre at Caiseal Mara Hotel in Moville set to house 100 asylum seekersCiar\u0026aacuten Cuffe says pedestrian crossing period should be increased by one secondTaoiseach says Unionists may be feeling vulnerable, isolated, worriedLimbani \u0026lsquoRobert\u0026rsquo Mzoma was stabbed to death in FoxrockA 15-year-old boy in UK appeared in court over \u0026lsquohigh speed\u0026rsquo electric scooter rideWednesday morning breakdown on city centre street causing delays along Green LineEU exit deal must preserve UK constitutional integrity, Dodds saysThe letters have been sent to those who may be affected by improved bus and cycle lanes under BusConnectsRobbery and drugs gang chief targeted by Cab was paid to leave State-owned propertyGame makers accused of \u0026lsquolacking transparency\u0026rsquo in selling space to companiesPipe bomb and arson attacks, an abduction and a stabbing follow earlier shooting"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3696929.1542145504!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"dublin property owners notified they may lose part of their front gardens","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSome 30,000 submissions were received by the NTA in relation to the redesign of the Dublin bus network when public consultation closed at the end of SeptemberHundreds of Dublin property owners who may lose part of their front gardens to accommodate bus and cycle lanes under the controversial BusConnects project have begun to be notified by the National Transport Authority (NTA). It is understood the NTA has issued letters to around 340 property owners along four proposed bus corridors Clongriffin to the city centre, Swords to the city centre, Blanchardstown to the city centre, and Lucan to the city centre. A further 1,000 property owners are expected to be informed from January and February. A public consultation process will open from Wednesday afternoon, and run into early 2019 in relation to upgrading the bus and cycle lanes. The BusConnects project involves upgrading 16 core bus routes and cycle lanes into the city. The NTA has acknowledged that to achieve the required space it will be necessary to acquire “parts of front gardens and land in front of commercial properties”.“We will purchase the portion of front gardens from property owners, ensure new landscaping and replanting of the gardens as well as providing compensation for the garden portion loss and disruption,” says the plan.The NTA has decided to inform affected residents in phases – with the next phase of impacted owners due to be told in January and the last batch notified in February. The remaining corridors include Ballymun to the city centre Finglas to Phibsborough Liffey Valley to the city centre Clondalkin to Drimnagh Greenhills to the city centre Kimmage to the city centre Tallaght to Terenure Rathfarnham to the city centre Bray to the city centre UCD Ballsbridge to the city centre Blackrock to Merrion, and Ringsend to the city centre. It is understood affected residents on the Kimmage to city centre corridor, who have already voiced concerns over the project, will be informed in January. The NTA has offered one-to-one meetings with those affected, according to a letter seen by The . “We do wish to reiterate that these are proposals only which are not fixed or finalised. They will be published in full shortly to get public feedback in relation to them,” it states. Separately some 30,000 submissions were received by the NTA in relation to the redesign of the bus network when public consultation closed at the end of September.A revised network is due to be published by mid-2019, and a further round of public consultation will begin. The new network is expected to be rolled out by early 2020.The NTA said the network redesign can be implemented using the current road network with “some upgrades to infrastructure at key interchange locations” and in advance of the core bus corridor project.

They feel abandoned and forgotten - almost like collateral damage of the past - as the country embraces the move out of economic crisis.”She pointed out that the people were “raising families, looking after children, caring for loved ones with disabilities, and doing what they can to hold on to their homes” and she warned that if they lost their homes to vulture funds or banks “they have nowhere else to go and are at high risk of adding to our homelessness crisis.”Julie Sadlier, a solicitor who has worked with distressed borrowers for over 10 years said the research was the first such project to concentrate on the “lived reality of the people behind the statistics and balance sheets” and she accused the Central Bank of consistently highlighting the needs of banks at the expense of families at risk of losing their homes.“Over the past 10 years, we have completely lost sight of the humanity of the situation, and of the fact that many people, because of a variety of circumstances, have no way of making a deal with a bank and are looking at losing their family home,” she said.“The State schemes we have in place don’t seem to be working either. Criteria for the mortgage-to-rent scheme are not reflective of the current market reality and supports intended to help people with financial and legal advice are failing to build trust.”The report finds that over 70 per cent of people who are struggling have never consulted a solicitor while over 80 per cent have not had a solicitor represent them in court. Most said they could not afford the legal fees.The courts were described as being intimidating, difficult to understand, daunting and largely intolerant of unrepresented plaintiffs and lay litigants and contrary to popular narratives, 72 per cent of people in mortgage distress have attended court hearings in their case.The research shows that systems put in place to support people in mortgage distress are not working.

Photograph:  Paul FaithAFPThe European Union and United Kingdom have agreed the draft of a withdrawal agreement covering the terms of Britain’s departure from the EU. The biggest difficulty here was agreeing a way to avoid the return of a hard Irish border. The main focus when the agreement is published will be on exactly how this is achieved. This is the much-discussed border backstop.It’s really just a badly-named guarantee. It is a promise that no matter what happens in the future agreement on a trading relationship between the UK and the EU, to be negotiated during the transition phase, that there would be no hard border in Ireland.The backstop was first agreed in principle last December, when the EU and the UK signed up to a “political declaration” that would form the basis for the withdrawal agreement. This also covered the UK’s financial settlement, the mutual rights of citizens and the two-year transition period which means nothing will actually change for 21 months after next March’s exit.As well as promising to maintain the open Irish border, British prime minister Theresa May also promised that the arrangement would not result in any differences between the North and the rest of the UK. The difficulty in the negotiations has centred on how the promise is to be made good, and how long any backstop commitment will last for.It proposes that the whole of the UK remains in a customs union with the EU, while a new trade deal between the two sides is agreed. This is the so-called UK-wide backstop. That is an attempt to maintain Ms May’s twin obligations – of the open border in Ireland, and no different customs regime between the North and the rest of the UK. However, there will be some differences in other non-customs rules and regulations between the North and Britain, a potential political problem.Also, the problem for Brexiteers is that this keeps the UK under EU rules for a period – and perhaps indefinitely if no new trade deal can be agreed.The UK will be signing up to an arrangement to maintain an open border, whatever the outcome of future talks – but the key will be how this would happen and under what circumstances it could end. The British wanted to be able to exit the backstop agreement once they were happy a new trade deal with the EU would avoid a hard border. But the Irish and EU side pointed out that this isn’t really a backstop if the UK could get out of it whenever it wanted.And that’s why they have said that if the UK-wide backstop is temporary, there may need to be – wait for it – “a backstop to the backstop”. This would involve a specific guarantee that the North would remain effectively in the EU trading bloc in future, if everything else failed.I know. The Irish Government has said it is agnostic – it doesn’t mind whether there is a Northern Ireland only backstop, or a UK-wide backstop, once the guarantee is watertight.Reports suggest that the final text includes just one backstop – based on a UK-wide arrangement – but that there will be additional Northern Ireland-specific elements to it, offering guarantees to Dublin. The text will be closely examined to see how this is all put together.You must be joking. The DUP will object to anything meaning different regulations could apply in the North to the rest of the UK – and this is still likely in some areas. The British Brexiteers are already out against it, warning it could leave the UK under EU rules, but without any say in how they are made.It is over to London and the UK cabinet. If they give it the thumbs up, then the EU will schedule a special summit probably for later this month, or at the latest for early next month. Once that’s agreed, the British and European Parliaments must ratify the treaty before the UK leaves at the end of March. We really are in the endgame now.\u0026nbspIn Dublin, the cabinet is meeting to disucss the draft text and in Brussels Michel Barnier, the EU\u0027s chief negotiator, will brief European Union ambassadors.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspDeal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Video: Oireachtas TV\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTaoiseach Leo Varadkar speaking about the Brexit deal in the Dáil on WednesdayThe draft agreement between the EU and the UK on the Brexit withdrawal treaty contains the essential aspects of the backstop that the Irish Government has always wanted, the Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has implied in the Dáil this afternoon.“It does have to be there, it does have to be legally operable, it can’t have an expiry date, it can’t be possible for one side to withdraw from it unilaterally ,” Mr Varadkar said.“It is our intention that the backstop should never have to be invoked and if it is invoked it should be temporary,” he added. But he also said that the Irish Government required the backstop to be operable “unless and until” it was replaced with something better.Mr Varadkar chaired a meeting of the Cabinet in Government Buildings on Wednesday morning at which ministers were briefed on the contents of the deal. However, the Government is remaining silent on the draft agreement for now for fear publication of any detail will complicate matters for the British Prime Minister Theresa May as she seeks to gain the approval of her Cabinet for the deal.Mr Varadkar said the details of the text are likely to be released later, if the British Cabinet approves it. Mr Varadkar also said that the Dáil will get to vote on the UK withdrawal treaty even though it is not legally necessary.He said that if this agreement was made it “will be an international treaty between EU, including Ireland, and the UK, and being an international treaty it would continue to apply even if a change of government in Ireland or the UK.”He said that a lot of things can go wrong, but if the UK is in a position it is proposed that Commission taskforce will be in a position tonight to publish the text of the agreement.“The text will have to be ratified by Westminster and European parliament. While not legally necessary it is my strong view that the text should be put to a vote in Dáil Éireann,” he said.He said if the UK Cabinet was in a position this afternoon with the text it is proposed the Commission taskforce would publish it this evening.Mr Varadkar said “my reading is that the Good Friday Agreement is not negatively impacted”.Fianna Fáil deputy leader Dara Calleary said this document is “as important to the island of Ireland as it is to the UK and as it is for the EU”.It was a “seminal one in the history of this island and this Oireachtas should have the power and capability to scrutinise it”.Sinn Féin deputy leader Pearse Doherty hit out at the DUP who he said were “living in a fantasy land” on Brexit. They did not know what was in it but were against it and this was “absolutely reckless”.The Taoiseach said however: “I know that for the Unionist community this is quite a difficult time and may be feeling vulnerable, isolated and quite worried about what may be agreed.But he said the Belfast Agreement would be protected and that included a recognition of the territory of the UK and the principle of consent and he was happy to have that included in the agreement.He also said that timing for the release of the document was important. He remembered when the “German parliament saw our budget before our parliament did and that has to work both ways”. He did not want to be putting in the public domain documents that other parliaments had not seen.This morning’s Cabinet meeting follows a meeting on Tuesday night between Mr Varadkar, Tánaiste Simon Coveney, Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe and Minister for European Affairs Helen McEntee.The DUP has warned that Mrs May’s Brexit deal could lead to the break-up of the United Kingdom. There was uncertainty about the review process in the agreement, under which the UK would exit from the backstop.As first reported by The  last week, under the draft, the backstop will apply to the entire United Kingdom and see Britain remain in a customs union with the EU if no solutions to avoid a hard border are found. However, the withdrawal agreement will have additional measures for Northern Ireland to ensure there is no hard border.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination. A fashion insider said: His brand is about female empowerment. That\u0027s his ethos. He couldn\u0027t go ahead with this, it wouldn\u0027t be a good look. It would be awkward. I can\u0027t imagine celebrities would want to be associated with Philip Green. He\u0027s in a tricky situation.

Her mother was extremely anxious, unable to feed or hold her child.As there was no window into the unit, she couldn’t even see her. Nobody was allowed into the ICU and Manu had to be cared for by one nurse, so the infection didn’t spread to other infants on the ward.Manu was suffering from sepsis, a serious and potentially deadly condition where an infection gets into the bloodstream and the body overreacts.If left untreated, babies can go into septic shock and their organs can begin to shut down within hours. Manu had already been given powerful “last resort” antibiotics for more than a week.  Perplexingly, they didn’t seem to be working.Laboratory tests came back revealing why. The infection that had spread to Manu’s blood was resistant to every antibiotic the hospital stocked, except for one: Polymyxin B. This explained why her infection hadn’t responded. Manu was given Polymyxin B immediately, but had to be monitored carefully as it can damage the kidneys and nerves.Antibiotic resistance | Global consumption fuels spread of superbugsBabies less than a month old are vulnerable to catching infections as their immune systems have not fully developed, and if those infections get into the blood they can cause sepsis. Globally, sepsis is one of the three leading causes of infant deaths. In India, sepsis was responsible for at least 640,000 babies dying before they reached a month old in 2016, Unicef figures show.Over the past decade hospitals have been faced with an extra threat. As was the case for Manu’s infection, they are seeing “alarming” rates of antibiotic resistance in the types of bacteria that typically cause sepsis, making care of sick babies much more difficult.In most big city hospitals, where babies with sepsis are referred, common antibiotics are no longer effective. More than 80 per cent of some types of bacteria causing sepsis in babies are multidrug resistant – immune to nearly all antibiotics.Doctors are having to administer “last-line” antibiotics, normally given only in emergencies, as the first drug. It was estimated in a study in 2016 that resistant infections kill more than 58,000 babies in India every year, though the author of the research said this was a vast underestimate.The laboratory at All India Institute of Medical Sciences, where around half of bacteria are resistant to the carbapenem antibiotics used in emergencies to treat resistant infections “We are in a fix. We are staring at a gloomy situation,” said Dr Suman Chaurasia, a paediatrician and sepsis researcher at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, a top government hospital in Delhi.While older antibiotics are being repurposed for adults with sepsis, there is a lack of data on babies and so there are few alternatives. If resistance to “last line” drugs continues to rise, Dr Chaurasia is worried these “rescue” antibiotics currently used to save babies’ lives will also fail.“Our biggest concern is what kind of drug would be left for us? If drugs like colistin are getting out of our reach, being snatched out of our hands, how are we going to treat babies further?”“I can’t think of anything more threatening to mothers and babies lives than antibiotic resistance,” said Professor Ramanan Laxminarayan, director of the Center for Disease Dynamics, Economics \u0026amp Policy (CDDEP), a US public health organisation.“Antibiotics have made us lazy. It’s held out the hope that antibiotics will cure infection but they are working less and less often.”He called for government policies to regulate sales and use of antibiotics and for better infection control in hospitals. “We are just not doing enough on infection control… we need hand washing, hand barriers against bacteria spreading. These are non-negotiable but they are flouted routinely in all facilities.”India has become the global epicentre of antibiotic resistance, with many factors combining to hasten the spread of superbugs. Bacteria evolve resistance to antibiotics naturally over time, but the mass consumption of the drugs speeds it up dramatically, particularly if they are used inappropriately.India’s use of antibiotics in human medicine more than doubled between 2010 and 2015 as incomes rose. The country has a huge population, millions of whom are living in poor, unsanitary conditions, and there are frequent outbreaks of infectious disease which require antibiotics to treat.Drugs are available over the counter and many people take the wrong antibiotics or an incomplete course and a majority of people get medical care from unregulated private doctors who are often untrained and may prescribe inappropriately. This is combined with poor sanitation and infection control in many hospitals, allowing resistant organisms to spread.Antibiotics have also been widely used in Indian farming to treat and prevent disease in cattle, chicken and pigs used for meat, milk and dairy. Tiny frequent doses are also used to fatten animals up for slaughter, a practice banned in the EU and US because this kind of use fuels resistance.Finally the country is a global hub of antibiotic production, and the pharmaceutical factories leak antibiotic-ridden effluent into the environment during the manufacturing process, as revealed in a previous Bureau investigation.This “perfect storm” has led to soaring rates of resistance among bacteria in India, creating powerful superbugs which then spread all over the world. At three hospitals the Bureau visited in Delhi and Jaipur, there was a reported resistance rate to a group of last line antibiotics known as carbapenems of between 50 and 70 per cent. In the UK, fewer than 2 per cent of bloodstream infections are resistant to these drugs.Antibiotic resistance | The true cost in Britain and around the worldIt is having a huge impact on newborns vulnerable to infection, experts warn. Dr Chaurasia and his team produced a landmark study, tracking babies with sepsis from three government hospitals in Delhi. Before this, the lack of data meant sepsis was has not been taken seriously as a public health concern, he said.His team followed 13,530 babies between July 2011 and February 2014 and found nearly 15 per cent suffered sepsis. They found the condition was responsible for nearly a quarter of all baby deaths. Inthe UK it is responsible for less than 2 per cent.The levels of multidrug resistance was “alarming”, Dr Chaurasia said. One of the bacteria causing the sepsis, acinetobacter, had a resistance rate of 82 per cent. Two thirds of the babies infected with it died.The study also found that most cases happened within the first three days of life, some within just 12 hours. It is very unusual for infections to be caught so soon and the doctors are not sure where they are coming from.Dr Suman Chaurasia, a paediatrician and sepsis researcher at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Delhi, who carried out the study. He said rates of antibiotic resistance were \u0026#39alarmingIt could be that mothers were carrying bacteria and passed it to their baby in the womb, or in the birth canal during labour. Or it may be that unsanitary equipment or practises during pregnancy or birth introduced the bacteria to the mother and baby, such as unsterile forceps being used or staff failing to change their gloves or wash their hands between patients. The babies may also be catching the bacteria from the hospital surroundings or from doctors, nurses or families who visit.After carrying out the groundbreaking study, Dr Chaurasia and his team hope to come up with solutions: alternatives to antibiotics that could be used on newborns, old antibiotics that could be repurposed, and if so, the dose that could be used. Currently there is no quick was of diagnosing sepsis – sending a blood culture to a lab takes at least three days and a bacteria can’t always be grown. It is hoped a fast bedside test can be developed instead.Some believe India should concentrate on improving the cleanliness of its hospitals. “Unless India improves sanitation in communities and infection control in hospitals we won’t be able to tackle antibiotic resistance at all,” said Dr Abdul Ghafur, a professor in infectious diseases and co-ordinator of the 2012 Chennai Declaration, a roadmap for combating antibiotic resistance in India.Many are already working to improve infection control. The international NGO Jhpiego is working to lower rates of maternal and baby mortality by encouraging good menstrual hygiene, good birthing practices and appropriate antibiotic prescription in Indian hospitals, communities and families.It can be difficult to instil these behaviour changes, said Dr Kailash Saran, head of Jhpiego Rajasthan. “We faced a lot of resistance from staff,” he said. “They assume the hygiene is poor so they give antibiotics.Yet slowly, with mentorship and repetition, behaviours are beginning to change. “If you start explaining why you are doing certain things, people are more likely to follow,” said Dr Bulbul Sood, country director of Jhpiego India.Two days after being given Polymyxin B, baby Manu seemed to respond. She was well enough to come off oxygen and be moved to a different ICU where her mother could visit and feed her breast milk using a tube. The family are now waiting, hoping she will fully recover.Madlen Davies is a reporter with the Bureau of Investigative JournalismNewsletter promotion - global health security - end of articleProtect

coastal town has resulted in a council blocking a new cafe from opening in a store left empty for a year.Christchurch in Dorset had 14 coffee shops within a 500-metre stretch on its High Street - an average of one every 35 metres - before an application was submitted by chain company Coffee#1 to turn a former a shoe shop into an outlet. Christchurch Borough Council voted to refuse permission for the plans, which would have created eight jobs, following objections from rival cafe owners and local residents, who complained there were too many coffee shops.Among the establishments already on the High Street are chains like Caffe Nero and Costa, as well as independent businesses the Coffee Pot, Cuckoos coffee bar, Fleur-de-Lis tearooms, Arcado Lounge, Soho, The Boardroom, Wild and Free Coffee, Coast Coffee Co, Kelly\u0027s Kitchen, Baggies, Clay Studio and Indulge Yourself.The list does not include Greggs or Subway which also serve an array of coffees such as lattes and cappuccinos.Cafe owners said there was not enough business to go around as they objected to the planning applicationMike Ismail, owner of Baggies Cafe, said: There are 28 food outlets just in the core part of High Street and 14 of those are cafes or coffee shops.To have that many in a town centre of this size is a crazy situation.The increase in coffee shops and drop in footfall has been a gradual process over the last six years.When I first started in 2012 business was booming but it has become reality tough and is becoming a struggle year on year.The footfall has reduced hugely because there are too many of us.Chains including Caffe Nero are already established in the town centreHaving another coffee shop open would have taken maybe five customers away from each of the existing coffee shops.Councillors at Christchurch Borough Council said that while the vacant premises would have been put to use with new jobs created, it would probably have caused other cafes to close.Peter Hall, a town centre councillor who objected to the application, said: The applicants said they were going to employ eight people, but allowing the plans could have meant eight jobs were lost elsewhere.There was quite strong feeling from local cafe owners and residents that enough is enough.There are quite a few empty shops but another coffee shop won\u0027t solve that.Councillors feared jobs could be lost at existing businesses if another cafe was allowed to openMr Hall added that planning guidelines state the town centre shouldn\u0027t have more than 30 per cent of its shops as food outlets. Christchurch currently has 40 per cent.Mother and daughter Jacqueline and Meghan Francis, who run Coast Coffee Co, said despite their business appearing successful, they struggled to pay the bills which includes £2,500 a month in rent and £1,360 a month in business rates.In their written objection to the recent planning application they said: Far from bringing more jobs to the town, another coffee shop will be the final nail in the coffin for existing shops struggling to survive.Coast is an extremely busy and outwardly successful business. In reality we barely manage to pay our bills.A reduction of say, 10 per cent of customers, will probably be the end of us.Christchurch has the highest population of elderly people in Britain, with 30 per cent of its 46,000 residents aged over 65.Comment:  It\u0026#39s time for us Leavers to grow up and accept that Mrs May\u0026#39s deal is as good as it getsBrexit deal latest news: Eurosceptics

President Mike Pence expressed the Trump administration\u0027s strongest condemnation yet of Myanmar\u0027s treatment of Rohingya Muslims on Wednesday, telling leader Aung San Suu Kyi that persecution by her country\u0027s army was without excuse.Pence also pressed Suu Kyi to pardon two Reuters journalists who were arrested nearly a year ago and sentenced in September to seven years in prison for breaching the Official Secrets Act.The violence and persecution by military and vigilantes that resulted in driving 700,000 Rohingya to Bangladesh is without excuse, Pence told Suu Kyi in remarks open to the media before they went into private talks on the sidelines of an Asia-Pacific summit in Singapore.I am anxious to hear the progress that you are making of holding those accountable who are responsible for the violence that displaced so many hundreds of thousands and created such suffering, including the loss of life, he added.Suu Kyi, seated next to Pence, was stony-faced as he spokeLeaders of Southeast Asian nations, who will meet Pence on Thursday, are also expected to call for those responsible for atrocities in Rakhine state to be held fully accountable, according to a statement the Asian countries prepared for a summit, reflecting a stronger line being taken within the group.Suu Kyi, seated next to Pence, was stony-faced as he spoke.Rohingya Muslim refugees wait for food aid at Thankhali refugee camp in Bangladesh\u0026#39s Ukhia districtThe Myanmar army launched a sweeping offensive in the north of Rakhine state in late August last year, in response to Rohingya militant attacks.Myanmar denies persecuting members of the Muslim minority, saying its forces have carried out legitimate counterinsurgency operations.Suu Kyi, responding to Pence, said: Of course people have different points of view but the point is that you should exchange these views and try to understand each other better.In a way we can say that we understand our country better than any other country does and I\u0027m sure you will say the same of yours, that you understand your country better than anybody else, she added.The United States has accused the military of ethnic cleansing against the Rohingya, who are widely reviled in Buddhist-majority Myanmar.UN-mandated investigators have accused the military of unleashing a campaign of killings, rape and arson with genocidal intent.Amnesty International this week withdrew its most prestigious human rights prize from Suu Kyi, accusing her of perpetuating human rights abuses by not speaking out about violence against the Rohingya.Once hailed as a champion in the fight for democracy, the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize winner has been stripped of a series of international honours over the Rohingya exodus.Neither Suu Kyi nor her office have commented publicly about the decision by Amnesty International.Myanmar government spokesman Zaw Htay did not answer calls seeking comment on Pence\u0027s comments on Wednesday.Pence also said that Washington wanted to see a free and democratic press in Myanmar, commenting: In America, we believe in our democratic institutions and ideals, including a free and independent press, Pence said.White House officials told reporters after their closed-door talks that he had pressed her multiple times to pardon the two convicted Reuters journalists.They had a very candid exchange of views on that, a senior White House official said. He declined to elaborate.Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo, the Reuters journalists, both Myanmar nationals, were arrested in the city of Yangon last December. On Nov 5, their lawyers lodged an appeal against their conviction.At the time of their arrest in December, they were working on a Reuters investigation into the killing of 10 Rohingya Muslim villagers during an army crackdown in Rakhine state. Reuters published its investigation into the massacre on Feb. 8.Suu Kyi has said that the jailing of the Reuters reporters had nothing to do with freedom of expression and that they were convicted, not because they were journalists, but because they had broken the official secrets law. Please review our commenting policyComment:  It\u0026#39s time for us Leavers to grow up and accept that Mrs

lanka power vacuum new prime minister voted","story":"Buddhist monks hold candles as they take part in a peaceful protest and demand respect for the country\u0026#39s democracy Sri Lanka\u0027s parliament on Wednesday voted out the bitterly disputed government of former strongman Mahinda Rajapakse, removing one controversial figure but leaving the country in a power vacuum.The island nation has been in crisis since the president sacked prime minister Ranil Wickremesinghe on October 26 and replaced him with Mr Rajapakse, who served as president until being voted out three years ago.On Tuesday the Supreme Court overruled the president\u0027s dissolution of parliament and halted preparations for a snap election, in a major boost for the ousted prime minister.In stormy scenes Wednesday, legislators gave their verdict on the two rivals - with a majority in the 225-member assembly supporting a no-confidence motion against Mr Rajapakse.Parliament also passed motions declaring illegal the November 9 proclamations made by Maithripala Sirisena, the president, to enshrine the power shift.The result however does not automatically mean that Mr Wickremesinghe, who has refused to leave the prime minister\u0027s residence, has won the constitutional showdown.Day-to-day administration remains paralysed as the crisis drags on and there are growing fears for the economy and Sri Lanka\u0027s ability to repay its huge foreign debts.The government of acting Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa has been voted outThough Mr Wickremesinghe\u0027s United National Party is the biggest in parliament, Mr Sirisena retains the power to choose the next prime minister.The UNP leader, who left his bunker at the Temple Trees official residence for the first time in nearly three weeks to go to parliament, still hailed the vote.This is a victory for the people, Mr Wickremesinghe told reporters, condemning the president\u0027s actions as illegal.He said officials should no longer take orders from the Mr Rajapakse-led purported government.The UNP said that Sirisena must now call on Mr Wickremesinghe to form a new government. UNP deputy leader Sajith Premadasa said: For me, he is still the prime minister. Today, democracy prevailed.In a chaotic session, 72-year-old Mr Rajapakse and his legislator son Namal walked out of the red-carpeted chamber just before the speaker Karu Jayasuriya called for a vote.Lawmakers loyal to Rajapakse attempted to grab the mace, the assembly\u0027s symbol of authority, to disrupt the vote, but the speaker pressed ahead.The ayes have it, the speaker announced. I rule that this House does not have confidence in the government (of Mr Rajapakse).Several of Mr Rajapakse\u0027s ministers came out of parliament accusing the speaker of violating parliamentary norms by holding the crucial vote.He has no bloody business calling a vote, Leader of the House Dinesh Gunawardena told reporters.However, shortly after the collapse of Mr Rajapakse\u0027s administration, one of his ministers, Wasantha Senanayake switched to Mr Wickremesinghe\u0027s side. Three other MPs from Mr Rajapakse\u0027s side defected to the UNP just before the vote.Mr Sirisena sacked the legislature on Friday shortly after an admission that Mr Rajapakse did not have a majority in the assembly.Mr Sirisena ordered a snap election on January 5, a move even the independent Elections Commission announced was unconstitutional and illegal.A dozen petitions were filed in the Supreme Court which on Tuesday restored parliament and suspended the January 5 vote.Parliament held its first session following the court ruling under tight security.Thousands of armed police deployed along the key approach roads to parliament, which is located on a man-made lake island, with several anti-riot units on stand by.Parliament officials had feared that supporters of Mr Rajapakse\u0027s party might try to stop legislators getting to parliament, but those concerns proved unfounded.Please review our commenting policyComment:  It\u0026#39s time for us Leavers to grow up and accept that Mrs May\u0026#39s deal is as good as it getsBrexit deal latest news: Eurosceptics warn Theresa May her agreement will lose her support of Tory MPs and \u0026#39millions of voters\u0026#39White House to consider China sanctions bill in response to human rights violationsFight against meningitis lags behind other preventable diseasesCouncil decides to block new cafe from opening in empty shop because it has too many coffee shopsCervical cancer screening letter blunder saw nearly 50,000 women miss results and screening remindersTheresa May must come clean: her Brexit deal is a dog\u0026#39s breakfast (but is still the best thing on a desultory menu)\u0026#39Vigilante\u0026#39 neighbourhood watch group forms in Birmingham after failed bid for more police on streetsIsrael government in turmoil as defence minister quits and calls for elections over Gaza ceasefireNine more migrants arrested after second Channel crossing in two daysComment: Brussels\u0026#39 gloating gives Brexiteers every reason to be wary of Mrs May\u0026#39s dealJapanese government grants nation one-off ten-day holiday for royal transitionBrexit timetable: Mapping the three paths to independence from the EUInside the private world of Prince Charles: What\u0026#39s life really like for our future king? Making lessons fun does not help children to learn, new report findsThe warring factions Theresa May must pacify to get her Brexit deal through parliamentWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/11/13/TELEMMGLPICT000162445715_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqqVzuuqpFlyLIwiB6NTmJwRMWbYwzrg_3PLcMwCu9G8U.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"subtitles theatre deaf wouldnt want inflict everyone else","story":"The Troth at the Southbank Centre earlier this year featured subtitles As someone who was born deaf and is the daughter of an actress, it might be natural to assume that I would be the first cheerleader for the charity Stagetext’s campaign to make arts events more accessible to the hearing-impaired by offering subtitles for theatre performances.

By mid-December, one bitcoin was worth close to $20,000 (£15,000), but that was the high water mark before the tide turned.A year later, bitcoin is trading at around a third of its peak value but some cryptocurrency analysts believe the market might be on the verge of mirroring the gains it experienced in late 2017. The only caveat is that it might not be bitcoin that leads the charge this time.Overstock CEO Patrick Byrne, who was behind the online retail giant becoming\u0026nbspone of the first places to accept bitcoin back in 2014, said\u0026nbspthat he still expects\u0026nbspthe mass adoption of cryptocurrency, without specifying\u0026nbspwhich one.Speaking to bitcoin enthusiast Naomi Brockwell on her YouTube channel, Mr Byrne said he remained highly sceptical of the traditional financial system. When asked if he saw bitcoin becoming a worldwide currency, he pointed to countries like Venezuela that have experienced significant financial turmoil in recent years.When people start getting into it is when their own financial systems collapse, he said. Whether bitcoin is the one, whether bitcoin has solved its speed problem, or it\u0027s another cryptocurrency, only time will tell.Created with Sketch.Bitcoin\u0027s volatile history in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.18 Satoshi Nakamoto creates the first bitcoin block in 2009On 3 January, 2009, the genesis block of bitcoin appeared.

This represented a 1,300 per cent increase from its price at the start of the yearBitcoin has enjoyed the most sustained period of stability in its history, helping it address the issue of price volatility that some critics say makes it unsuitable as a form of mainstream payment.\u0026nbspGeneral consensus among market analysts is that this trend is likely to continue in the short term, barring any major news that could send the price shooting in either direction, such as a large-scale hack on a leading exchange, or positive regulation implemented by a financial body.Bitcoin price predictions made by 10 analysts for November\u0027s Finder\u0026nbspCryptocurrency Predictions Survey suggest that the world\u0027s leading digital currency will experience steady growth over the next year, though the upcoming months remain uncertain.Bitcoin wallet give away $125m of cryptocurrency to help growth“Some of our panellists believe external forces could shift the market greatly over the next month, and particularly for bitcoin, Jon Ostler, CEO of Finder, told\u0026nbspThe Independent.\u0026nbspThe upcoming decisions on a Bitcoin Exchange Traded Fund being approved or not by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the US Commodities and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) deciding whether to accept the application by ICE backed cryptocurrency exchange, Bakkt, are expected before 1 December. So at this stage, it’s difficult to predict exactly what will happen.Looking longer term, Mr Ostler said bitcoin is expected to experience steady growth over the next year, with the panel of experts predicting an average\u0026nbspvalue of $16,732 by the end of 2019. “With bitcoin being very stable and within a range between $6,800 and $6,100, it is hard to suggest anything will change until it breaks this range, said cryptocurrency trader Craig Cobb, who forms part of the panel.leveled out in recent months (CoinMarketCap)But if it\u0027s not bitcoin, a\u0026nbsphint at what this next break-out cryptocurrency might be was given earlier this week by Blockchain, the world\u0027s most popular bitcoin wallet.

Nomos was established in Glashütte in 1990 by Roland\u0026nbspSchwertner, a fashion photographer and computer scientist from West Germany, and now employs 300 people from 20 nations.Italy far-right government offers land to parents who have third childFar-right parties overtake Macron for first time in France pollMI5 agents to take lead in fight against far-right extremism“Glashütte as we know it today would simply not have been possible without the reunification of Germany, and without the freedom and democracy that brought,” says Uwe Ahrendt, chief executive. “Furthermore, we have employees that need our protection those that the far right would claim \u0027don’t belong here\u0027. But we know that they do.”Ahrendt became the chief executive of\u0026nbspNomos in 2000. The company was shocked to discover\u0026nbspthat in the 2017 federal elections, over a third of Glashütte residents had voted for the far right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party.\u0026nbspSince spring 2018, Nomos has worked with Open Saxony, a Government-funded programme, to provide free workshops and training to its employees where they\u0026nbspcheck the accuracy of right-wing views and provide emotional support to staff. Ahrendt says: “We realised that we need to position ourselves clearly and publicly in support of our democratic political system.”Glashütte in East Germany is known as mini-Switzerland for its thriving watchmaking industry (Courtesy Photo)German businesses have another good reason embrace ersity: the country will be short of 3 million workers by 2020, according to a 2017 report by Prognos, an economic research institute, worsening to a shortage of 3.3 million by 2040 as the native population ages.\u0026nbspSkilled migrants are being seen as a way to plug the gaps. A new immigration law, introduced on October 2, aims to attract more workers from countries outside the EU. Steffen Kampeter, chief executive of the Confederation of German Employers\u0027 Associations has said Germany’s international competitiveness depends upon “qualified workers from abroad”.The state is funding efforts to improve ersity in German businesses who may not have considered hiring migrants in the past. At a recent meeting organised by Netzwerk Courage, a network that promotes democracy, business leaders, trade union representatives and groups working with migrants came together to discuss how they can improve ersity in East German businesses.Petra Köpping, the minister for integration in Saxony, said that for years, East Germany has not worked towards making the workforce more erse. Over time, it has fallen behind. Now it needs to work even harder to catch up. Petra Köpping herself employs 45 staff – 18 of which come from overseas.Marlis Straessner-Lacroix\u0026nbspis from the organisation Willkommon in Lobtau, which has been helping asylum seekers in the Lobtau district of Dresden since 2014. She said that in many cases, businesses show a lack of interest in employing migrants, even when approached by organisations who have the resources to help.Nomos employs 300 people from 20 nations (Courtesy Photo)Glashütte is not your average East German town. It exports tens of thousands of luxury watches every year from 10 high-end watchmakers, some of which sell timepieces for millions of pounds. The industry started in the mid-1800s, when Ferdinand Adolph Lange enlisted financial support from local nobility to start manufacturing watches as means to employ impoverished local people.Like all East Germany industries, Glashütte\u0027s watch factories were taken over by\u0026nbspthe Soviet-supported East German state after the Second World War. When this regime collapsed, many workers fled to the West. Whole towns were hollowed out. Glashütte was revived in part by incomers like Walter Lange, the great-grandson of Ferdinand, who returned from the West to revive old brands alongside new ones, like Nomos.Many other East German towns never experienced the same renaissance. Even today, East Germans are still paid less than West Germans and work longer hours. The average annual gross wage in the former East German states is €30,172, almost €5,000 less than in states in the former West Germany, according to official data provided to\u0026nbspthe socialist Left party.For some, a sense of injustice has hardened into a fear of the outsider since Chancellor Angela Merkel welcomed migrants to Germany in 2015. Ahrendt says far-right riots in the nearby town of Chemnitz\u0026nbspin August\u0026nbsphave\u0026nbspmade the company’s efforts to promote democracy seem even more essential: “We wanted to set a precedent, because an intolerant, racist atmosphere will not be permitted at Nomos\u0026nbspGlashütte.”Some businesses and organisations have reported that since the AfD has gained more support in elections, the number of applicants from overseas has decreased. Dr Michael Genkin, the leader of a visitors programme that welcomes international scientists to the Max Planck research institute in Dresden, says that after 2015, Saxony became less attractive for workers of all kinds. “We indeed had the impression of a decreasing number of applicants at our institute around the time of those political developments in Saxony, and in Dresden specifically,” he says, noting that the number of applicants was too small to draw a statistical conclusion.Ahrendt says events in Chemnitz and elsewhere have shown the world a darker side to German politics that it is up to responsible businesses to counter.“My company is concerned about this image,” he says. “We want to show that there is a brighter side to Germany, especially in Saxony. When you are close by, Chemnitz is just a little place in Germany but when you are far away, it represents all of Germany.”10 best watches for menThe workshops at Nomos are booked out until the end of the year. “That is great news, especially since they are voluntary and take place within work hours,” Ahrendt says. “From our point of view, everyone should work to protect freedom and democracy—and perhaps even more so in Saxony, since it was something that we fought for in 1989.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

But if a ‘no deal’ Brexit is avoided, a further fall-back in inflation and a rise in nominal wage growth should spur a sustained consumer recovery next year.”“We still think that CPI inflation will return to the 2 per cent\u0026nbsptarget in Q1 and will average just 1.8 per cent\u0026nbspin 2019,” said Samuel Tombs of Pantheon.Separately, the ONS reported\u0026nbspon Wednesday that annual factory gate prices rose 3.3 per cent in the month, up from 3.1 per cent in September and coming in ahead of City estimates.It also estimated\u0026nbspthat average UK house price growth\u0026nbsppicked up to 3.5 per cent year-on-year in September, up from 3.1 per cent in August.Prices fell 0.3 per cent in London over the period.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

They have created a high-ranking committee to examine all the risks, including those raised by the IMF and the US Treasury, and those discussed during the public hearings on the legislation.The issues laid out by the IMF include reputational\u0026nbsprisks and a danger of losing its correspondent banking relationship (CBR) with the US dollar.Given these sorts of issues, the authorities expect it will take a few years to issue the cryptocurrency, the IMF report concluded.Moreover, they will only issue the SOV\u0026nbsponce its use complies with the FATF\u0026nbsp(Financial Action Task Force) standard and US regulation, and once its use in transactions in the US financial system has been approved by the US government.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

At this biennial event, the participating companies exhibit their latest service robotic technologies and componentsThe robot developed by Seed Solutions sings and dances to music during the Japan Robot Week 2016 at Tokyo Big SightThe traffic misdirection, known as a border gateway protocol (BGP) hijacking, lasted for around an hour and a half on Monday evening, ending at around 10.30pm GMT.ThousandEyes\u0026nbspexecutive Alex Henthorn-Iwane\u0026nbspsaid it was the worst incident affecting Google traffic that his firm had ever seen. He also speculated that the hijacking may have been the result of a war-game experiment.The incident\u0026nbspwas particularly suspicious because internet\u0026nbsptraffic was being sent to the Chinese government’s\u0026nbspinternet\u0026nbspprovider, China Telecom, which has previously been accused of improperly\u0026nbsprouting\u0026nbsptraffic through China.A report\u0026nbspearlier this year by researchers at the US Naval War College and Tel Aviv University found\u0026nbspChina\u0026nbspTelecom has\u0026nbspbeen hijacking internet\u0026nbsptraffic passing through the US and Canada on a regular basis.Conveniently, China Telecom has ten strategically placed, Chinese controlled internet ‘points of presence’4 (PoPs) across the internet backbone of North America, the report\u0026nbspstated.\u0026nbspVast rewards can be reaped from the hijacking, erting, and then copying of information-rich traffic going into or crossing the United States and Canada – often unnoticed and then delivered with only small delays.A Google spokesperson told The Independent: “We’re aware that a portion of internet traffic was affected by incorrect routing of IP addresses, and access to some Google services was impacted. The root cause of the issue was external to Google and there was no compromise of Google services.”In an update to its Google Cloud Status Dashboard, Google said it was conducting an internal investigation in the hope of\u0026nbspmaking\u0026nbspappropriate improvements to help prevent a future recurrence of the issue.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

This requires the customs union as the basis of the future relationship,” deputy chief negotiator Sabine Weyand said, according to the note seen by The Times newspaper.May calls in ministers to approve deal reached by UK negotiators“They must align their rules but the EU will retain all the controls. They apply the same rules. UK wants a lot more from future relationship, so EU retains its leverage.”\u0026nbspThe binding clauses would mean the UK would be tied to EU rules on workers’ rights, environmental protections, and state aid while the so-called backstop applies – which everyone in Brussels believes it will for quite some time.The provisions are enraging some Tory Brexiteers, who see Britain’s departure from the EU as an opportunity to strip out what they see as excessive regulations and rights for workers.“She hasn’t so much struck a deal as surrendered to Brussels and given in to everything they want and tried to frustrate Brexit that it’s not so much a vassal state anymore as a slave state,” unofficial rebellion leader Jacob Rees-Mogg said, articulating the views of many of Ms May’s MPs.Government forced to publish secret Brexit legal adviceUK travellers will not need visas to visit the EU in no-deal BrexitRemainers also rounded on the leak. Dominic Grieve QC, a Tory MP and the former attorney general, said: “Speaking in private Sabine Weyand has been brutally honest about what the Prime Minister’s deal will really mean.”He added: “I could not look my constituents in the eye and say this would be a better deal than the one we have as a member of the EU and so I will vote against it and instead I will vote to hand the final decision back to the public. A choice between this miserable Brexit and no deal is no choice at all. The British public deserve a real choice between leaving the EU on these terms or sticking with the deal we’ve got inside the EU.”But speaking on Wednesday morning Theresa May loyalist William Hague urged Tories to ignore the “leak overnight from somebody you have never heard of before” and to back the plan, arguing that Brexit could be thwarted if it was ditched.The leaked written account of the meeting seen by the newspaper also suggests\u0026nbspthat Britain “would have to swallow a link between access to products and fisheries in future agreements” for the future relationship. The claim is political dynamite because some Brexiteers want the UK to be able to exclude EU fishing boats from British waters after the country leaves.We will not comment on the various press reports over the past 24 hours.Cabinet ministers are being strong-armed to support the deal, with some deemed “key” to its approval call in for one-on-one meetings with the Prime Minister ahead of a moment-of-truth meeting on Wednesday.The final text of the draft withdrawal agreement has not been made public, meaning ministers must either decode the vast legal agreement themselves or rely on Downing Street’s interpretation of it.EU ambassadors will meet simultaneously in Brussels this afternoon to examine\u0026nbspthe agreement, and be briefed by EU officials\u0026nbsp– though the full sign-off process from member states is expected to take longer.\u0026nbsp“It’s going to be a thorough information on the state of play,” a spokesperson for the European Commission said.Even if the Prime Minister can secure the support of her own cabinet it looks increasingly unlikely that she will be able to get the plan through the House of Commons, with opposition from Labour, Tory eurosceptics, and the DUP now looking more certain than ever.Created with Sketch.Brexit threatens life on the Irish border: in pictures Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.John Murphy flies the European flag outside his home near the border village of Forkhill, Co ArmaghAn abandoned shop is seen in Mullan, Co Monaghan.

A third of those who replied were undecided.\u0026nbspThe majority (63.3 per cent) backed a second referendum when asked how the government could give people a say on the terms of Britain’s exit from the bloc, while 10.9 per cent suggested a public consultation.About 10 per cent said they trust the government to do a good job, and 7.4 per cent said the UK should just leave the EU.Kajal Odedra, executive director of change.org UK, said people feel “bombarded but gagged by Brexit”, regardless of whether they voted to leave or remain in the European Union.EU to decide whether Brits will need visas in event of no-deal BrexitVoters in most vulnerable Tory seats \u0027back fresh Brexit vote\u0027Every day takes us closer to giving the people the final say on BrexitThornberry says Labour could still back Final Say Brexit referendumCorbyn rejects calls for Final Say referendum, despite Labour backlashJohnson insists May can be forced into Final Say referendum on BrexitWriting exclusively for The Independent, Ms Odedra said: “The choices the government makes in negotiations are critical.\u0026nbsp“But they are being made far away from the public with no consultation whatsoever.\u0026nbsp“When we asked change.org users, only 7 per cent of those polled felt they have been given a chance for their voices to be heard since the referendum.“And 85 per cent felt they didn’t have any say in shaping the government’s Brexit strategy.”Leave voters were more likely to feel heard by ministers at about 23 per cent, while only 1.4 per cent of Remain voters said they had been listened to, according to the poll.Young people were also more likely to feel ignored than older voters, the findings show, with just 8.3 per cent of 16 to 24-year-olds reporting that they believe their voices are being heard.Around a quarter of over-65s said they felt listened to, compared to 20 per cent of those aged 55 to 64, and 10.5 per cent of 25 to 34-year-olds.It comes after a special parliamentary event heard that\u0026nbspmore people back a fresh referendum than oppose one in all of the 67 most marginal Tory seats.The YouGov survey of 25,000 people\u0026nbspalso found that a majority of voters in the Labour constituencies that voted Leave in 2016 now back a fresh referendum, by an average of 59 per cent in favour compared to 41 per cent against.It also comes as more than 3,000 people were expected to attend a major rally in London to urge\u0026nbspMPs\u0026nbspto reject a bad Brexit deal.Cross-party MPs have backed the call,\u0026nbspincluding Tory Jo Johnson, who resigned from government last week over Theresa May’s Brexit strategy, Labour’s David Lammy and SNP\u0026nbspWestminster leader Ian Blackford.Liberal Democrat MP\u0026nbspLayla Moran, who backs the Best for Britain campaign,\u0026nbspsaid: “No one voted for this pathetic little deal which actually hands over our sovereignty, making the UK a rule taker rather than a rule maker. It is the opposite of taking back control.”Caroline Lucas, former Green party co-leader,\u0026nbspadded: “The only solution is to take the final decision out of the hands of deadlocked politicians, away from the backroom deals, and give it back to the public with a People’s Vote.“On Brexit, it’s clear we have a parliament in stalemate that can’t deliver a clear choice for the future. So it’s time to let the British public do it instead.”The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

But if a ‘no deal’ Brexit is avoided, a further fall-back in inflation and a rise in nominal wage growth should spur a sustained consumer recovery next year.”“We still think that CPI inflation will return to the 2 per cent\u0026nbsptarget in Q1 and will average just 1.8 per cent\u0026nbspin 2019,” said Samuel Tombs of Pantheon.Separately, the ONS reported\u0026nbspon Wednesday that annual factory gate prices rose 3.3 per cent in the month, up from 3.1 per cent in September and coming in ahead of City estimates.It also estimated\u0026nbspthat average UK house price growth\u0026nbsppicked up to 3.5 per cent year-on-year in September, up from 3.1 per cent in August.Prices fell 0.3 per cent in London over the period.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Europe and its security.”The suggestion angered Mr Trump, who sent a series of hostile tweets about the comments.On Tuesday the US president tweeted: “Emmanuel Macron suggests building its own army to protect Europe against the US, China and Russia. But it was Germany in World Wars One \u0026amp Two – How did that work out for France? They were starting to learn German in Paris before the US came along. Pay for Nato or not!”The election of Mr Trump to the White House appears to have given more urgency to the cause of boosting the EU’s defence capabilities, with leaders warning they cannot simply rely on the United States.Commission president Mr Juncker said last year that “deference to Nato can no longer be used as a convenient alibi to argue against greater European efforts”.In 2016, then defence secretary Sir Michael Fallon said the UK would use its veto to stop the creation of any EU army. However, the UK is leaving the EU, and will therefore no longer have any say in its governance.Created with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Palestinians gather in front of damaged buildings in Gaza City following Israeli air strikes targeting the area overnight.

What is the Brexit backstop? Has Northern Ireland been split from UK?                 Brexit deal TODAY: What time will Cabinet meet TODAY?Does this mean the European Court of Justice will have influence in Britain?Ultimately, the ECJ will be the final arbiter on issues involving EU law that may arise from the Irish backstop agreement.Geoffrey Cox, the Attorney General, has discussed a \u0026ldquojoint arbitration panel to break any future impasse during review negotiations surrounding the backstop.But EU officials believe such panels are not allowed to settle political disputes of this nature.Questions of interpreting EU law can only be settled by the ECJ, which will leave the Luxembourg-based courts with an important role to play in the UK\u0026rsquos exit from the backstop.Could the backstop become the future trading deal?Michel Barnier\u0026rsquos deputy Sabine Weyand told EU27 ambassadors last Friday that the UK-wide customs arrangement would become the \u0026ldquobasis of the future relationship.She said: \u0026ldquoWe should be in the best negotiation position for the future relationship.\u0026ldquoThis requires the customs union as the basis of the future relationship.\u0026ldquoThey must align their rules but the EU will retain all controls. They apply the same rules.\u0026ldquoThe UK wants a lot more from the future relationship, so EU retains its leverage.Obviously this is still all to play for, but Brussels feels like it is in a strong negotiating position moving forward.

including Jungle Queen Georgia Toffolo, who called him a sex god.Devout Catholic Rees-Mogg has made no secret of his socially conservative views, including being anti-abortion and against gay marriage.His plummy tones, double-breasted suits and traditional manner have earned him the nickname The Honourable Member for the Nineteenth Century.The environment secretary has achieved a remarkable turnaround since kning Boris Johnson during the  leadership contest.His support among party members dropped through the floor and it seemed his chances were gone for ever.But Mr Gove, who led the Leave campaign in the EU referendum, has rebranded himself as an ecowarrior as Environment Secretary.He has also thrown his full support behind Theresa Mays Brexit plan, winning him friends among MPsnot the party faithful.Though an unlikely candidate at the time, the Brexit campaigner reached the final two of the  leadership contest.She withdrew over ill-judged remarks about Theresa May not being a mother.She is now Leader of the House, and survived in post despite reports Mrs May was planning to cut dead wood in her January reshuffle.Mrs Leadsom had a role in the downfall of Sir Michael Fallon after she accused him of lewd sexual comments.The popular and savvy leader of the Scottish Conservatives has been touted as the potential saviour of the Tories in Westminster.But Ruth has said repeatedly she wants to focus on Scotland and as she is not an MP she currently is not eligible to stand as leader of the UK party.In September  she declared she never wants to be Prime Minister.She will also be putting politics on the back burner for a while as she has just had a baby. Mrs May was humiliated when her snap election backfired in , costing the party its Commons majority.Critics in her own party are circling over her handling of Brexit, with rumours more than  MPs have sent letters of no confidence.She could be forced out MPs demand her exit and she loses a subsequent vote.There would then be a Tory leadership campaign, with the winner crowned PM.Alternatively, Mrs May could lose a vote of confidence in the Commons, leading to her government falling.In theory, the Queen could ask the Labour leader to form a minority government, but the numbers in the Commons would make it impossible for him to govern.There could well be a fresh General Election with both major parties trying to secure a parliamentary majority."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/NINTCHDBPICT000267876768.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"cops are led by donkeys sun says","story":"Don’t get us wrong.

And what a mother.They say no one is irreplaceable but I think she is — which must be such a lot of pressure for him. In short, he has spent his entire le waiting for his mum to die before he can start his dream job.And in the meantime his le, in some ways, is on hold. He was not allowed to marry the woman he loved and was instead forced into a loveless marriage.And every time he so much as expresses an opinion about anything, he is denounced as being “meddling”.So it’s no wonder that in Prince, Son And Heir, the BBC documentary this week marking his th birthday, Charles was quick to quell concerns that he would be a “meddling” or activist king, saying: “I’m not that stupid.”Declaring the role of sovereign and heir to be dferent, he said he is aware of the constraints he will encounter as king, and says his behaviour will change.I can see why he is saying that, given the amount of criticism that has come his way over the years. But when you think that he was campaigning about issues such as the environment and single-use plastic long before anyone  got on the bandwagon, it might be better to see him as a trailblazer than a meddler.I admire that he has a voice.And when he is king I think he should use it — not be silenced by the pressure of the role.He has a very broad range of knowledge and he is absolutely passionate. We live in a society where everyone has their say — so why shouldn’t he In fact, I thinkhe visited Europe he might help with Brexit.There is no doubt the Queen is a hard act to follow — when the time comes, that is. Now Charles is  he is the longest serving heir to the throne in history. And he may have years to go, as the Queen looks and sounds fantastic .But we should stop maligning Charles and start supporting him.He is a good man and there is no doubt he is dedicated to the job. He is mature enough to know how to do the job well and he certainly knows what is expected of him.He has brought up two fantastic sons that any parent would be proud of.And he really is passionate about changing the world for the better.It has been more than  years since he set up his Prince’s Trust charity.Last year alone it helped nearly , young people get into education, training and jobs. It is simply fantastic.He is deeply committed to his fantastic we, who is very down-to-earth and great fun .He is also passionate about promoting women’s issues, so whatever you think of him you must give him credit for that.I believe very strongly in the monarchy. I would do anything the Queen asked me to do.The Royal Family are a great thing for our country and something to be very proud of.In a world of increasing uncertainty, they are this country’s rock and foundation. We should all get behind Charles and celebrate him as our future king.Apart from anything , we need all the stability we can get. ANYONE living in London will be unsurprised to hear that there are now a record number of people sleeping rough there.Figures show there were , rough sleepers in the capital between July and September – the first time the total has exceeded , in a three-month period.It’s awful and it’s shocking to see people sitting in the cold begging for money.And it’s hard to know how to help. Of course, the temptation is to give money but obviously that’s just a short-term fix.Night shelters are a good short-term solution. Buthomeless people don’t get involved with a network that can really help them, it’s unlikely their circumstances will ever change.My husband Paul volunteers with the fantastic charity West London Mission . It offers homeless people a hot shower, new clothes, a meal and a decent night’s sleep.But it also offers access to project workers who will help people change their circumstances.Its aim is to empower and help homeless people become part of a community, because that’s the start of them getting off the streets, into accommodation, then into work.There are so many reasons that people become homeless. Some have lost their job and can’t afford rent, or they’ve fallen out with family and turn to drink and drugs.They might have mental or physical health problems, a history of abuse or a dficult childhood moving between foster homes.But where there is le, there is hope. Paul has been working with one guy who was homeless and hopelessly addicted to drugs.But, over time, he has got clean, found a place to live and, last week, got a job at a restaurant, which is what he was doing before he got involved in drugs.He’s got his le back, basically. It does happen.Soyou are worried about homelessness, think about donating to an organisation such as WLM. Better yet, volunteer your time and skills.Even just helping someone to fill out a form, which can be incredibly dficult for some people, can make a huge dference and is so rewarding.TODAY is Remembrance Day and I wear my poppy with pride. This year I will particularly recognise all the true heroes from World War One. I thank them for their service, and remember we are always in their debt.It is so important we never forget the sacrice they made and the bravery they showed.I doubt there will ever be another generation like them. AS a rule, I like to live and let live. But I really had to roll my eyes at the story of -year-old Dutch pensioner Emile Ratelband, “who identies as a -year-old” and is fighting to legally change his age by  years so he can get more work and attract more women on Tinder.Emile, above, was born on March , , but says he feels at least  years younger and wants to change his birth date to March , .His argument is thattransgender people are allowed to change sex, he should be allowed to change his date of birth because doctors said he has the body of a -year-old.So does that meanI feel like a supermodel inside, I can I get my job title legally amended Or maybe at  I could identy as  so I can have access to my pension SO the six men arrested for burning an effigy of Grenfell Tower are in hiding and relying on friends and relatives to bring in food and drink. Still, they are yet to speak out – or apologise.What beggars belief is not just that these sick men thought that no one would notice nor care when this footage emerged on social media – but really that they are unhinged enough to do it in the first place.I’m pretty sure about one thing, though. No matter what consequences they will face for their actions from the law, they will never, ever live this down in the eyes of the world – and nor should they.I’m talking about Michael Douglas, . When he was awarded with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for more than  years in the entertainment industry, he gave his father, Kirk, a kiss on the lips to celebrate.In my experience there comes an age when your kids don’t want to kiss you – particularly on the lips and particularly your dad.It’s part and parcel of growing up that your kids don’t even want you to breathe, let alone kiss them.In fact, everything you do embarrasses them. But, given that Kirk Douglas is , maybe it’s just a reminder that things come full circle.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I sense, like the recently axed Big Brother and The X Factor, it’s been living off its reputation for a couple of years.Enjoyable as it’s been, the basic issue with this run has been the lack of a central figure in the mould of Syed Ahmed, Katie Hopkins or the late, great Stuart Baggs to take the series by the scruff of the neck.Some have shown vague promise but the closest thing it’s had to an alpha bell-end is Captain Pangea himself, Kurran Pooni, who was marked out less by his all-round uselessness than by the wrist he broke arm-wrestling back at the house, and his insistence he was “ per cent stepping up as project manager” just before he  per cent stepped down.There was no dodging the bullet, though, last week, when Lord Sugar demanded he PM a marketing campaign “for a noo airline” with accompanying adverts “and a noo unorm as well”.Kurran wasn’t underselling the sense of destiny he felt at this responsibility. “Everything in my le has led to this moment,” he claimed, presumably ’cos he hadn’t done anything  up until that moment.The great thing about this task, though — like all the best Apprentice episodes — was that the laughs were shared round equally.So while advert director Kurran was recreating the Club Tropicana video on Southend seafront, Camilla and Jackie were designing a stewardess’s unorm for the party-themed Jet Pop that wouldn’t see the light of day eveneasyJet suddenly opened a brothel chain in Amsterdam.A horrible thought occurred, though, as she was market-researching at Heathrow.She’s not going to wear that thing pitching to  industry experts at BA HQ, is she  She bloody is, you know.She gave it the full doors-to-manual flirtation as well. So everyone’s mind was already in the gutter before Jackie finished the audience off with the news: “It’s very easy to wipe down, as well.”In the normal course of events, reducing Claude Littner to a helpless giggling wreck would be enough to lose any task.The other team, though, Typhoon, had contrived to come up with something almost as bad, Manage Air, a business-targeted operation whose corporate logo looked like a satanic pentangle and theme tune was AC DC’s Highway To Hell.There was a genuine sense of tension in the boardroom then, which would’ve been ruinedSugar had played it all for laughs.He didn’t, though. He let the contestants hang themselves with their own words before firing Kurran, who could leave with a sense of “job done”.He’s created a bit of Apprentice folklore, after all, and hopefully reminded everyone this show is far from dead.Naturally, in the final taxi scene, he also remained convinced of his genius, boldly declaring: “My advert was gold.”The first and possibly last time in his le where he’s not just  per cent wrong, he’s  per cent right as well.Glorious television.Dianne: “Stephen Fry.”The Time It Takes, Joe Lycett: “Sesame Street’s Big Bird lives in what street ”Oliver: “I don’t know.”Joe Lycett: “A bird in the hand is worth two in the what ”Jon: “Foot.”And Bradley Walsh: “Which former EastEnders star presents the Sky One series Extreme World ”Zoe: “Barbara Windsor.”CELEBRITY Hunted contestant and former Commando Johnny Mercer MP has faced a stark choice this past month.The eternal humiliation of being beaten by Chris and Kem, off Love Island, on the Channel  hide ’n’ seek game.Or two weeks in a confined space with a clearly smitten Kay Burley.Heroically, he chose the latter, enduring her attention and pet namewith the same sort of grit that probably saw him through three tours of Afghanistan.Then, last week, he sneaked off for an unscheduled visit to his we, Felicity, and Burley completely lost her s***.Lost it so badly, in fact, that she threw herself at the mercy of a passing bread truck driver, which led to the best update of the series: “Kay Burley is currently in a -ton lorry, on the M, between junction  and .”She was quickly grassed up, of course, then apprehended at the Warburton’s depot, without the need for a vet or a tranquilliser dart.But while it’s a poorer show without the old mad-whack, there’s still plenty of mileage left in this gripping series.AJ Pritchard is cornered in Shropshire, Olympic silver medallist Louis Smith has just been found hiding in his mate’s Jacuzzi showroomand Baldrick-brained duo Chris  Kemhave somehow given everyone the slip.But as for Johnny Mercer  He’s probably smuggling himself back to the Mouth of Hell fort, in southern Helmand, just for the relative peace and quiet. Paul Merson: “For me it’s six and a half of one and a dozen of the other.”Graeme Souness: “The only one with potential is Martial and Pogba.”Dion Dublin: “Liverpool are in second and a half gear.”And Charlie Nicholas: “Pogba’s either brilliant or a showpony. He played OK last week.”THIS week’s Doctor Who episode introduced us to the Demons Of The Punjab, who turned out to be nothing of the sort.They were just morbid sods who mope around the universe “honouring those who die alone”, like soldiers, holy men and Brendan O’Carroll on For Facts Sakes.No actual science-fiction storyline to speak of then.But that’s not really the point of this viewer-shedding series, which has already got on its high horse about sexism, Donald Trump, American segregationist racism, men giving birth and gun control.Kind of inevitable, then, that the BBC would eventually pour a bucket of its self-loathing sick all over the British Empire, via the partition of India in , with an episode that was every bit as historically powerful as Carry On Up The Khyber.The key dference, of course, was that Bungdit Din and his Burpers weren’t actually being used as a means of brainwashing children.Because If you were expecting Doctor Who to present the flip side of Britain’s relatively benign rule in India , then you’ll also be waiting for the episode where Jodie Whittaker lands in a Soviet gulag and starts teaching children about the brutal idiocy of Marxism.The BBC just doesn’t do anything other than its own left-of-centre view, these days – or irony by the sounds of things.As it’s just been revealed there’ll be no festive episode of Doctor Whobecause it’s “run out” of storylines.Run out  RUN OUT How the hell can a series run out of ideas when it hasn’t had any yet This Morning, Thursday: “Coming up, at quarter to , the rise of the penis filler, Doctor Ranj is here to answer your questions.”The show’s other penis filler, Martin Lewis, will answer them on Monday.IT seems almost wrong to single out just one programme from Sunday’s beautul Armistice Day coverage, but the year’s most meaningful TV awards should probably all go to BBC’s They Shall Not Grow Old, made by Peter Jackson, whose astonishing film gave a voice, laughter, tears and colour to some of the extraordinary men who survived the - trenches.Those of us who watched it, on Sunday, are unlikely ever to forget the experience. Those of you who didn’t, must catch up with it on the BBC iPlayer.Be sure, though, to watch it right through to the credits’ last chorus of Mademoiselle From Armentières, where it names the veterans who have all long since passed but whose memories and souls have never seemed more alive and unforgettable.“It’s quite hard to put your finger on it.”I’ll bet.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Many children are seeing their parents orce, start new cohabiting relationships, and having those end as well.The findings are said to explain why some blokes seem unwilling or unable to settle down.“All of these relationships can influence childrens outcomes, as we see in this study.”The number of kids living with cohabiting adults has more than doubled in the UK from seven per cent in  to  per cent in .Those living with a married couple fell by nine percentage points of the same period to  per cent, figures from the Office for National Statistics show.Dr Kamp Dush added: “You may see cohabitation as an attractive, lower-commitment type of relationshipyouve seen your mother in such a relationship for a longer time.That may lead to more partners since cohabitating relationships are more likely to break-up.“What our results suggest is that mothers may pass on their marriageable characteristics and relationship skills to their children – for better or worse.“It could be that mothers who have more partners dont have great relationship skills, or dont deal with conflict well, or have mental health problems.“Each of these can undermine relationships and lead to instability.“Whatever the exact mechanisms, they may pass these characteristics on to their children, making their children’s relationships less stable.”The findings are published in the journal PLOS ONE."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/NINTCHDBPICT000449160532.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"eu army emmanuel macron angela merkel latest","story":"Merkel declared there should be an integrated European Union military, recalling the lessons of the First World War and the isions that led to the conflict.Speaking to MEPs today about the future of Europe, Merkel said the continent should take its fate fully into its own hands.Echoing comments made by French leader Emmanuel Macron last week, she said: We should work on a vision of one day establishing a real, true European army.Merkel added that such an army would not undermine the US-led military alliance NATO but could be complementary to it. It should include common development of arms industry, she said as well as an EU-wide arms export policy and crucially a European intervention force.It came a day after a senior minister from the French Government called for the EU to become a powerful new “empire” to rival the US and China in an interview which will infuriate Donald Trump.Merkels remarks today in the EU parliament drew loud applause in the legislature but also boos from euro-sceptic members.One of them was chief Brexiteer Nigel Farage, who said: Its a European Union that we are told is now to become an empire - a militarised European Union.A European Union that has launched a new Cold against the United States of America.One hundreds years on from the Armistice we should genuinely be worried.The idea that this new militarised union is somehow a recipe for peace I suggest you sit back and think a little bit more carefully.Maybe you should all re-read history because the European project was set up to stop German domination and what you have seen today is a naked take-over bid.Yesterday French finance minister Bruno Le Maire said Europe must be strong enough to defend itself in the future - words the US president called insulting.Le Maire controversial calls for a new superstate came as he backed Macron’s and Merkels plan for a “real European army”.Le Maire suggested Brussels should go one even further and establish itself as an “empire”.Its about Europe having to become a kind of Empire, as China is. And how the US is, the French finance minister told the German newspaper Handelsblatt.After being quizzed by the newspaper on his comments, he added: “Do not get me wrong, Im talking about a peaceful empire thats a constitutional state.I use the term to raise awareness that the world of tomorrow will be about power.Power will make a dference: technological power, economic, financial, monetary, cultural power will be crucial.Trump has blasted Macrons idea for the European Union to build an army to protect itself from the US as insulting.The US President tweeted: President Macron of France has just suggested that Europe build its own military in order to protect itself from the US, China and Russia.Very insulting, but perhaps Europe should first pay its fair share of NATO, which the US subsidises greatly!It comes three days after the French President said the US is as big a threat to the EU as Russia and China and called for a “true European army” to defend the bloc.In an extraordinary attack on the US president, Macron lumped Washington together with Moscow and Beijing as Europe’s biggest foes.The arch euro federalist insisted only a fully fledged EU defence force can protect the continent against the trio’s aggression.He said: “We have to protect ourselves with respect to China, Russia and even the United States of America.“We will not protect the Europeans unless we decide to have a true European army.”The French president lashed Mr Trump for deciding to pull the US out of a nuclear treaty with Russia that was signed during the Cold War.He raged: “When I see President Trump announcing that he’s quitting a major disarmament treaty which was formed after the s euro-missile crisis that hit Europe, who is the main victim  Europe and its security.”Mr Macron made the comments in a radio interview from the town of Verdun - the site of a major WW battle - as he tours the Western Front ahead of Remembrance Day.They were welcomed by the EU Commission, which said it has already put the wheels in motion for the eventual creation of a euro army.A spokesman beamed: “If there is a Commission that has put forward the need for a meaningful defence identity for the EU, it’s this Commission.“President Macron has been consistently putting forward this narrative for a stronger Europe that empowers and protects.“This is totally totally compatible with our work and all contributions from our EU leaders, and especially from President Macron, are very much welcome.”But the remarks were savaged by former British Army commanders, who said the revelations showed why the UK must pull out of the EU’s defence plans.Major General Julian Thompson, who led British forces in the Falklands, told The Sun: “The EU Commission now openly admits it has created the preamble to an EU army.The UK is in that preamble and risks being kept in it.“Ministers must withdraw or risk losing forever whole chunks of the UK’s democratic control over defence.”Colonel Richard Kemp, a commander of UK troops in Afghanistan, added: “This is precisely what eurosceptics have been warning about.“It is time for ministers now to take notice and rein in what they have agreed since the referendum.They have been led astray in the most crucial area of sovereignty.”And Tory MEP Geoffrey Van Orden, a former British Army Brigadier, raged: “Instead of th century dreams of French-led European grandeur, President Macron should be helping build Western solidarity.“That means helping and not obstructing a strong partnership with Britain and strengthening the NATO alliance.”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/NINTCHDBPICT000248408276.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"brits wont need a visa to travel to europe even if we get a no

holidaymakers from Europe.But it was previously feared the EU would charge Brits £ or more for a permit to enter after Brexit.Todays announcement applies to all the countries of the EU except Ireland, plus Norway, Switzerland, Iceland and Liechtenstein.Freedom of movement between the UK and Ireland is already guaranteed under a separate treaty dating back to .A Government spokesman said: A UK government spokesperson said: We welcome the proposal by the European Commission which reflects the future relationship that the UK wants with the rest of the EU.We have been clear in our proposals that we want to ensure reciprocal measures on visa-free travel for tourists and short term business visitors with the EU.”Anti-Brexit campaigners claimed the new rules will hurt British citizens who spent large parts of the year abroad.Lib Dem MP Tom Brake said: This will come as a real shock to those who spend their winter months in Spain or Portugal and will now see additional costs and

their nature may be a marriage, a civil partnership, a romantic relationship, or a family relationship.The bank has had a strict rule on reporting office romances in place since .But the new code represents the first public acknowledgement that employees must declare their relationships to bosses.Other major banks like Bank Of America Merrill Lynch and Goldman Sachs also have so-called love

But then someone threatened to push me in the Burr-Bank [stream’s name] and said ’Get on your gut’, and a girl walked on my back.”Unsurprisingly, the teen said the bullying made him feel “sad and upset”.CBC said the dad of one of the students involved in the incident formally apologised over the weekend, and said his son took responsibility for what he did.He told the network: “This was an awful, awful situation that nobody should have to endure.”According to Fox News, Brett has accepted his classmates’ apologies but has urged pupils to stop any further bullying.His mum, Terri McEachern, said she was amazed that her son had forgiven those who abused him.She told the Washington Post: “It’s just heart-breaking. This is his mind-set.Children with disabilities have the most amazing gts in the world, they don’t see bad in anyone. They see so much good in everybody.”His mum intends lodging a formal complaint with the high school.Cape Breton-Victoria Regional Education Centre said school staff are “leading a restorative practice process” with the school community, including parents.Yesterday, a group rally was held outside Glace Bay to send a message of support to the bullied teen, and show he is not alone.Organiser Dionne Dermody told CBC that the boy’s story had upset her, as she has experience of working with people with cerebral palsy and “to see Brett hurt like that really pulled at my heart.”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/NINTCHDBPICT000449306519.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"dog drinks owners pint belfast pub","story":"The devious dogs cheeky pint was caught on camera by Jake Pulford, , who couldnt keep in the giggles as he watched the canines antics from a bus.Jake claims the wily pet even dared to take several swigs - but made sure to check it wasnt going to get caught out beforehand.The dog, which is thought to be a Shiba Inu, had been left alone tied to a table in the beer garden of the Errigle Inn in Belfast.The crafty hound made Jakes day - and he claims it gained the attention of several passengers on the bus.He expected the dog to regret its actions after taking the first lick, but claims the mutt seemed to enjoy the beer and kept going back for more.Jake, from Belfast, said: I just heard people laughing and looked out [the window] and saw the dog without its owner.It had a lead attached to the table it was at so clearly its owner had just walked into the pub and left it alone for a little bit and thats when it made its chance.It went in more than once - he was doing it a few times so he seemed to enjoy it.I was laughing at the dog and I was trying to get the before and after pictures so I was just being very careful and zooming in.There were a lot of other people on the bus laughing at the dog too.When he shared his photos in his group chat with friends, Jakes pal found it hilarious and convinced him to let her post it online.The two pictures were shared with the comment: Spotted checking the coast is clear at a Belfast pub.The post was liked, shared and commented more than , times.Jake has not managed to track down the owner - but claims he would tell him about his mischievous mutt.Jake, who is a software developer, said: If I saw the owner and had the chance then Id probably tell him [what happened].I havent seen the dog since.

Another  metre banner reading “CLIMATE CHANGE” was dropped from the bridge, with protest groups warning five bridges across the Thames in London will be blocked on Saturday or Rebellion Day. Extinction Rebellion activists have also blocked access to Downing Street, with one protester superglued to fencing. In a press release from the protest group, they said: The Extinction Rebellion activists descended on Downing Street as part of the escalation of its nonviolent uprising against the British government for its criminal inaction on the climate emergency and ecological crisis.  “We are bold. We will not hide. We are all in open rebellion. We have informed the police and emergency services that these  bridges will be road-blocked: Southwark, Blackfriars, Waterloo, Westminster and Lambeth.” On Monday, a protest organised by the group saw people descend on the headquarters of the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy. Other activists superglued their hands to the revolving doors of the department and locked their arms together with plastic tubes to ensure they could not be easily moved. Dozens of police arrived in vans to closely watch the protest as chants of fracking is stoppable and keep that oil in the soil rang out on Victoria Street. Police said one person was arrested.  Young activist Frederik Arstad, , who travelled from Oslo in Norway to protest, said the group wanted authorities to take more seriously the severity of the situation regarding climate change. It will raise the ocean levels, cause more floods, forest fires like weve just seen in Calornia, and it will affect the whole world, especially the poor parts of the world, Mr Arstad said. This will create climate refugees. They have to go somewhere and they might come here and we will probably shut them out, and there will be a human disaster. A number of the protesters hailed from near Cuadrillas shale gas fracking site at Preston New Road in Lancashire, which they claimed was environmentally damaging.

Her plan looks dead on arrival when the Labour leader made crystal clear his party will vote against it alongside Brextremist rebels and, at the moment, DUP MPs in what would be a fatal personal blow. Corbyns accusation that Mays posing a  choice between a botched deal and no deal thats a failure on its own terms following two years of bungled negotiations hurt because its largely true. Picking at sovereignty and trade deal sores, this was the best Prime Ministers Questions performance for months from a Labour leader who mocked her and Brexit Secretary Dominic Raabs discovery of the importance of the Dover-Calais route to and from the Continent.  The usual Tory wall of noise behind May was largely quelled and her dig at Labour splits, Corbyn asserting Brexit cant be stopped and Shadow Brexit Secretary Keir Starmer insisting it can, lacked sharpness as Corbyn gave himself wriggle room by arguing he wouldnt frustrate it but he would oppose a Tory mess. This is a colossal crisis for Britain and not just May when her effective deputy David Lidington earlier today admitted the Brexit hes supporting would leave the country worse off.  How fiercely Mays fighting on two fronts, caught in a Remainer-Quitter pincer movement, was reinforced by Brextremist Tory Peter Bone warning shed lose support of their partys MPs and millions of voters.

The backstop for the Northern Irish border. Youve probably heard a lot about this mysterious backstop. But do you know what it means  We dont blame younot, as the whole thing has been testing our brains for months. In fact, its astonishing that the whole of Brexit has come down to boring technical jargon about customs arrangements. No one told you THAT in . But we are where we are, and with a possible general election round the corner, its vital you know what the debate is about. Here is the issue explained.  The backstop is a small but crucial part of the overall Brexit deal.It is a backup plan to guarantee checks do noton the -mile border between Northern Irelandand the Republic . This situation - known as a hard border - would set Irish peace back decades and could trigger ato violence of the Troubles. It would reverse the Good Friday Agreement pact that allows anyone to cross the border with little more than a sign and a dferent-coloured road.  Under the backstop, EU customs rules will be extended across the whole of the UK for a temporary period. This has infuriated Brexiteer MPs - who fear we will be a vassal state to Brussels, unable to sign trade deals around the world. It will kick in from December no solution has been found for the Irish border.  November : After months of stalled talks over the Northern Irish border, deal is reached at a technical level between the UK and EU.  November : Emergency Cabinet meeting scheduled for pm.  November : Theresa May gives statement to Parliament. End of November : Possible emergency EU summit with  other leaders to sign off the deal. - December : The next scheduled European Council summit. This is the last chance saloon to agree a deal. Already its much later than was ideal. Otherwise there wont be time to sign it off before Brexit Day. After a deal is reached: MPs hold a vote on any deal in Parliament. This is danger moment two for Theresa May, who will likely face a Tory leadership challengeshe loses the vote. She claims the UK will leave with No Deal anywayshe loses. But Labour say she should be forced back to the negotiating table call a general election or even trigger a second EU referendum.  March : Brexit Day. If theres a deal, this will be a total anticlimax because a transition will be in place. If theres No Deal, planes could be grounded, ports jammed up and customs checks thrown into chaos at pm.  December : If theres a deal, this is when the transition period - which continues pretty much all the EU rules we have now - is supposed to end. But talk has been floated of extending this by a few months. After December : If theres still no deal, under current plans a backstop would kick in. This could keep the UK tied to EU customs rules, until a proper agreement is reached, in exchange for keeping the Northern Ireland border open. For more information read our guide to whats happening with the Brexit talks and  ways No Deal Brexit will affect your le. Why is it making people angry  There are three main reasons why it is making Brexiteers, Remainers and the DUP angry. These reasons are important because MPs could vote down the backstop - and therefore the entire deal - in the House of Commons. . It will stop the UK signing global trade deals  The UK cannot sign its own trade deals with other countries, like Australia and Japan,it is in a customs union with the EU.This is why Theresa May was adamant the UK must leave the EU customs union. The backstop, however, will keep us in that customs union in all but name. . We could end up trapped in it forever  Britain tried again and again to set a time limit on the backstop, but it seems she was unsuccessful. First she wanted to set a firm end date of  December  - but the EU rejected it. Then she wanted a mechanism for the UK to quit the backstop, no matter what Brussels says - but the EU rejected that too. Instead, leaked reports suggest there will be an independent arbitration committee to decidethe backstop can be terminated, with members from both the UK and EU. If this wasnt bad enough it could be overseen by the European Court of Justice - the exact body Theresa May is trying to leave.  EU negotiator Michel Barnier previously warned a deal could force some goods to be checked between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. Theresa Mays DUP allies reject that - saying it breaks up the precious union of the UK. The PM has repeatedly insisted Northern Ireland will not be treated dferently to the rest of the UK. Thats the whole point of extending EU rules everywhere. But the EU had insisted on a backstop to the backstop - prising Northern Ireland apart from UK rules and keeping it in EU rules -everything  falls through. And leaked reports suggest there WILL be some Northern Ireland specic elements to the backstop. A Brexit deal between the UK and EU is set to be agreed. The final hurdle will be a vote in Parliament. MPs are grouped in several factions - their warring opinions on it all are explained here. Even though they disagree,they all vote down the deal they could defeat Theresa May.

And the groom is captured in the stark landscape, his neatly tailored wedding suit soaked through by sheets of rain lashing the crags. But the results of their bold choice of venue are a series of stunning images that capture both the raw beauty of the wilderness setting and their love for each other.  Newly-weds James and Laura picked the Isle of Skye after considering locations around the globe. James, , and Lisa,  flew from their home in Chicago to the picturesque island for the unique shoot following their Scottish wedding ceremony on September .The couple, who have been together for four years, got in touch with Andrew Rae - a Scottish photographer - on Instagram after viewing his incredible gallery of past images.However, the pair were hit with strong winds and a barrage of mud as they posed for the set.  Lisa said: We anticipated cooler, misty, weather similar to that of the Pacic Northwest in the states. Boy, were we in for a surprise. The wind was unreal. The weather in Chicago fluctuates pretty regularly in spring and fall. We could have a week of F and have snow the next. We have a fair amount of wind that comes off of Lake Michigan, but nothing like the wind in Skye. I’m sure it was F and sunny back home on our wedding day.  Lisa said the couple took a while to decide on their perfect destination to elope but after spotting pictures of the Isle, their mind was made up. Lisa added: We wanted a unique wedding experience that was reflective of us. We both love the outdoors and are always up for an adventure. We were interested in a remote area overseas, the idea just seemed more romantic.  She added: Our first destination thought was French countryside, but the more I researched it, the more dficult it seemed to be due to the language barrier. Scotland continually came up as an elopement destination and neither of us had been before so we just kind of went with it. Photographs of Skye really solidied it as the perfect place for us.  The couple prepared for the weather conditions and Lisa said she didnt mind getting her wedding dress covered in mud. She added: It was expected. I searched for the perfect dress that could pack well and was lightweight for hiking around for this purpose. We wanted to end up in the fairy pools, but due to the weather we never made it. I’ve been dreaming of Skye every day since.  The newlyweds grew up just half a mile away from each other Lisa said: We knew of each other in high school but connected well after college at a neighbourhood bar. We now own a home in the same neighborhood we grew up in.  Lisa said she would recommend a similar shoot to anyone who wants incredible wedding photographs. She added: We planned to marry at Loch Coruisk but could not make the trip due to bad weather. We chose to marry at Honeycomb Rock, an area near the pier to travel to Loch Coruisk. Andrew’s photography skills are truly an art form. I never imagined I would look at such a beautul photograph and see myself in it.  We had such a wonderful experience, everyone was so warm and welcoming. The people really made the trip. For those interested, expect the worst with the weather and embrace it. And please, leave Skye as beautul as you found it.

Nicola Lissimore, from Wolverhampton, West Mids, pleaded guilty to two animal welfare offences when she appeared before Birmingham Magistrates Court on Friday. She has been banned from keeping animals for le. The -year-old lived in a filthy house and the court heard how the RSPCA were called to her address after concerns a number of cats were not being cared for. On investigation, four cats were found dead and a further  were found in a poor bodily condition.  Inspector Dawn Burrell went to the address and was unable to contact the owner but could see a number of emaciated cats through a window. She could also see piles of faeces and rubbish in the house and could not find any signs that the cats had food and water. The pets had no access to the outside and she could see fleas jumping up at the front door. The RSPCA monitored property for a few days and believed no one was attending to the cats so, upon veterinary advice, entry was gained with the help of officers from West Midlands Police. Inspector Burrell said once inside it was clear the cats were suffering from dehydration, were emaciated and had other untreated medical issues.  She said: The police went to the back door and couldnt push it in due to the amount of faeces behind it so we tried the front. This time a front  went through and immediately the smell of ammonia hit us as we went inside - it was so strong we were physically gagging. We found four dead cats amongst the piles of faeces which was piled high, there was rubbish strewn around and the only water available in the property was from a bathroom tap which was left running but the door was closed so they couldnt access it. This was one of the worst properties I have entered in my thirty years in the job.  It was so sad to see these dead cats just left in the filth and the others were either emaciated or had other health problems which had not been addressed. The surviving cats were signed over into the care of the RSPCA and have now been rehabilitated. Some have already found new homes and others are still waiting for adopters. Lissimore was also given a -week jail term suspended for  months.

Women across the globe are desperate to copy her looks and get their hands on whatever clothes she wears. Dubbed the Duchess effect her outfits usually sell out within hours of her being photographed in them. But even the most fashion forward of people can still slip up sometimes - something the Duchess of Sussex proved to be true over the weekend.  The expectant mother accompanied her husband and other family members to the Royal British Legion Festival of Remembrance at the Royal Albert Hall on Saturday November . On first glance the -year-old looked incredibly chic in a black Stella McCartney coat dress, which cleverly hid her baby bump thanks to a big bow. She wore her dark hair down, tucked behind her ears and paired the dress with a black clutch and heels. But people couldnt help notice that something about her ensemble was a little odd - and its all to do with her tights.  Meghan, who has famously opted to forgo wearing hosiery thus far, decided to put on a pair of shiny, nude tights for the event. And many people on social media were bemused by the way they looked. One person wrote: Meghan rewearing her fab Stella McCartney coat from Cardf visit, but I cannot get over the glare of these tights. Another said: What has happened to Meghan Markles tights  Has she spilt her wine   However others found this criticism incredibly offensive and highlighted how dficult it can be to find tights that match your skin colour. I feel so sorry for Meghan Markle because her every move is scrutinized because shes American, a commoner older and biracial. Now they are talking about her nude colour tights. They dont exactly match her skin tone. Well, this is a COMMON problem for women of colour, argued one Twitter user. Another added: Do we really have nothing better to talk about on Remembrance Day than Meghans tights  This isnt the first time the duchess has come under fire for her choice of hosiery.  In May, she wore a similar pair of tights to Prince Charles th birthday party at Buckingham Palace and was also criticised for them. She has since been seen stepping out in public with bare legs. Some have suggested that the decision to cover her skin may not have been her own - as it is commonly thought that the Queen has an unwritten rule about guests and family members wearing tights at royal events. However Marlene Koenig, royal expert and Royal Musings blog founder, told BAZAAR this isnt actually true. She said: There are no rules for royal women regarding pantyhose. While most womenwear pantyhouse with suits or gowns for a good slim line, it is not required by any decree from the Queen. What do you think of Meghans tights  Let us know in the comments below.

So the official photos marking the Prince of Wales’ th birthday are truly a breath of fresh air. They capture the smiling face of a modern monarchy, and the loving bond between Charles and his close-knit clan. The heir to the throne sits on a bench beaming, surrounded by his family.  And, while that bench is probably hand-carved oak and the Clarence House lawn freshly mown by a gardener, the Wales-Cornwall-Cambridge-Sussexes really look like a NORMAL happy family.

And the pair, who grew closer than ever to their father following the tragic death of Princess Diana, said they wanted him to be a big part in their own children’s lives. Camilla, also interviewed for the programme, said: “He’s wonderful with children. He doesn’t mind crawling on the floor for hours with them. We had a picture the other day with Louis pulling on his hair. He loves it. He’s exceptionally good with very small children and babies.”  Charles has clearly mellowed over the past decade and become more relaxed about family photoshoots. Just before his marriage to Camilla in  he took his sons on a stag do ski trip to the posh resort of Klosters. On a photoshoot the Prince was caught on microphone slating the press and BBC reporter Nicholas Witchell.  Grinning through gritted teeth, he told his sons: “I hate doing this. Bloody people. “I can’t bear that man [Witchell]. He’s so awful, he really is. I hate these people.” Urged by a photographer to “look like you know each other” the boys leaned closer.  Charles grumped: “Do I put my arms round you  What do we do ” William replied: “Keep smiling, keep smiling.” Charles wisely followed the advice and in the  years since has learned much more from William and Harry about showing emotion in public.  At  he seems more comfortable in his skin than ever before. And, as these pictures show, the modern monarchy is facing the future with a smile.

The woman, from Cheshire, was reported to police after she appeared to write on a secret Facebook group that she had used the potentially lethal treatment on her son.The highly-covert group is for parents who believe autism - a lelong, developmental disability - is caused by parasites. The groups , members, who are allegedly charged pound to join, share images of the so-called parasites leaving their children after treatment while congratulating themselves. But autism campaigner Emma Dalmayne claims the shocking images in fact show childrens bowel linings that have been burned out of their bodies by the bleach.  The treatment, known as CDor MMS , is administered orally or via enema and is being sold in the UK by online dealers and in person. Emma infiltrated the Facebook group and discovered the mother from Cheshire appearing to confess to using CD on her young son and reported her to Cheshire Police. Posts from the mum appear to show her admitting to administering  drops a day to her son, but becoming worried when he seemed weak and wouldnt get out of bed. Emma is calling for the government to ban the treatments and has launched at petition calling for alleged autism cures to be made illegal, which has more than , signatures.  Emma, an autistic mum-of-six from London, said: No parents will admit to doing this to their children publicly. This treatment is not illegal at the moment but we need to get rid of it. These parents are so ashamed of doing it in the first place. These people are brainwashed by [proponents of CD and MMS], who say that those against this support big pharma. The biggest problem is that the government dont do anything about this. This is not illegal yet. It is not illegal to use CD on your children and it needs to be. The most extreme case I have seen to date is a six-year-old boy who had to have his bowel removed and a colostomy bag fitted after his parents gave him these enemas. What you see in these images is the bowel lining of these victims. Some of the people who disagree with my campaigning have told me I should die, Im a whore, my children are vaccine damaged, I wont heal them because I want them to be autistic and I claim disability allowance so it wouldnt be profitable to heal them. It makes me so angry as an autistic person. Im furious that people want to heal this. There is no cure for autism. It isnt a disease or a disorder, its a neurological dference.  The Food Standards Agency issued a warning that both MMS and CD should be avoided and that the concentration of MMS is equivalent to industrial strength bleach. The mother, whose son is severely autistic, refused to respond to attempts to speak to her. A spokesperson from Cheshire Police said: This is an ongoing incident and we are investigating whether any criminal offences have taken place. Another parent, from Leicestershire, who claimed on the group that she had used MMS on her baby daughter, asked the group membersshe was doing alright because the baby was OK. The woman and her husband, both originally from Algeria, claimed they did not want to comment and had noticed how opinions y about this treatment. Her husband said: She is not happy to talk about. We are not there yet. I therefore have nothing  to say.  On the Facebook group, there is advice on how to make protocol , testimonials and also safe online practices information. Guidelines on the group that were published in  advise members that use of CD is beyond the mainstream standard of care and can get you into trouble. It also saystherapists, nurses or school officials come to your home please keep your supplies and dosing discreet. Recent posts from the website show concerned parents listing abnormal symptoms after administering CD to their autistic children. One mother posted: Hi everybody, my son has the last few days blue lips, is that normal . Others respond saying no, that is not normal. Check his heart. The concerned mother replied Im worried now. What can it be  But it started after we used CD.  On July , another parent posted a graphic image of her daughters dirty nappy with long pieces of bowel lining laid out on a piece of kitchen roll. The mother asks members to identy what parasite it is, and one respondent claims her daughter must be doing bettershe expelled this without even an enema. An admin posted this is good. Keep doing enemas to pull them out. On July , a member posted a picture of a parasite she had expelled dangling from a fork - though Emma believes it is cm of a childs bowel lining. Along with the Facebook group, Genesis II church also advertises the use of MMS on their website and lists sellers of the treatment. The organisation has  churches worldwide, including one in London and Co. Kildare, Ireland. It offers a ten-day course for members to train as MMS doctors or ministers, after which they could be able to open their own church. Once the ministers have healed  people, they will be given a doctorate degree. It also includes details about how it not only cures autism, but cancer, dementia, HIV, tumours and genital warts. Holistic therapist Danielle Bryant, from Wales, was warned repeatedly by the Food Standards Authorityand Medical and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agencylast month thatMMS was not deleted from her website it would be closed down. She admits that she was a health minister for the Genesis II church after attending one of their courses on how to make MMS, but claims she only ever used it on herself. Danielle said: Ive never really sold it. I have only ever made it for myself. I put the MMS on my website, but I never had any takers. The FSA contacted me to say they would take down my websiteI didnt take down [the link for MMS. I used MMS for a few things and that was quite a few years ago. Id read about it and I had a positive outcome. I just did the [Genesis II] course around six years ago.

I started using it during the day as well just to calm down when I felt anxious and it really helped.” Then, In June , after discussing the idea with her boyfriend, Matthew , , a trainee personal trainer – who backed her  per cent – she launched her own ASMR channel. But, despite the positive reaction she has had from thousands of followers, Sophie says she does get accused of creating fetish material. Sophie, who makes her money from advertisements, continued: “A very small percentage of people online may use these kind of videos for sexual reasons, but I think those people may have a personal issuethat’s the case. “It makes me uncomfortable to think that someone is using it for sexual purposes, because that is never my intention. “Some of my friends make comments about it being sexual, but most of them love ASMR and even watched me on YouTube before they met me at university!” Describing the effect of ASMR videos – which celebrities like record-breaking rapper Cardi B are great fans of – she said: “I loved creating my channel because ASMR is something that can really help with anxiety and depression. “ASMR is a tingly feeling that makes you feel a sense of peace, almost like a relaxing pins and needles that gives you a truly numb sensation.” Sophie, whose collection of  videos, in which she whispers messages like Hello sweetheart and makes stroking hand gestures with make-up brushes directly into a camera – sometimes role playing as a doctor and mermaid - are amongst  million ASMR broadcasts on YouTube.

And while the experiment found that only half those taking part experienced the ASMR tingles, the videos had a considerable impact on those who did.

But what is palm oil found in  There are some everyday products that contain palm oil that may surprise you.  Some kinds of lipstick are said to contain palm oil as it helps it hold its colour well. Shampoos could also contain it as the oil helps hair restore natural oils. Soaps and detergents could be found to have palm oil in them, as it removes dirt. Food products that could be found with palm oil inside include margarine, instant noodles, pizza dough, packaged bread, ice cream, cookies and chocolate, according to the World Wildle Fund.  Palm oil helps to give chocolate a shiny appearance and stops it from melting. It can give cookies and ice cream a creamy taste, and also enhances texture of bread dough. Some kinds of instant noodles also made it on the list WWFs list for containing palm oil.  Greenpeace has reportedly made a link between Mondelez - which makes Cadbury, Oreo and Ritz products - to the destruction of a big orangutan habitat in Indonesia. “It’s outrageous that despite promising to clean up its palm oil almost  years ago, Mondelez is still trading with forest destroyers,” Kiki Taufik, who leads Greenpeace Southeast Asia’s Indonesia forests campaign, told News.au. “Palm oil can be made without destroying forests, yet our investigation discovered that Mondelez suppliers are still trashing forests and wrecking orangutan habitat, pushing these beautul and intelligent creatures to the brink of extinction. “They’re literally dying for a biscuit.” According to the report, Mondalez bought at least , tonnes of palm oil and palm oil products in . A spokeswoman for Mondalez told : Mondelez International is committed to eradicating deforestation in the palm oil supply and we are actively working with our suppliers to ensure palm oil is fully traceable. We have actionable steps in place to make certain that the palm oil we buy is produced on legally held land, does not lead to deforestation or loss of peat land, respects human rights, and does not use forced or child labor. Mondelez will continue to prioritise suppliers that meet our principles and exclude those that do not. We are calling on our suppliers to improve practices across their entire operations and to engage their third-party suppliers to ensure their palm oil production is % sustainable and traceable. At the end of , % of our palm oil was traceable back to mill and % was from suppliers with policies aligned to ours. She added: While Mondelez International accounts for only about . percent of palm oil consumption globally, we have played - and continue to play - a leadership role in global industry advocacy toward sector transformation. We are proud to partner with several of the leading global organizations focused on improving the palm oil supply chain.  Regulators banned Icelands Christmas advert from TV screens for being too political - a move that has prompted , people to sign a petition for it to be allowed to be shown. The commercial, voiced by actress Emma Thompson and originally produced by Greenpeace, features a cartoon baby orangutan - Rang-Tan - warning its rainforest home is being cleared for palm oil plantations. Since it was banned it has had more than  million views on Facebook, the retailer said, and celebrities including James Corden have backed the campaign. The company pledged in April to take palm oil out of  food lines by the end of , a move which it said would reduce demand by more than  tonnes per year. Palm oil is mired in controversy, with warnings that sustainable versions are not preventing deforestation, while there are concerns that a switch to alternative oils could have greater impacts on habitat destruction where in the world.

I had to move out of my flat for two weeks while the workmen fixed my electrics as it wasnt safe and they said it would be quickerI moved out. I had to stay with my mum for a bit and in a hotel.

Northern Chiles Atacama desert has adapted to surviving without water for over  million years but unusual levels of rainfall have now seriously damaged the rare ecosystem and its uniques microbes. The region is constantly under observation from experts because the extreme dryness is regarded as a good analogue for Mars studies. As with Mars, the soil is extremely poor in organic le and yet it is still inhabited by microbial species from the three domains of le which are both dryness and radiation tolerant, and have lived in the region since the Jurassic period.  The situation in the hyperarid heart of the Atacama desert in northern Chile that has seen consecutive rains for the first time in  years has shocked scientists. Rather than supporting the development of le in the desert, they say the rain has destroyed it. The team from the Centre of Astrobiology say that the rain has devastated the microbial species that live there and were accustomed to no rain, according to the study published in Scientic Reports magazine. The recent rains have been attributed to climate change and investigator Armando Azua-Bustos explained: Our group has discovered that the contribution of water has not meant a development of le in the Atacama, has caused a huge devastation of the microbial species that lived in these places before the precipitation. They added: ... the sudden and massive input of water in regions that have remained hyperarid for millions of years is harmful for most of the surface soil microbial species, which are exquisitely adapted to survive with meagre amounts of liquid water, and quickly perish from osmotic shock when water becomes suddenly abundant.  The study said the indigenous micro-organisms that were perfectly adapted to live in the extremely dry conditions were unable to adapt to the new conditions and  percent of microbial le in the areas studied has been destroyed. The Atacama desert is one of the driest places in the world and is the only true desert to receive less precipitation than the polar deserts.

Buruli ulcers, also known as Mycobacterium ulcerans, is an infectious disease which kills off skin cells, small blood vessels and fat under the skin. As the bug buries deeper into a sufferers body, ulcers begin to form before eventually a person is at risk of losing their whole limb. Cases of the bug are on the rise in parts of Australia, with Victorias Department of Health and Human Service raising concerns about the number of victims. Dr Brett Sutton commenting on the rise said: It may be that mosquitoes are biting possums and are biting people.  It might be that the possum faeces in the environment then contaminates it and people are getting it into their skin through cuts or scratches. In , there were just two cases of the bug, before this rose to  last year, reports nine.au. Experts are predicting this year will see  new cases of people infected by the flesh-eating bug. The bug can leave sufferers needing months of recovery. Jett, , had to learn to walk again after developing a Buruli ulcers that put him in hospital for three months.  His mum Arna-Leigh said: I remember the moment that the doctor came out of surgery. He said, I think that you need to go to Brisbane, and theres a real chance thatwe dont find out what this is, he will lose his leg. The Victorian government donated millionfor research on the ulcer and Dr Sutton said half has already been spent. The bug can often start as a small painless bump, similar to a common insect bite which grows and swells over a number of weeks.  The bump usually becomes painful and can lead to a mild fever before turning bright red and crusty - with a scab that wont heal. The scab then disintegrates as the bump turns into an ulcer. Treatment involves either oral antibioticscaught early enough or surgery to remove a small amount of healthy tissue around the affected area to get rid of the infection completely.In some cases, more complex surgery may be needed where a skin graft of health skin is transplanted over the ulcer.

The mum-of-three from Victoria, Canada, was also diagnosed with sleep apnea three years ago after constantly feeling exhausted despite sleeping for up to nine hours a night. Fearing the problems serious health problems that can be brought out on by the breathing disorder including an increased risk of a heart attack, diabetes and more, she knew she had to change. She switched her high calorie diet for an Isagenix programme, consuming two protein shakes, a healthy meal and healthy snacks. Within a month she lost a stone and a halfand now shes dropped more than half her body weight, as well as ten dress sizes.  Now weighing st lbs , she was a finalist in a body transformation challenges and has qualied for the World Beauty Fitness and Fashion Show. Julie, who manages family business Millstream Self Storage, said: Before I had one foot in the grave,that wasnt a wake-up call I dont know what  was. I was told I would need a machine to help with my sleep apnea for the rest of my le. I was horried to have my husband sleep beside me, I didnt feel attractive with the machine and couldnt let my teenage daughters see me with the mask on my face. I dont think I was comfortable with any of my body parts before but now I love showing off my arms, legs and stomach. My husband says when he sees before photos of my back you can see how much my shape has changed. He described it as looking like a caterpillar with lots of rolls and no ident of a waist because my stomach stuck out really far.  I had no bottom, I was kind of rectangular, now Im a shapely beautul butterfly. My husband calls me hot Julie, he is just really amazed, he loved me big and loves me small, but thinks Im really hot now. He feels like he married two dferent women. I always felt beautul inside but now the outside reflects that too. Julie was overweight since childhood and remembers being mocked for her larger clothing and taking salads to school. She would regularly lose weight, which she would then put back on and then some. It additionally hit home in  when she struggled to go on a hike with her friend and forced them both to head back less than half way in. Julie said: I had a friend who liked big walks, I had previously been able to do them with her, but when I went on a hike I couldnt make it half way before having to turn around and go back down. I couldnt make it through and was so disappointment with myself, I was holding her back and I was already struggling on the easy parts  minutes in.  Her cousin told her about Isagenix and encouraged her to try to -day trial - within a month she had lost lbs.

Her newfound le has led her to run her first k and even inspired husband Murray, , to five stone .

The -year-old was born with an extremely rare neurological condition that means she can remember nearly everything that’s ever happened to her in her le. Her first memory is of having her picture taken at  days old. And she can recall the minute details of her first birthday party - from the itchy satin dress she wore to the Minnie Mouse teddy that terried her. While some memories are more vivid than others, Rebecca can always remember the emotions she felt - as well as the tastes and smells she encountered. Her mind is filled with endless flashbacks - from magical Christmases as a child to more hurtful memories of her being bullied at school. The young woman, from Brisbane, Australia, told : “My memories are all in sequence, they come in a chronological order by days and times. “My earliest memory is of having my picture taken at  days old. “I saw a picture of that photo when I was  but I always remembered it and would speak to my mum about it in my early childhood. She was shocked that I could remember and when I saw the photo, it was dated the rd of December  when I was  days old. “It never occurred to me that it wasn’t normal to remember things like that.  Rebecca is one of around only  people in the world who have Highly Superior Autobiographical Memory , or a super memory.While her happy memories are wonderful, she admits it’s tough being able to recall every detail of her le - from what clothes she was wearing to exactly how she felt when something bad or embarrassing happened to her on a certain day. Her over-active mind also causes her to suffer from headaches and insomnia - but she has learned to quieten her mind by reading the Harry Potter novels. She now knows all the books by heart and recites them in her mind to calm her down and help her fall asleep. “The memories make it dficult to get to sleep when it’s dark and silent because I just get distracted, she told us. It happens all through the day but when I’m trying to sleep I just get random flashbacks and it keeps me awake. That’s why I learned to recite the Harry Potter books. While remembering everything certainly has its perks, Rebecca says her mind often feels “overwhelmed” and cluttered with memories. A particularly negative recollection can often ruin her day. She is currently in therapy and is working on ways to repress particularly painful memories and keep the incessant flashbacks at bay. “There are a few memories from my early childhood that are the absolute worst and I hate reliving those, said Rebecca. I want to get rid of those memories because I was going through a phase of depression when I was  and I don’t like reliving those emotions and feelings again. “When they’re negative, I like to call them intrusive memories. It could be a day I was looking forward to but something could remind me of a negative memory and the negative emotions flood back and it just ruins the whole day for me.  “I’ve been doing therapy for the past few years and my therapist has given me exercises to deal with my memories and they’re used for people suffering from PTSD. “One is called leaves on a stream, I just imagine taking every thought out of my mind and putting it on a leaf and it’s floating away. That just grounds my mind. While some of us still cringe at memories from our embarrassing teenage years, they flood back for Rebecca asits happening right then and there all over again. The intense experience can be incredibly painful and dficult to cope with over and over again. “I dream about my past all the time too, and they’re always about my school days, said the young woman. “I just relive the embarrassment of whenever I did something at school. Emotions come back, physical sensations come back, tastes and smells do as well.  Rebecca also tries to centre her mind by drawing her memories or building her Harry potter Lego set. When a memory comes flooding back, she has to fight the urge to respond in the same way she would have at that time of her le. She explained: “The emotions and the adrenaline I getto whatever age I was at the time of the memory but my conscience and reasoning are like an adult. That makes me feel ashamed and embarrassed and reluctant to be open about them because I know it’s an immature reaction or something silly that I don’t need to worry about. It creates a lot of confusion within me. In recent years, Rebecca has been working with neurologists to help with their research into how memory works. “I’m close to my step-dad’s family and his dad passed away two years ago from Alzheimers, she said. He had it for seven years before he passed away and it was just so sad. If there could be a cure, it would be fantastic. And I’m involved in research that helps find the answers and that means a lot to me. Rebecca has met one other woman who has H-SAM and says it was “incredible” to meet someone who has the same experience. “For the person not to be confused or amazed but just to react asit was a normal thing was amazing, she said.We just couldn’t stop talking the first time we met. It’s so amazing to have a friend who knows exactly what I’m talking about.” While she sometimes wishes she didnt have such an incredible memory, the young woman says the happy memories make it worthwhile. Often, it can feel like time travel. I relive happy memories just as much as negative memories, she said “Those are the moments I’m grateful I have H-SAM, I relive holidays I’ve had, I love going to the Disney and Harry Potter parks. “Most of my happiest memories come from my adulthood and not my childhood.  “Most of my happiest memories come from my trips to Calornia. And although she feels her mind is “constantly cluttered”, she has never felt any other way. “It’s something I’ve grown used to but I knowthis happened to me suddenly I’d be absolutely overwhelmed and I wouldn’t cope with it, said Rebecca. “I get a lot of headaches, I get tired a lot but it’s something I’ve just accepted as part of my le. I’ve just grown used to it. “Whenever I’m getting stressed because my head is just going haywire or I’m having an intrusive memory I do wish I didn’t have it but I like to focus on the positive. She added: “I used to look at it like it as a complete curse but now I’m teaching myself to look at the positive side.I don’t have to keep a diary to remember happy events - they’re just there.And it’s also something interesting to talk about - I love being quirky.

You feel like you want to help out where you can and obviously being injured, you can’t.“It had been a long time doing that so it felt good to be back out there and help us get a point on the board.“We need to build on that now.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/11/Royal-Bank-of-Scotland-250px-1.jpg ","title":"the great outdoors make for a great community for people across scotland","story":"Green spaces and a connection to nature are hugely important when it comes to calling a place a home, according to a new study from Royal Bank of Scotland.Royal Bank’s new Community and Ways to Bank research has revealed that the intensity of modern living isn’t making the need to have a space to enjoy the greenery and surroundings around us any less of a priority.As our lestyles and priorities change, the way we choose to bank is changing too and that is why Royal Bank is investing in new ways to help make banking easier for customers.From community bankers and mobile branches bringing banks to the heart of hometowns, or new mobile apps and digital banking services allowing customers to bank wherever they are and at any time of day, Royal Bank of Scotland aims to make banking easier and more convenient.For more information about the Royal Bank of Scotland click here. vw, px\"  "},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/11/5beaa2d7b646d.jpg ","title":"tom duthie false dawns could be over for arabs as current dundee united team showing grit and determination","story":"As their team has struggled to get back to the Premiership, the last two-and-a-half years have seen Dundee United fans become used to  dawns.Under Ray McKinnon, by the end of  the Tangerines had battled back from a slow start to their first season in the Championship to move to the top of the ision and looked every inch automatic promotion contenders.It didn’t last and the next couple of months saw them slip off the pace and have to concentrate their efforts in getting up via the end-of-season promotion play-offs.It was a case of lightning striking twice a year ago when Csaba Laszlo took over.For a couple of months, United again looked the part only to quickly fall away with a string of horrible results that left them again facing the lottery of those post-season knockout games.The memories of those campaigns are why many Arabs are trying their damnedest not to get carried away by the progress their team’s been making since another new manager, Robbie Neilson, took charge last month.After a run of four wins and a draw, keeping feet firmly planted on the ground must be growing increasingly dficult. For the -plus who travelled to watch the weekend win at Ross County, it might be well nigh impossible.Because at the Global Energy Stadium on Saturday, Neilson’s Tangerines looked every inch the kind of side that finish top of this notoriously dficult of leagues. That was largely down to there being nothing pretty about this win.Under McKinnon, Laszlo and even Neilson already, United have shown when it comes to quality football,everything clicks there’s not a team in the second tier who can live with them.They can pass any side off the park, keep possession and conjure enough chances to comfortably win a game.For all but a few sides with genuine aspirations to win the Championship, however, that’s seldom enough. This is a ision where the team finishing first must also have the ability to grind out wins.It’s what St Mirren did last season, Hibs the one before and even Rangers found they had to be able to do as they got up two years ago.Even Neilson’s young Hearts side that galloped away with the title in  did, on the few occasions when necessary, show they could dig deep and battle for points.Now, and arguably for the first time since they dropped down from the top flight, it’s a quality United possess.They ended County’s nine-game unbeaten home run since the start of the campaign, not through playing the kind of football of which we know they’re capable, but by standing up to the physical challenge that’s always posed by the home side up there.Yes, United had to do plenty defending, but through a clear game plan, organisation and a willingness of players to put their bodies on the line, it was executed so well that, for all their territorial dominance, the Staggies had very few clear sights of goal.A nice bonus stemming from that fact was, for the first time in his short tenure, in the build-up to the game injuries were a signicant issue.Frederic Frans and Callum Booth were doubts last week and unable to train with the rest of the squad until a Friday session confirmed they wouldn’t make it. In William Edjenguele and Paul Watson, the manager found able deputies.He’s said since he arrived at Tannadice winning promotion would take a squad of highly committed players.He now knows he has that and try as they might not to, the fans must be getting excited."},{"url":null,"title":"wetherspoons-bans-dogs-from-all-pubs","story":"POPULAR pub chain Wetherspoons has banned dogs from all of its branches."},{"url":null,"title":"mobile-providers-charging-customers-for-phones-already-paid-off","story":"AN estimated four million UK mobile phone users have been charged pound million for handsets they already own, a charity has warned."},{"url":null,"title":"hydro-turns-five-meet-the-head-of-entertainment-who-spoke-on-anniversary","story":"OVER five million concert-goers in five years have visited the SSE Hydro...a figure which has exceeded the expectations of the woman responsible for bringing some of the worlds biggest acts to Glasgow."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-takeaway-launches-deep-fried-mars-bar-calzone","story":"A GLASGOW takeaway has launched one of the worlds unhealthiest pizzas - a deep fried MARS BAR calzone containing around , calories."},{"url":null,"title":"harry-and-meghan-expecting-first-baby","story":"The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are expecting a baby in spring , Kensington Palace has announced."},{"url":null,"title":"teen-bakes-grandads-ashes-into-biscuits-and-shares-with-classmates","story":"A high school student mixed her cremated grandfatherrsquos ashes into homemade sugar biscuits and shared them with several classmates, police in Calornia said on Wednesday."},{"url":null,"title":"rbs-paid-contractors-400-a-day-to-stuff-envelopes","story":"Royal Bank of Scotland paid contractors a staggering pound a day to stuff envelopes, wasting thousands of pounds of taxpayersrsquo money in the process, it can be revealed."},{"url":null,"title":"can-you-give-staffie-tila-a-home","story":"ANIMAL charity the Scottish SPCA is celebrating their annual Staffie Awareness Week to encourage the public to come along to meet the staffies currently in their care that are looking for homes."},{"url":null,"title":"no-payout-for-celtic-fan-after-slip-injury","story":"A CELTIC fan who intended to sue the club for pound, after claiming a spilled drink caused him to fall and suffer injuries, has not been awarded any cash."},{"url":null,"title":"scots-clubs-set-to-bank-up-to-20m-from-new-scottish-cup-tv-deal","story":"THE SFA will bank up to pound million from a deal with BBC Scotland and satellite broadcaster Premier Sports to broadcast William Hill Scottish Cup games for the next six seasons."},{"url":null,"title":"nicola-sturgeon-we-must-resolve-to-do-all-we-can-to-promote-peace-in-the-world","story":"On Sunday I had the honour of attending the national service to mark  years of the First Armistice - the end of the First World War."},{"url":null,"title":"im-a-celebrity-line-up-meet-this-years-campers","story":"A football manager, an ex-EastEnder and a former Doctor Who and Glasgow actor are among the famous faces set to brave the jungle for this yearrsquos Irsquom a Celebrityhellip Get Me Out Of Here!"},{"url":null,"title":"plans-submitted-for-new-mcdonalds-in-glasgows-east-end","story":"NEW plans have been submitted for a McDonalds drive-thru restaurant in Glasgows East End."},{"url":null,"title":"surge-in-buckfast-sales-blamed-on-minimum-pricing-trade-off-from-high-strength-ciders","story":"IT was a landmark pricing policy designed to transform Scotlands troublesome relationship with alcohol."},{"url":null,"title":"flip-out-offering-free-trampoline-sessions-for-schools","story":"MENTAL Health minister Clare Haughey had a spring in her step as she announced a free trampoline for schools programme."},{"url":null,"title":"top-scottish-blogger-emily-shakgough-to-meet-fans-in-glasgow","story":"TOP blogger Emily Shakgough will meet her Glasgow fans as the face of a top lingerie firm."},{"url":null,"title":"holidays-are-coming-all-the-christmas-adverts-on-tv-so-far","story":"GLASGOWS Christmas tree is officially up, George Square will light up the skies this weekend and the citys style mile is already getting busier - the holidays are officially on their way."},{"url":null,"title":"win-a-fantastic-diy-makeover-with-city-building-and-the-evening-times","story":"LIFE can be a challenge ndash no-one knows that more than Robert McGhee."},{"url":null,"title":"libby-mcarthur-age-denial-maybe-there-is-something-in-it","story":"In my teens and not long after my Guinea pig had died, my Dad said to be careful as the felt tip I was using was a permanent marker.

What’s more, eventhey don’t mutate as occurred in the case outlined here,released into the wild either by design or mistake these foreigners can cause havoc to local ecosystems.In a letter to the scientic journal Nature in , a group of German scientists began ‘it has been rumoured that an unidentied crayfish…of marbled appearance and uncertain geographical origin that was introduced into the German aquarium trade in the mid s, is capable of unisexual reproduction ’.The authors ended by warning that: ‘This crayfish…could become a menace to European freshwater systems, as the release of even one specimen into the wild would be enough to found a population that might out-compete native crayfish’.Now,  years later, this all-female crayfish has escaped into the wild.  Identied as a descendent of the fresh water slough crayfish from Florida, it is now called the marbled crayfish or Marmokrebs. So far it has invaded the waterways of at least nine European countries as well as Japan and Madagascar. Unravelling its origin reveals that a unique macro-mutation must have occurred in a single slough crayfish egg probably caused by heat or cold shock whilst in transit from Florida to Germany for the pet market.The resulting female hatchling possessed three sets of chromosomes per celland the ability to produce clones of itself without a mate and at very high frequency.Because of its warm climate and abundant freshwater habitats, Madagascar has seen the most rapid colonisation with Marmokrebs. Millions of the animals have invaded the countries lakes, rice paddies and swamps and are threatening its seven endemic crayfish species.It is only a matter of time before this scenario is repeated in other locations, destroying valuable ecosystems and eliminating indigenous species."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 37","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Sir,It is always a delight when a letter awakens a landowner.James F Lithgow#s insult about ‘blow-ins’ is a typical trait. I worked extremely hard to buy my farm, not being able to piggyback on my forebears’ efforts, and I didn’t ‘blow-in’, it took two forty-foot pantechnicons four days.It is clear he has an interest in wind turbines, and no doubt with a pair of wellies, a fish farm or two. His blinkered refusal to accept the huge body of evidence regarding fish farm contamination suggests he has an investment and it needs protecting. But only, of course,you don’t have a commercial interest.There is a huge amount of evidence that mechanical kelp harvesting does irreparable damage to the sea bed. Could I draw your readers# attention to the Facebook page #Stop Mechanical Kelp Dredging# The sea bed can’t be seen, but a bank statement can. No prizes for who is the loser. The  jobs in aquaculture will not last longmass kelp harvesting is allowed to decimate sub-sea environments and the only jobs on fish farms will be pushing barrows of diseased and dead fish.I’ve no doubt he knows that wind turbines have a -year le span and then the hugely disruptive process will start againan alternative has not been discovered. It has been calculated that the energy costs of a wind turbine will never be recovered during its lespan, but those receiving grants really don’t care.Why, given the amount of rainfall in Argyll, are hydro schemes not pursued  It used to be a mystery, until one looks at the vast sums of subsidy given by a gullible government to so called ‘alternative energy sources’, which actually means ‘alternative revenue sources’.There are any number of pretty glens that could be dammed, providing an extra environmentally-friendly leisure resource, create an opportunity for aquaculture and would not require a replacement somewhere down the line.Alexander Hamilton, Tayvallich.Sir,With reference to James Lithgow’s letter of September , it is important to make a couple of points.Mr Lithgow is right to say kelp has been sustainably harvested in Argyll for generations. There can be no comparison, however, with the current proposal to mechanically dredge up entire stands from the seabed together with all the fragile le that depends on them. This is not sustainable as evidenced in the few countries which have allowed this practice to take place.  Seaweed cultivation, on the other hand, is sustainable and more can be found on this through the Scottish Association for Marine Science.The  parliamentary inquiry into the environmental impact of salmon farming warned current methods could cause #irrecoverable damage#.  This is deeply concerning to those of us who live here, raise families and rely on the sea for our creel fishing, shellfish and tourism businesses. We also all have an inherent responsibility to care for our environment and there is increasing urgency to do this.Enterprises do need to be encouraged to grow and to provide opportunities and employment. This, however, must be done responsibly and with thought for the long-term viability of our communities.The profits of the predominantly multi-national salmon farming companies, who benefit from current loopholes in our environmental regulations, are well able to fund a responsible and researched approach for sustainability and erse employment opportunities. Norway, for example, is encouraging its salmon farmers to adopt closed containment and these methods are working well in a number of other countries, including the USA.The council has a legal responsibility for the environment and needs to take precautions for the future of Argyll, not just for job numbers today.If short-term interests are prioritised, all of our futures will be much the poorer.Will Self, on behalf of Friends of the Sound of JuraSir,Most schools in Scotland have pipers and drummers within their pupil population.Schools in Argyll are probably no exception.

Fish generate their own electricity by biological means, you see, and so have no need for charging points.Perhaps I shouldn#t even try to explain the joke to Mr Lithgow.I had hoped for a more cogent critique of the points I made, rather than the amateurish attempt to cover his lack of reasoning by smearing my origins and character, or what he erroneously imagines them to be, and by repeating the endless waffle of the wind industry#s PR department.One example: whenever a new wind farm is proposed there is a claim that it will provide electricity for a certain number of homes, say ,. What is not mentioned, however, except in very fine print at the bottom of the page, is that these figures are only achievable under perfect wind conditions, which rarely occur, and that the real output of usable electricity is a small fraction of the headline figure.What is also not mentioned is who is going to pay for the decommissioning costs when the wind farms inevitably turn into junk. Somehow, I don#t think it will be those who benefited financially. More likely, it will be us, the public, already being fleeced by inflated electricity bills, who will have to pay to haul thousands of tons of unrecyclable trash from our mountains or live forever with enormous eyesores.Let me restate the case for tidal power. The tides are generated by the moon as it orbits the Earth which creates gravitational pull on the oceans. These tides are predictable, both in power and timing, for centuries in advance, and will carry on being so until the moon eventually flies off into space some billions of years hence. There are two incoming tides and two outgoing every day, a total of four, each one involving an enormous quantity of moving water and thereby presenting the opportunity to generate electricity, totally free of carbon dioxide emissions.The UK, and especially Scotland, has an enormousof coastline. Scotland#s coast is about , kilometres, and Argyll accounts for a very high proportion of this because of the legacy of the last ice age which left us with such a convoluted coastline. So we have plenty of scope to exploit this resource.And we are doubly blessed because the complexity of our coastline results in the tides reaching dferent points at dferent times of the day. Therefore, by using several dferent sites, we could have an even amount of electricity always on tap.Wind and solar power cannot match this, either in quantity of power or dependability. They require a duplicate system of nuclear, coal, gas, and oil-fired generators always fired up and ready to kick in when the wind and sun refuse to co-operate # an enormously expensive system both in money and CO emissions.There is a case for subsidies during the infancy of any industry to get it started off.But the wind farm industry is not an infant # it is now a fully grown cuckoo. It has never has earned its keep and never will so it is time to chuck it out of the nest.Stuart White, Minard.Friday September  is World Alzheimer’s Day.There are , people with dementia in Scotland and , people with dementia across Argyll and Bute.

As he says, it is far too dependent on the vagaries of the weather.Tidal power can never fail and here in Mid Argyll we have potentially the most efficient and cost-effective tidal system under our noses. This, in turn, would open up additional tourist and recreational facilities at virtually no extra cost. This would be a win-win situation, but without, I suspect, sufficient profit to satisfy the usual parasitic financial interests.What is this simple and relatively inexpensive answer Simply build a sea wall or dam, call it what you will, across the relatively narrow entrance of Loch Gilp from the Lingerton promontary towards Ardrishaig via the rocky skerries, which would reduce the cost, and finish short of the Ardrishaig lighthouse harbour wall, thus funneling all the tides through a very narrow area.Then simply incorporate as many sea locks and gates as needed to allow passage of boats in and out of the harbour and the Crinan Canal.The additional locks would be used for either lower-able turbines or permanently submerged tidal units such as in the Pentland Firth. This would be simple and cost-effective, as the generating turbines catch the tides both in and out. After all, the Romans were using tide mills , years ago, so the idea is nothing new.In addition to this, Ardrishaig would finish up with an enhanced harbour  and marina and, with a few rocks removed from the beach, the wide open area at low tide back to Lochgilphead # now wasted # would make a splendid international course for activities such as land yacht racing.The other deceitful cuckoo that we should consider debunking is the very misleading fallacy that electric cars are helping to save the planet. Yes, it is ideal and justied for town or city use to keep the fume level down in densely built up areas where fresh air is in short supply among high buildings. But generally their use is unjustiable because pollution would actually increase considerably overall because to generate every single power unit of electricity it takes roughly two polluting units of other fuels such as coal, oil or even gas to produce that single electrical unit.So, unless the electricity is always generated from renewable systems such as hydro, tidal, solar or wind, then total pollution would go up, not down.One more cuckoo destined to be the sham of another expensive white elephant.Bob Henderson, LochgilpheadSir,We would like to say a huge thanks to all the bands who played on the Sunday of this year#s Tarbert Music Festival for making it a successful afternoon after the event had to be moved from the quay to the village hall # this has to be our most stressful decision.Thanks to all the hotels and pubs for organising the great music for the weekend.We raised just over £ at the coffee morning, so thanks to everyone who baked or donated and also to all the helpers # Anne, Gail,Jane, Allie, Nina and Zena.Many thanks also to the award-winning Mid Argyll Pipe Band, who entertained a huge crowd in the pouring rain and also the Loch Fyne Pipe Band who played to the Sunday survivors.To Mrs Brown, our very own collector extrondanaire, her wee buckets totalled £.Finally, and most importantly, thanks to visitors and locals for turning out to support our music festival.Thank you all.Margaret, Duncan, Barbara and Kirsten of Tarbert Music FestivalSir,The National Autistic Society is looking for people and organisations who have done something amazing for autistic children, adults, or their families.Perhaps it’s a teacher who has helped a child achieve something great, an autistic adult who has been campaigning tirelessly or a business that has put a lot of effort into making their workplace accessible.If any of your readers know of a person or organisation like this, please nominate them for our seventh annual Autism Professionals Awards.

Star lost possession in midfield and Connor Crawford’s clearance was closed down by the Kings Park forward whose shot beat Kalache from the edge of the box and the hosts took a - lead on the hour mark.This visibly knocked the confidence of the Star team and Kings added a second goal when poor play again from Star trying to break gted possession to the hosts and once again their striker was on hand to make it - and give Star a mountain to climb in the last twenty minutes.Star didn’t give up however and could have been back in the game when the ball fell to Gregor Peacock in the box, the ing striker hit the shot and the ball was saved by the Kings Park goalkeeper.Kyle Selfridge went close to claiming a late leline but his free kick from twenty yards cannoned off the bar and the game finished - to the home side.The Star management team were disappointed as that’s the first time the Lochgilphead side have failed to score in the league in more than two years.On Saturday November  Red Star play host to Campbeltown pupils in what looks like another tough league match.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13548879.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_JS166431538.jpg","title":"beith juniors president says club","story":"NewsBeith Juniors president says club are ready for Scottish Cup day with Ayr UnitedThe Mighty president, John Boal, says Ayrs large travelling support will be given a warm welcome at Bellsdale Park.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  NOV NewsBeith president John Boal\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailBosses at Beith Juniors today insisted they are ready and able to host Ayr United in the Scottish Cup.

Accusations of spies lurking furtively in the shadows. And claims of sabotage as posters advertising a “summit” meeting are mysteriously ripped off walls and hoardings. No – it’s not a meeting of the Klu Klux Klan in Hickory Hollow, Arakansas in the s. And no . . . it’s not a clandestine, cover-up being leaked in the basement of Washington’s Watergate Hotel in the s. This is Troon, South Ayrshire  . . . and the cloak-and-dagger involves the proposed take-over of a community activity centre. It’s Dundonald Gymnastics Clubversus Muirhead Tennants and Residents Association . And in the middle we have SAC. Normally this would mean South Ayrshire Council . . . but in this case, it really stands for Sell All Centres. Andthere’s room for another acronym – let’s throw in the real reason behind this rammy – it’s called C.A.T . . . Community Asset Transfer. SAC wants to get Muirhead Activity Centre – and its running costs – off its books. DCG – a well organised and well funded gymnastic club – would love it as their new permanent home. They’re currently based in Dundonald Activity Centre – but having to move vaulting horses and other equipment after every session is apparently getting in the way of healthy exercise. With DACattached to Dundonald Primary School and protected from CAT, the Muirhead building is a sitting target for them. But DGC operate classes seven days a week – and a take-over would leave little or no room for other sports and clubs that currently use Muirhead. And it’s this possible exclusion of other sports and interests - by a single self-serving club - that has rightly upset MTRA. But the real villain in this localised skirmish is the Community Asset Transfer policy itself. Our local council is using it as a convenient back door to off load the expense of running village halls and community properties across the whole of South Ayrshire. Interestingly, last week’s Budget - in a nod to the centenary of  – announced extra funding to protect and preserve the many village halls built to help small communities recover from the ravages of the Great War. In stark contrast, South Ayrshire Council wants to wash their hands of them! The Muirhead decision will finally fall to a full SAC meeting. It will be interesting to seethe four elected Troon councillors look their constituents in the eye – or choose to look away in line with council policy. From where I sit, Dundonald Gymnastics Club has  plus members, a waiting list, over  internet followers and employs more coaches than Dodds of Troon. It appears everyone and their auntie wants to see the wean wearing a wee blue leotard and a medal. That’s fine. But surely not at the expense of other children with other interests and needs. If DGC want a place to themselves – let them find it and fund it themselves.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilSchoolsWorld War TroonDundonaldAyr"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13563563.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_boyle.jpg","title":"danny boyles armistice tribute pages","story":"NewsDanny Boyles Armistice tribute Pages of the Sea to honour British Armys first black officer on Ayr beachA large-scale portrait of Walter Tull designed by sand artists Sand In Your Eye, will be drawn into the sand on the beach and washed away as the tide comes in.ShareByAbi Smillie:,  NOV NewsLieutenant Walter Tull\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe first black officer in the British Army will be commemorated on Ayr beach as part of director Danny Boyle’s Armistice commission Pages of the Sea. Lieutenant Walter Tull, was Britain’s second black professional footballer who had signed up with Rangers, and trained as an officer cadet in Gailes, Ayrshire. Walter- along with millions of other soldiers- will be honoured on Sunday, November  in a nationwide gesture of remembrance. A large-scale portrait of Walter Tull designed by sand artists Sand In Your Eye, will be drawn into the sand on the beach and washed away as the tide comes in. And the public will be asked to join in by creating silhouettes of people in the sand, remembering the millions of lives lost or changed forever by the conflict. The project is the latest collaboration between the National Theatre of Scotland and - NOW, the UK’s arts programme for the World War  centenary, and will use  beaches all around the UK as their canvasses for the mass art-work. Each of the beaches taking part in the project will commemorate a dferent WW casualty.  Walter Tull was born to Alice Elizabeth Palmer, from Kent, and Daniel Tull from Barbados, the son of a slave, on April , . After the death of his parents he and his brother Edward were placed in a children’s home in Bethnal Green. Edward was later adopted and it is believed that he went on to be Britain’s first black dentist after taking over his father’s practice on St Vincent Street in Glasgow. Walter, however, began playing football with Tottenham Hotspur in , and after touring South America with them he was offered a contract, making him the second black professional footballer in Britain. When playing for Tottenham and later Northampton Town he faced a lot of racial abuse and prejudice, yet he went on to have a successful football career. In , Northampton Town began negotiations to transfer Tull to Glasgow Rangers. However, the First World War broke out before Tull could play a game for Rangers. He enlisted as a private in the Footballers’ Battalion of the British Army, where he was quickly promoted to be a sergeant. He took part in and survived the Battle of the Somme, after which he was sent to England to recover from illness. He then went to train as an officer cadet in Gailes, Ayrshire. Although black officers were not allowed in the British Army at this time, he was commissioned in May , thus becoming the first black combat officer in the British Army. He died in battle in France in , during the last major German offensive. His body was never found. Walter will be remembered this Sunday as the public pay their respects to millions of fallen servicemen. • Activities on Ayr beach will happen between .am and am.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnBritish ArmyArmed forcesAdoptionWorld War Ayr United FCAyr NewsAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"detectives step up hunt armed","story":"NewsDetectives step up their hunt for armed thugs who attacked and attempted to rob woman in her homeShareByGary Fanning:,  NOV Updated:,  NOV NewsPolice are now appealing for information after the incident\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailDetectives today have stepped up their hunt for two armed thugs who attacked a terried woman and tried rob her in her Ayr home.

decide on the next steps in the national interest.ldquoI am confident that this takes us signicantly closer to delivering what the British people voted for in the referendum.ldquoWe will take back

year.Figures released through a freedom of information request show that over the last five years, council bin crews have failed to empty more than , bins from around , households.Furthermore, the number of bins missed each year has been rising since , when , bins collections were missed.Three years later, in , that number had risen to ,, and already this year , bins have been missed.Opposition councillors have lined up to criticise the figures, particularly in the wake of allegations that Scottish Borders Council is considering moving to three-weekly bin collections when the budget is proposed in February of next year.Hawick and Denholm councillor Clair Ramage said: ldquoBin collection is a very emotive subject and as councillors we receive many complaints over this very issue.ldquoTo see that there has been a rise in the number of missed bin collections is extremely alarming and has to be investigated as a matter of urgency but this is only the tip of the iceberg.ldquoIn the last month we have been informed that Scottish Borders Council is considering tri-weekly uplts, a change that I am completely opposed to.ldquoAt the moment Scottish Borders Council is struggling as we have seen householders use their recycling bins for general waste when their general waste bins are full.ldquoThis creates other problems, the recycling vehicles are then contaminated with general waste and have to pay penalties to the processing company.ldquoIf bi-weekly lts are not working then tri weekly lts will create even more problems, for example fly tipping.ldquoI realise that budgets are tight but the combination of missed bin collections resulting in rubbish spilling over encouraging vermin is not something that as a community we should accept.Hawick and Hermitage councillor Watson McAteer also commented: \"I do not recall missed bin collections being a statistic that is regularly shared with councillors. Perhaps the fact that for whatever reason , bins have failed to be collected explains why this is not on public record.ldquoI am regularly receiving complaints from constituents who find their bins still full on the pavement after the collection date.ldquoWhile of course there will always be occasions when the council have no control of the situation the figures being produced certainly challenge the current collection policy.ldquoCan you imagine the problems this would causethree-weekly collection was to be introduced  I for one will not support such a move and would ask the council to explain to council tax payers why this problem exists and what they are doing to resolve it.According to data collected by the Local Government Benchmarking Framework, which is a comparison network for Scottish councils, . per cent of Scottish Borders are satisfied with their local refuse collection.However, this is below the Scottish average of . per cent and is the second lowest of the rural and island councils that Scottish Borders Council is grouped with.The council also spends pound. per premises on waste disposal, which is below the Scottish average of pound..Leader of the opposition and Tweeddale East councillor Stuart Bell said that Scottish Borders Council officers work hard to recty issues, but residents need to be aware of how to report missed bin collections.He said: ldquoI will be interested in the councilrsquos conclusions on the long term trend. As I recall there has been a gradual introduction of food waste collections into the larger communities in the last few years, so the number of total collections may have increased at the same time as the number of missed collections has increased.ldquoBut I am concerned to see the detail of missed bin collections. I had expected, and can see, that the number of missed collections is higher in the winter months when the teams can have dficulty getting round in the snow, but it is worrying that the level of missed collections never drops below  in any one month. ldquoThe public needs to know that there is a very easy mechanism of reporting missed collections on the councilrsquos website and, in my experience, refuse and recycling staff at Scottish Borders Council do follow-up on issuesthere is a systematic cause.A spokesperson for Scottish Borders Council said that the number of bins left unemptied each year is actually very small compared to the number the council collection.The authorityrsquos waste management service says it collects around .m bins each year, meaning the number of missed bins equates to less than half a per cent.The spokesperson said: ldquoThe number of missed bin collections over the last five years will be dependent on a number of factors including: the provision of a new weekly food waste service to around , households in  access issues due to obstruction and road closures vehicle breakdowns adverse weather service error an increase in the number of new homes which bins are collected from each year and bins not being presented by householders by am on scheduled collection days and incorrectly reported as missed.ldquoIt is not possible to determine the exact cause of any increase in missed collections but the increasingly challenging winters experienced across the Borders will be having an impact.ldquoThat was the case this year, when the extreme winter conditions experienced in January, February and March caused signicant disruption, with three full days where collections were unable to be carried out across the Borders.ldquoHouseholders reporting a missed collection over this period will have contributed signicantly to the increase this year."},{"url":null,"title":"irish-opposition-leader-dismayed-by-dup-response-to-brexit-proposal","story":"Irish opposition leader Micheal Martin has criticised the Democratic Unionists over their reaction to the Brexit deal reached between the UK and the EU.DUP leader Arlene Foster voiced concern about the deal, while East Antrim MP Sammy Wilson said his party will not vote for it.All of the great and the good who were rolled out during the #EURefwill be rolled out again in the coming weeks to try and get us to fall into line.

She is originally from another European country but has made Haddington her home, with her husband and two wonderful children.Her explorations of nearby woods led her to discover an unusual grave amongst the trees. It is a grave of a horse, buried in the th century. It was this grave she had offered to show me. To get there we had a beautul walk along a secluded section of the banks of the Tyne. It was the trees I noticed first, of course, which were dotted along the banks of the river.Autumn was just then beginning to brush the trees with its colour, and it was one of those evenings when the setting sun seemed to take its time, bathing the land in bright streaks of orange light. Along the way, Marije paused and said: ldquoThis is my tree.It was a beech tree of signicant age, its branches arching over the Tyne, asfishing. She showed me her sitting place, underneath its embracing canopy. Here the roots curved to make a natural seat. Her older son spoke of seeing kingfishers, and sure enough, this was a perfect place to absorb the majesty of the Tyne as it flowed towards Haddington. Another beech of similar age grew close by. Their branches entwined, making it look like they were sisters holding hands.But I sensed then there was more to Marijersquos connection to this place, although I then had no idea just how powerful her story was.When we finally got to our destination in the woods further upriver, the light was too weak to penetrate the trees. The old grave of the horse was shrouded in darkness.Yet with the help of mobile torches we could view it, and for sure the grave was interesting and worth a story in its own right. I vowed to find out more about its background as we headed back to Marijersquos house in the dying embers of a sunset.When we reached her house we were treated to wonderful hospitality. It was then that Marije told her story of the beech tree.Not long ago she had been diagnosed with cancer. She faced the possibility of being taken by this cruel disease. Numbness and disbelief at first overcame her, then there was the realisation that le might be very short and she would have to leave her two young children.She walked to the beech tree soon after her diagnosis and sat cradled by its roots. Despite having family and friends whose love and support was invaluable, Marije explained it can also be a desperately lonely feeling. ldquoWe all know we canrsquot live forever, she told me, ldquobut to face the reality of my end at such a young age and with children was unbearable.ldquoI went on that walk to the tree in the most dire situation, she told me. ldquoI felt a connection as I sat under the tree, I really felt her old wisdom and energy.Her love for her young children is what gave her strength in the worst of times. The tree seemed to symbolise this powerful bond, its roots deeply holding it safe.ldquoPeople talk about mother nature, Marije said, ldquoand I understand why. When my hair fell out, I lsquogave it backrsquo to nature, underneath the beech. I know it makes me sound weird, but it really helped me.It is not weird, of course. Trees are full of wisdom, not in the sense of actual words but in the spiritual sense. Beech is said to be the matriarch of the wood, sometimes called the mother of the forest. It is a good listener. Our best ideas and inner reflections can come when we sit under the embrace of an old tree even science tells us this now.Sadly not everyone wins the fight against cancer, but thankfully Marije recovered after treatment. The experience has left her treasuring every single day and taking no sunrise for granted. And she is thankful to her beech tree, which was her companion and confidant in those times of emotional agony. It remains for her a place of contemplation and peace, where she can give thanks and absorb the joy of being alive.ldquoI cherish every day now in ways I didnrsquot before, she told me. ldquoI think it is important to allow our kids to feel the connection with nature. That means being in nature, and respecting it. After all, we are all part of it.This was the real story of that walk on that day a story of incredible bravery, pain, love and determination by a young mum I now have the privilege to call a friend."},{"url":null,"title":"labour-ties-bring-meeting-to-a-halt","story":"Prestonpans businessman Ferhan Ashiq had applied to increase the size of an alcohol display ndashand for a name change ndash at one of his stores.But Councillor Jim Goodfellowimmediately recused himself from the application because of his friendship with Mr Ashiq, who is a member of East Lothian Labour Party.After a short adjournment, Councillor Fiona Dugdale , convenor, also declared an interest.Remaining Labour councillor John McMillan, however, said he did not believe his relationship with Mr Ashiq, who has shops in Musselburgh and Prestonpans, could have an impact on his ability to make a decision, while Conservative councillor Jane Henderson said she did not know him.The boardrsquos legal adviser described the situation as ldquounusual but said the board was no longer quorate and Mr Ashiqrsquos application would have to be continued to the next licensing board for a decision.But a bemused Mr Ashiq noted: ldquoWhen it comes to the next meeting I will know most of the board members there.Legal adviser Carlo Grilli advised Mr Ashiq to send his father, whose name was on the application, and an agent instead.The application was to change the name of Mr Ashiqrsquos Prestonpans store on Redburn Road from Day-Today to Day Todayand increase the alcohol display from . square metres to . square metres."},{"url":null,"title":"rare-bottle-of-whisky-to-be-auctioned-for-combat-stress-charity","story":"It is one of only , matured in an American bourbon barrel for eight years, with a cask strength of  per cent alcohol.The auction is part of a fundraiser for Combat Stress, the veteransrsquo mental health charity, and is being organised by the music group the Flying Aspidistras ahead of their concert of remembrance, Now the Guns are Silent, at Gosford House on Sunday.The occasion will be a reflection on the harsh reality of war and the suffering felt beyond the battlefield.Kilchoman distillery on Islay has bottled this special single cask to coincide with the centenary of the end of the First World War.More poignantly, it is also to commemorate the sinking of two troopships, the SS Tuscania and the HMS Otranto, with the loss of nearly  men, in the waters around Islay in .Ailsa Fortune, the events organiser, said: \"The war affected every community in Scotland, from Islay to East Lothian.\"The end of any war leaves many broken lives.

network was a ldquodirect result of cuts to local authority funding by the Scottish Government.He said: ldquoThe condition of roads is a problem across Scotland. This is a direct result of the Scottish Government slashing council funding over this period, with East Lothian Council having suffered cuts of around pound million in the last five years.ldquoEast Lothian Council has done its utmost to protect the budget.ldquoThe Scottish Government needs to recognise the impact its cuts are having and give local authorities the funding they need to protect services, including road maintenance.The county is currently covered by km of roads, ranging from class A routes to unclassied lanes.And an Annual Status and Options Report, produced on behalf of East Lothian Council, has revealed that  per cent are currently in need of repair.The report, which looks at the impact of future funding on network maintenance in the long term, warns that the current level of investment of pound.million a year will mean that more than  per cent of the roads will be in a state of disrepair in  yearsrsquo time.And it reveals that, as an asset, East Lothian Councilrsquos carriageways depreciate in value by poundmillion every year.It also found that nearly km of rural public roads in the county were in poor condition and needed immediate investigation and possible treatment.The report said: ldquoThe level of investment on public roads in East Lothian has not been sufficient to limit the decline in the overall condition of the network.It revealed that additional investment of pound.million over the next  years could signicantlyimprove the state of the roads, with fewer than  per cent likely to need repairs by the end of the decade.Peter Forsyth, asset manager for East Lothian Council, said that the recommendation for operating the carriageways following the report was to continue with the current level of investment.In a report to the councilrsquos policy and performance review committee, he said the costs of corrective treatments, in particular carriageway reconstruction, were ldquoprohibitive and a preventative treatment approach should ldquomitigate the need to invest signicantly.But he warned: ldquoShort-term under-investment could result in major long-term expenditure necessary to recty major defects which could have been addressed earlier.Councillor Jane Henderson , leader of the opposition, said: ldquoOur road infrastructure assets are vital and dficult decisions will need to be made.ldquoWithout investment now the amount of money needed in the future will be a greater problem the old expression of lsquoa stitch in time saves ninersquo was never so apt.ldquoThe decision on how much to spend on roads now will inevitably mean choices. Money will have to be found and some services which are lsquonice to haversquo may have to see new or increased charges.

This process starts again now and the Conservative Group will play the fullest role it can in determining a responsible approach to our vital infrastructure.Councillor Stuart Currie, SNP Group leader, said: ldquoMore investment is required in roads to ensure that we keep up the momentum.ldquoIt is concerning that the current level of investment is not enough to prevent conditions deteriorating further.

With  holiday lodges crammed on to the former fairways, the beautul landscape and its wildle will be lost forever. There is another way! A country park, managed by a charitable trust, could deliver fantastic community benefits, education and natural play spaces, as well as jobs and spend in the local community, enhancing rather than damaging the environment.The spokesman said it was ldquohugely questionable that  new self-catered lodges were needed, adding: ldquoAny search on [property rental website] Airbnb will show an average of  self-catering options available in North Berwick pretty much every week between September and May, so an additional  could actually overload and damage the existing tourism market.

Visitors will be able to access it via a walkway.The plans were originally turned down after an objection from Transport Scotland, which felt it would ldquoresult in inappropriate parking which would interfere with the safety and free flow of traffic on the A.However, at the local review body meeting, three councillors disagreed and gave it the go-ahead.Among those approving the plans was ward councillor Norman Hampshire.

It is a collection of stories and anecdotes mainly relating to sporting le and animals.The following tale is inspired from one of the anecdotal stories in Eganrsquos book:ONE autumn evening in the early th century, a storm descended on the county. Dark clouds opened their dreich souls and drenched the land with a torrent of rain. The wind and downpour kept people awake for the whole night, and but by sunrise the tempest was over.Yet all the sudden rain had caused the River Tyne to flood. The folk of Haddington gathered by its banks to witness a strange sight. For the surface of the water was laid with huge masses of hay. The storm had obviously caused the hay recently cut and stacked in the fields upriver to be blown into the flood water, or swept away by it.They watched as small mountains of hay floated by. It was an intriguing sight but of course for farmers it was their winter feed for their animals going waste to the sea.Then someone spotted a swan. It seemed to be attempting to find a place to land. The river was in a torrent and at times the majestic creature seemed to give in to the current and glide on its course until once again it found the strength and motivation to make for the river bank. It was in no imminent danger, but clearly desired to get out of the fast-moving water.As people watched the swan it was noticed that a strange black spot could be seen amidst its white feathers. As the swan drted closer to the bank, people realised what the black spot was: a rat!The rat was clearly alive, at times peeping over the plumage asto see where they were. The swan seemed unperturbed by the ratrsquos presence on its back. In fact, as people watched more closely there seemed to be a connection between the swan and the rat which was most unusual.The royal bird was clearly giving the rat a collie-buckie, or piggy back. How the rat came to be on the swanrsquos back in the first place nobody could tell. The wee creature was very likely at home in one of the bales of hay when it was swept away by the river. In the swirling water it must have struggled to survive.Then rescue came with the swan. Could the creature have scrambled onto the swan without its permission  Surely not! Did the swan actively help the rat  If so, the moment of rescue had been a compassionate act unseen by human eyes. As people followed the drama they realised that the swan was looking for a place to land, not for itself but for its passenger.A crowd had soon gathered to witness the swanrsquos progress. The power of the flood water meant it had real dficulty in finding a place to get close to the river bank. But finally the swan found the strength and opportunity to swim close to the riverrsquos edge.The rat, recognising the opportunity, leaped from the swanrsquos plumage and landed safely on dry land. For an instant the rat turned and looked at the swan, then scampered away. The swan, its mission accomplished, majestically glided back into the main flow of the river.If the rat had thought itself safe then it soon realised this not to be the case. The people watching the spectacle had motivations very dferent to the swan. As soon as the rat landed, dozens of young men, urged on by their elders, chased it with sticks and set their dogs upon it.The animal, having survived naturersquos tempest, now faced an even greater danger his le was sport for humans. The creature zigzagged as people, yelling and howling with delight, chased it this way, then that. The rat, being cornered by a group of about  lads armed with stones and sticks, turned and headed back towards the water.But it didnrsquot make it. The creature was given a deadly blow by a lsquomerciless fellowrsquo. A cheer rang out and people came to view the dead rat. Then a strange silence descended as people reflected, now too late, on what had happened. In the frenzy of the chase it had been so easy to see the rat as merely vermin, rather than a living creature who had struggled to survive and so earned the right to le.People dispersed, no longer cheering.The whole scene had been witnessed by the swan from its vantage point on the river. What its thoughts were on the human behaviour it saw we can only guess.Humans can be made to do this to each other as well, of course. In the frenzy of war, people are encouraged to see others as no more worthy of le than that rat. And the insidious power of this is that both sides are encouraged to think the same way.But deep down, when we touch our humanity, we know how wrong this is. Old soldiers themselves are the first to understand the tragedy of it and see the humanity in those who had been on the lsquoother sidersquo. While there are undoubtedly people who commit evil and need to be stopped, it is the conditions which allow hate to flourish which give rise to their power and influence in the first place.In our remembrance of those who have fallen, let us do so with the reflection and not the frenzy. Let us not forget that the real enemy of us all is hate."},{"url":null,"title":"inspectors-impressed-on-visit-to-elphinstone-primary-school","story":"Parents of youngsters at Elphinstone Primary School and Nursery Class received a letter this week from Education Scotland and the Care Inspectorate following an inspection visit in September.The letter outlined a number of strengths at the school, as well as areas to improve.Fiona Robertson, head of education at East Lothian Council, told the Courier: ldquoWe are pleased that inspectors from both agencies recognise the positive dference that nursery and primary school staff are making for the children and their families in Elphinstone.ldquoThey considered leadership, learning, attainment and wellbeing amongst other areas and concluded that the school was good across these quality indicators.ldquoIrsquom especially pleased to see Alison Cameron receive recognition for her leadership and direction so early in her time as headteacher of the school.ldquoI know that she and the staff team will continue to put pupilsrsquo learning at the heart of all they do.ldquoIrsquod also like to recognise Heather Williamsrsquo work in laying the foundations for this positive outcome during her time at Elphinstone.The letter noted strengths in the schoolrsquos work, including kind and articulate children who make the most of their learning, and the warm, inclusive ethos that creates a family feel.No further inspections are planned, with the school urged to ldquodevelop a strategic, joined-up approach to self-evaluation to ensure that all children can achieve the best possible outcomes and to continue to develop the curriculum.Councillor Shamin Akhtar, cabinet spokeswoman for education, echoed the comments of Mrs Robertson regarding the schoolrsquos former and current headteacher.She said: ldquoThe inspection recognised a number of areas such as the positive relationships across the nursery and school which are making a dference for children and families.ldquoThey also commented that children were making the most of their learning and were provided with real leadership opportunities at the school."},{"url":null,"title":"austerity-over-in-the-county-definitely-not","story":"Jim Lamond, head of East Lothian Council resources, dismissed claims austerity was coming to an end as a report warned of uncertainty about the future of farming, food and drink, and tourism after the UK left the European Union .Audit Scotland identied the potential problems facing East Lothian as the key sectors of its economy came under risk.

reports that a senior Brussels negotiator has said the deal will mean the UK aligns its rules with Europe, while the EU ldquowill retain all the controls.At Prime Ministerrsquos Questions, Mrs May told MPs: ldquoThe Cabinet will decide on the next steps in the national interest.ldquoI am confident that this takes us signicantly closer to delivering what the British people voted for in the referendum.ldquoWe will take back control of our borders, our laws and our money, leave the Common Fisheries Policy and the Common Agricultural Policy while protecting jobs, security and the integrity of our United Kingdom.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the draft deal was ldquoa failure in its own terms and a senior spokesman said that the ldquolikelihood was that the party would vote against it in the Commons.Irish premier Leo Varadkar said the draft deal could provide the basis for a summit of EU leaders by the end of the month, potentially on November .ldquoIt is yet to be agreed by the UK Government and they will discuss it this afternoon, and it is yet to be agreed by the European Council, and we may be in a position to have an emergency European Council meeting before the end of the

that Sabine Weyand ndash deputy to EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier ndash told ambassadors the UKldquowould have to swallow a link between access to products and fisheries in future agreements and

This outline remains open for further negotiation ahead of any summit and a final deal will depend on it being acceptable to the UK in its full form.In an apparent response to Ms Weyandrsquos comments, the Prime Minister said: ldquoI am aware of the concerns that there are, that we donrsquot want to be in a position where the European Union would find it comfortable to keep the UK in the backstop permanently.ldquoThatrsquos why any backstop has to be temporary.The ldquobackstop is intended as a fallback arrangement to avoid a hard border with Ireland unless a wider trade agreement can

I noticed it one day when I went to collect my son. This would have been around .I mentioned it to a friend. She and I were in the same womens group and a friend of hers had died from breast cancer. The brass plaque beside the tree was mottled and not very well looked after.One day I saw my friend cleaning it. She told me that her friend who died had been active in the feminist economic movement and she was cleaning the plaque in her memory. The Glasgow Womens Library got involved and they campaigned for it to be Tree of the Year in .The Suffragette Oak makes me think about the forgotten history of these women: the hard work and striving that went unnoticed. Thanks to these women who went that extra mile, we now have the vote ndash we have a voice.The tree was badly damaged in a storm last year and the council had to make it safe. The bits cut off were given to Glasgow Womens Library and they are making it into things to sell to raise funds. Isnt that lovely Another special tree was one I saw at a holiday place we rented at Achnacloich, near Oban.The gardens there have this amazing redwood that looks like a gigantic hand.The reason it looks like a hand was that when it was planted a rabbit kept nibbling the bud in the middle. Every time this rabbit nibbled it, another shoot would come out the side. It was one of the first redwoods to be grown in Scotland.We were staying there with loads of kids and it was the best climbing tree in the world ndash they would get lost in it.You would be sitting outside having a cup of tea in the morning and suddenly hear a wee voice from up in the tree asking: \"Whats your favourite flavour of crisps \"Carole Baxter, Beechgrove Garden presenterI LOVE rowan trees. All the species are beautul. There is such a range of colourful berries and they are a hardy plant. In my garden in Aberdeenshire I have eight ieties including cashmiriana, Joseph Rock and the native rowan.I have enjoyed the rowan for its berries as long as I can remember, certainly from a young age. It is a value-for-money plant: you have the blossom and fruits, lovely foliage and great autumn colour.People perhaps arent aware of the range of species and named ieties. You dont need to have the one that has the orange-red berries you can get white, yellow and pink berries.There are some small ones as well, such as Sorbus reducta which is ideal for a rock garden. We have that one at Beechgrove as well as vilmorinii, which has pink berries with almost blueish foliage. Those were my plant choices.What is interesting is that birds tend to home in on the red and orange berries to start off with so,you have cashmiriana with its white berries, it tends to hold the berries a bit longer.This year has been particularly good for the fruits because we had a cold spring and it gradually got warmer, so we didnt have the frost and the blossoms werent damaged, which was then followed by a nice hot summer.It is nothing to do with the fact we are going to have a hard winter as people often say ndash thats an old wives tale ndash it is the fact that we have had a good season.Episodes of Beechgrove Garden are available on BBC iPlayer until November Gordon Buchanan, wildle filmmakerSCOTS pine has been my favourite tree from a young age. I grew up on Mull and I have always loved woodland. I spent a lot of time as a kid walking through the woods.One walk we did took us a mile or so out of Tobermory. When you are eight or nine, even just going a couple of miles out of town feels like you are exploring the other side of the planet.It was while out walking that I first saw a Scots pine. It was one of those classic old \"granny\" pines with so much character, the limbs were all twisted ndash there was one that came out at a right angle and shot skywards.This Scots pine stood among mixed birch and there was no other tree around it that looked the same. It seemed so exotic and out of place. Your eye was drawn to it.As I got older and spent time in the Cairngorms and Abernethy Forest, I learned that much of Scotland was covered in forests filled with these trees. I thought it was the most magical habitat.The tree then became a symbol for all the wildle that you find living in those forests. I have spent time filming capercaillie as well as red deer, red squirrels and pine martens among the trees.Weirdly, now I have travelled further than just a couple of miles out of town, whenever I see Scots pine, they dont look exotic to me. I have recently been working in Russia where there is mixed birch woodland and what I call \"Caledonian Forest\" ndash this reminder of home.My love of Scots pine is undiminished but they have gone from being a symbol of the exotic to something very familiar.A couple of years ago I was working in a mountainous region of Turkey and you could almost have been in the Cairngorms. It was very similar. I felt at home.Animal Families and Me with Gordon Buchanan is at Kirkintilloch Town Hall on November , Brunton Theatre in Musselburgh on November  and Rothes Halls in Glenrothes on November Kirsty Wark, broadcasterA TREE is a marker, something you look out for at a particular time of year. My Japanese maple in the garden, for example, you just know when the leaves are going to turn, be vivid and then flutter to the ground.The yellow-berried rowan is one of my favourite trees. I love lime trees because I think they are so vivid in the landscape.Trees represent a constancy. Planting trees is entirely altruistic because, unless they are fast-growing, you are never in your letime going to get the real benefit of them. I love the fact that parks were laid out by the Victorians ndash and even much earlier with Lancelot \"Capability\" Brown.After my father died, we planted a rowan where he loved to fish most, which was Kendoon Loch in Galloway. That was in . It is beside the water and Im not sure it is the most fertile place for it, but it is hanging on in there. I went to see it last week.In Celtic mythology the rowan symbolises courage and protection. That is why you will often see old houses with rowans planted in the front garden by the gate. We planted a red rowan for Dad, but I really like a yellow rowan too.I used to know the names of all the trees because I was in the Brownies. I dont know them all now. I love walking in the forest up to Glenashdale Falls and Whiting Bay on Arran, those specic spaces where you are surrounded by flora and fauna.Sir John Lister-Kaye, author and naturalistTHERE is an ash tree that is one of the biggest trees in the garden here at House of Aigas near Beauly and almost certainly the oldest ndash it is possibly  years old. It is right beside the house.Ashwas a very valuable timber throughout the th and th centuries. It was used for all sorts of things ndash implement handles, cart frames, furniture.It is a very good, close-grained hardwood. Very few ash trees ever survived more than  or  years, perhaps  years, because they were too valuable. Highlanders were not well off and it was a good way of making money.There are very few old ash trees in the Highlands. This one has survived simply because it is so close to an th-century house and I think the owners must have said many times: \"Dont fell that tree, we like it\". And so it survived.What is wonderful about it is that it has survived for so long and that means it has seen so much. For instance, it will have seen Bonnie Prince Charlie come through raising the clans which, of course, culminated in the Battle of Culloden.It saw the folk mourning after the loss of Culloden and it saw Cholmondeleys regiment come and camp here and then burn the tacksmans house down right beside it. The tree must have been scorched by that fire. The Frasers who were living here at the time were all murdered in May .It has witnessed some real horrors. Later, it will have witnessed the Highland Clearances, people pulling out and leaving for the New World. It will have witnessed the Victorians arriving with their grand ideas and turning the place into a sporting estate.This \"loftier ash\", as I call it ndash because that is what Fraxinus excelsior means ndash has seen a lot of history and for that reason alone it is a very valuable tree. In my book Song of the Rolling Earth: A Highland Odyssey, I dedicated a whole chapter to it.Let me read you a bit from it: \"The ash tree has witnessed it all. I stand at its foot. Great roots have corrugated the ground around it with broad woody thongs undulating outwards in a circular plate of tangle and deep grip, roots that trail far across the lawns in every direction.\"It is solid, purposeful, locked in. Its trunk writhes with power. It is all heart. My fullest reach, both arms stretched, extends to less than a third of its circumference an inconsequential hug leaving me in awe of its rigid grandeur.\"Its bark is deeply grooved with long vertical ripples of hardness like a throng of ribbed buttresses all heading upward, shoring up its might, shedding veils of green dust at my touch.\"The bark fissures draw in treecreepers: those tiny mouse-like birds that dash upwards in little jerky pulses, defying gravity. Then, giving in to the earths pull, they flick down again, back to start, like a game of snakes and ladders never won.\"I am enthralled by this tree, rapt. Every time I stand here, I shrink it grows. I age it shrugs off such foibles and just goes on expanding into a thousand shaded alleys. What is  minutes or a week when you are  years old \"Song of the Rolling Earth: A Highland Odyssey by Sir John Lister-Kaye is published by Abacus, priced pound.. Visit aigasPaul Murton, Grand Tours of Scotland presenterA TREE that I have always admired is a rowan that grows from a huge boulder. It is one that everyone will have seen as they are driving north up the A to Fort William.Just as you get to Rannoch Moor and are climbing up above Loch Tulla, there on the left-hand side of the road is a massive boulder left over from the Ice Age.There is a crack in it where, for many years, this amazing little rowan tree has been growing.It has been blasted by the elements and cant be getting many nutrients from the rock, so I dont know how it survives.There is something quite symbolic about it. I have filmed it several times for programmes over the years. It also appears in one of my favourite books, Mountaineering in Scotland by WH Murray.In fact, the first time I saw this rowan tree was in WH Murrays book when I was  or .I hitchhiked from Dunoon to Glencoe to go climbing and I remember seeing it in the flesh and thinking: \"Oh, thats the one in the book\".That was exciting because I felt I was on the trail of real mountaineers. Any mountaineer who had been up to Glencoe going back decades will have seen that wee tree.How did it end up there  Perhaps a crow or a raven carried a berry, dropped it and it then got stuck in a crack where there was enough nutrients for roots to grow. It must be at least  years old.Im a bit of a secret tree hugger. I planted a lot of trees at my mothers place in Argyll years ago and it is nice to admire how much they have grown. There are a couple of chestnut trees, beech trees and Scots pine.Episodes of Grand Tours of Scotlands Lochs are available on BBC iPlayer until November . The series will be repeated on BBC in Greg McHugh, actorI GREW up in Morningside in Edinburgh and at the bottom of the garden were steps down to a wood. There was a mud road with a wall and trees behind it. I loved spending time there.All the kids in my street would go down and play. It was an incredible place. I know people think of Morningside as being posh, but this wasnt a kept space. It was completely wild and overgrown. My mum would always shout as I went out the door: \"Dont go near the giant hogweed!\"It was this little hidden spot in the city. When I was in third year at school, I did a history project on it and learned that this was the old \"poorhouse\" road that had grown over.To think of the families that would have walked up and down there, the trees have been witness to all of that.We would gather conkers, climb and make rope swings among the trees and put old doors down over the stream. On fireworks night there would be a big bonfire and all the families in the street went along.One of my brothers mates stood on a wasps nest and was incredibly badly stung. Afterwards it gave spending time among the trees a new element of risk. The thing that sticks in my mind is that, while during the day it was our playground, we would never dare go down there at night.The inaugural Scottish Tree Festival organised by Discover Scottish Gardens features more than  tree-themed events and runs until December .

To find a location, he followed instructions said to have come to him in a dream and loaded panniers of gold on the back of a donkey.William followed the animal as it roamed across his lands. When night fell, it rested under a tree on a higher and rockier site close to the steep-sided Allt Dearg.The castle was built on that spot with the unique quirk that it was constructed around the tree. This subsequently became a feature of part of the cellar, known since as ldquoThe Hawthorn Room.Legend has it that the tree has magical qualities which have on more than one occasion saved the castle from disaster.Modern scientic analysis has revealed that the tree died in approximately , most likely as a result of being deprived of light because the castle had been built around it.

The former Rangers and Ajax striker is a season and a half in to a new job managing Uzbekistanrsquos once all-powerful football club, Pakhtakor, and things are going well.The Georgian, in new kit, is standing in the centre of his perfectly manicured home pitch and telling a TV crew why the wilderness years for his team are over. ldquoThis year the squad is pleasing everybody, the Georgian says in heavily accented but well rehearsed Russian. ldquoThanks to Alisher Burkhanovich, everything has changed. The management. The trainers. The philosophy.The name-check is for Alisher Burkhanovich Usmanov, an Uzbek-born multi-billionaire once named as Britainrsquos richest man and best known in the UK as a former Arsenal shareholder.Mr Arveladzersquos reference is not accidental. Because Pakhtakorrsquos coach is appearing in a half-hour hagiography about Mr Usmanov on state-controlled rolling news channel Orsquozbekiston .The show , a glowing documentary called a ldquoSense of Belonging, was first broadcast this summer. It leaves viewers in no doubt that Mr Usmanov is the force behind Pakhtakorrsquos revival and even more dramatic plans for a super-modern -million stadium to replace the clubrsquos roofless s Tashkent ground.Pakhtakor manager Shota Arveladze on Ozbekiston But it never - crucially - quite says he owns the club. In fact, Pakhtakorrsquos ultimate formal ownership might be closer to Mr Arveladzersquos old Ibrox home than his new Uzbek one.Pakhtakor was purchased last year by a Uzbek registered ldquoforeign company called SFI Management Group. The company has never publicly named any shareholders or explained why it is listed as ldquoforeign.However, a corporate filing obtained by The Herald shows SFI has just one shareholder: Quality Trade Supplies, registered at a former draperrsquos shop in Douglas, South Lanarkshire.:Investigation: Scotlands firms, Argentinas bribes and Uzbekistans dirty cottonThe firm, QTS, for short, is one of Scotlandrsquos increasingly notorious limited partnerships, a kind of shell company which Transparency International has called ldquoa vehicle of choice for money-laundering and which the CBI has warned harms this countrys global reputation.The shop in DouglasQTS has never filed any accounts or named any ultimate beneficiary. There is no suggestion the firm has done anything wrong, but everything it does is shrouded in corporate secrecy. So much so that its role in SFI has sparked serious concerns among Uzbekistan-watchers over corporate transparency.That is because SFI does not just own Pakhtakor. The business has taken control of huge chunks of state industry in the country on ldquotrust. Under deals made with Uzbekistanrsquos rulers SFI manages the countryrsquos biggest metal-maker, Uzmetkominat and its giant Almalyk copper mine and smelter complex, one of the most polluted places on the planet. SFI has also moved on Uzbekistanrsquos state drugs monopoly and other metals and insurance businesses.In its fawning reporting, Orsquozbekiston  has linked investment at both Uzmetkombinat and Almalyk to Mr Usmanov, but without nailing down the billionairersquos exact role. Its Sense of Belonging documentary signalled a huge change in Uzbekistan. The old regime of Islam Karimov, the Soviet-era strongman who died in , has gone and the countrys new leaders are prepared to share economic power with expat oligarchs such as Mr Usmanov.ldquoAlisher Usmanov is taking an active role in a whole series of important projects for our country, the news channel declared over dramatic drone footage of doves flying across anhistoric Uzbek skyline.The opening of Ozbekiston s documentary on Mr UsmanovOne of those projects Ozbekiston  lauds is the construction of a the Tashkent Metallurginal Plant, which is being carried out, it said, ldquowith the support of Mr Usmanov.\"Scottish\"-owned Tashkent Metallurgical Plant under constructionThis  million euro scheme - now well under way - was announced by Uzbekistanrsquos still relatively new president, Shavkat Mirziyoyev, last year, as a major foreign investment. Last month The Herald revealed that investment was carried out by QTS.Tashkent Metallurgical Plant now shares an office with SFI, just across the road from the home ground of Pakhtakorrsquos Tashkent rivals Bunyodkor.A succession of anonymously owned Scottish and other British shell companies have been investing in Uzbekistan, including in the cotton industry and in a prestige downtown office development, Tashkent City.\"I am proud to be an Uzbek.\" Alisher Usmanov on Ozbekiston The Herald wrote to SFI and QTS asking them to name their ultimate beneficiary was. We received no reply.Alisher Ilkhamov, a research associate at the School of Oriental and African Studies at the University of London, is very concerned over the lack of transparency.He said: \"The opacity surrounding deals such as the privatisation of Almalyq and the Tashkent City development indicates the emergence of a new type of authoritarian regime in Uzbekistan.\"Speaking more generally, Mr Ilkhamov added: \"If the previous, Karimov regime was based on preserving the Soviet-style command economy, then the Mirziyoyev regime is turning out to be more business-friendly and eager to attract foreign investments.\"However, the new regime like the previous one is failing to adopt sufficient safeguards against corruption and therefore is prone to the collusion between public office holders and the private sector represented mainly by oligarchs.\"This is gradually becoming more akin to what we see in Russia and Kazakhstan, a combination of relatively liberal economic system with grand corruption.\"Ozbekiston  reports SFI taking over management of the giant Almalyk mine and smelterLast month an Uzbek human rights group - eager to find out who was really investing in their country - urged the UK Government to act on SLPs. The UK Government is considering reforms.Alison Thewliss, the SNP MP leading the campaign for change in the House of Commons, said progress had been \"agonisingly slow\". Ministers, she added, should be really concerned about revelations from Uzbekistan.:Questions as Uzbek president grants tax breaks to anonymous Scots firmsResearcher and writer Richard Smith summed up: \"We are witnessing two pantomimes. In Uzbekistan, itrsquos no secret that Mr Usmanov manages huge swathes of the countrys economy via SFI Management Group, which is controlled by QTS. \"Meanwhile, the UK pretends to require disclosure of ultimate beneficiaries. Yet QTS has still not made any statement about its controlling person, more than a year after the law took effect, and remains unsanctioned.\"As the months pass, itrsquos dawning on everyone that, despite the fine words about transparency, the UK isnrsquot the least bit serious about disclosure.Mr Usmanov is a patriot helping to rebuild his country, according to state TV. But is he alone  Another Uzbek expat oligarch, Belgian-based minerals billionaire Patokh Chodiev, or Shodiyev, has also been linked with SFI . His London representative has repeatedly denied this to The Herald.Meanwhile, back at Pakhtakor it is not just the manager who changed after the SFI take-over. The club has a new president, Bobur Kabulovich Shodiyev. Russian media says this is Mr Chodievs nephew.

We know in any criminal trial the test is whether or not the prosecution has proved its case ldquobeyond reasonable doubt. If not, juries have to acquit. Which means not guilty ndash there is no middle way in the law. So why, in effect, have two not guilty verdicts Some lawyers, like Derek Ogg QC, have argued that logically it is the ldquonot guilty verdict that should go. This would concentrate jurorsrsquo minds on deciding whether or not the prosecution case had been ldquoproven beyond reasonable doubt. This is apparently how it was in Scottish courts in the th century. The ldquonot guilty verdict was reintroduced in the th century.However, many lawyers used to argue that the not proven verdict harmed the accused, not the accuser. Having a jury rule that the case against you was ldquonot proven might suggest that you got off on a technicality, or that the prosecution just hadnrsquot got its act together. Defence lawyers argued that guilt should be expunged by an unequivocal declaration of not guilty ndash meaning he or she really, really didnrsquot do it. The late former Scottish Secretary, Donald Dewar, moved a Commons Bill in  to have the ldquobastard verdict, as Sir Walter Scott called it, scrapped. But this wasnrsquot because he thought it would necessarily make rape convictions easier.Not proven still has its defenders. Some say abolition would undermine Scots law and that we shouldnrsquot be importing an Anglicised system on a wave of emotion. It is good for juries to have more than one option so that they can express a degree of doubt, or qualication. Brian McConnachie QC, the former President of the Criminal Bar Association, has pointed out abolishing it could have unintended consequences. As we discovered during the debate about scrapping corroboration in rape trials, getting rid of one anomaly often creates a raft of new ones.In Scottish jury trials there need only be a simple majority for conviction, eight to seven in a -person jury. In England the test is much stricter ndash there are smaller juries and the majority has to be  out of . If not proven is dispensed with, many would argue that the Scottish majoritarian system would have to go too. This might actually make it harder to get rape convictions.Indeed, you could argue that not proven gives an ldquoeasy option the other way ndash in favour of the accuser. It allows juries who believe the ldquovictim, but are not convinced by the prosecutionrsquos handling of the case, to say: ldquoWe think he or she probably did do it, even though the evidence isnrsquot conclusive. This arguably sends a signal to the civil courts that this person might be guilty on the balance of probabilities. Civil courts are less strict on the need to prove ldquobeyond reasonable doubt.This is actually what happened in the case of Miss M, the rape victim who has been arguing for not proven to be scrapped. She made legal history last month by taking the not proven verdict against former student Stephen Coxen to the Personal Injuries Court in Edinburgh, where it was effectively reversed. She was awarded pound, in damages. Of course, that raises further questions about double jeopardy. If someone is found not guilty in one court, does it makes sense for them to be found guilty in another If you accept the #metoo doctrine ndash ldquoalways believe the victim ndash then you donrsquot really need trials at all. However, this causes problems when the wrong people get accused. When one of the leading figures in the #metoo movement, the Hollywood actress Asia Argento, was accused in August of statutory rape of an underage boy in Calornia, her defenders insisted that she should be given the benefit of ldquodue process, and be innocent until proven guilty. This was correct. The rush to judgment was wrong and unfair ndash even though she reportedly gave the ldquovictim , to settle the claim privately.The problem with sexual assault and rape is that they often involve dficult cases relying, in the absence of corroboration, on ldquohe said she said and the credibility of the parties involved. I have never sat on a rape case jury, but Irsquove spoken to many who have, and they tell me the cases often involve alcohol and vague and muddled memories. It is probably the case that too few rapists are being punished. But tipping the scales in favour of the victims doesnrsquot always work.The justice system in England has been rocked by the collapse of a succession of highly-publicised rape trials in which the police withheld, or failed to disclose, evidence crucial tothe defence. The former head of the Crown Prosecution Service, Alison Saunders, had to make a formalapology, and then resigned last month, after a review covering just two months of English rape cases found that  had to be halted because the police had failed to hand over evidence of innocence. The police insist that they werenrsquot trying to rig the prosecutions. But the head of the politan Police, Cressida Dick, has since issued new guidance saying that ldquocomplainants in rape and sexual assault cases should be listened to, but not automatically believed. ldquoItrsquos not all about the victims she said.Justice is hard. The debate over not proven has been grinding on for a long time. Holyroodrsquos Justice Committee has said that the dual acquittal is on ldquoborrowed time ndashwhich I suppose is itself a kind of not proven verdict. Scrapping the Scottish verdictis beginning to look well nigh inevitable.

There are issues with BME teachers dropping out in the first three years of teaching.Equality issues in schools in general do not seem to be a strong enough focus and that is a particular case in terms of race.We have evidence that Muslim teachers are particularly struggling with racism in schools, and that can be from pupils or subtle messages from other teachers.Another key issue is that teachers talk about how racism in school has become more of an issue in the context of Brexit. Pupils feel emboldened to say racist things.

Jim therefore tried to find historical accuracy as far as possible by researching contemporary documents and manuscripts that held vital evidence.\"There are certain liberties you can take, like for example the drumming used by the armies preparing for battle and that is often for dramatic effect.\"The film is billed as a \"true David versus Goliath story\" of how the great th-century \"outlaw king\" Robert the Bruce used cunning and bravery to defeat the larger and better-equipped occupying English army.At the films debut during the Toronto Film Festival last year there were a few raised eyebrows when American actor Chris Pine, who plays Bruce, appeared full-frontal naked in one scene.Directed by Oscar-nominated film-maker David Mackenzie the epic was shot in ious Scottish locations throughout  and Jim spent six months working on the diegetic soundtrack.Jim said: \"I had a meeting with David Mackenzie just a few weeks before the shoot and none of this particular aspect was planned. David calls himself a jazz film-maker and doesnt really like to spend too much time planning it all out. Its very much part of his style.\"Jims mother, Beryl, still lives in Thurso and said she is \"immensely proud\" of her sons achievements.Wednesday  Nov  : PM"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04118000/04118144.jpg","title":"Writings on the wall for Graffito","story":"THURSO has embraced an artistic legacy stretching back to the s with a vibrant mural in the town centre created last Wednesday by an artist from the Black Isle.Unlike the earlier work on Tollemache House by Polish artist Caziel Zielenkiewicz ndash a student of Picasso ndash the latest piece of public art has so far achieved great praise from the majority of people commenting on social media.The Facebook page for Caithness Horizons Museum and Art Galleryndash who commissioned the work by Marc Delaye ndash has attracted many comments about the colourful artwork gracing a wall of their carpark.Lora Dillon said: \"Went down to see it today. We all love it.\"Gill Arrowsmith and Shirley Sinclair both thought the painting was \"fantastic\" while Annemarie Simpson thought that a similar venture in Wick would help tackle the \"towns eyesore\" buildings.While on that subject, one dissenting voice condemned the piece and said there was a \"masterpiece eyesore now in Wilson Street thanks to Caithness Horizons\".Beauty is, of course, in the eye of the beholder.The mural depicts a portrait of Thursos renowned botanist and geologist Robert Dick surrounded by a kaleidoscopic representation of the CHMAG facade and the scientists specimen collection.The bold use of line and colour based on modern urban graffiti cannot fail to be noticed just like the mural on nearby Tollemache House but is sited in a much less conspicuous space ndash the gallerys car park.CHMAGs curator Merran Gunn, who was instrumental in commissioning Delaye to create the work, said the artist had also spray painted a wall within the building as part of a show running called Graffito.His earlier piece has an explosive anime style figure punching out of the wall toward the viewer.\"Marcs work is bold and vibrant, electric colours jostle for dominance, and the new outside mural is no exception with tangerine skies set behind the historic Thurso of Robert Dick,\" said Gunn.Thursos illustrious scientist had his herbarium collection feature in an earlier work by the artist Joanne Carr which in turn is featured within Delayes mural ndash a clear case of one artist paying homage to another.\"Graffiti and street art is more relevant than ever whether it be in the art world ndash with the recent record sale of Banksys girl with a balloon ndash or here in the Highlands where graffiti has made its way onto the syllabus at Farr High School through art teacher Tracy Wilkinson,\" she said.After garnering great positive feedback from the current show Merran decided to \"have a moment of spontaneity\" and raised funds through a crowdfunding website and the Dounreay Communities Fund to commission Marc Delaye to breath some le into a fairly drab corner of the town.Tracy Dodson, commercial manager of CHMAG, said that the gallery was \"breaking boundaries\" with Graffito.\"It questions what actually constitutes art and what gets shown in a gallery. Graffito is an exhibition that celebrates artwork that is available to everyone.\"Traditionally graffiti has been seen as anti-social, fringe or even as criminal vandalism, but with an emphasis on social inclusion, we are celebrating street, pop, comic and zine work as mainstream art for hanging in our gallery.\"Tracy unabashedly declares that Graffito is \"aimed at young people and the young at heart, as a way of inviting new and future audiences to a museum and gallery experience\".\"This is a multicoloured on-the-wall exhibition devoted to all manner of graphic mark-making and breaking the boundaries of what art is all about,\" she said. \"We have also hosted street painting and comic workshops, guided gallery tours, and collaborating with our local schools and council.\"Marc Delaye is an established community projects artist with Freshpaint.org which is based on the Black Isle.\"Murals are as alive now as ever before and an excellent way to introduce art to internal and external spaces, giving iniduals and communities something that they can be proud of and enjoy each and every day,\" said Marc.The murals can be privately commissioned and can be an \"ideal means of advertising products, services, messages and campaigns\".Other exhibitors at Graffito include Andy Strachan, of Comic Creations Studios Dundee, David Robertson of Fred Egg Comics and Zu Dominak, all of whom work at the University of Dundee within the Masters degrees in Comics and Graphic Novels ndash the only course of its kind in the UK.Other exhibitors include Victor Nobis and his series Fallen Giants ndash a fantasy dream space where cities like Edinburgh rise and twist through the torso of neon lit giant figures.Graffito finishes on Saturday with a day of childrens workshops, guided tours and a colouring competition.Wednesday  Nov  : PM"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"November ,  at : pmOrkney band, FARA have been nominated for The Belhaven Bursary for Innovation in Music — an award which grants the winners £, to pursue and develop their music.

Most died during active service.

Will the Chief Secretary work with the Secretary of State for Business to develop that proposal and work with the Business Department and the developers to see the fruition of what could be a very important part of the Government’s industrial strategy.”Responding to Mr Carmichael, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, the Rt. Hon. Liz Truss MP, said: “As part of the spending review we will be looking at the most efficient way we can achieve our carbon targets, and I am working closely with the Department of Business Energy and Industrial Strategy to do.”Commenting after the exchange, Mr Carmichael added: “The Minister’s response will do little to assure the industry that they are a priority for the Government. There was nothing in the Budget for this industry, and the Government have been working closely across departments for some time now. It is disappointing that little progress appears to be being made.“Wave and tidal power generation and new and innovative forms of producing green energy. The ambition of the industry however has not been matched by the policy framework, which continues to prevent this sector from reaching the point where it becomes commercially viable.“Renewable energy generation, particularly wave and tidal stream power are areas at which the Northern Isles is at the very forefront, and the creation of these Innovative Power Purchase Agreements would make great strides towards helping these innovative industries continue to flourish.

Descendants of both Vice Admiral Fremantle and Rear Admiral von Reuter will be attending the conference.The conference will cover not only the scuttle, but also the history and impact of that fateful day.Speakers will explore the American navy#s vital role in the war, how the scuttle was interpreted in Germany and how the legacy still lives on today.Six months before the centenary itself, this will be a wonderful opportunity to share Scapa#s history, stimulate ideas for  and build a lasting knowledge of what happened and why.Nick Jellicoe will publish two books next year: The Last Days of the High Seas Fleet and, in partnership with the Orcadian, Scuttle to Salvage, a book about in photographs. He is shortly launching a website to support the centenary, Scapaflow and will be producing another animation The Scapa Flow Naval History Conference will take place at Kirkwall Grammar School, Friday and Saturday, November  and .Details on the conference can be found on https:shop.scapaflow copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

If we continue to turn a blind eye to the risk of developing type  diabetes as a result, we can only expect to see the number of undiagnosed cases escalate.‘Diabetic retinopathy is one of the leading causes of blindness among people of working age in the UK so it’s hugely important that diabetes is detected early and monitored correctly to avoid furthering the risks.‘At Specsavers, we offer digital retinal photography. This takes a detailed picture of the back of your eye and the microcirculation of blood – helping to highlight indicators of diabetes that need addressing.Eye screening is also a key part of your diabetes care and people with diabetes should have routine screenings done every one to two years by an optometrist. Contact your local GP or local diabetic screening service for more information.Sophie Castell, Director of Relationships at RNIB, says: ‘Sadly, all too often, people with diabetes can lose their sight due to complications. Yet with early detection and treatment, sight loss due to diabetic retinopathy can be prevented. Regular eye tests are important for everyone, but especially for people living with diabetes who should also ensure they attend appointments for specialist diabetic eye screening. It’s a few minutes that could save your sight.’ https:www.diabetes.org.uk resources-s - diabetes_in_the_uk_.pdf https:www.diabetes.org.uk about_us news over--of-people-unaware-diabetes-can-lead-to-blindness- State of the Nation’s Eye Health, Specsavers  RNIB  https:www.rnib.org.uk knowledge-and-research-hub-research-reports prevention-sight-loss stateofthenation http:www.rnib.org.uk sites default files RNIB_evidence_based_review_of_working_age_people.pdf vw, px\"  copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

We are pleased to confirm we have made some changes to the substation design at Finstown, which we hope will go some way to address concerns raised. We are also pleased to confirm that we will underground the proposed infrastructure at Hoxa Head.#In the coming weeks, SSEN’s project team will continue to assess the responses received as it further refines the project design.SSEN plans to submit its planning applications for the proposed substation at Finstown, the subsea cable and the underground land cable that will connect Finstown to the subsea cable later this year, while a final round of public consultation will be held in Spring  on the onshore infrastructure required to connect the ious renewable projects looking to connect on Orkney to Finstown substation.For more information on the project, including the latest visualisations of the proposed substation at Finstown, please visit: https:www.ssen-transmission projects orkney copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Executive chairman Wolfhart Hauser had taken over at the helm following O’Toole’s departure, but will now revert back to his non-executive chairman’s role.Details of the changes came as the group reported interim pre-tax losses widening to £. million in the six months to  September from £.m a year earlier due to restructuring and reorganisation costs from the withdrawal of Greyhound services in Western Canada.But revenues rose . per cent to £. billion and on an underlying and constant currency basis, pre-tax profits jumped . per cent to £m, while earnings lted . per cent to £.m.But FirstGroup warned that its rail arm, which includes the South Western Railwayand Great Western Railway franchises, would see annual underlying operating profits fall year-on-year.

The school was forced to close after numerous safety incident in just a few weeks.Other incidents include a pupil being struck by a metal  from a roof in West Lothian, and a ceiling collapse in East Ayrshire.The figures were obtained by a Freedom of Information request from  of Scotland’s  councils, submitted by the Scottish Conservatives. The exact figure is likely tohigher as many councils fail to collect and publish the information.Liz Smith, Scottish Conservative shadow education secretary, renewed her call for building reports to be included in school inspections.“Each one of these incidents represents a risky situation that children or staff have been put in while at school.“Children and staff must be safe at school, and the fabric of the school buildings must be maintained properly.“Including building reports in school inspections is an obvious way to ensure that school buildings are fit for purpose and prevent any more avoidable accidents.”A spokeswoman for the Educational Institute of Scotland , said the incidents were a “wake-up call”.“Safety incidents in schools are a stark warning to all local authorities and those responsible for the construction and maintenance of our schools – that they must take action to ensure that all buildings are well-designed, properly-built and maintained to an extremely high standard.This is not an area where corners or costs should ever be cut.” A Scottish Government spokesman said: “The health and safety of pupilsis of paramount importance. All local authorities have a statutory responsibility to manage and maintain the school estate and provide a safe environment for young people and staff.“In the current year, councils will receive a local government finance settlement of £. billion.

He’s about to get on a plane but the worn white Fender Stratocaster with the maple fingerboard, on which he wrote best selling hits with his band Chic and produced some of the biggest-selling albums of all time with David Bowie, Madonna and Diana Ross, won’t be shoved in the hold. The Hitmaker, as he calls it, and which is integral to his funky ‘chucking’ style, won’t be out of his sight. He left it on a train once, luckily got it back, but yes, he did freak out...The Grammy Award-winning musician, composer, arranger, guitarist and co-founder of Chic says, “I have a replica, and a plexiglass one and they sound really great live and on record, real close, but it’s not the same.” Rodgers is about to fly out of Toronto when we speak, heading for London in his trademark dreadlocks and beret to put the funk into the X Factor, replacing the touring Robbie Williams as a judge. He’s also collecting a humanitarian award from the Global Gt charity for his work with his We Are Family Foundation, named for his Sister Sledge anthem. Career-wise he’s flying high too, after releasing the first Chic album for more than two decades this summer featuring Elton John, Emeli Sandé and Lady Gaga, with another album due out in February and about to kick off a -date European and UK tour with the band that’ll make Glasgow Dance, Dance, Dance in December. He’s the newly elected Chairman of the Songwriters Hall of Fame and as the recently-appointed inaugural Chief Creative Advisor for Abbey Road Studios, it’s time to celebrate Good Times. Rodgers is responsible for decades of floorfillers, after starting out as a musician on Sesame Street, playing clubs and bars before co-founding Chic in  with bassist Bernard Edwards. There were Chic disco hits: Dance, Dance, Dance, Everybody Dance, I Want Your Love, Le Freak and Good Times, and hits he produced for others: He’s The Greatest Dancer, We Are Family, , I’m Coming Out, Upside Down, , Like A Virgin, , Let’s Dance . Then there are his collaborations, with Daft Punk on the Random Access Memories album and single Get Lucky, global hits that won him three Grammys, with Avicii, Sigala Disclosure and Sam Smith, plus the genre crossing talent that saw Good Times spark the advent of hip-hop when it was picked up as the base for Sugarhill Gang’s Rapper’s Delight. In all, his work has sold more than  million albums and  million singles, but it’s been  years since Nile Rodgers and Chic released a studio album. Hence the title It’s About Time. “Yes,” he laughs. “For one thing there’s the obvious – it was about time I did this stuff and got it back out.” It would have been earlier, but as Rodgers was working on the album the deaths of his friends and previous collaborators Prince, David Bowie, George Michael and Chris Cornell hit him hard. “What happened was I had got a large tape drop from Warner Brothers of masters that I thought were gone for ever and that made me feel so happy and nostalgic and I was about to release an album. But then people started passing away that I had written tribute songs about, and it made me feel like I’d be capitalising on Bowie and Prince’s passing, and it was just so wrong.”The time is right now, however, and at , Rodgers has been thinking about mortality. He’s beaten prostate cancer once in  and last year had a lump removed from his kidney. Today he declares himself fit and healthy,a little tired from last night’s Toronto gig, but he’s determined to fulfil his mission to get everyone dancing to feelgood music.“I know that our time on this planet is finite,” he says “and you know what, I want to spend the rest of my le making really great dance music. When I was producing Eric Clapton one day he came out of the studio and said to me that he was gonna play blues for the rest of his le. I said ‘Eric, you mean to tell meI come see a Clapton show I’m not gonna hear Sunshine of Your Love  Or any of those Cream and Blind Faith cool songs ’ And he said ‘no, you’re not gonna get that again, because I’m not going to play it again.’ I went home and thought about it for a bit and I said, ‘well, hell,Eric Clapton is gonna play blues for the rest of his le, I’m gonna play dance music for the rest of my le. Right! I just wanna play music for ever.“Not that I think I’m Eric Clapton, but you know,you’ve put in all this time, you have the right to decide what you want to do and I decided that I like to make music that makes people happy, makes people want to dance. It really feels good to me to see people express themselves through motion.”Speaking of dancing, as a legendary exponent of dance music, what does Rodgers consider to be his hottest move  How would he wow one night in a disco on the outskirts of Frisco  Rumba and Tango, Latin Hustle, too, Yowsah, Yowsah… “I have no idea,” he says and laughs. “I don’t consider myself a good dancer any more, because I was actually a serious dancer. I was actually a ballet dancer in another le. Not many people know that, but it’s true. Around the time I was working with Sesame Street when I was  or , and I took it very seriously for a while. Then I just started gigging a lot more and I didn’t have time to practise and ballet you gotta practise just as seriously as you practise music.” As for the upcoming tour, Chic fans can expect to hear the old favourites alongside some of the new album because Rodgers knows his crowd and after playing the festival circuit with Glastonbury and Coachella last year, he’s also conscious a lot of the audience will be hearing them for the first time. “At our shows I ask people to raise their handsthey’re seeing Chic for the first time, and we’re averaging about  per cent first timers. This is amazing to me! Especially since we’ve played the UK so much. I’m like Jesus, everybody has seen us! But no, more than half the crowd will raise their hands and that’s cool.”Rodgers may have four decades in the business but he’s still an innovator and already at Abbey Road has been the first to shoot a video there and has more plans to move and shake the legendary studio.“Abbey Road’s amazing,” he says. “They’re allowing me to do everything there, matter of fact, ha! I might re-invigorate my ballet career, have a dance recital there! It’s just incredible. It’s probably one of the most artistic, creative environments I’ve ever been in. I’m making films, doing concerts, even Paul McCartney wound up having a concert there after I came.”Born in New York in  Rodgers didn’t have the easiest start in le. His mother was  when she got pregnant with him and his biological father, Nile Rodgers Senior, a travelling percussionist, moved on. With his mother and step-father both being heroin addicts, Rodgers learned young to be self-reliant. The last time I interviewed him he spoke about how once as a five-year-old he got wedged down the back of the sofa when his parents were out of it and he had to wait for his grandmother to come round to the house and retrieve him. If he could, what would he say to that little boy stuck amid soft furnishings, waiting for someone to realise he was missing  “I’d say, buckle up, it’s going to be a hell of a ride!” He laughs. After learning to play the guitar at  Rodgers figured he could pay rent and landed his first professional job in the Sesame Street band at . But despite their struggles, he’s very close to his family, especially his mother, and is grateful for the legacy of music bequeathed him by his parents. It’s in his bones and has been all his le.“I have music in me, around me, it just swirls in my head all the time. I can’t turn it off as a matter of fact. Oh yeah, I always hear music, all day long. I heard it as a child, and I hear it now,” he says. In was almost inevitable he would make his name in music, from the beginning playing and practising every day. “I wish I could do that now,” he says, “I would give my left arm to be able to do that. Oh, no… you know what I mean.” He laughs. “I just think practising makes me play better, and he quotes the violinist Jascha Heetz, who once said ‘ I don’t practise one day, I know it two days, the critics know it three days, the public knows it.’ His insecure formative years necessitated a work ethic that spurred Rodgers on and brought financial rewards such as the house by the shore in Westport, Connecticut, with the boat moored at the jetty, where he lives today. Apparently alone, but then Rodgers never talks about his relationships. “Yeah, I’m pretty discreet,” he says. And just out of nosiness, because he’s ulged this to me before, and he is the child of a pair of beatnik hippies, does he still like to hang out there naked when he doesn’t have guests  He laughs. “Yeah, of course, why would I change  Old dog new tricks  No.” With his colourful le story, Nile Rodgers The Musical, should be worth the wait, but his much anticipated autobiographical show is still being written and may be another couple of years in the pipeline. Right now he’s got his hands full with the musical he wrote with Jean-Paul Gaultier, entitled Fashion Freak Show, currently wowing the Folies Bergeres in Paris, as well as another musical bound for Las Vegas and provisionally London’s West End. “The Paris show is doing great and the other one is loosely based on disco lestyle stuff and it’s being done by [Steven Hoggett] the choreographer from the Harry Potter show that’s in the West End now.”As to who would play Rodgers in the musical of his le, he’s at a complete loss, sounding surprised at the question.“Oh, I don’t know… I wouldn’t even… I don’t even know,” he says. “That person would have to be a hell of a lot more talented than myself, because they’d have to do a lot of things at an early age that I couldn’t do when I was that age!” He laughs.Compose, perform, produce, act, oh and they’d have to add ballet to the long list of talents now too, know their ballottéfrom their boogie. “Yes, they would.” He laughs. And no, he wouldn’t consider playing himself.Today Rodgers’ mother Beverly has Alzheimer’s, but the two find common love in music and when he visited her last week, as usual they revisited their playlist for le.“She loves everything. My mom is a be-bop junkie... and loves everything from Charlie Mingus to Nina Simone to Miles to The Beatles. The other day we were singing Hey Jude and she knows every single word, even sings the ad libs…” He lts his voice and does his mother doing McCartney’s scat, “Ju-Judy Judy Judy Judy Judy.“She’s amazing.”Rodgers’ own playlist of signicant songs would contain primarily jazz and some of his own tracks, not out of narcissism, but because he rarely gets to hear them. “I only hear my music when I’m playing it and there’s a huge dference between the recorded and performance versions. In performance there’s a lot of improvisation whereas recorded is exactly the same every time. Sometime when I hear the recorded version I go ‘oh my god, I forgot I wrote that part too’. The other day I heard Let’s Dance and forgot how intricate the horn voicings were. I listened to the whole album and thought wow, this is cool.“Let’s Dance was part of Rodgers’ reinvention as a producer, the album that turned his career around after punk kicked in and left disco apparently for dead. Boogie was busted as punk gobbed in its face and Chic, with their soul, RB, funk, glitter and groove were out in the cold. “Durin’ the disco sucks era,” he says, “we couldn’t get anything, no buzz, no one would listen to us. We were just persona non grata. It’s not that the music was bad, it was just we were not flavour of the month. People didn’t like us.”The collaboration with Bowie was to reinvigorate his career and satisfy his love for discovering new sounds. “Up until David’s record I had six failures in a row. I was known for producing disco. But after David I probably had six successes in a row: David Bowie, INXS, Duran Duran, Madonna, then Duran Duran again, then Mick Jagger and David Bowie with Dancing in the Street... yeah I had a clutch.“And collaborating is fun! Not only have you got your own energy to vibe off, but you have other people’s. I love being in Chic but for the last  years I’ve been mainly in the room with brand new people, in other people’s bands.” Looking back over his career Rodgers is hard pushed to nominate an event or song of which he is most proud. “I’m not more proud of Let’s Dance than We Are Family, Get Lucky, I Want Your Love, Dance, Dance, Dance, Everybody Dance or Rapper’s Delight.”As he lists the titles, it prompts a muscle memory, the beginnings of a hustle in the hips, a shimmy in the shoulders, so perhaps it’s the longevity of his sound that’s most impressive. Rodgers, however, can’t explain his success. “If I knew the answer to that question, don’t you think every record I’ve put out would be a hit ” he says. “Most of my records are not hits. Most of my records are flops. Only a handful are hits. Well, actually, a big handful....”A very big handful...“Well, yeah, anyway...” he trails off, modest and mellow.Holding his Hitmaker, it’s time for Rodgers to board his flight, with a final word about how much he’s looking forward to the tour. “You know, I really love composing, I love making records, and when we know from the charts that people are listening, there is a joy that we get. “But when you can actually see people having a good time, that feels pretty damn good. There’s nothing like that. It’s wonderful. So... see you in Glasgow for Good Times.” @JanetChristieNile Rodgers  Chic kick off their UK arena tour at The SSE Hydro Glasgow on  December.

At least that’s what it looks like from this European mainlander’s perspective.Scotland is regarded as a rebellious but likeable underdog who’s being dragged out of the European Union against its will. Bagpipes, haggis and whisky are all fine – but honestly, for the politically interested traveller, Scotland’s EU-friendly attitude is the icing on the cake.Brexit felt like a rejection for many of my fellow Europeans – so it feels good to know there are still people out there who think dferently. Yes, euroscepticism is on the rise in many countries – just look at Italy and its government’s anti-EU rhetoric, blaming Brussels for everything that’s going wrong, even for the Genoa bridge collapse. But there’s still a widespread acceptance of the EU in Europe. In fact, a recent survey commissioned by the European Parliament showed that  per cent of respondents believed that their countries’ membership of the EU was a good thing. That’s the highest it has been in  years.So for many people, Scotland seems like a bastion of reason in a world gone crazy with populism. The Scottish position on Brexit has evoked solidarity and sympathy. But the question is: does this attitude mean that an independent Scotland would be welcomed by the EU While the political landscape has signicantly changed since the independence referendum in , most people would see one country in particular as a roadblock. Spain is still having its own domestic problems with the separatist movement in Catalonia, a region in the north-east of the country. So that’s one member state that wouldn’t particularly be in favour of any independence referendum.Their government has recently changed, however. In June, socialist Pedro Sánchez took over as prime minister after his predecessor Pedro Rajoy was ousted in a vote of no confidence. Sánchez has been reaching out to the independence supporters in Catalonia, but he’s far from being in favour of the region parting ways with Spain and will not support a referendum. His party PSOE backed the hard stance of Rajoy’s government after the Catalan vote back in October  and helped impose direct rule on Catalonia under article  of the constitution.: EU negotiator: ‘Simple fact’ independent Scotland could join EUBut Scotland has one advantage over Catalonia: Holyrood and Westminster negotiated the Edinburgh Agreement, thereby allowing for the Scottish Government to organise a referendum. In contrast, Spain’s constitutional courts declared that Barcelona’s referendum was illegal. The situation is dferent, and that’s why some observers think that, provided another independence referendum was done constitutionally, Spain would now not stand in the way of EU membership from an independent Scotland. But hypothetically – just how long would it take an independent Scotland to rejoin  I asked David Martin, Scotland’s longest-serving member of the European Parliament. The Labour MEP had an astonishing answer: “If we were independent, I think we could be a member of the EU within two years.“ That seems like a remarkably short time. But again, Scotland has an advantage: its laws already comply with EU law which puts it well ahead of other EU candidates like Montenegro. Martin has a direct comparison as he is chair of the delegation to the EU-Montenegro Stabilisation and Association Parliamentary Committee.“We would have to negotiate things like fishing – which would not be easy but would not be impossible,“ he said. “We have to decide what we’re going to do about the single currency and about Schengen, but I think the areas for negotiation would be rather narrow.“: Guy Verhofstadt: Scotland ‘obliged to follow’ Brexit decisionOther MEPs have spoken in a similar vein: the German MEP Elmar Brok, for example, has reportedly said Scotland’s readmission into the EU could be “speedy“. An independent Scotland might only have a few “narrow” issues to discuss compared with all the points the EU would have to discuss with other membership candidates. But these subjects seem so sensitive and complicated and they could, in my opinion, turn out to be much harder to solve than some might hope for. Scotland right now benefits from the special position the United Kingdom has within the EU. If the country did become independent and tried to get back into the EU, it would have a better starting position than others, but it would not automatically be able to claim the UK’s opt-outs. Why would the EU allow a cherry-picking member once again – that didn’t work out so well with the UK, did it  Scotland would enter the negotiations like a completely new applicant.As you can imagine, from my German perspective, a closer membership than before would not a bad thing I have experienced the benefits of my country’s EU membership. But do all those who support independence know that an EU membership for a future Scottish state might entail giving up the opt-outs and adopting the euro In my mind, independence supporters in Scotland often make it seem asgetting back into the EU would be a really smooth operation. But let’s be honest: while Holyrood might gain control from Westminsterthere was independence, they would have to cede some of it to Brusselsthey wanted to join the EU again.©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4829190.1542124527!/image/image.jpg","title":"spice girls kylie and elton where are new bands amid nostalgia fest","story":"Given Scotland is awash with the music of the past # in the form of ageing stars and tribute acts # Brian Ferguson questions whether young bands will be able to compete.It is hard to believe that Kylie Minogue was to blame for one of my most underwhelming music festival experiences.

Perth Concert Hall’s forthcoming line-up has an Elvis impersonator, a “Magic of Motown” night, an Eagles tribute act, and a visit from The Osmonds and UB. Among the acts being served up at the Caird Hall in Dundee are nights devoted to the likes of The Bee Gees, The Rolling Stones, Johnny Cash, Dolly Parton and Willie Nelson. Falkirk Town Hall’s programme has tributes to Bon Jovi and Whitney Houston, alongside Abba, Blues Brothers and Buddy Holly tributes.To be fair to all of the above, Scotland’s biggest venues are serving up a similar menu. Culture Club, Belinda Carlisle, James, Ocean Colour Scene, Franki Valli  The Four Seasons, The Australian Pink Floyd Show, Madness, Chic and Paul McCartney are all booked into the Hydro in Glasgow before Christmas. Tributes to George Michael, Abba, Arentha Franklin and even The Spice Girls are jostling for attention in the Edinburgh Playhouse’s spring programme.A few years ago, the nostalgia circuit was largely the likes of The Rolling Stones, Sir Rod Stewart and Elton John. Perhaps aware of the increased competition, the latter has just put tickets on sale for a tour in the autumn of .More than a quarter of a century after the death of Freddie Mercury, Queen are enjoying a major revival thanks to the film Bohemian Rhapsody.

Senior ministers were summoned to Downing Street for inidual meetings with Mrs May tonight in a bid to shore up support.The text is understood to include contentious elements of the ‘backstop’ plan to maintain the status quo along the Irish border after Brexit, including separate regulatory checks for goods moving between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.It sets out a proposal for the UK to remain under EU customs union rules until a trade deal between London and Brussels can guarantee the free flow of goods across the Irish border, but an ‘exit mechanism’ from the customs backstop is not expected to include a firm end date or give the UK the right to walk away unilaterally.Brexiteers and DUP MPs seized on leaked details of the draft agreement, with Jacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of the pro-Brexit European Research Group of Tory backbenchers, calling on cabinet to reject the draft as “a failure of the government’s negotiating position and a failure to deliver on Brexit”.Boris Johnson dismissed the breakthrough as “vassal state stuff” and claimed it “failed to protect our precious Union”.“For the first time since partition, Dublin will have more say over aspects of government in Northern Ireland than London,” the former foreign secretary added. “Am I going to vote against it  Yes.”Scottish Conservative MP Ross Thomson suggested Northern Ireland was being “hived off”, and the DUP’s Westminster leader Nigel Dodds said: “If the reports are as we are hearing, then we couldn’t possibly vote for that.”Cabinet will meet at pm tomorrow afternoon, at the same time as ambassadors from the  other EU member states gather in Brussels for a briefing on the draft text from chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier.If ministers give their approval, the draft deal could be published as early tomorrow afternoon, with the Prime Minister unveiling the agreement with a Downing Street statement, UK government sources suggested.However, several cabinet ministers including the Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab are understood to be unhappy with aspects of the Irish border backstop, and the risk that the UK could be prevented from signing its own trade dealsit is held within the EU customs union indefinitely.Scottish Secretary David Mundell is expected to view the draft agreement tonight. Welcoming the progress, he said it was “encouraging there’s a potential agreement”.“We need to reflect on that detail and see what’s there and hopefully be in a position to take forward a deal,” he told journalists.Mr Mundell and the Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson have previously signalled their refusal to accept new trade barriers in the Irish Sea.In a letter to Prime Minister Theresa May last month, both senior Tories highlighted that “having fought just four years ago to keep our country together, the integrity of our United Kingdom remains the single most important issue for us in these negotiations.”They said: “Any deal that delivers a dferentiated settlement for Northern Ireland beyond the dferences that already exist... would undermine the integrity of our UK internal market and this United Kingdom.“We could not support any deal that creates a border of any kind in the Irish Sea and undermines the Union.”As well as the UK’s orce treaty, the draft texts includes an outline declaration of objectives for the future trade and security partnership between London and Brussels, which could include details of EU demands for access to British fishing waters - another contentious issue for Scottish Conservative MPs.Responding to news of the potential breakthrough on social media, Nicola Sturgeon said: “If the PM’s ‘deal’ satisfies no-one and can’t command a majority, we mustn’t fall for her spin that the UK crashing out of EU without a deal is then inevitable – instead we should take the opportunity to get better options back on the table.”“Also, though the Withdrawal proposals will get most attention initially, the declaration on future relationship is just as important.“If that is vague and dodges tough issues, a blindfold Brexit would beckon. It would be deeply irresponsible for parliament to sanction that.”As news of the draft agreement broke, ministers from devolved administrations were in London for their latest meeting with UK counterparts on post-Brexit power-sharing.Their meeting in the Cabinet Office, where a reading room was set up tonight for ministers to review the draft deal, broke up half an hour early.Scottish Government’s Constitutional Relations Secretary Michael Russell issued a call for devolved administrations to be shown the text, but UK government sources said it couldn’t be shared before the Cabinet had seen it.“It is completely unacceptable that devolved administrations have still not seen the detail of any draft deal,” Mr Russell said following the meeting. “We know no more coming out of tonight’s JMC than we did going in.”©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4829646.1542202423!/image/image.jpg","title":"snp to vote against brexit deal as sturgeon demands same status as northern ireland","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...SNP leaders have again insisted that Scotland should be given the #same opportunity# as Northern Ireland to stay in Europe#s single market post-Brexit.First Minister Nicola Sturgeon warned that without such an arrangement being in place, Scotland would be left competing for investment with a country which was “effectively” still part of the trading bloc.Her message, echoed by SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford, came as Theresa May prepared to face her Cabinet in a showdown meeting over the draft Brexit deal.: Theresa May braced for Cabinet revolt over BrexitMs Sturgeon said on Twitter that the “PM’s approach would take Scotland out of the single marketbut leave us competing for investment with Northern Ireland that is effectively still in it”.She later told ITV Border: “This from what I know of it is not a good deal for Scotland.“It would take Scotland out of the single market which would be bad enough in and of itself, but it would do so while leaving us competing for investment and jobs with Northern Ireland that would effectively be staying in the single market. That would be the worst of all possible worlds for Scotland.“So what I think is important now is that we don’t allow ourselves to fall for the Prime Minister’s spin that a bad deal has to be accepted because the only alternative is no deal.“Itdoes not mean that no deal is inevitablethis deal is rejected by the House of Commons. Instead what that opens the possibility for is getting better options like full single market customs union membership back on the table. We must be striving for what is right for the country. My job is to strive for what is right for Scotland, not accepting bad deals.“It’s ironic, is it not, that for the last two years the Prime Minister has told us that a no deal is better than a bad deal and now she’s arguing that we’ve got to accept a bad deal for fear of no deal.“That is a  choice.”Her remarks came as Democratic Unionist Party chief whip Sir Jeffrey Donaldson warned the arrangements for Northern Ireland could lead to the break-up of the United Kingdom.He claimed the deal would in the “long term” leave Northern Ireland closely aligned with the EU and could increase support for Scottish independence.“It’s about the constitutional and economic integrity of the UK, that is fundamental for us,” he told BBC Radio, adding that the “DUP does not stand alone on this, we have many friends within the Conservative Party and indeed in some other parties, who believe this deal has the potential to lead to the break-up of the UK”.: ‘Unacceptable’ that Scottish Ministers not shown Brexit dealScottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson, who is currently on maternity leave after the birth of her son, and Scottish Secretary David Mundell have both warned they could quit their rolesBrexit threatens to “undermine the integrity” of the UK.Mr Blackford, an SNP MP, said the two Tories had “got questions to ask”, but added: “I’ll leave that to them.”For her part, Ms Sturgeon said: “I’ll leave David Mundell to worry about his own contortions. The Scottish Conservative party in general and David Mundell in particular have got themselves into all sorts of strange postions over this. They seem more interested in standing up for the DUP than standing up for Scotland which I think is a strange position for the Secretary of State for Scotland to be in. “My job is to stand up for Scotland. “Scotland voted to remain overwhelmingly. Not withstanding that I have argued consistently for a compromise position of single market and customs union membership. “What I don’t think anybody with Scotland’ best interests at heart could accept is a situation where Scotland is not just out of the single market but competing with Northern Ireland which would still be in the single market. That would be devastating for jobs and investment in Scotland and not something I think that anybody should be prepared to accept.”Mr Blackford stressed that Scotland should be treated the same as Northern Ireland.“As far as we understand things this morning it looks asit’s actually going to a be a dferent deal for Northern Ireland,” he told BBC Radio Scotland’s Good Morning Scotland.“If it’s permissible for Northern Ireland to stay in the single market as part of the backstop - and I welcome that for the people of Northern Ireland - then of course Scotland should be given the same opportunity.”He continued: “Nicola Sturgeon, our First Minister, has been very clear ever since the Brexit vote that we need to respect the votes of the people of Scotland and as a very minimum that means staying in the single market and the customs union, these are our red lines.”Mr Blackford insisted it was “absolutely right” that the Brexit deal should enshrine the Good Friday agreement, which ended years of conflict in Northern Ireland, and ensure there is noto a hard border with the Irish Republic.But he went on: “The key point is thatthere is to be a dferentiation for Northern Ireland there is no reason why the circumstances in Scotland can also not be respected.“We need to stay in the single market and the customs union, and the Government in London must listen to us on that.”©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"watch aerial footage new eric gray centre ","story":"The long-awaited Eric Gray Centre is nearing completion – as shown by aerial footage recently published by contractors DITT Construction.The project, costing around £ million, marks the culmination of years of planning with a feasibility study taking place in .

It is part of the Year of Young People activities.The youngsters involved will come up with ideas but they are also keen to hear what other young people would like to see on the mural.Year of Young People ambassador Jonathan Dorrat said: “We’d really like children and young people aged eight to  years to come forward with designs or concepts for the new mural. Some of the themes could be, #What do you enjoy about Shetland #, #What makes you proud of Shetland #, #What is Shetland famous for #.# Send any ideas, before Friday th July , to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.The SIC#s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.#This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station.

Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me .. Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!Why not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like    It#s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.There are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined. Next you#ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!I think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.If you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, #The Arts#, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved    SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, #Status Quo#, thanks, Malcomn Younger and #Scottish National Ballet, #Highland Fling #, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £ million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.Would not even need a bar!!!The Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass. Building methods change along with building materials.I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.Come on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.The Shard is a massive glass pyramid#.I#m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug##.Mareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.If I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used # There#s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.All the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.Call me old fashioned but I would love to see the modernbuilding business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of  to  tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles,all done  years ago.It#s true you really can#t get the staff nowadays. I wonderthe Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops # the British ways of one can#t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is aboutto finish offanother burgeoning industry.I’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up! As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in theirbucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.Aluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.I’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of theterm ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much inidentying the material nature of that being used but more an attemptto denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure Rather like calling a van a box on wheels  I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaningcomments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.@ Haydn Gear.When there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.Pretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.Unless you already know Mareel#s purpose and that its supposedly an #iconic# design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that#s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname #The Pagoda# as soon as it was built.Let us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for #Mareel# to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst#s #Pickled cow and calf.#, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel#s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.I have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel. What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kickout of venting there spleens in those directions.I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.Leaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man Those of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.Purely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda wasin any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it I wondertakeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architecturalsimilarities.The viking was a chippy when it opened.#What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.# Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, # is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments  #, #I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever# and # Pig ignorant prats.# Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!Well Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there  All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.Love hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of someby those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and tomaintaincredibility from the watchful public at large. In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.Look what happened!So let today’s critics mock onit makes them feel better.Paraphrasing MGM#s famous motto, the phrase #Arse gratia artis#, springs to mind. LOL 🙂As an artist myselfdoing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.I have been to many art exhibitions andart shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as # ripping off the customer # with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody  can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.It takes me about  hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.I have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit. Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spenceis an all too common feature in mostwalks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns isnot too far removed from theactions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!So talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.Nobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as #pig ignorant#. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such #arty things#.We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £ million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained consecrated.No doubt it was deliberate and theopportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !Had you checked out Ian#s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I#d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous #Sam the Eagles# among us. That said, it#s a concept I wouldn#t wish to see spread any farther!🙂No insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to #The Black Mountains#. Iwill try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found inMareel#s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing , nasty little creatures!!! .Fairenough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artistswhen it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds.

Nice to have these little chats from a distance and always enjoy reading your submissions.HGIs the winning artist of the Turner Prize, representing what many think of the Turner Prize and this of being a club for elitist artists where their work is highly questionable or just giving art the # shock value # when it comes to expressing what art is or should be Personally, I would do away with this and just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it # And the winner of the Turner Prize is#. #. lol“ And the winner of the Turner Prize is###. ”.Go on David,since you are consumed with what is appropriate why not have a go yourself  You said “ personally , I would just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it “ And the winner of the Turner Prize is##.David Spence.

LoLThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.Based on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say # there is a strong likeness to themselves # and they are very pleased with the outcome.Alternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.I could always get away with this by saying # It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art # and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lolWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself andyou look at my products you would find this to be true. My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generatesympathetic responses.It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear..."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.It is rare enough for a local game to end -, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.Astonishingly, Delting’s - triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.The final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.Delting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.Devonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.This is the th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back  years for Southend’s solitary success.Apologies to older readersI’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in , but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.The quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw - with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay - away from home.The semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another - draw and another replay was necessary.After Delting won that one - at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.Delting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.Although it was tough ask to play two games in about  hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.So on Saturday th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.Goals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a - lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.Player manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.It was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.But it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.: : : : : : : :In professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.The benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the  clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.During the - campaign the clubs benefited from over £. billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £ million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £ million.Just where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.While players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.On the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Cha, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.In Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.Following Rangers’ - draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.It could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.That was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.Perhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes findsdficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.Rogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.There are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.: : : : : : : :One of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.Although the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and  runs.Much has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.Unfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.I’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.Maybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.The only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.Some apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.In answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 25 ","story":"Those responsible finally saw sense this week, reversing the ridiculous decision to play both Scottish League Cup semi-finals at Hampden Park on the same day.Celtic, one of the four sides involved, had indicated that a draw should be made to determine which game was moved to Murrayfieldthe original plans were scrapped.But the holders’ game against Hearts will now take place in Edinburgh at .pm on Sunday th October. The Rangers v Aberdeen tie will be played at Hampden at .pm the same day.Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers described the process as “irrational and discriminatory”, saying he had never been to Murrayfield in his le.This is the same man who could not offer any comment when quizzed at the weekendit was unfair to ask Aberdeen fans to travel to Glasgow for a noon kick-off.The handling of this by the authorities has been a shambles, and it was a bit rich to hear Scottish Professional Football Leaguechief executive Neil Doncaster say that the U-turn was because the situation had changed.Initially Hampden Park Ltd had insisted on sticking to its contract to host all semi-finals involving Celtic and Rangers, Doncaster said. The SPFL was unwilling to breach that contract and risk legal action and apparently Police Scotland were okay with the original decision. Incredibly it was said to be “the best and most practical solution”.But after the inevitable outcry, Hampden Park Ltd changed its mind and decided to waive the legal obligation.No-one should really be surprised at such a monumental cock-up, however, as you’d be hard pushed to find two organisations with as little credibility as the SPFL and Police Scotland.The idea of staging both games at Hampden on the Sunday, with Rangers taking on Aberdeen at noon and Celtic meeting Hearts at .pm, was beyond belief.Dons supporters were rightly up in arms, having been forced ious times in the past to travel to Glasgow for lunchtime kick-offs. Unless Scotrail, another organisation not known for covering itself in glory, agreed to put on extra trains the first was due to arrive in the city  minutes after the match had begun.Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes pointed out that the scheduling would have little or no effect on his team’s preparations which would just go ahead in the usual fashion. That may be so but for the fans it would have been a complete nightmare.Hearts boss Craig Levein was more outspoken, which is becoming a regular feature of a man who was once seen as boring. He described the SPFL’s decision as absolute madness.The Edinburgh club’s owner Ann Budge also voiced concern, given the dficulties that could arise from having over , supporters from four dferent clubs in Glasgow on the same day.She was quite correct. The probability that it would deter younger Hearts followers from travelling, as it could be a very late trip back to the capital, was a very real one.Budge was one of those who asked the SFPL to think again, saying the body should be encouraging fans to attend and not making it dficult for them.If the first game had gone to extra time and penalties it could have been well after pm before the stadium was emptied. That would not have given much time to clear up the inevitable mess, get rid of , people and get another , in.If any evidence was needed about what is wrong with Scottish football, here it is. The Scottish football authorities had placed all its eggs in one basket with Hampden and had no option but to try and justy the daft move. It really did beggar belief.: : : : : : : :Fortunes have been mixed for Shetland’s rugby teams so far in their mainland competition endeavours.The men’s side began by losing all three games and finishing bottom of group one in the oddly named North Region Referee’s Cup, although they were only well beaten in one of the ties.Then, on the back of a promising home league win against Aberdeenshire, they unfortunately came up short on Saturday after a long trip to the Western Isles, going down - to Stornoway.The revamped Tennents Caledonia North  ision looks very competitive, with the likelihood of most teams being able to beat anyone on their day.Shetland, as we all know, will be a match for most at home. But it remains dficult to do the same when travelling, with so many players not able to commit due to one reason or another.The depth of the squad is very important, which is why it is heartening to see more youngsters coming into the equation. They, after all, are the future of the club.The women’s team, on the other hand, have enjoyed a great start to the season, beating both Banff and Inverness Craig Dunain and currently leading the Tennents North League table.Last year’s league winners Orkney have already lost a game against Inverness, and a fascinating battle could ensue at Clickimin on Sunday when the island rivals go head to head.: : : : : : : :As someone who has supported Manchester United for over half a century, it pains me to see the state of the club under manager Jose Mourinho.This week’s home peformance against Valencia was abysmal, with several players totally devoid of pace and urgency and obviously not doing the business for the man in charge.The stunned silence among the fans was something that has rarely,ever, been seen before. Many of them began leaving Old Trafford with  minutes still remaining, and you really can’t blame them.The once-great club has been on the way down ever since the retiral of Alex Ferguson. The treatment of his replacement David Moyes was shocking, being sacked after only eight months in charge, and the appointment of the next incumbent Louis Van Gaal was a mistake.The worst move of all though was to hand the job to Mourinho. Winning the Europa League and the League Cup in his first season obviously gave  hope to some but he really was an awful choice.This walking advert for narcissism needs to go now before things become even worse. But the question is who will be next in line. Zinedine Zidane has been tipped because of his supposed “humility”, in contrast to Mourinho, although that was hardly evident with the infamous dismissal for head-butting Marco Materazzi in the  World Cup final.Others who have been tipped include Didier Deschamps, who led France to World Cup success a few months ago, or former United player Laurent Blanc who was recently in charge at Paris Saint-Germain.While it will most likely be another foreign manager who succeeds Mourinho, I reckon the club could attempt to reverse the trend by appointing an Englishman.Why not give someone like Eddie Howe of Bournemouth the job  He is one of the brightest young bosses in the country and has performed wonders at a club where the ambitions are basically to stay in the Premier League. But sadly I can’t see it happening.: : : : : : : :Contrary to my views on Mourinho, it was very disappointing to see the likeable Steve Bruce handed his marching orders by Aston Villa this week.Bruce led the club to the final of the Championship play-offs last season, but was sacked on Wednesday after a - home draw with Preston North End the previous evening.Villa are now th in the table but had they beaten Preston they would have risen to fth equal, only five points behind the leaders. A couple more matches and things could have been on the up again.Bruce had a cabbage thrown at him by a so-called fan before the game on Tuesday and later said the incident unfortunately summed up society at the moment.“There’s no respect for anyone any more,” he told interviewers, a statement which was borne out by the actions of the Aston Villa board of directors the following day. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"whalsays new research arrives in lerwick for first time ","story":"The Research leaves Symbister with bunting flying as she heads for Lerwick on Saturday.

He deserves all the support possible.Tomorrow’s match, despite being outside the Six Nations, should still be hotly contested. In the absence of Hogg and Barclay, English-based Sean Maitland and David Denton, and half-backs Finn Russell and Greg Laidlaw who now ply their trade in France, it gives an opportunity for some youngsters to make their mark.Those include Blair Kinghorn and Adam Hastings who have been named in the starting line-up, while Darcy Graham, George Horne and Matt Fagerson may get their chance later in the game.He won’t be making an appearance on this occasion as he plays for Welsh side Scarlets, but I am particularly interested in seeing Kiwi import Blade Thomson in the next three tests.

He had represented Cunningsburgh, Ness United and ious Shetland select sides, once making a trip to Faroe with a county squad.Alastair was probably a wing-half in his early days, but after the change from -- to modern formations he usually formed part of the central defence.He played alongside the late Ian Manson for Ness, while for Cunningsburgh his long-term partner was Douglas Halcrow. They were part of a team which enjoyed many successes in Southern League football, and also which won the Parish Cup in  and .Cunningsburgh had a number of outstanding players in that era, not least twins Billy and Malcolm Adamson and the late George Adamson, but Alastair was definitely one of the most consistent.Very similar to his -year career at The Shetland Times, he was as dedicated as it was possible to be, someone you could always count on whatever the issue.As former goalkeeper Peter Farmer said after the funeral last Friday, “I played behind Alistair for  years and he was so reliable, the way he read the game.”Football runs in the family. His younger brother Gordon also played for Cunningsburgh and Ness while another brother Jim represented Shetland in  and . Nephews Raymond and James Aitken and Tony and James Johnston did likewise, with the latter becoming the county’s equal most-capped player.When the Times started a works league team in the s Alistair was persuaded to come out of retirement and take part in the very first match, a friendly against Bressay. That was where his we hailed from and I recall him saying that “I better no score a goal or Margaret will nivver spaek ta me again”.He also came with the works team on a trip to Orkney. He was a bit unsure about that and actually got injured in one of the matches, but as far as I recall he had as good a time as anybody where the after-match entertainment was concerned.Alastair and Margaret had three daughters, Wendy and twins Susan and Alison. They were all musically gted while Susan and Alison excelled at hockey.One of his grand-daughters, Sophie Moar, is a top athlete. At the island games in Jersey three years ago she won a bronze medal in the long jump and was a member of the gold medal-winning # metres relay squad. Alastair and Margaret were there to see it and I would imagine that was one of his proudest ever moments. After his retiral in  our paths crossed a few times but unfortunately not all that often. He was always friendly and good company.The last time I saw Alastair was earlier this year when I visited him and Margaret at Bremmer in Cunningsburgh. It was a very dficult experience as by then the dementia had taken its toll, and he was a shadow of the vibrant figure he had been. He still knew me though, which made it worthwhile.Alistair was a tremendous guy. I know Margaret, their daughters and grandchildren, and the other family will miss him greatly, and I would like to give my condolence to them all.: : : : : : : :News came this week that Crystal Palace footballer James McArthur had retired from Scotland duty as he believed it was the only way he could “continue to play at the top level”.There was a time when representing your country was considered the “top level” but sadly that is not a view shared by an increasing number of people in the game.McArthur, who won the last of his  caps a year ago, says he has found it increasingly dficult to manage a number of physical issues. He is only .The Crystal Palace midfielder will continue to turn out for his club in what could be -odd games a season. However, he has deemed the half a dozen or so he could be required for his international side to be just too much.McArthur follows in the wake of a number of Scottish players who have taken this decision, the highest profile being Celtic captain Scott Brown. Others, such as Alan Hutton, are still performing regularly for their clubs.There were also the recent instances where both Leigh Grfiths, Robert Snodgrass and Kieran Tierney asked to be released from the international squad because of perceived “fatigue”.No doubt McArthur, like the others mentioned, has his reasons for arriving at this decision. But I cannot help thinking that players from a dferent era would never have done so.Some, notably Denis Law and current Scottish boss Alex McLeish, have said they have never retired from their country. They would still be availablerequired. Attitudes have definitely changed, and not for the better.: : : : : : : :The Australian Cricketers’ Associationthis week called for the bans to be lted on the three players who were involved in ball-tampering in South Africa earlier this year.The association has laid part of the blame for the incident at the door of Cricket Australia, who it has labelled “arrogant and controlling”.Steve Smith, David Warner and Cameron Bancroft were all “contrite men who have suffered enough”, a review carried out by the ACA stated.Smith, who was captain at the time, and vice-captain Warner are seven months into their one-year bans, while Bancroft, who carried out the cheating, will be eligible tonext month.While the three may have endured both a degree of humiliation – Smith’s tearful confession was felt by some to be meaningful – and financial penalties, lting the ban now would send all the wrong signals.Cheating in sport, however apologetic the protagonists may appear in the aftermath, is an anathema which needs punishing.

It#s very rare to see a flag flying any time except on the Lord Lieutenants flag flying days list ofwhich is out of date.It is troubling to hear where the British media still blame German militarism and nationalism for WW, asnationalism and militarism were ever missing from the British national outlook. All major European powers fought to gain advantage over neighbours.It is refreshing though to hear the French President tell world leaders, including Putin and Trump, that nationalism is a #betrayal of patriotism#.#By saying #our interests first and never mind the others#, you stamp out the most precious thing a nation has # its moral values,# he said, thereby insisting these sometimes exist.The European Union used to be widely regarded as a moral endeavour. It seems most of our neighbours still see it that way, as something worthwhile which tempers selfish instincts and secures peace.If Brexit goes ahead the prospect of Britain forgetting its responsibilities as a victor, as Churchill put it in, #for the immediate future of the world# looms large.

A lot of visitor experiences are going to be marred.\"Adam Gough, CairnGorm Mountain representative, who had told of the need for the slopes aimed at beginners and intermediates, was clearly stunned by the rejection.Asked immediately after the decisionan appeal was likely, he said that a statement would be issued later.CNPA head planner Gavin Miles had stressed from the outset the application had to be determined on planning issues ndash landscaping impacts in particular ndash and not on its commercial merits, which had generated much argument.He said the business case was a matter for Natural Retreats.Mr Miles told the committee the articial slope would not extend the ski area in any signicant way but the footprint of obvious development would increase.He commented: \"Initially the team were very concerned about the landscaping but as more information was given to us by the applicants it was considered that in the long term planting would mitigate against that. There would be an impact in the short term of the dry ski slope.\"Whether it will ever be an attraction in its own right and generate signicant income, who knows, but that is not a consideration of the planning process.\"In effect it is a ersication of business in this area and therefore acceptable andit was to strengthen the stability of CairnGorm Mountain then thats a good thing.\"He said there were some hefty planning conditions attached to control the development.CairnGorm Mountains representative said some  per cent of total visits to the resort were in just three winter months of the year.Mr Gough had told the committee Natural Retreats had explored several options in depth to remove the reliance on winter income including mountain biking and zip-wiring but this plan was the most viable at this time.He said it was imperative the attraction can provide year-round employment in order to retain its best staff. This site was the most sheltered for the ski slope and close to other facilities without impacting on other slopes, he said. It could also be used for tubing and other activities.Mr Gough acknowledged the clamour for better ski uplt at CairnGorm which has been overtaken as Scotlands most popular ski resort.He said: \"We would like nothing more than to be able to upgrade ski infrastructure to improve the snowsports experience for everyone but this has to be a long term process built on solid commercial foundations.\"He said the slope could be in operation for  per cent of the year outwith winter and ice would not be a problem as it was easy practice to break it up.ABA secretary Alan Brattey said history showed articial slopes at Scottish resorts including the Lecht, Glenshee and Glencoe had not worked.He also said a bright green Snowflex slope would stand out like a sore thumb and no consideration had been given by the operator to an alternative by market leader, Neveplast, which could be camouflaged.He said that of just over  votes on Facebook on the application,  per cent were against it.Tessa Jones, of the Badenoch and Strathspey Conservation Group, asked the committee: \"What are you going to say to the world about this peatland destruction \"Committee member Dave Fallows moved the application be refused and he was seconded by Carolyn Caddick.He said he appreciated the efforts to mitigate against the ski slope but said: \"It cant possibly soften in the long term the impact that this makes on the area.\"Mrs Caddick said: \"We are going to see it for miles and miles around.\"Peter Argyle had moved in favour of the application saying he had faith in the planning officers conditions but was not supported.Mr Brattey said after the vote: \"This was very much the right decision and wed like to congratulate the planning committee for deciding to reject this planning application against the advice of their planning officials.\"We very much hope that common sense will now prevail and that the plans for the Ptarmigan Building will be dropped.\"We are left to wonder just exactly why HIE allowed their tenant to take such a madcap plan all the way to the CNPAs planning committee who were very decisive in their rejection of it.\"He said HIE should ert the pound million to new uplt. \"The hill business requires to be funicular proofed as soon as possible,\" said Mr Brattey.Wednesday  Nov  : PM"},{"url":"https://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04118000/04118338.jpg","title":"Helping mountain to reach its peak","story":"Gavin MusgroveA pound MILLION vision to revive CairnGorm Mountain has been laid out to release the resorts immense unlocked potential over the next five to  years.US-based consultancy SE Group believes the resort can attract in the region of , winter visitors per year ndash more in seasons when there are peak snow conditions ndash with the right targeted investments.But controversially they appear to have written-off any future for Coire na Ciste which accounts for one-third of the ski area and boasts the best terrain for skiers and boarders at intermediate level and beyond.Instead the report proposes that all the focus for snowsports is on Coire Cas and two state-of-the art six person chairlts should be installed.There is also a role for the funicular which is currently not running at the resort because of safety fears.However, it is seen as having a subsidiary role as snowsports uplt and to be used and maintained more for non-skiers and ski school customers.Vermont-based SE Group carried out its independent review of uplt infrastructure at the resort between February and September, earlier this year.No funding has been allocated.

in","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe Armadale to Mallaig crossing is among the most popular ferry routes in Scotland according to new figures obtained by Kate Forbes MSP.According to  statistics, Ardrossan to Brodick had the highest number of passengers with ,, followed by Largs to Millport , Wemyss Bay to Rothesay , Oban to Craignureand Mallaig to Armadale .Skye, Lochaber and, Badenoch MSP, Kate Forbes said she was surprised that Mallaig to Armadale crossing proved more popular than Ullapool to Stornoway .The statistics also showed that the Skye to Mallaig route was the most popular crossing for coaches across Scotland.Kate Forbes MSP said: “Since RET was introduced by the SNP Government, it’s great to see the rise in passengers.“RET is vitally important to the islands and has arguably done more than anything  to level the playing field for island communities who need to travel.“Mallaig to Armadale figures were up by  per cent compared to the fateful summer of . Importantly that means that visitors will be travelling through the Sleat peninsula, where communities have worked long and hard to build up a viable industry.“In the midst of the important debates about ferries and not least the importance of the MV Coruisk to the Armadale-Mallaig crossing, it’s important to celebrate the huge contribution that RET has made to the island economies.”If CalMac#s league tables of ferry route usage tell us anything, it is that moving the MV #Coruisk# from its purpose-built harbours on the busiest crossing in the north-west remains inexplicable.If the two tables of passengers and coaches highlight anything , it is that CalMac badly needs its two new ferries from the Clyde to be delivered according to their revised schedule and not experience a third delay.It is a mild surprise, as Kate Forbes MSP says, to discover that more people sail between Mallaig and Armadale in Skye than between Stornoway and Ullapool and that more coaches cross the Sound of Sleat than make any other journey on CalMac#s itinerary.It is good news not only for Sleat but for the whole of the island. It is good news which is tempered by the fact that this busy, bustling route is now served only by whatever ships CalMac can spare, when the tide permits them, while its purpose-built vessel, the MV #Coruisk#, which can dock at Armadale in all tidal conditions, is ploughing between Mull and Oban  nautical miles away.If CalMac had the ships, Mallaig Armadale would be dependable and therefore even busier, Mull would have a vessel of its own and almost everybody would be happy.CalMac do not have the ships in large part because two new deep-sea vessels which were commissioned in  from Ferguson Marine Engineering at Port Glasgow show no sign of turning up for duty.One of them is due to operate on CalMac#s busiest passenger route between Ardrossan and Arran. The other is to work between Uig, Tarbert and Lochmaddy, which last year carried almost , people.The delivery date for those two ships has been put back twice. On each occasion, the £ million contract to Ferguson Marine — which is the property of one of the Scottish Government#s friends, advisors and allies, the billionaire tax exile Jim McColl — was topped up by a multi-million-pound handout from the public purse.If all was on schedule at least one of those ships would now be in service, and CalMac would have substantially more leeway in manoeuvring its fleet from one part of the west coast to another. They might even be able to keep the #Coruisk# on the Sound of Sleat.They are very far from on schedule. The new Ardrossan Arran ferry is now supposed to be delivered next summer, and the new Uig Tarbert Lochmaddy ship in spring .Will they be delivered  Or will we experience a third delay, which would certainly plunge CalMac into even greater chaos as its ageing fleet breaks down or requires routine maintenance somewhere in the Baltic Those are important questions. As we reported last week, the chief executive of Outer Hebrides Tourism, Rob MacKinnon, has criticised the Scottish Government for a lack of any #tangible action# to address the islands# ferry problems.The Scottish transport ministry, said Mr MacKinnon, must #pursue all feasible options to increase ferry capacity in both the long and the short term for the benefit of both visitors and islanders#.As we report this week, Labour#s Western Isles# candidate Alison MacCorquodale has added her voice to the many demanding to know the precise terms of the private finance initiative deal which has bound the Scottish Government into using just one ferry for all passengers and freight between Ullapool and Stornoway, with unacceptable consequences.Ullapool Stornoway may not yet carry as many tourists as Mallaig Armadale. But it is the definition of a leline service, with , passengers last year, many of whom found themselves unable to squeeze onto an overbooked #Loch Seaforth#.We should be told how and why one of our biggest and most important ferries came to be owned by Lloyds Bank.We should be toldJim McColl is going to deliver two badly-needed ships at the third time of asking.It is not enough to say, as does transport minister Michael Matheson, that building CalMac#s ferries is #providing vital support to our shipbuilding industry#The way things are going, building and rebuilding CalMac#s ferries will keep Scottish shipbuilding alive well into the next decade. Their higher purpose, and Mr Matheson#s job is to provide vital support to the Hebridean ferry service. That support is urgently required."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/2018-mod-gold-medals-e1539885405814.jpg","title":"thursday at the mod skye and lochalsh gold medal","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThere was a Skye and Lochalsh double in the premier singing competition at this year’s National Mòd in Dunoon.In Wednesday night’s final Ceitidh Campbell from Kyle of Lochalsh won the women’s Gold Medal, while the men’s medal went to Ruairidh Cormack from Portree.Both singers are following in family footsteps in landing the prestigious honour, which is presented by Mòd organisers An Comunn Gàidhealach.Ceitidh’s mother, Barbara Smith, won the Gold Medal when the Mòd was held in Skye in .

This motion was agreed. earlier this week, the chair of the EDI committee, Councillor Allan Henderson said that the council was putting pressure on the Scottish Government to have the route classed as a trunk road. However, during Thursday’s meeting Councillor Cockburn was quick to dismiss the likelihood of this happening: “Who in their right mind would take  miles of the worst road in the Highlands” He said. “After six and a half years we still only have two options… and the delays and the consequences for the wider community have been absolutely shocking.”The SNP member for Wester Ross, Strathpeffer and Lochalsh also went on to question the tendering process behind the work at the bypass, saying: “Was it necessary to shut the road during the day  I believe there was a tender on the table that would have allowed the road to open during the day.”He went on to argue that the council needed to release money straight away to enable design work on the replacement options for the current bypass to begin, adding that it was a matter of urgency due to the risks identied in the  annual sloping report which detailed four very high-risk rock slopes at the Stromeferry bypass.In response to Councillor Cockburn, the council’s head of infrastructure Colin Howell said that the council did receive an alternative tender from a contractor who said they could carry out the required works at night, however, Mr Howell said the cost was signicant and due to concerns about these plans it was decided it would be wise for some of the work to be undertaken during the day.Mr Howell said that while there were ongoing issues with rockfalls and managing slopes, he believed that the council had done a good job. He went on to add that the council were prioritising the high-risk slopes and currently working on the cost and details in relation to stabilising those areas which would be delivered at the next EDI committee meeting. He added that there were “three optimum solutions” in respect to replacement options and said that the committee had “decided to leave those three on the table# and seek dialogue with Scottish Government for funding. He said: “The administration is looking for feedback, we are working on slopes with high risks and will come back to the next EDI with the costing.”Councillor Derek MacLeod described the current situation as “one episode in a long, long history of problems with the route#, and in contrast to his fellow ward member, Councillor Cockburn, he argued that the route should be “trunked between Auchtertyre and Garve” as he believed it to be strategic in linking the ferry points of Uig and UllapoolCouncil Leader Margaret Davidson told the committee that she would be meeting with the Transport Secretary Michael Matheson and would report back “what options have been put on the table.” Councillor Davidson said that the council were “acutely aware of what’s needed” and were working towards a long-term sustainable option for Stromeferry.

For anartist of his stature this was courageous, dependent as he was, tosome extent, on commissions from people who, to say the least, wouldnot be subscribers to our paper. But this was an artist who went hisown way in art and who acted as a citizen with a conscience in anIreland where State-imposed censorship distorted not only politicaldebate but also national self-image. For Robert Ballaghcreative work and active citizenship have gone hand in hand all hisle. This is depicted in his double self-portrait ‘Upstairs No.’,one of the many illustrations of his work in this superbly writtenand beautully presented book. It is not a standard autobiographywith chapters set out in chronological order beginning with genealogyand ending with this week’s news. As you would expect from Ballagh,he takes a dferent approach, starting towards the later years andcircling through his days in no particular order before coming backto the present. More than that, he weaves narrative, anecdote andreflection together seamlessly and conversationally showing a skillwith words akin to his skill with brushes. He has a story to tell ofa very ied le, from his unusual family background to his time asa showband guitar player, through his unorthodox beginning as apainter and his development as an artist and an activist. Withfrankness and clarity he tells us how he learned and matured as anartist and his brief commentaries on many of his works areilluminating both of how they were made and the concepts behind them.It makes the reader want to look again and more intensely at thepictures. The Prologue isessentially a dedication to Robert’s late we Betty, his lelonginspiration, mentor and most important critic. The first chaptertells the harrowing story of how Betty, in her serious illness, wasdisgracefully let down by a healthcare system which basically allowedher to die through neglect, as was admitted in legal proceedings. Butthis does not cast a shadow over the book, as her positive presenceis felt throughout, and is celebrated by the author. These days I rarely getthat urge immediately to re-read a book when I reach the end, but Idid with this one. Thankfully the chapters are so well defined thatthey can be read as stand-alone essays or stories. Take just twoexamples: ‘Who Fears to Speak ofEaster Week’ recounts the tremendous people’s commemoration ofthe  Centenary in which Robert played a central part, aculmination of his activism which has included campaigning againstapartheid, for the Birmingham Six, for artists’ rights, with theIrish National Congress opening border roads, in solidarity withPalestine and as an enthusiastic participant in Féile an Pobail inWest Belfast from its commencement.‘Dining at McDonald’s’is a brilliant critique of the dominant and stultying modernistideology and practise in art and an appeal for an opening up. Ballaghattacks “the notion that the artists’ choice imbues a givenobject with special properties which are tantamount to a metaphysicaltransformation of the object that it ceases to be a pedestrianartefactand becomes,by virtue of the artist’s choice, art”. This ideology leads tothe absurdity of much of the ‘installation’ stuff in galleriesthat baffles all but elitist insiders and, as Ballagh recounts, theclaim by loyalist killer Michael Stone that his attack on Stormontwas a piece of performance art. He argues that the bureaucracies mustset aside this ideology and make galleries more open and democratic .For these views and forhis artistic method and, among some I suspect, for his politics,Ballagh has been frowned upon by certain elites. One prominent figurein the Irish art world said of him with dripping condescension thathe is “not a real artist, he is a mere illustrator”. Typically,Ballagh responded with humour and defiance in a self-portrait wearinga t-shirt saying ‘Fuck the Begrudgers’.

The last time nationalists had attempted to hold a parade inside the walls was on St Patrick’s Day  – when they were batoned by the RUC.Housing was a massive issue in Derry and the Derry Housing Action Committeeprovided the focus for leadership as the Civil Rights campaign took off. The DHAC had organised a James Connolly commemoration in the city in July  which was banned by the unionist government.The Northern Ireland Civil Rights Associationagreed to hold a march in Derry on  October. The loyalist Apprentice Boys organisation immediately announced a counter-demonstration with the purpose of forcing the unionist government’s hand to ban the Civil Rights march. But the regime at Stormont did not require forcing because the Home Affairs Minister was ultra-unionist William Craig, who promptly imposed the ban.NICRA held an emergency meeting with the DHAC. Many on the NICRA Executive and some Derry nationalist figures, including John Hume, wanted to cancel the march, but the majority of Derry activists were determined to defy the ban. They won out and the march was to proceed as planned.It was a relatively small march, beginning on Craigavon Bridge with several hundred people. The objective was the Diamond in the city centre.The march was stopped in Duke Street by the RUC. A meeting was held with speakers including Gerry Fitt, Betty Sinclair, Eddie McAteer, Ivan Cooper, Austin Currie and Eamonn McCann. Three Westminster Labour MPs were also present.After the meeting, the marchers found themselves hemmed in on all sides by the RUC. They could not disperse and after a tense stand-off the RUC, oblivious to the presence of TV cameras and photographers, unleashed an unprovoked attack on the crowd with batons, boots and fists. Water cannons were then used.Bernadette Devlin McAliskey, then a young People’s Democracy activist, recalled:“Quite deliberately, they hosed in the upstairs windows and shopfronts, and they went right across Craigavon Bridge, hosing all the onlookers. The police just went mad.”The RUC attack in Duke Street brought the Civil Rights struggle in Ireland to a world audience for the first time. It was a complete eye-opener to many people in the  Counties and in Britain. But most profound was its effect on young nationalists.Derry man Mickey Devine , the last of the ten Hunger Strikers to die in the H-Blocks of Long Kesh in , recalled:“Like every young person in Derry, my whole way of thinking was tossed upside down by the events of  October . I didn’t even know there was a Civil Rights march I saw it on television.“But that night I was down the town smashing shop windows and stoning the RUC. I developed an intense hatred of the RUC. As a child I had always known not to talk to them or to have anything to do with them, but this was dferent.The RUC attacked the Civil Rights march in Duke Street, Derry, on  October .test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27485  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonThe past cannot be changed, nor can our shared hurt, suffering and pain be undone. While there may never be agreement on the ious contested narratives of the past, these must all be respected and acknowledged.- Declan KearneyThis week the NIO consultation on dealing with the legacy of thepast in the north of Ireland closed.It will inform a legislative process and bringforward future legacy legislation.Failure to deal with the past remains one of the most signicantimpediments to political progress here.It is a barrier to the development of a comprehensivereconciliation and healing process in this society.British state policy has been the primary factor in preventinglegacy issues from being addressed or resolved.Powerful sections of the British military and intelligence systemhave never embraced the peace process. They remain psychologically andpolitically locked into a conflict mind-set even twenty years after the GoodFriday Agreement was signed.The role of British State forces and their agents, a refusal toacknowledge and be accountable for their actions, combined with a disregard forsuccessive binding court rulings, has defined the British state’s approach tolegacy matters.That has been reinforced in recent times by a cynical and narrative, including interventions by the British Prime Minister Theresa May,and British Secretary of State in the north, Karen Bradley, to suggest thatonly state forces were being made subject to legacy investigations.These statements are offensive and wrong, and are an egregiousdemonstration of the partisan nature of British policy towards dealing with thepast.They are consistent with the British practice of denying wrongdoing, concealing the truth, and preventing accountability.This poses a major challenge to ensuring that a robust,independent, and impartial facilitation of the legislative process will emergefrom this consultation on addressing the legacy of the past.All sides suffered, and caused suffering to each other during theconflict.There are multiple narratives regarding our tragic past. There isno single narrative despite the attempts of the British state and politicalunionism to assert otherwise.The past cannot be changed, nor can our shared hurt, suffering andpain be undone. While there may never be agreement on the ious contestednarratives of the past, these must all be respected and acknowledged.The Stormont House Agreement, , , set out an agreedframework of legacy mechanisms which provided an unprecedented opportunity tocomprehensively deal with the past in all its aspects.Subsequent draft legislation reneged on the British government’sobligations under the SHA by introducing a national security veto, which hadthe effect of blocking a way forward on the issue of legacy.Full implementation of the SHA on a human rights compliant basispresents the best opportunity to deal with the legacy of our past and guaranteea framework which is victim centred.Facilitation of any future legislative process will require thatthe British government must ensure all victims are treated with equality,respect and dignity that the legislation reflects the policy intent of theAgreement and, that the legacy architecture is fully independent, human rightscompliant, and properly resourced and funded.The following key principles should be central to the operation offuture legacy legislation and mechanisms.-          Allprocesses should be victim centred-          Allprocesses must secure the co-operation of all relevant parties to ensuresuccess-          Allprocesses should be based upon equality, respect, and dignity-          Allprocesses must be free from political interference and be absolutelyindependent-         Acknowledgement should be central to the operation of the legacy framework-          The aim ofthat framework should be to enable reconciliation and healing within widersocietyIf there is to be a collective and comprehensive engagement withthe past in a human rights compliant manner, there can be no hierarchy ofvictimhood or humanity.There must be no change to the definition of a victim.High-quality services should be provided to all victims at thepoint of need.This should extend to the immediate provision of a pension for allseriously and psychologically injured during the conflict.The British Government should also immediately release therequired funding to resource the Lord Chief Justice’s inquest plan, as aseparate distinct process from any new legacy mechanisms.The Office of the Police Ombudsman should be adequately andimmediately resourced.Any attempt by the British state to introduce a statute oflimitations to protect its forces and agents would be a violation of the SHA and must be opposed.Full participation and unfettered disclosure by British stateforces and its agents with the legacy mechanisms will be essential to achievefull public confidence in their ability to deliver on behalf of all society.Periodic reviews should be carried out to inform the extent offunding requirements and necessary timeframe, for all legacy mechanisms.Legacy processes should not be limited or impeded by closedmaterial proceedings. In addition, for future legacy mechanisms toasintended, it is essential families are given full access to legal aid.The legacy legislation which ultimately emerges from theconsultation must comply with the policy intent of the SHA by:-          Promotingreconciliation-          Upholdingthe rule of law-         Acknowledging and addressing the suffering of all victims and survivors-         Facilitating the pursuit of justice and information recovery-          Beinghuman rights compliant-          Beingbalanced, proportionate, transparent, accountable, fair, and equalThe full implementation of that Agreement representsthe best potential and opportunity to address the legacy of our politicalconflict and the suffering experienced by everyone during the conflict inIreland, Britain and beyond. So, it is now time to finally deal with the past.  It is time tobuild for the future. It is time to lay the foundations for reconciliation andhealing, and to open up a new phase of the peace

permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic norms, social modernity, political integrity, and standards in public office”Ive been wondering lately whether anyone in Democratic Unionist Partyleadership circles actually try to reflect upon what republicans, nationalists, and other progressive minded citizens think about the current political situation.Do they even care what others think The evidence suggests not.Several days ago the DUP leader pronounced that her party could and would change the Good Friday Agreementat a whim. There was no hint of irony in her claim – the DUP has spent the last  years opposing the GFA, ever since it was signed.In another extraordinary, but not untypical, outburst she declared her blood red line position on Brexit and, that in the same week as the consultation on dealing with the past was concluding!Of course the DUP leader, and other key figures have form in making offensive and provocative political interventions.Her dehumanising description of republicans as \"crocodiles\" in  comes to mind.Notably, she previously called republican and nationalist Ministers in a ing Executive ‘rogues and renegades.Only the DUP knows whether this leader is naturally predisposed to being rhetorically gaffe prone, or is being deliberately offensive.Perhaps some figures in the DUP do think about wider opinion: the DUP is not a monolith after all.But, those currently in charge of the DUP have turned away from power sharing.  They oppose equality and rights, and reject reconciliation.Instead they have chosen to join forces with the extremists in the British Tory party to help steer the Brexit train wreck.The DUP leadership is living in a delusional bubble.Meanwhile, the party brand has become indistinguishable from the financial scandals of recent years such as Red Sky, NAMA, Brexit dark money, and financial relationships with Sri Lanka.The ongoing RHI inquiry exposé of how the DUP behaved in government makes a complete mockery of its purported adherence to good governance’.The party MPs have become power drunk through their pact with the Tories, and a serious misconception that they are king makers in Westminster.  Edward Carsons cautionary words have clearly been forgotten or disregarded.  He warnedWhat a fool I was.  I was only a puppet, and so was Ulster… in the political game that was to get the Conservative party into power.’ The DUP has a tactical approach towards everything including maintaining the status quo on its own terms, slowing down and frustrating progressive societal change, and maintaining sectarian dominance within the unionist constituency.The DUP leadership is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic norms, social modernity, political integrity, and standards in public office.  Its inability and refusal to embrace dference or celebrate ersity is reflected in an institutionalised bigotry against, and intolerance towards the Irish national identity and cultural traditions, and LGBT rights.The partys contempt and sharp practice in government has destroyed wider public confidence in the political institutions, and led to the decisive tipping point of RHI and withdrawal of the Líofa grant scheme in the winter of .As a result of its ingrained arrogance and lack of political humility the DUP leadership is constantly in denial about how society in Ireland views its sectarianism, homophobia, and toxic pact with the Tories.The overwhelming majority of republicans, nationalists, and many others, including sections of civic unionism, do not believe the DUP is serious about restoring genuine power sharing. These citizens want the institutions to be restored, but not at the risk of allowing the DUP to continue practicing discrimination, disrespect, intimidation, bigotry, and sharp practice. They will not be giving the DUP permission to get back into power on that basis.  And, neither will Sinn Féin.The DUPs behaviour, and the onslaught of Brexit have together brought back graphically into focus the denial of rights which resulted in the Civil Rights Movement fty years ago.A generational realignment has occurred within northern nationalism.Acht Gaeilge, marriage equality, womens reproductive health rights, legacy justice rights, and the demand for a Bill of Rights are the modern day acid test equivalents of one person, one vote.  The current crisis in the north of Ireland is the visceral culmination of  years of DUP push back against the GFA.Intoxicated with its imaginary power at Westminster, the DUP leadership has finally over played its hand. The political institutions could have been re-established by the th February last, but the DUP leaders walked out of negotiations.Instead of selling the deal which they negotiated in February with Sinn Féin, the DUP leader, deputy leader, party chief executive, and its senior talks team bottled out.Since then the party has been convulsed with the resultant internal fall out.  There has been no meaningful contact with Sinn Féin, and absolutely no willingness demonstrated to resume negotiations.Any advocacy of blood red lines is a total anathema to democracy.The wider nationalist constituency is fed up to the back teeth with the subversion of the political process by the DUP, the British Tory government and others in political unionism.It is more impatient than ever for equality, rights and parity of esteem.  The history of  is being replayed. Thousands marching from Duke Street in Derry city on Saturday th October to mark the iconic civil rights march  years before is the latest example of that.  An exciting momentum for change is taking place across Ireland, north and south.  Old orthodoxies are being eclipsed by discussions about new, modern, all-Ireland constitutional and political arrangements. The permanent unionist electoral majority is gone and demographic changes are irreversible.All of this puts the onus back upon both governments to act decisively to address the denial of rights.The Irish government needs to take the lead because for now the DUP has this British government over a barrel.  But thats a short-term situation.  A British general election in the immediate to mid term cannot be ruled out.A new political discourse has begun about the future. All sections of society need to be involved in this and the unionist is critical in all of this.Brexit, the GFA, citizens rights, and an Irish unity referendum are central to that. Progressives should explore common ground and alliances for change.Republicans and unionists need to start to face the same way.  We have to begin looking at each other through eyes of the future.The benchmarks of a rights-based society guaranteeing civil and religious liberties and equality for all, are set.  These are not negotiable.So, whoever is actually in charge of the DUP for the time being has a lot of serious thinking to do...Who now leads the DUP  Do they have the authority to negotiate and stick to an agreement Are they committed to a shared future with republicans, nationalists, and others in the north Unless, and until the DUP can clearly answer these questions for the rest of society, it will remain exactly where it is now – out of power, and facing the inevitable fate about which Carson warned: getting dumped by the British Tories.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27487  ","story":" Mícheál Mac DonnchaThe Liberal Party was in government in Britain and had introduced the Home Rule Bill with the support of the Irish nationalist MPs in Westminster. They had abolished the veto of the House of Lords and Home Rule was due to be implemented in . The Tories seized on the issue of Home Rule as the most effective weapon to bring down the Liberals. Leading members of the British landed aristocracy, capitalists and senior military figures jumped on the bandwagon and backed up Unionist leader Edward Carson with threats of civil warHome Rule was brought in.Amidst the political frenzy there were very few Protestants in Ulster who were prepared to oppose Carsonism. But there were some and among them was the Reverend J.B. Armour of Ballymoney, County Antrim. A minister of the Presbyterian Church, Armour stood out from most of his co-religionists in advocating self-government for Ireland. In , he opposed a resolution at the Presbyterian General Assembly condemning Gladstone’s second Home Rule Bill. He was also a strong critic of landlordism.In , he again opposed a resolution against Home Rule at the Presbyterian General Assembly.Calling for freedom of conscience for Protestants to support or oppose Home Rule, Armour slammed the intolerance of Carsonism when he told the assembly:“If you deny the right of private judgment and of free speech, how much do you have of Protestantism worth keeping  Nothing at all.”Armour organised a public meeting of Protestants in Ballymoney to support Home Rule and oppose Carsonism. Banners in the hall proclaimed “No provisional or provincial government for us” and “Ulster for Ireland and Ireland for us”.The resolution stated that the meeting of Protestants of Ballymoney and the protests in The Route“against the claim of Sir Edward Carson and the self-constituted Provisional Government of Ulster to represent the Protestant community of north-east Ulster” and “disputes the narrow claim that dferences of creed necessarily separate Irishmen and women into hostile camps”. Among the speakers at the Ballymoney meeting were JB Armour himself, historian Alice Stopford Green, Jack White, son of a British Army general and later a leading figure in the Irish Citizen Army, and Roger Casement, who was executed in . This was Casement’s first appearance on a political . With his Antrim family background, Casement regarded the occasion as hugely signicant and in his speech he denounced any notion of partitioning Ireland. The meeting was a once-off and failed to turn the tide of Carsonism but it did show that a signicant minority of Protestants in the North-East were still prepared to stand up for Irish unity and self-government. The meeting of Protestants in Ballymoney in support of Irish self-government was held on  October ,  years ago this week. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27490  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonThe labour movement will only successfully put its mark on the Irish unity debate by arguing for the primacy of economic democracy, and the case for a rights-based society in a new Ireland.- Declan KearneyLast weekend the Irish Congress of Trades Unionsand Irish Labour History Society organised a conference to commemorate William Walker in Belfast.Walker was an anti-Home Rule unionist who was a leader in the Belfast Independent Labour Partyin the early twentieth century.When James Connolly, Irelands most signicant historical, socialist republican leader called on the ILPs membership to support socialist unity in Ireland, his appeal provoked a rebuke from Walker.This led to a robust debate between both figures in the pages of Forward between May and July .Their debate came to be known as the Connolly Walker controversy and later became an historical reference point for the anti-imperialist struggle in Ireland.I participated in a  alongside veteran trade unionist Joe Bowers, Ulster Unionist councillor Chris Mc Gimpsey, and ICTU Assistant General Secretary, Owen Reidy, to discuss the post Walker years and the current situation in the north.Not surprisingly we delivered four very dferent perspectives on Walker and his legacy as well as, Brexit the north strategy and politics on the Left and, future prospects.A very challenging but fraternal debate ensued between the lists and the audience.I opened my comments by saying that any consideration today of William Walker’s legacy needs to be within the historic and contemporary reality that the advancement of socialist and Labour politics has been held back due to the effects of British colonial policy in Ireland.He was a product of his native Belfast and directly influenced by the communal environment within which he grew up.He was a protestant in a largely protestant workforce. Sectarianism in the late s and early s stalked Belfast.While Walker was severely limited in his political analysis he was committed to improving the conditions of his fellow workers.He is an integral part of Belfast’s industrial history and his contribution to the city’s labour heritage deserves recognition.British policy in Ireland and its consequences for Irish society has ided Irish workers along communal lines. It has paralysed the labour movement from effectively challenging partition and championing the strategic aim of Irish unity.Partition is the central fault line at the heart of Irish society and politics.Sectarianism remains a visceral blight in this state.Following partition, it was used by the ruling unionist elite to cement the foundation of the state and prevent unity among citizens on issues of common concern.The fact is Labour was indeed told to wait as the resurgent struggle for national independence grew in momentum just over  years ago.The counter revolution which took place post partition represented a strategic setback for labour and working-class interests in the new free state.It eclipsed the seminal influence which socialist republicanism had on the  Proclamation and the Democratic Programme of the First Dáil.The rights of workers became subservient to the conservative elites, north and south.However, sections of the labour movement were compliant with British policy in Ireland and the imposition of partition.That was personied in the political thinking of Walker and others pre partition.This tendency opposed Connollys core position that \"the two currents of revolutionary thought in Ireland, the socialist and the national, were not antagonistic but complementary\".Walkers debate with Connolly reflected a key contradiction inherent in the Irish labour movement and its relationship with the Irish national liberation struggle, and anti-imperialism generally.That contradiction has existed ever since.Walkers brand of ‘Municipal Socialism’ was in reality a euphemism for self-imposed strategic and political limitations which went on to define the Trade Union movement in the north.As a result, the Irish labour movement, particularly in the north has failed to challenge partition and modern British political policy towards Ireland.Partition has been an abject failure. It was never designed to make the northern state a political or economic success.From the beginning this state has carried within it the conditions of inherent instability.It was built upon institutionalised and structural sectarianism which ensured that a substantial minority was destined never to be treated as equals.The Civil Rights Movement fty years ago exposed the inability of the unionist state to treat the minority as equals.That belligerent opposition from powerful sections within political unionism against reform of the northern state persists today in the form of political unionism, and specically DUP hostility towards implementation of the Good Friday Agreementsince .Refusal by the DUP to embrace a rights-based society and equality, culminated in the collapse of the GFA political institutions in January , and our associated political crisis which has continued since then. Those currently in charge of the DUP have turned away from power-sharing.The party brand is now indistinguishable from financial scandal and sharp practice in government.As a party, the DUP is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic reforms, social modernity, and standards in public office.Its project is negative and tactical, and entirely focused upon slowing down and blocking progressive change, while maintaining a sectarian hegemony within the unionist constituency.The DUP is in denial about how society in Ireland views its sectarian, homophobic and toxic pact with the Tories.The overwhelming majority of republicans, nationalists and many others, including sections of civic unionism, have concluded that the DUP has had its chance and cannot now be trusted in government.They will not be giving the DUP permission to get back into power at the risk of allowing it to continue practicing discrimination, intimidation, bigotry, or sharp practice.The enduring political crisis is accentuated by systemic structural weaknesses in the regional economy.The required investment in local public services and protection of workers’ rights are confronted with a combination of Tory austerity and Brexit.Pressures on public services are intensying.The regional block grant, or public expenditure settlement, has been reduced by .%.Real term cuts to public funding are now factored into future budget profiles alongside ·         Actual net cuts in take home pay for public and private sector workers·         Welfare cuts and the universal social charge·         Higher inflation and living costs, adults in working families live in relative povertyAverage wages in the north remain lower than ten years ago.Precarious working conditions, zero hours’ contracts, and the scam of bogus self-employment used by some employers are in common practice.Workers’ rights and protections are being systematically reversed.The onset of Brexit will be a catastrophe for the regional and island economiesIt will deepen an existing race to the bottom by further undermining the potential for economic growth, and new investment.The Brexit agenda, twinned with Tory austerity threaten jobs across all economic sectors, workers’ terms and conditions, and, any potential for sustainable public services in the north.The dawning political and economic reality is that Brexit has changed everything.It has exposed the negative role that partition continues to play in Irish affairs, and the fundamentally anti-democratic nature of the union with Britain.  The British state has been pushed into an unprecedented, existential political crisis.Brexit is a train wreck being jointly steered by the DUP and extremists in the British Tory party.But it also has become a defining moment for these islands.A new generation is questioning partition.There has been a seismic sht in the ambitions and expectations of citizens in the north.A new political discourse has begun about the future of Ireland north and south, and our relationships with Britain and EuropeThe debate on Irish unity and the timing of a unity referendum have moved centre stage.The time has come for a fundamental paradigm sht in British government policy towards Ireland.The Irish government needs to begin preparing constitutional, political and economic transition towards Irish Unity.It should facilitate an open, inclusive national conversation involving all citizens, political parties, social partners, and civic society.That is a dialogue about our collective future on this island which addresses all the concerns, accommodations and compromises relevant to negotiating a new, all Ireland, constitutional, pluralist democracy.Today this new focus upon Irish unity provides Irish trade unionists and workers with an opportunity to influence the debate about future constitutional and political change.Previous moments of political change have required that labour should wait.The emerging challenge for the Irish labour movement north and south is to engage with this emerging discussion.To paraphrase Connolly in his opening contributions to the Connolly Walker debate\"Constitutional change then is almost a certainty of the future.”The labour movement will only successfully put its mark on the Irish unity debate by arguing for the primacy of economic democracy, and the case for a rights-based society in a new Ireland.I said to the Belfast conference this reality will require Irish trade unionists to take strategic positions on supporting an Irish unity referendum and then to campaign positively for constitutional change.On Monday of this week I reiterated that opinion when I met Patricia King, General Secretary of ICTU in Dublin.Of course, this will be a challenging discussion for the Irish labour movement, as comrades noted both during and after the plenary discussion. But it should not be feared or avoided.Today in modern Ireland there is a battle for hearts and minds about how society is organisedThe status quo has failed us all.Connolly’s vision of a united Ireland which serves the interests of the many instead of the few will not be wished into existence.Labour should not wait again.The Irish labour movement needs to assert itself on the Irish unity debate by introducing a progressive labour agenda to the unfolding discourse on future constitutional and political change.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27491  ","story":" Mícheál Mac DonnchaThe writer, newspaper editor and Irish republican Seumas O’Kelly was a native of Loughrea, County Galway. Author of short stories, plays, poems and a novel, The Weaver’s Grave which was his masterpiece, O’Kelly’s le was cut short because of his commitment to Irish freedom. The O’Kelly family of Loughrea were flour millers and merchants and Seumas received a good education. He was a fellow student of James Joyce in University College Dublin. There is a remarkable photograph of the BA degree class of  including Joyce, O’Kelly and George Clancy. Like O’Kelly, George Clancy, a close friend of Joyce, was to die a tragic death. He was Sinn Féin Mayor of Limerick when on  March  he was murdered in his home by the Black and Tans, on the same night as former Mayor Michael O’Callaghan. Seumas O’Kelly was a committed republican from an early age. He is recorded as one of those to the fore in the centenary commemorations of the  Rising in . He was writing for Arthur Grfith’s Irish Republican Brotherhood-funded newspaper The United Irishman from  and for its successor Sinn Féin from . While a full list of attendees is not available it is probable that he was at the founding meeting of Sinn Féin in November . In  O’Kelly was appointed editor of the Leinster Leader in Naas, County Kildare. He founded a branch of Conradh na Gaeilge in the town and was active in Sinn Féin locally. He welcomed republicans to his home during the annual Wolfe Tone commemorations in nearby Bodenstown. O’Kelly’s first book of stories was published in  and his first play was produced the following year. Several of his plays were produced at the Abbey Theatre. Constantly busy with literary and journalistic work, O’Kelly was subject to poor health. He joined Óglaigh na hÉireann when they were founded in  but was unable to play an active military role. His brother was a Volunteer and was jailed in England after the  Rising. The paper Nationality, edited by Grfith, was established in  and O’Kelly was one of its writers. It was the main organ of Sinn Féin during the  and  by-elections. In May  Grfith was arrested and jailed in England and O’Kelly took over as editor of Nationality. Following the  November  Armistice which ended the First World War, British soldiers and loyalists ran riot through the streets of Dublin, attacking suspected Sinn Féin supporters. On the night of  November a crowd of drunken soldiers invaded the Sinn Féin Ard Oig at  Harcourt Street . Seumas O’Kelly was at his desk in the Nationality office and tried to defend himself with his walking stick. The office was wrecked and O’Kelly collapsed. He was brought to Jervis Street Hospital where he died of a brain haemorrhage. Seumas O’Kelly was honoured with a republican funeral to Glasnevin Cemetery, attended by huge crowds.

In  the Women’s Social and Political Union was founded in England and the militant feminists commenced the battle for the vote. In Ireland there had been groups working for women’s suffrage but the campaign really began here on the instigation of Hanna Sheehy Skeffington and Margaret Cousins. Margaret Cousins came from a unionist family in Dublin but she later wrote: “I belonged in my heart from the beginning to the fighters for freedom.” Her husband James Cousins also rejected the unionism of his background and became involved in the Gaelic revival. Margaret came into contact with the women’s movement in England in . On herto Ireland she co-operated with a remarkable young woman who was to make her mark on Irish history. Hanna Sheehy was the daughter of a Fenian, David Sheehy, who took part in the  Rising and was elected as a Parnellite MP in . Hanna was an exceptional student and excelled academically despite the restrictions on women’s access to education she achieved a first class honours MA in . She became a teacher and married Francis Skeffington. In line with their shared feminist principles they adopted each other’s surnames. Francis resigned his post as registrar of University College because the authorities refused to register women on the same basis as men. In  Hanna and Margaret founded the Irish Women’s Franchise League , with the active support of both Francis Sheehy Skeffington and James Cousins. From the beginning they stressed that the IWFL would address the specic needs of Irish women in “a subject country seeking freedom from England” and would “work on independent Irish lines”. Margaret Cousins described the IWFL’s position: “Its policy was to educate by all forms of propaganda the men, women and children of Ireland to understand and support the members of the League in their demand for votes for women, and to obtain pledges from every Irish Member of Parliament to vote for Women’s Suffrage Bills introduced in the British Houses of Parliament, and to include Women’s Suffrage in any Irish Home Rule Bill.” The IWFL campaigned throughout the country and made an impact beyond their numbers of about  activists. Not all militant women agreed with the IWFL’s tactics the republican group Inghinidhe na hÉireann refused to join in lobbying the British parliament, preferring to “organise a women’s movement on Sinn Féin lines, or on lines even broader still”. Despite this dference, republican women such as Constance Markievicz played an active role in the IWFL’s work and Hanna Sheehy Skeffington herself was strongly republican. Markievicz urged young Irishwomen to prepare to fight: “Arm yourselves with weapons to fight your nation’s cause. Arm your souls with noble and free ideas. Arm your minds with the histories and memories of your country and her martyrs, her language, and a knowledge of her arts and industries. Andin your day the call should come for your body to arm, do not shirk from that either.” Markievicz said Irishwomen were “doubly enslaved with a double battle to fight”. Following the  general election the Irish Party at Westminster was in a position to press the Liberal government to publish a Home Rule Bill. But Redmond and his party still refused to support women’s right to vote. The IWFL became more militant and Hanna and Francis founded the Irish Citizen newspaper to further the cause of women’s rights as well as Irish independence, social justice and pacism. When British politicians visited Ireland they were challenged by the IWFL. Margaret ‘Meg’ Connery confronted British Tory leader Andrew Bonar Law and Unionist leader Edward Carson when they came to Dublin. In Belfast Hanna Sheehy Skeffington challenged Winston Churchill. Margaret Cousins joined protests in England in  and was jailed for a month. In June  eight women from the IWFL smashed windows in Dublin Castle and other prominent buildings. Hanna was arrested at the Castle and she and the seven others were imprisoned in Mountjoy. The following month British Prime Minister Asquith visited Dublin and there were more protests. Three English feminists had followed Asquith to Ireland and they were also jailed for their protests. After a hunger strike in Mountjoy by the English suffragists and the IWFL women, all were released except two of the Englishwomen who were subjected to forced feeding. Many meetings of the IWFL were physically attacked at this time by Redmondites who saw the campaign for women’s suffrage as a threat to their political dominance and their relationship with the British Liberal government. In contrast, republicans such as Pádraig Mac Piarais and Thomas MacDonagh were supporters of the IWFL. The IWFL also won the support of prominent trade unionists James Larkin and James Connolly. They were closely allied with the Irish Women Workers Union in Liberty Hall and in  Hanna Sheehy Skeffington was jailed after a confrontation with the Dublin politan Police during the Great Lockout. She was released after a six-day hunger strike. That year also saw the death in England of feminist Emily Davison who ran on to the course at the Epsom Derby and was trampled by a race horse. Hanna Sheehy Skeffington was jailed again in  for campaigning against recruitment to the British Army. Her influence and that of the IWFL was seen in the Proclamation of the Irish Republic of  which enshrined women’s right to vote. Her friend James Connolly told her: “You will be glad to know that in the Proclamation of the Irish Republic we are including equal citizenship for women.” Hanna replied that she knew who was responsible, meaning Connolly himself. “We were practically unanimous, Only one questioned it,” replied Connolly. Francis Sheehy Skeffington was murdered in Portobello Barracks by a British Army officer during the Easter Rising. Hanna embarked on a tour of the United States to expose the truth about the murder and other British atrocities. She continued to play a leading role in the struggle for Irish freedom, as did many of the pioneering feminists of the IWFL. In  the IWFL saw its central aim achieved when women voted for the first time in the general election which resulted in a massive Sinn Féin victory, although women under  were still excluded. The IWFL actively opposed British rule and supported Dáil Éireann. For example in August  Hanna was badly beaten by the RIC who attacked a Sinn Féin meeting at which she spoke in Kilbeggan, Co. Westmeath. IWFL women went on to champion women’s rights in the decades following the Treaty when they faced the very dferent challenges of a partitioned Ireland with conservative anti-women governments North and South. The Irish Women’s Franchise League was founded  years ago on  November .test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27493  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonA wreckers’ agenda is being driven by the DUP and Tory government.

They must not be allowed to destroy the democratic option formaking change in the north.It is these circumstances which bring sharply into focus theIrish governments responsibilities.Those who courageously signed this letter to the Irish government are saying the negative position of the DUP and British governmentmust not be tolerated.These are citizens who want the political institutionsre-established but only on the basis of democracy and equality.They are assertive in their resolve to see a rights basedsociety created, which guarantees rights, respect, and parity of esteem, in ashared, inclusive future.But they are not prepared to be treated as second-classcitizens in this part of Ireland.Those days are over.It is time for the Irish Government to indeed redouble itsefforts to step up to the mark by absolutely opposing the imposition ofBrexit, and guaranteeing equality and rights for all citizens in the north.An Taoiseach and the Irish Government needs to reflect verycarefully about the signicance and timing of this intervention, respondpositively and act decisively, in cooperation with the politicalrepresentatives of Irish citizens, and others in the north, to ensure thattheir democratic rights are delivered upon.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27494  ","story":"• th NOVEMBER  - Newly elected Sinn Féin President Gerry Adams Mícheál Mac DonnchaTHE Ard Fheis of  marked a signicant stage in the political development of Sinn Féin. The historic gathering came in the wake of the campaign in support of the H-Block and Armagh prisoners, the epic Hunger Strikes, the intervention of prisoner candidates, North and South, in  and Sinn Féin’s electoral rise in the Six Counties in  and .The party’s performance in the October  Assembly elections – when five republicans were elected to the body set up by British direct ruler Jim Prior – caused alarm to the SDLP and their supporters in the Establishment parties in the  Counties. Sinn Féin’s lead in boycotting the Assembly was followed by the SDLP for fear of losing further support to republicans. The Fine Gael Labour Government, led by Garret FitzGerald, set up the New Ireland Forum in Dublin mainly as a  for the SDLP. In June , the political establishment in Ireland and Britain was rocked by the election of Sinn Féin Vice-President Gerry Adams as MP for his native west Belfast. For long a leading republican activist, Adams advocated the deeper politicisation and popularisation of the republican struggle and the building of Sinn Féin across the  Counties.The British Tory government of Margaret Thatcher was also concerned at the rise of Sinn Féin. In the week before the Ard Fheis in November , Prior told Tory MPs that Ireland could become a “Cuba off Britain’s west coast”. He said he feared Sinn Féin could overtake the SDLP electorally and “we must do all we can to strengthen constitutional nationalism”. When the Sinn Féin Ard Fheis gathered in the Mansion House in Dublin on  and  November, it was set to elect a new leadership. Ruairí Ó Brádaigh had been president since  and he announced that he would not be seeking re-election. He said the four-province federal Ireland plan, of which he had been a strong advocate, had been rejected at the  Ard Fheis and his approach on other issues, including electoral strategy, had been rejected by the Ard Chomhairle.In his address, the new party president, Gerry Adams, dismissed media claims of a ‘Northern takeover’ and said:“We are not a Northern, nor a Southern party – we are an Irish republican party organised throughout Ireland.”The main theme of his speech was the need for republicans to break out of political isolation and “get among the people in the basic ways which the people accept”. In line with this approach, the Ard Fheis voted to contest European Parliament elections with the intention of taking seatsthey were won. This followed the expansion of party electoral strategy the previous year. The Ard Fheis coincided with a by-election campaign for the Dáil seat of Dublin Central, which was contested by Sinn Féin candidate Christy Burke, turning in a creditable performance. There was further controversy after the Ard Fheis, and discomfort for Fianna Fáil leaders in particular, when Gerry Adams was confirmed as the main speaker at the annual Kilmichael commemoration in west Cork. Gerry Adams was elected president of Sinn Féin at the Ard Fheis of November ,  years ago.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/200/2018/AP-New-top-side-logo.jpg","title":"27495  ","story":" Robbie SmythOver the last  years Irishsociety has evolved and transformed in many ways.

Boyle, Chief Executive of Ballymena Business Centre. The project is part funded by Invest Northern Ireland and the European Regional Development Fund under the Investment for Growth  Jobs Northern IrelandProgramme.I used to be a childminder and had two young children and didnrsquot think it was possible for me to get into the beauty business - but then I went back to college and studied beauty at the Roberta Mechan College, she said.I have a real interest in health and well-being and wanted to offer these services to others. I opened in April this year and I currently offer specialist skincare, nails, massage and waxing.Helen turned her dream into a reality after taking part in the Go For It Programme which is delivered free of charge by a team of experienced business mentors through Northern Irelandrsquos wide network of enterprise agencies.It provides expert advice and help with developing a robust business plan to help turn ideas into a commercial enterprise.Commenting on the success of the programme, Helen said: Often it is hard to know where to start that was my experience before starting the Go For It Programme. The support and guidance offered through it helped me fine tune my business idea from concept to working reality.They helped me with practical things in the early stages like setting out a business plan and doing a detailed analysis. It was great for helping me to budget and forward plan.ldquoI would urge anyone who has ever had the idea of starting up their own business, or evenyou have just started operating your own business to apply for a place on the Go For It Programme. The skills and knowledge imparted is beyond the realms of what you could achieve on your own.Melanie Christie Boyle, Chief Executive of Ballymena Business Centre, on behalf of Mid and East Antrim and Borough Council, added: ldquoHelen joined the Go For It Programme driven by a desire to launch her very own beauty business, driven by a passion to help women improve their skin and help them feel good about themselves.Helen undertook an intensive beauty course under tutelage of an industry expert with a clear vision and motivation to open her own salon as soon as she completed her examinations.We worked with Helen to develop a business plan, focusing on key areas such as defining her service provision, marketing and financial forecasting, as well as helping her secure commercial premises at Ballee and Harryville Community Enterprise Centre.It is great to see how Helen has progressed her business in such as short space of time, building a loyal customer base and a excellent reputation for her quality customer service and using only the very best range of products.If you have a business idea yoursquod like to develop oryou are thinking about starting a business call    or visit: visit www.goforitni.

The investment by The Lotus Group, one of Northern Ireland’s best established property solutions companies includes the relocation of the company’s headquarters to the listed building which formerly housed the Down Shoes factory. The iconic art deco building has been carefully refurbished to create a central and fully al new base for The Lotus Group’s management team and support staff, and offers additional space for further commercial and residential development. The flagship site on Banbridge’s Newry Road is also home to the heritage inspired Lotus Village - a private housing development by the company. Work has now commenced on the second phase of the project which includes a range of high end semi-detached homes, townhouses and apartments.The regeneration programme and HQ move signals a new developmental phase in the strategic direction of The Lotus Group, resulting in a re-focus on key business sectors and the provision of added value services.This includes the private nursing home sector, where, based on years of expertise, The Lotus Group has moved away from the standard ‘landlord-tenant’ model to the provision of a quality-driven ‘managed asset’. This is reflected in its selection of Countrywide Care Homes as a strategic partner for its nine nursing homes operating throughout the UK. By successfully managing the transition of the nursing homes from the failed Southern Cross Group to Countrywide, The Lotus Group has secured a total of  beds, underpinned  jobs, and delivered a signicantly enhanced quality of service to residents. This includes three nursing homes in Northern Ireland.According to Chief Executive Brian Henning, adopting a longer term view to service delivery sets The Lotus Group apart from others in the sector: “The past few years have proven that those who understand the property market in its entirety and are prepared to take a long-term, strategic view, are best positioned to manage the market in the future. Despite the recent economic upheaval we believe there remain many opportunities which demand creative and strategic property solutions.This is essential to support the recovery and growth of the NI economy as it moves out of recession.“Throughout the last  years we’ve continued to invest in the best people, consolidated our strengths in key market sectors, created partnerships which add value, and utilised our expertise to deliver a strengthened and stable property portfolio which meets the needs of the changing economy.Looking to the future, Mr Henning added: “We’ve honed our business offering and have a highly experienced, professional team in place. Through prudent management we’re ideally positioned to deliver robust, professional and service-led solutions of which our new partnership with Countrywide Care Homes is an excellent example.” Adding his support, David Simpson, MP for Upper Bann said: “This investment by the Lotus Group is a good news story for the local property sector and represents a positive economic development for the area as a whole. It proves that even through an economic downturn, strategic planning, entrepreneurial spirit and strong leadership can deliver long term results.”  with Melanie Christie Boyle, Chief Executive of Ballymena Business Centre, who provided Helen with expert advice and help with developing a business plan in order to help turn her business idea into a reality\"   with Melanie Christie Boyle, Chief Executive of Ballymena Business Centre, who provided Helen with expert advice and help with developing a business plan in order to help turn her business idea into a reality\"  Local mum hails Go For It programme after she achieves le goal of opening her own business Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\""},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8537099.1529312918!/image/image.jpg","title":"new park ride facility at fane valley welcomed","story":"Local Alderman Junior McCrum has welcomed the new park and ride facility being built adjacent to Fane Valley in Banbridge.

The site is a joint effort between Translink and Roads Service. Ald.

With a limited number of tickets still available, ‘Em Two Balloons duo Gerard Jordan and Ciarán Nolan told Daily Belfast how audiences can expect all their favourite characters from previous stage outings with a wedding bringing together the West and North of the city for its fairytale finale.“This is the fourth year we have brought ‘Em Two Balloons and their Christmas show to the Roddy’s,” explained Ciarán, “we had great success last year with the Terrible Tragedy of the Twinbrook Turkey and we are back again to tell all about the Fairytale of New Lodge. We had Deck the Falls back in , Turkey last year and now this feels like the completion of part of a trilogy.”“The demand for the shows is growing each year,” said Gerard, “audiences have really taken the characters Ciarán and I play and given us such great support. At the start of November we learned that there are only  per cent of the tickets left at the Mac and people are coming in every day to get their tickets early for the Roddy’s. If there were more days in December we would put on more shows as the demand is there.”“Audiences can expect pretty much what they have experienced before, especially in terms of laughter,” said Ciarán. “There are wedding bells in the air in the production, North Belfast is meeting West Belfast and the introduction of the Glider is bringing our characters East. I mean, what’s the most exotic thing for a Westie  It’s’ getting on the Glider and heading East, seeing Stormont in real le,” he laughed. “The characters Gerard and I have created Jean and Joan, Tablets and Muttley and our two doormen Feargal and Maxi are all there as well. Countess and Winalot, the two dogs, are woofing all the way towards Christmas too. Our bride is played by me and called Mini Driver who is from the Oldpark, Feargal is our groom and the all important wedding prep forms part of the story too.”Gerard spoke of how the hard work has been going on behind the scenes since .“It’s been great how much the audiences have backed us. The real compliment is that the audiences keep growing and this year we’ve added matinees into the Mac, we want to branch out to new audiences each year and will be taking the show to Naomh Éanna on December  as well.”Ciarán said that due to overwhelming demand a handful of dates will be performed after Christmas at Fruithill Bowling Club, Gort Na Mona and St Paul’s GAC on the ,  and  of December. “We will be working on new material for  and ‘Em Two Balloons will be bringing out a new production.

He said officials in Dublin had not been formally notied of a deal being reached in Brussels. \"Were at a stage where there is still no agreement at this point in time,\" the spokesman said. \"There is actually no agreement.\" He added: \"At the moment, this is only speculation.\" In another sign that Dublin may not be happy, a spokesman for Irelands deputy premier, Simon Coveney, said: \"Negotiations between the EU and UK on a withdrawal agreement are ongoing and have not concluded.\" He also said a \"number of issues are outstanding\", adding that negotiations were at an \"extremely sensitive\" juncture. In the Dáil earlier, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said the language around the customs arrangement was not important, so long as Irish objectives were achieved. \"Whether it is a double backstop, a backstop to a backstop or a hybrid backstop is not the point. \"The point is having a legally binding guarantee that a hard border would not emerge between Northern Ireland and Ireland,\" he said. Defending his acceptance of a review mechanism, Mr Varadkar noted that the Good Friday Agreement also has one.

We are clear - we will not be voting for this humiliation!— Sammy Wilson MPNovember , Some Conservative MPs have also criticised the deal, claiming it would keep the UK under EU control.Mr Martin said the matter “deserves better than that”.“I was a bit dismayed to see people coming out very early – Sammy Wilson from the DUP, for example – even before they had read anything to do with the text, proclaiming they were going to oppose it, and people from the hard Brexiteer group as well,” he said.“I think the issue deserves better than that, and I would hope that the other parties in Britain would stand back and look at this in detail and come to a considered position on the agreement which has been reached between the European Union and the United Kingdom.”The Fianna Fail leader said relations between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland are at their lowest in  years and blamed the Conservative Government at Westminster and the Fine Gael administration in Dublin for changing “the overall dynamic”.Fianna Fáil leader Micheal Martin told the Irish Association conference at Queen’s said relations between NI and ROI are at their lowest in  years, adding that Brexit “has no upside for Ireland”. pic ziGXop— Rebecca BlackNovember , “Where the Major, Blair and Brown governments had shown a deep commitment to Northern Ireland’s long-term progress, there was an apparent impatience in the Cameron government that they still had to spend time on the issue,” he said.“In fact David Cameron’s approach was that Northern Ireland had to ‘stand on its own two feet’ rather than expect London to help overcome every problem.“The change of government in Dublin also marked a new approach. Set-piece meetings continued but there was a clear disengagement and an expectation that it was time to just let the DUP and Sinn Fein get on with business.”Speaking to the media at an Irish Association conference at Queen’s University Belfast, Mr Martin said:“I welcome the fact that the European Union and the United Kingdom, it seems, have agreed on a text for the withdrawal part of the agreement.“The devil is in the detail and that is something we have got to keep an eye on, not just today but in the coming years. Brexit is going to be a long journey, this is just the withdrawal agreement.“What’s key for me is Brexit is not good for Ireland, it’s not good for Britain, so we have got to aim for the softest Brexit possible.“A no-deal scenario would be Armageddon, it would be ruinous for Britain.”Speaking at the same event Ulster Unionist Steve Aiken also commented on deteriorating relations both north south and east west.He said: “The DUP told us they were holding the Conservative Party to account. Look what they have done, they have undermined the union, they have helped destroy devolution in Northern Ireland, the DUP has been an absolute disaster.“It has been a disaster for Northern Ireland, it has been a disaster for unionism, and I think members of the DUP need to very clearly reflect on where they have got themselves in this position.”"},{"url":null,"title":"may says draft deal takes uk significantly closer to brexit","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHomes  InteriorsSeptember CarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

This requires the customs union as the basis of the future relationship.“They must align their rules but the EU will retain all the controls. They apply the same rules. UK wants a lot more from future relationship, so EU retains its leverage.”However, questions were raised over the leaked note after Ms Weyand “liked” a series of tweets suggesting that it was “not an accurate reflection of the EU’s position”. The draft agreement of more than  pages is understood to involve the UK remaining in a customs union and committing to a “level playing field” on EU rules in areas like environmental and workplace protections during a backstop period after Brexit.Cabinet ministers are also looking at a brief political declaration – possibly as short as five pages – setting out an outline framework agreed by EU and UK negotiators for future relations on issues like trade and security.

Those responsible have branded by the local politician as ldquogrossly irresponsible.Cllr Curran described those who engage in such behaviour as ldquoselfless, reminding them that they are guilty of an environmental crime by dumping their waste in unauthorised areas.There are a number of illegal dumping hot spots across the district with the Downpatrick councillor suggesting the mentality of those responsible is particularly dficult to fathom.ldquoI cannot understand why people do not make use of household waste centres in Downpatrick, Castlewellan and Ballynahinch, declared Cllr Curran.ldquoThe mentality of those who dump waste along rural roads is beyond me. What puzzles me most is that people who engage in this activity end up paying for its removal through their rates bills. They are literally costing themselves money, but that does not appear to register with them.Cllr Curran said there was no excuse for illegal dumping as there were so many ways for people to dispose of their waste legally and safely.ldquoFly tipping and illegal dumping results in a blot on the landscape and is an image no one wants to see. I firmly believe that those responsible for despicable behaviour should feel the full force of the law, otherwise this activity will continue, he warned.ldquoIllegal waste can range from bin bags dumped at the side of the road to old household furniture, rubble or old trees. For a modest fee, bulk waste can be collected outside peoplersquos homes.ldquoFor the le of me I do not understand why people are prepared to load up their vehicles and drive to secluded, rural areas to get rid of household waste. Why not just drive to one of the three household centres in our district Cllr Curran said local council officials were placing increasing emphasis on promoting the district as a major tourist destination and the last thing they wanted to see was roads littered with waste.He added: ldquoThe message must go out that illegal dumping is unacceptable and that the countryside and indeed town centres must be respected, not used as open air dumps by people who should know better.ldquoWe are fortunate to live in a stunningly beautul area which should not be blighted by the reprehensible actions of a mindless few. Our rural areas in particular must be respected, not used as open air dumping grounds..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Ballycran have it all to do in final  ","story":"BALLYCRANrsquoS hurlers are hoping that history repeats itself at the Athletic Grounds in Armagh on Sunday when they take on Cushendall in the Ulster Club Hurling Championship final.Itrsquos  years since the McKenna Park side last lted the Four Seasons Cup. That was in Cushendall are the aristocrats of the competition and while Ballycran have lost all three final appearances since their historic win in , the Ruairi Ogs have been crowned undisputed Ulster champions on no less than five occasions.Ballycran booked their place in this yearrsquos showdown after a sizzling display of open hurling, blasted holders and hot favourites Slaughtneil out of the competition.Gary Savagersquos boys were rated as   outsiders against the defending champions, but they left Slaughtneil in tatters with an impressive display.Savage was part of the team that lted the trophy in  and in addition to now managing the side, his two sons, Liam and Phelim, help control matters on the field of play.Both boys are certainly chips off the old block and Phelim, despite still being a minor player this season, is showing his true pedigree by dominating games from the centre half back berth and midfield.He is surrounded by a host of top class hurlers with Michael Hughes Stephen Keith, Scott and Brett Nicholson, Conor Woods, James Coyle and Colm McManus to feed off.Ballycran lost both their Antrim League games against Cushendall by signicant margins, but championship finals are a dferent animal and Gary Savage will have his side in a voracious frame of mind for Sunday. Cushendall are expected to lt the Ulster crown for a record-breaking th time.

I initially lobbied for more investment in the park and am glad local council officials took this on board and are developing a masterplan with public input at its heart.Cllr Andrews said he was pleased to take part in last weekrsquos consultation and was impressed at how many people took the time to attend, confirming he will be supporting the motion and views outdoor leisure as an economic driver for the whole region.ldquoThe people who attended last weekrsquos event agree that the country park is a major tourism asset and offers signicant development potential which must be appropriate and not spoil what is already in place, he continued.ldquoDelamont can act as a major economic driver and benefit not just the immediate killyleagh area, but the wider district..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Rogue trader tried to swindle £7k from Newcastle pensioner  ","story":"A FRAUDSTER tried to scam an  year-old Newcastle woman out of nearly pound, for tarmacing her driveway which he had deliberately damaged, Downpatrick Court has heard.Dean James Winderstood shamefaced in the court on Thursday on five charges relating to work he carried out in February.Winder, who traded as Unique Style Driveways, admitted one charge of fraud by misrepresentation and three further charges of aggressive, misleading, and unfair commercial practice.He was also admitted using an inaccurate service flyer which failed to say that his business was registered in England.All offences took place between February -.The court heard that the scam may never have been uncovered had it not have been for the actions of a taxi driver.Police praised the driver who raised the alarm with the Trading Standards Service after he learnt of what was happening as he brought the woman to a bank to withdraw pound,.Trading Standards called the police who arrested Winder and another person at the scene.Winder was given  hours of community service and fined pound by District Judge Amanda Brady for his actions, which were later condemned by police as ldquodisgusting.He was also instructed to immediately pay back pound, which he had taken from the woman as a deposit.A prosecution lawyer said that Winder approached the woman and her partner unsolicitedly to power wash and seal a paved area at their Mourneview Road home for pound.However, after doing the work, Winder pointed out some problems with the driveway and offered to do further work for pound,, which was increased to pound, to tarmac the full driveway.Some of the problems that Winder had pointed out in the driveway were those he had actually created while doing the first job, the prosecutor added.A defence lawyer acknowledged that Winder, now with an address at Holmes Avenue, Dreghorn in Irvine, Scotland, had seen an opportunity to get further work from the elderly couple and had done a ldquopoor job of tarmacing the driveway.However, he said Winder had made a full admission for his actions, offered his apologies and had turned up in court with the full amount of money to be ed to the elderly householder.The lawyer added that while there was another man involved in the work and transaction, Winder was ing the money on his own.Judge Brady described Winderrsquos actions as ldquomean-spirited. She told him: ldquoYou took advantage of an elderly person, quite deliberately, and deliberately damaged her driveway to get more money.Winderrsquos conviction was later welcomed by the police.Chief Superintendent Simon Walls said: ldquoThis was a callous and calculated act by Winder who deliberately set out to scam this couple out of their hard-earned money.ldquoWhat Winder did was disgusting and I hope the courtrsquos judgement will bring some level of comfort and reassurance to the couple.ldquoI would also like to praise the taxi driver who raised the alarm and thank our colleagues in Trading Standards Service.Chief Superintendent Walls also appealed to friends and family of older or vulnerable people to talk to them about lsquocold callersrsquo and make sure they know what to do when salespeople come to their door.He added: ldquoNot all cold callers are rogue traders, but some are. If you feel that something isnrsquot quite right, it usually isnrsquot.ldquoUnofficial traders can overcharge unsuspecting and often older householders for poor quality work, or work that is never completed at all.ldquoRemember, itrsquos your home and itrsquos OK not to open the dooryou have any concerns.

Keenan quickly tagged on a rsquo with two Morgan frees stretching the lead to four points by the th minute.Ballymartin were far from playing the role of bystanders, but they managed to shoot seven wides against the wind, misses that proved crucial at the finish.With  minutes gone Chris McKay had a stinging shot crash off the crossbar following a stunning passage of play, but Keenan and Morgan ensured St Johnrsquos kept ticking over with points apiece.Ballymartin continued to waste several good scoring opportunities before Michael Higgins picked up his sidersquos first score in added time at the end of the first half as St Johnrsquos went in with a - to - lead.It took the protagonists a while to settle in after the break, but with  minutes gone Cathal Doyle reduced the arrears to four points with a score from play. St Johnrsquos then cruelly lost the services of the influential Eoin Moag to a black card and minutes later he was followed for an early bath by Darren Savage, who received a second yellow and then red.St Johnrsquos backs were now to the wall and Ballymartin made sure they stayed there. However, another Morgan free stretched St Johnrsquos lead to - to - before the real Ballymartin fightback started.Consecutive points from Michael Cunningham, Ryan OrsquoHareand Ross Cunningham left a single point in it and Ballymartin were in the right tack.The Lilywhites pushed and probed for the equalising score, but with the game in added time St Johnrsquos broke free and a surging run from Conor Flanagan ended with him setting up Branf for the match-winning score.Just to rub salt into the wounds, Morgan added a point from play to leave St Johnrsquos with their Division  status intact.St Johnrsquos: D Morgan, C Magorrian, A Morgan, J Addis, D Savage, R Flanagan, M Grant, A McMullan, E Moag, C Brannf , C Morgan , C McKay, M Keenan , J Clarke, C Flanagan.

Projected as three-screens, the film was cleverly edited to juxtapose the ying yellow line constructions, from the scouts lining up their yellow kayaks to the farmers forming their line of yellow bales.With the use of dramatic aerial shots, the formation of the yellow lines could be seen clearly as they cut through the landscape, representing both the Border and itrsquos people. The film received great response from the audience participants as they witnessed the powerful result of their involvement.With lsquoAcross and In-Between,rsquo Suzanne Lacy highlights the wit and cleverness of Border le in the face of political pressures, focusing on the power of play in creatively responding to complex issues.Suzanne commented: ldquoOur project draws those who live along the often-invisible boundaries between countries into a conversationmdashmetaphoric and literal ndash on personal and symbolic meanings of this border and by extension all such borders drawn by political forces.ldquoThe artwork explores inverse paradigms: visible and invisible, official and unofficial, rural and urban, the real border and imagined ones.

If they succeed, this would automatically mean more barriers to trade with the EU, including across the Irish border, she stated.Dr Hayward agreed that the Mrs Fosterrsquos argument against any sort of backstop was ldquoperfectly reasonable as it is not ldquothe intended destination. But she still argues that it is of ldquocritical importance.. It is the issue over which the whole Withdrawal Agreement could collapse, leaving all of us in the mire of a lsquoNo Dealrsquo outcome.ldquoIt is therefore very important that all judgements of the backstop are based on a clear and accurate understanding of what it actually means, unclouded by hyperbole.And it is in relation to the backstop where Dr Hayward, who is a Fellow in the Senator George J. Mitchell Institute for Global Peace, Security and Justice, took most issue with Mrs Foster analysis:ldquoFoster claims that Northern Irelandrsquos access to the UK single market would be restricted. In actual fact this is entirely in the hands of the British government ndash it is a domestic issue unrelated to UK-EU negotiations, the Queens Reader asserted, before adding:ldquoSecondly, Foster says that lsquoEU access, comes with the requirement for Northern Ireland to fully adopt and implement EU regulations with no changesrsquo. But it is not necessary to have full regulatory alignment with the EU in order to have tarf free access to its market. That would be like saying wed have to have all our laws imposed by Beijingwe are to get tarf-free access to China.Dr Hayward does however admit that major ergence would require an operational backstop:ldquoThat said,the UK erges widely from the lsquocommon rulebookrsquo of the EUrsquos single market, it would not be possible for goods produced in Northern Ireland to have free movement around the single market as is currently the case. It would be in just such an instance that the backstop could come into play. This would not mean that all EU laws would apply in Northern Ireland but rather that goods produced here could be considered to be of EU standardcertain procedures are followed.In her opinion piece last week Mrs Foster stated that:ldquoFree Trade Agreements donrsquot just cover regulation but tarfs too. This would require not just being in the single market but in the customs union. In other words, a total sea Border descending between Northern Ireland and its largest market, Great Britain.Dr Hayward does not agree however and says ldquothere is absolutely no prospect of a total sea border under any scenario.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

After half a century of business this is a signicant blow to the area. Of course my thoughts are first and foremost with the staff who have lost their jobs in the run up to Christmas. It is also important to recognise that this will have a signicant knock-on impact on the local economy.”He continued: “North Antrim has had a signicant number of job blows in recent years. It is long past the time when the area should receive the attention it deserves from Invest NI which to date has neglected the constituency.”Bannside alderman Stewart McDonald added: “Today’s news is deeply upsetting and a huge loss not just to the workers directly impacted but to the entire local economy. These were not minimum wage jobs but skilled positions which commanded a good salary. There is now a duty on all elected representatives in North Antrim to follow TUV’s lead and demand that we get the fair deal we deserve from Invest NI when it comes to attracting employment to the area”.His council colleague, Timothy Gaston said: “My thoughts and prayers are with those who have lost their jobs today.

Martinduring a conference on Brexit at Queens University Belfast.The Fianna Fail leader said relations between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland are at their lowest in  years and blamed the Conservative Government at Westminster and the Fine Gael administration in Dublin for changing \"the overall dynamic\".\"Where the Major, Blair and Brown governments had shown a deep commitment to Northern Irelands long-term progress, there was an apparent impatience in the Cameron government that they still had to spend time on the issue,\" he said.\"In fact David Camerons approach was that Northern Ireland had to stand on its own two feet rather than expect London to help overcome every problem.\"The change of government in Dublin also marked a new approach. Set-piece meetings continued but there was a clear disengagement and an expectation that it was time to just let the DUP and Sinn Fein get on with business.\"UUPs Steve Aiken during a conference on Brexit at Queens University BelfastSpeaking to the media at an Irish Association conference at Queens University Belfast, Mr Martin said:\"I welcome the fact that the European Union and the United Kingdom, it seems, have agreed on a text for the withdrawal part of the agreement.\"The devil is in the detail and that is something we have got to keep an eye on, not just today but in the coming years.

Look what they have done, they have undermined the union, they have helped destroy devolution in Northern Ireland, the DUP has been an absolute disaster.\"It has been a disaster for Northern Ireland, it has been a disaster for unionism, and I think members of the DUP need to very clearly reflect on where they have got themselves in this position.\"Main Storytry catch     .               ..

Scotland should be given the #same opportunity# as Northern Ireland to stay in Europe#s single market post-Brexit.First Minister Nicola Sturgeon warned that without such an arrangement being in place, Scotland would be left competing for investment with a country which was “effectively” still part of the trading bloc.Nicola SturgeonHer message, echoed by SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford, came as Theresa May prepared to face her Cabinet in a showdown meeting over the draft Brexit deal.Ms Sturgeon said on Twitter that the “PM’s approach would take Scotland out of the single marketbut leave us competing for investment with Northern Ireland that is effectively still in it”.Her remarks came as Democratic Unionist Party chief whip Sir Jeffrey Donaldson warned the arrangements for Northern Ireland could lead to the break-up of the United Kingdom.He claimed the deal would in the “long term” leave Northern Ireland closely aligned with the EU and could increase support for Scottish independence.“It’s about the constitutional and economic integrity of the UK, that is fundamental for us,” he told BBC Radio, adding that the “DUP does not stand alone on this, we have many friends within the Conservative Party and indeed in some other parties, who believe this deal has the potential to lead to the break-up of the UK”.Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson, who is currently on maternity leave after the birth of her son, and Scottish Secretary David Mundell have both warned they could quit their rolesBrexit threatens to “undermine the integrity” of the UK.Mr Blackford, an SNP MP, said the two Tories had “got questions to ask”, but added: “I’ll leave that to them.”He stressed that Scotland should be treated the same as Northern Ireland.“As far as we understand things this morning it looks asit’s actually going to a be a dferent deal for Northern Ireland,” he told BBC Radio Scotland’s Good Morning Scotland.“If it’s permissible for Northern Ireland to stay in the single market as part of the backstop - and I welcome that for the people of Northern Ireland - then of course Scotland should be given the same opportunity.”He continued: “Nicola Sturgeon, our First Minister, has been very clear ever since the Brexit vote that we need to respect the votes of the people of Scotland and as a very minimum that means staying in the single market and the customs union, these are our red lines.”Busy road closed after discovery of suspicious objectArmed robbers raid city service station Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Mr Blackford insisted it was “absolutely right” that the Brexit deal should enshrine the Good Friday agreement, which ended years of conflict in Northern Ireland, and ensure there is noto a hard border with the Irish Republic.But he went on: “The key point is thatthere is to be a dferentiation for Northern Ireland there is no reason why the circumstances in Scotland can also not be respected.“We need to stay in the single market and the customs union, and the Government in London must listen to us on that.”try

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here.

It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth. Work is currently under way to consider how the Penarth Esplanade area can be further enhanced to deliver attractive uses for the townrsquos residents and visitors.ldquoWe recognise that there will be many people with an interest in the future of the site and we will continue to engage with the town council, as current tenants, and others as work continues in exploring options. ldquoThis will need the council to be creative with our ideas for how the arearsquos assets are managed at a time of diminishing budgets, as we continue our work to further enhance this important location.. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has recently written his le story. Journalist TomosPoveysat down with himONE of the culinary worldrsquos most talented figures has revealed his extraordinary journey, from the hardships of being made redundant to achieving the dream of opening his own restaurant, in a new book.James Sommerin released his -page autobiography - Generations - two months ago.The book takes readers on a turbulent ride, which documents the fall and remarkable rise of this multi-award winning chef.In no time at all, it has proved a major hit for the -year-old, with more than  copies having being sold.This is not surprising for this is no ordinary autobiography, as it also contains many eagerly-anticipated recipes and picturesque images.ldquoThe book is basically a round-up of my le so far, he said.ldquoIt also has a lot of personal information about me that people do not know. It has my childhood and when I was travelling, as well as some recipes in the back.ldquoIt was quite hard to come up with the title.ldquoAfter a lot of thinking, I came up with the name and it sums up what the book is about. It was my grandmother who inspired me to cook.ldquoI dedicated the book to her because she got me involved in cooking. I would cook with her on weekends and holidays.ldquoMy children are also involved with cooking. With these two points in mind Generations came forth.The chef, who was brought up and educated in Caerleon, left the area aged  and moved to Scotland.In the book he talks of Scotland in great depth, as this is where he ldquolearnt the craft.ldquoI did corporate and cooking in Caerleon. I then took my first full-time cooking position at the Cwrt Bleddyn Hotel, near Usk. Shortly afterwards I then moved to Scotland and it was there that I learnt my craft.ldquoThere was so much that I learnt when I was there and it helped me a lot in broadening my skills.He added: ldquoWhen I was there I also met my we. Then I came back to Wales a few years later and the rest is history.Despite the dficulty of doing so, Mr Sommerin also re-lives the ldquolowest point in his le by putting into words how he felt when the unthinkablehappened.ldquoThe book also gives the highs and lows, he said.ldquoDue to my wersquos persuasion, I also include the lowest point in my le. This was when I was made redundant from the Crown at Whitebrook.ldquoI had started there in  and was later made head chef.ldquoWhen I was made redundant it was a massive low for me: I went from an exceptionally good salary and having my first Michelin Star to nothing.ldquoI talk about this in depth in the book. I was devastated when I had to go. I even lost my cars.ldquoI had no income yet had to support my family.ldquoTo bring in money, I had to resort to cooking in peoplersquos homes.ldquoIt was dficult to writeabout this. But later I went on to open a restaurant in Penarth and that for me was one of my highest achievements. In the beginning it was a headache. It is not for the faint-hearted to open a restaurant. There were delays and things not falling into place.ldquoBut now Restaurant James Sommerin is a high point because this place is a family restaurant and we are all involved in it. My daughter is training to become a chef too.ldquoAnother high point for me was getting a Michelin Star. It is a hard thing to put into words how it felt, really.And for all the foodies wondering ldquoare there any recipes included  there is a plethora of mouth-watering dishes to cook at the back of the book.Mr Sommerin said: ldquoThere is about  recipes in the back ndash some are complicated and others easy. There are vegetarian dishes too.ldquoSome of the dishes are for a more challenging cook, rather than an amateur.The Michelin Star chef also expressed gratitude to his we for putting the book together, saying: ldquoThe book would not have happenedit were not for some strong people.ldquoThe strongest person is my we, who wrote it all.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

They will also prepare the puppy for her future as a working guide dog by taking her on trains and buses, and into shops.After a year or so in their care, Gem willto the charity to begin specialised guide dog training.ldquoIt was a challenge at first, especially as we never owned a dog before, but we felt it was a really worthwhile thing to do, said Mrs Arthur.ldquoI was aware of the isolation experienced by many people with a vision impairment and wanted to make a dference by giving something back to the community. Itrsquos been le-enhancing for us, and wersquove made all sorts of friends.ldquoPenarth town is a really good place to train a guide dog puppy, with a small arcade and local shops. People are very amenable and love being part of Gemrsquos education. We have the Esplanade, beaches and country parks, and wersquove even taken her to Ikea.\"People are very interested in the puppy and we rarely go on a walk without someone enquiring about what we are doing. Gem is so sociable and would like to say hello to everyone.The couple remember vividly the arrival of their first guide dog puppy, a yellow Labrador retriever named Gilly.ldquoWe were excited, very well prepared, and fell in love with her straight away, said Mrs Arthur. ldquoIt was the most joyful and wonderful experience, but you have to be prepared to put in the hard work to train the puppy.ldquoHanding her back after a year was hard, but we were kept informed of her progress and wersquore proud that she is now a qualied guide dog.The charity is seeking more puppy raisers in the Vale of Glamorgan area. Volunteers need access to a car and must be free to spend time with the puppy for most of the day. Their yard or garden will also need to be securely fenced so that the puppy remains safely within its confines.Guide Dogs supplies basic equipment, covers all veterinary and feeding expenses, and provides a network of support and advice.To find out more about becoming a puppy raiser for Guide Dogs, ring Steve Kersley on   and leave a message, or email Steve.Kersley@guidedogs.org.uk article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

When I woke up whenever and potted and mooched and just saw what the day would bring.Like most people, the demands of work, family, friends, errands and the general stuff of le, mean that at any given moment we can be doing one thing, planning something  and thinking about many more.I get in to grasshopper phases where it feels like there is so much on my lsquoto dorsquo list that I flit and fly between myriad things and sometimes few of them get completed how Irsquod like or indeed completed at all and for those that that do get sorted and sewn up with aplomb, there is no time to take any satisfaction or pride because it is time to crack on with the next thing folks.I read a while ago about a concept that affects your brain around scarcity.The idea that when we feel that something is scarce, be that time, money or something  that we feel is in short supply, it can make us act with less focus and rationality thanwe had an abundance of such.So, in my case, when I feel time is pressured, I am more likely to try to do more with the result that I feel I have less time and my scarcity suffering brain is more likely to forget, to misplace to mess up.And so, knowing this, I am going to set aside the lsquoto dosrsquo and the lsquoshouldsrsquo and curl up on the settee with my utterly wonderful friend and eat and chill and know that with every mouthful of delicious cake, I am doing myself some good. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a commentOrder byOldest firstNewest firstHighest scoredLowest scoredLoading comments...

It aims to maximise independence, which research has shown is the outcome that matters most to people.The project is informed by a similar initiative developed in Canterbury, New Zealand and has a number of key elements which will improve how health and social services work together.Some these elements include a well-being website which will link services across the community and allow health and social care professionals to share information about patients and multi-disciplinary teams.During a visit to Redlands Surgery in Penarth last week, Mr Gething met members of the Cardf and Vale team and some of the team visiting from New Zealand to see the development of the project.Mr Gething said: ldquoWith an increase in le expectancy and our continued public health challenges, our health and social care services will continue to face increasing pressures. This is why, in our long term plan for health and social care, we have set out the need to truly transform the way we deliver care to ensure it is sustainable in the future.\"This will require better integration of health and social services to reduce reliance on hospitals and deliver care closer to home. The Transformation Fund will be used to fund a small number of projects which have the most impact in developing and delivering new models of care, and which have potential to scale up so they can be used across Wales.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We are clear ndash we will not be voting for this humiliation!mdash Sammy Wilson MPNovember , Some Conservative MPs have also criticised the deal, claiming it would keep the UK under EU control.Mr Martin said the matter ldquodeserves better than that.ldquoI was a bit dismayed to see people coming out very early ndash Sammy Wilson from the DUP, for example ndash even before they had read anything to do with the text, proclaiming they were going to oppose it, and people from the hard Brexiteer group as well, he said.ldquoI think the issue deserves better than that, and I would hope that the other parties in Britain would stand back and look at this in detail and come to a considered position on the agreement which has been reached between the European Union and the United Kingdom.The Fianna Fail leader said relations between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland are at their lowest in  years andblamed the Conservative Government at Westminster and the Fine Gael administration in Dublin for changing ldquothe overall dynamic.Fianna Faacuteil leader Micheal Martin told the Irish Association conference at Queenrsquos said relations between NI and ROI are at their lowest in  years, adding that Brexit ldquohas no upside for Ireland. pic ziGXopmdash Rebecca BlackNovember , ldquoWhere the Major, Blair and Brown governments had shown a deep commitment to Northern Irelandrsquos long-term progress, there was an apparent impatience in the Cameron government that they still had to spend time on the issue, he said.ldquoIn fact David Cameronrsquos approach was that Northern Ireland had to lsquostand on its own two feetrsquo rather than expect London to help overcome every problem.ldquoThe change of government in Dublin also marked a new approach. Set-piece meetings continued but there was a clear disengagement and an expectation that it was time to just let the DUP and Sinn Fein get on with business.Speaking to the media at an Irish Association conference at Queenrsquos University Belfast, Mr Martin said:ldquoI welcome the fact that the European Union and the United Kingdom, it seems, have agreed on a text for the withdrawal part of the agreement.ldquoThe devil is in the detail and that is something we have got to keep an eye on, not just today but in the coming years. Brexit is going to be a long journey, this is just the withdrawal agreement.ldquoWhatrsquos key for me is Brexit is not good for Ireland, itrsquos not good for Britain, so we have got to aim for the softest Brexit possible.ldquoA no-deal scenario would be Armageddon, it would be ruinous for Britain.Speaking at the same event Ulster Unionist Steve Aiken also commented on deteriorating relations both north south and east west.He said: ldquoThe DUP told us they were holding the Conservative Party to account.

Thatrsquos been filled. So, I will just get on and do what Irsquom going to do.Labour is proud to be part of a cross party campaign to reform our gambling laws and we will continue to campaign for further improvements to regulation in the sector. pic hqlkmXpYJmdash Tom WatsonNovember , An impact assessment published in May last year suggested that the new curb should be implemented within nine to  months.But Chancellor Philip Hammond moved it to October in last monthrsquos budget, telling the Treasury Committee last week that following engagement with the gaming industry it would be a ldquosensible date.A campaign co-led by former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith but with cross-party support on Monday tabled amendments to finance legislation to force ministers to make the change in April.The Government was widely expected to lose when the amendments came up for debate next week.Tracey Crouch quit as sports minister over plans to delay a cut in FOBTsrsquo maximum stakes by six months Mr Duncan Smith raised the issue with a question at PMQs, after meeting Mrs May earlier in Downing Street.He told her he had been ldquoenormously proud that the Government had agreed to act on FOBTs which have ldquocaused endless harm , terrible damage to families.Mrs May told him an announcement was coming, adding: ldquoI know he has campaigned on this issue with a passion because, as he said, this question of the maximum stakes for FOBTs is one which does have an impact on vulnerable people as well as their families and loved ones.ldquoI recognise the strength of feeling on this issue. I know gambling addiction can devastate lives.Shadow culture secretary Tom Watson attacked the ldquodisastrous political judgment shown by the Culture Secretary and Chancellor.Many campaigners have welcomed the move He said: ldquoItrsquos very sad that it took an honourable resignation of a good minister and a cross-party revolt to achieve the blindingly obvious and necessary reforms to Fixed Odds Betting Terminals.ldquoWhilst this is a personal humiliation for Jeremy Wright, this is a very good day for the many thousands of people whose families and communities are blighted by gambling addiction.The British Amusement Catering Trade Association , which represents the amusements and gaming machine industry, also welcomed the change.Chief executive John White said: ldquoThere was never any justication for it being delayed beyond this point.ldquoThis is a victory for common sense.

The deal sets out a -year plan to grow the economy, boost jobs and tourism, increasing skills, encouraging investment and developing infrastructure. Six Northern Ireland councils are working in collaboration with the Northern Ireland Civil Service, Northern Ireland Office, Ministry for Housing, Communities and Local Government and the Treasury as well as Queen’s and Ulster Universities, and Further Education Colleges to move forward with the City Deal plans.Mr Buckley said: “Armagh, Banbridge and Craigavon’s absence from what has been described as a once in a generation opportunity is astounding.”He added: “I am stunned ABC appears to have missed an incredible opportunity through Belfast Region City Deal. Just last month the council’s chief executive Roger Wilson was quoted as saying: ‘We are proactively developing a high-quality business infrastructure, boosting skills in the region, supporting economic development and promoting the borough as being very much open for business.’ “City Deal ticks all of those boxes and more, and our borough’s vital strategic location would surely have made it the ideal location to benefit from the City Deal bid. The fact that councils as far away as Newry and Mourne have secured their place at the Belfast region city deal table, gives me even more cause for concern as to why Armagh, Banbridge and Craigavon are missing. “Just last week ABC council announced it had written to the Chancellor alongside Mid-Ulster and Fermanagh and Omagh councils to ask for a Treasury backed scheme, and Northern Ireland’s rd city deal. This leads me to ask why theyare not included in the Belfast city deal, when others were.“You just have to look at our neighbours to see what is being outlined. The Newry Southern Relief Road, for example, will be an invaluable addition to the area. In County Antrim, Carrickfergus is earmarked for around £m of investment in its town centre. My constituency of Upper Bann is crying out for similar investment, and was geographically and economical well placed to be included.”A spokesperson for the Council said ABC Council “set out its plans to explore mechanisms for a Growth Deal in collaboration with Fermanagh  Omagh District Council and Mid Ulster District Council in a letter to Chancellor Philip Hammond. “We believe that working with our two neighbouring councils – which represent one quarter of Northern Ireland’s population – we have a strong chance of securing a Growth Deal which will work to boost economic growth and deliver a step-change to the future prospects of the collective area. It will work alongside the Belfast City Region Deal and the proposed Derry Londonderry City Deal to bolster the NI economy as a whole.”Police investigate war memorial incident Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"try catch     .               ..

Ulster Business chats to Danske Bank’s Vicky Davies and Richard Caldwell about the bank’s new Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub and ‘Making more possible’ for Northern Ireland businesses When you are already leading the technology and digital race in Northern Ireland banking, where do you go from there  For Danske Bank, its sights were set on something hugely ambitious, and something philanthropic which it believes can help cultivate, boost and grow the next generation of technology and fintech business start-ups in Northern Ireland. Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub, run in partnership with Catalyst Inc, is a stunning, modern incubator and hub which will see dozens of entrepreneurs and start-up businesses shape and craft their ideas in the heart of Danske Bank’s own Belfast city centre headquarters. The partnership with Catalyst Inc makes a lot of sense, as it already plays host to dozens of knowledge-based businesses across  acres in the Titanic Quarter, and the Innovation Centre in Londonderry. Vicky Davies is managing director of strategy and corporate development at Danske Bank. “We have a clear ambition to be the best bank in Northern Ireland, and we plan to do that by making more possible for our customers, employees, stakeholders and society”, she says. It’s that message, ‘Making more possible’, that adorns the wall of one of the main meeting rooms in the Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub. “Banking is changing so fast. It’s relentless in terms of new entrants, innovation and the level of new fintech money coming into the industry.” “We know we need to change at pace, or face being left behind.” “We needed a partner in this venture, and we were looking for someone with reach and expertise,” she said. Following an initial meeting last year with senior management at Catalyst Inc, Vicky says there was an immediate mutual connection, and they went from there. “They have the expertise in running a space like this, and we have access to banking and business expertise – with both of us having great experience in helping businesses to grow. So, every dimension we looked at – it was a really good fit.” The hub is an impressive space, awash with splashes of colour, connectivity, co-working spaces and meeting rooms – including a nod to Princess Leia with an image on a wall – and it is able to play host to around - entrepreneurs and business start-up professionals, with top end cable and fibre internet connections. It’s further evidence of Danske Bank ensuring it’s well ahead of the pack and out in front. It’s about bringing a business from an embryonic start-up, to a thriving company, helping lead the way in its sector. But for Danske, this isn’t all about the bottom line. It’s about creating a thriving hub for the future stars of Northern Ireland’s burgeoning tech sector. And it’s a two-way street – with the bank aiming to learn as much from the start-up businesses nestled in the top-end spacious ground-floor hub, as the other way around. So, what does this mean for Danske Bank in terms of business banking and as an institution further bolstering its credentials in the digital space. Richard Caldwell is managing director of personal banking and small business. “We want to be part of the local fintech journey. We want to help influence and develop ideas,” he says. “There are more than , businesses in Northern Ireland, and we want to continue to support start-ups in general – by putting expertise and support into this partnership, we will help this particular set of small businesses to grow in what is a burgeoning sector.” “Ultimately, real success for us would be seeing products brought to market, and helping businesses grow from an embryonic idea, through to start-up, growth and expansion. With the business maybe ending up as one of our loyal corporate customers in the future.” Richard says research showed that many of Danske Bank’s existing bigger business customers wanted the bank to provide “something more tangible” for start-ups, to grow companies for the future. Although tenants in the new fintech space don’t necessarily have to bank with Danske, the Bank does offer banking support, including everything from a current account, to receiving assistance from a growth adviser to support them with their banking needs. gt “This is a major investment for us,” Richard says. “This is one of the most expensive ground-floor retail premises in Belfast, and we have devoted it to this hub. This is front and centre in the heart of Belfast.” The location of the new hub couldn’t be better – with the new Glider bus linking the hub to Catalyst Inc headquarters in Titanic Quarter. And, as modern tech businesses evolve and reach out to new markets and time zones across the globe, there is also  hour access to the Fintech Hub. The hub has a team of four, two from Danske Bank and two newly recruited by Catalyst Inc. Together Danske Bank and Catalyst Inc have also launched a new online  to help the wider growing number of start-up businesses across Northern Ireland to connect with investors, peers and potential new recruits across Europe - thehub.io helps connect start-ups to relevant resources, such as talent, networks, financing, tools and advice from experts which will help them overcome some of the challenges of scaling up. It is clear that strategically this is a big push by both organisations to play a key supporting role through the provision of both physical and online resources. Digitalisation Richard is keen to point out support for the hubs is just part of a bank-wide digital transformation agenda at Danske. “For example, we want to change the nature of traditional relationship management at the Bank. In addition to managing traditional banking needs as we have always done so well, we are now moving into the added value space. As well as the human touch, customers increasingly want top notch digital solutions to make their lives easier, to give them ease of access and quicker credit decisions.” The digitally-savvy way of thinking is giving Danske Bank competitive advantage, and that is from an already well-established position in the market. Last year they appointed a chief digital officer, who is a member of the Bank’s executive committee. “Our people are still our best asset and will remain so,” Richard said. “We have great people. And customers still highly value that human touch and expert advice. But what the journey looks like for transactions, well we have digital solutions for everything. For your payments, wages, drawing direct debits or paying suppliers. “Right now we are piloting and rolling out digital credit decisions for business customers. This is transforming the credit journey for both our customers and our business relationship managers. For example, one customer recently applied for an overdraft through the digital credit solution and got approval and the funds in their account in  minutes.” Danske Bank was the first of the local Northern Ireland banks to bring in app banking, and solutions such as Samsung Pay, Fitbit Pay and Garmin Pay. And this new Fintech Hub is very much another stride forward. The bank is also leading the pack when it comes to customer satisfaction, right across businesses of all shapes and sizes. “For some time now we have been the market leader in business banking. Research continues to show that our customer satisfaction scores are first for large business, and first for small business,” Richard said. Both Vicky and Richard are keen to see what they predict will be short and long-term benefits from the Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub. There’s an organic osmosis, allowing ideas to flow freely between the Danske Bank people visiting from upstairs and those entrepreneurs which it hosts on the ground floor. “The entrepreneurs in the hub bring a fresh mindset, one we can learn from as we continue our own digital journey throughout the bank,” Vicky says. Richard added: “The fintech sector is seen in many quarters as a challenger to traditional banks, but we are embracing it and feel we can grow with it, to the benefit of our customers.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/Oly-1.jpg","title":"titanic quarter office scheme out for tender","story":"Posted on Tuesday  November  by Ulster Business A huge office scheme for the Titanic Quarter has taken a step forward as the development is put out for tender.
