The group said this would increase consumer bills, slow down reductions in emissions and threaten energy security.The organisation told MailOnline that it would take 1.3billion cubic metres of gas to replace Hunterston B\u0027s production last year, and most of that would have to be imported especially on days when the wind is down. It comes as energy bills are set to go up significantly in April. Households will not know exactly how much their bills will rise until next month, but a hike of up to 50 per cent is predicted - meaning an average household on a supplier\u0027s default tariff will pay nearly £2,000 per year for gas and electricity, compared to less than £1,300 today.Britain\u0027s nuclear power plants can supply around 20 per cent of the country\u0027s electricity demand, but around half are set to close in the next four years as they reach the end of their currently scheduled life. The Scottish Government opposes building new nuclear projects and there is therefore no replacement for Hunterston B.Paris-based EDF, which stands for Électricité de France, first announced the closure of Hunterston in August 2020. Around 500 people worked at the plant and some 370 will stay on to help with the decommissioning process.The plant was originally scheduled to generate electricity for 25 years, but Mr Forrest said investment in the site meant its life could be extended until today. Environmental campaigners, however, said the final shutdown of Hunterston B - which started producing electricity 45 years and 11 months ago - was \u0027inevitable\u0027.          ‹ Slide me ›    Hunterston B (left, today and right, in 1995) near West Kilbride in Ayrshire has been a major British nuclear power plant Share this articleHunterston B nuclear power station retires after 46 years in service | Energy industry | The Guardian"},{"url":null,"title":"People set mock petition save Marble Arch Mound ahead closure Sunday","story":"Share this articleMarble Arch Mound has flood of visitors who want to see the \u0027meme\u0027 before it\u0027s torn down - MyLondon"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8a65ae03773db7b35d1da7ca4ce78792093466d6/0_200_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=8a04a70d151c3e601b37bc8059e5642d","title":"swindon town v manchester city fa cup third round live score updates","story":"Swindon head coach Ben Garner names Lewis Ward in goal and welcomes back captain Dion Conroy in the heart of defence following a spell on the Naughty Step. An injury doubt before the game, Wales international Jonny Williams drops to the bench with Ben Gladwin coming into midfield. Steve Mildenhall, the club’s 43-year-old goalkeeping coach, is also on the substitutes bench. “We had an outbreak,” said Rodolfo Borrell in his pre-match press conference. “At the moment, we have seven players unavailable, up to 14 staff members. That’s a big outbreak. We are getting it day by day, I don’t know where it will end.  “All of us, all the clubs are suffering. Some right now, some later. We cope as best we can. We are going back to the protocols from the beginning of the pandemic, minimise the risk at the training facility.  “There is anxiety because we have to test, people are suspecting who will be today, one, two, three less? It’s normal like any job or any club. We are coping, trying to establish the protocols and taking it day by day.” Swindon goalkeeper Joe Wollacott is in Cameroon on Afcon duty with Ghana and will be absent tonight, which means Lewis Ward will probably get the nod from manager from Ben Garner. Midfielder Jack Payne and central Mathieu Baudry miss out through injury, while tenacious Welsh midfielder Jonny Williams is also a doubt. Jake O’Brien, a 20-year-old Irish central defender newly arrived on loan from Crystal Palace, could get a baptism of fire for Swindon tonight. Where to start with Manchester City? Their seven unnamed Covid victims apart, there was every chance they would have fielded a massively – by their standards at least – understrength team anyway so it’s difficult to say who will line up for them tonight. This much we do know: Riyad Mahrez is away in Cameroon with Algeria, John Stones is unlikely to be risked as he’s recovering from a knock and both Phil Foden and Oleksandr Zinchencko are almost certain to miss out as they recover from Covid. Zack Steffen, Fernandinho and Jack Grealish seem likely to start but let’s face it, we’re only guessing here. No fewer than 72 places separate the League Two side from the runaway top flight leaders but a bout of Covid-19 in the Manchester City camp has provided Swindon with a glimmer of hope ahead of kick-off. Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola and his assistant Juan Manuel Lillo will both sit out tonight’s game in isolation after testing positive for the virus, along wih up to 20 other staff in the first team bubble, including at least seven first team players. For all that Covid-related chaos, City have not asked for the game to be postponed as they have more than enough registered players to meet the FA’s standards for fielding a team in this competition and Rodolfo Borrell will deputise for Pep in their technical area. Kick-off at the County Ground is at 8pm but stay tuned in the meantime for what promises to be some intriguing team news and build-up.

Photograph: iStockThe  2021 Feeder School list, published today, provides new insights into the education pathways taken by thousands of students who have completed the Leaving Cert cycle. The following are five of the key take-aways from this year’s data:1. Class a determinant At a macro level more students from Deis schools (3,524) secured places on high points courses in 2021 than from fee-paying schools (3,392).The undoubted success of investment in Deis schools these figures reveal is tempered by the fact that the numbers are a proportion of Deis 10,540 school leavers, whereas the fee-paying numbers are drawn from a much smaller cohort of just 3,912 school leavers.At a micro level it would appear that fee-paying schools still dominate our most sought-after courses. Ten of the top 15 boys’ schools in terms of progression to third level are fee-paying colleges. The five non-fee-paying schools in this category, Ard Scoil Rís, Limerick Oatlands College, Mount Merrion St Benildus Stillorgan, Capuchin Rochestown Cork and Christian Brothers, Mitchelstown, mostly draw their pupils from families with similar social class backgrounds to their neighbouring fee-paying schools.Interestingly, only seven of the top 15 girls-only second-level schools are fee-paying, with three of the four most successful colleges being non-fee paying. 1st Salerno in Galway, 2nd Loreto Dalkey (fee-paying), 3rd Coláiste Muire Ennis, 4th Coláiste Íde, An Daingean.Again social-class background rather than attending a fee-paying college seems to be the determinant factor governing levels of progression.2. Most students are choosing to apply to their local or regional colleges  Irish young people, unlike their compatriots in the UK, tend to apply for third level places at their local colleges. Research carried out with those who have progressed to third level indicate that most Irish school leavers apply to attend colleges where they can continue to socialise with their peer group.There is also a growing economic factor causing students to select their local institutions, driven in large part by the soaring cost of accommodations in our towns and cities: living away from home adds hugely to the cost of attending college.There are significantly lower third level progression rates among students in counties or geographic locations, which do not have access to third level institutions and who are therefore unable to attend a chosen course without living away from home. Contrast Kilkenny 68 per cent, Longford (68) and Laois (70) with Galway (81), Donegal (84), and Clare 86 percentage progression rates to third level.3. Progression by post code Apart from the school a child attends, where families live also seems to determine overall third level progression rates. The most affluent parts of the capital city, such as Dublin 6 and Dublin 14, saw 104 and 96 per cent respectively of the total numbers of 2021 6th years who sat the Leaving Cert in schools within these postal districts progress to third level this year.In other postal districts of the city Dublin 11 and 7, the proportion of Leaving Cert students progressing to college in 2021 were 54 and 64 per cent respectively. The ide is also stark when the figures are broken down into those who secured places on higher points courses. Some 96 per cent of school leavers in Dublin 6 went on to one of these programmes, compared with 46 per cent in Dublin 11.4.We still want to pursue the CAO route The current year’s numbers reveal Ireland’s exceptionally high third level participation rate, which is among the highest in the world.Ireland also continues to have one of the highest retent- ion rates in second level across Europe: that is the proportion of students who stay in school until the Leaving Cert.5. The growth of full-time senior cycle grinds schools While pupil numbers sitting the Leaving Cert continue to increase annually due to demographic factors, our figures show that numbers sitting the Leaving Cert in 143 second-level schools (composed of nine fee-paying, 44 Deis and 90 non-fee paying institutions) dropped by more than 15 per cent this year, compared to their 2020 numbers.So what may be driving these numbers? Firstly, the country was still in recession when this year’s cohort of Leaving Cert students started second level in 2015. Specifically, in relation to the lower numbers sitting the Leaving Cert in fee-paying schools in 2021, the downturn hit family incomes in 2015, adversely affecting enrolment numbers in these schools at that time.Secondly, and probably more importantly, the presence of full-time grind schools in our major cities offering a two-year Leaving Cert programme seems to be drawing some families who can afford the fees for the final twothree years of second level education.Some parents believe that the grind schools offer a more flexible range of subject choices than those available in their child’s second-level schools. Furthermore, many students want to escape what they perceive to be restrictive rules and regulations central to our second-level school cultures."},{"url":null,"title":"students in fee charging schools more likely to progress to courses with high points","story":"New data shows that almost all Leaving Cert students in fee-charging schools progressed to third-level institutions (99.7 per cent). Photograph: iStockStudents from fee-charging schools are significantly more likely to progress to high points college courses, according to data compiled by The .However, schools in disadvantaged areas – or Deis schools – have also performed strongly by sending high numbers of students to third level.The figures are contained in the annual  Feeder Schools supplement on Friday, which provides a school-by-school breakdown on the number of students who progressed to higher-level education in 2021.Last year’s Leaving Cert students were the first cohort to benefit from a choice of predicted grades and written exams.New data shows that almost all Leaving Cert students in fee-charging schools progressed to third-level institutions (99.7 per cent), up slightly (+1 per cent) from the previous year.Non-fee-charging schools also sent a large majority of students to college (80 per cent), down slightly (-3 per cent) on last year.In Deis schools more than half of Leaving Cert students went on to study in higher education (62 per cent). This was also down slightly (-2 per cent) on the previous year, but up significantly on 2019 (+5 per cent).Overall, these figures suggest that last year’s move to provide a choice between written exams and predicted grades proportionately benefited more students in fee-charging schools compared with 2020’s calculated grades model.Education authorities have not released national data on progression from schools to further education courses.When third-level progression rates are broken down to high points courses only, students in fee-charging schools fared particularly well with 87 per cent securing places in such programmes, up slightly on last year (+1 per cent).Among non-fee-charging schools the equivalent figure was 52 per cent (-1 per cent year-on-year) and 33 per cent among Deis schools (no change).The Feeder Schools data also provides a breakdown of college progression rates by postal district in the capital.These figures show evidence of a “class gap” in the proportion of students going on to college in different parts of the city.For example, third-level progression rates are highest in more affluent areas such as Dublin 6 (104 per cent), Dublin 14 (96 per cent), Dublin 2, 3, 4 (all 90 per cent).They were significantly lower in less affluent areas such as Dublin 11 (54 per cent), Dublin 10 (55 per cent) and Dublin 1 and 22 (both 57 per cent).When progression rates are broken down by county, Dublin ranks highest (90 per cent), followed by Clare (86 per cent) and Donegal (84 per cent).The lowest ranked counties were Kilkenny, Longford, (both 68 per cent), Meath (71 per cent) and Cavan (72 per cent).When Feeder School data is broken down by inidual school, it shows fee-charging schools account for almost half of the 20 schools with the highest progression rates to high points courses.Overall, the schools which sent the most students to third-level were: Christian Brothers College, Dún Laoghaire, Co Dublin Salerno Secondary School, Salthill, Galway Loreto Abbey, Dalkey, Co Dublin Coláiste Muire, Ennis, Co Clare Coláiste Íde, Dingle, Co Kerry Gaelcholáiste Chiarraí, Tralee, Co Kerry St Mary’s Secondary School, Macroom, Co Cork The Teresian School, Dublin 4 St Gerard’s School, Bray, Co Wicklow and Loreto College, St Stephen’s Green, Dublin 2.All these schools recorded progression rates in excess of 100 per cent, given that the numbers included students from previous years who deferred their applications.In any given year, about 20 per cent of students defer their applications to higher education."},{"url":null,"title":"third level colleges set to reopen from monday","story":"Trinity College Dublin has confirmed that it plans to press ahead with in-person and online exams for first-year students from next Monday.

Our priority will be teaching and learning.”He said there will be a staggered reopening of third level with five higher-education colleges reopening on Monday and a further five reopening the following week.Others will follow throughout the course of the month. Apprentices are already on site in the technological sector continuing their training.“Since third level reopened in September, public health teams have been working with third-level providers to ensure staff and students can safely access education,” Mr Harris said.“Last month we provided a fund of €9 million to purchase antigen tests for staff and students to provide an extra layer of protection. This will continue to be rolled out over the coming weeks and months.”He confirmed that his Department is also working with the Health Service Executive to roll out “vaccination week” again this semester to ensure students can access their boosters.Colleges will operate in line with a detailed framework for a safe return to campus, which enabled the return to on-site classes in higher and further education and training since last October.ExamsTrinity College Dublin, meanwhile, has confirmed that it plans to press ahead with in-person and online exams for first-year students from next Monday.The university’s students’ union has called for all exams to be moved online in light of the current public health situation.However, a spokeswoman for Trinity confirmed that in-person exams will take place in various venues on campus, all operating at significantly reduced capacity.“Trinity plans to proceed as planned with those examinations and has introduced additional mitigations to ensure social distancing,” she said.“There has been no update regarding any change in guidelines for third-level institutions, and consequently we have decided to proceed as planned. Our plans are broadly in line with those of other colleges and universities.”Separately, Trinity will operate a walk-in vaccination centre in the college’s dining hall from Monday to Thursday for all staff and students. Boosters will be available as will first and second vaccinations.The university said it is encouraging everyone in its community to be vaccinated.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"what s stopping better information on schools","story":"Data on the school of origin of students going to further education and training is not systematically gathered and released. Photograph: iStockAre third level progression charts a flawed and limited metric? Or do they provide valuable information to parents and s? The answer to both questions is yes.The information published in today’s  isn’t popular with teacher unions or some politicians, who say they promote elitism and strengthen the position of already privileged schools.Prof Kevin Denny, head of the school of economics, at UCD, takes issue with this. “The basic argument is the following: school is multi-dimensional, it’s not all about points. Such tables don’t reflect that. Ergo, nothing is better than something. But since deciding what school to send their children to is one of the biggest decisions many parents make, it is fundamental that they are in a position to make an informed decision.”College progression data is but one metric, and today we also publish advice on the equally important factors that parents or s might consider when choosing a second-level school.At the Oireachtas Committee on Education in September 2021, John Irwin, general secretary of the Association of Community and Comprehensive Schools, criticised the media for not including apprenticeships in the “so-called league tables”.But apprenticeships and further education are not excluded from the annual feeder school tables because The  or other newspapers choose to ignore the data.Instead, it’s because data on the school of origin of students going to further education and training is not systematically gathered and released.Despite the criticisms levelled at the media over progression tables, the road to better data has consistently been blocked by the Department of Education and successive ministers for education, who know exactly how schools are performing.Today, however, we have published data provided by Dunboyne College of Further Education showing the secondary school of origin of its students. It helps to paint a much better picture of the outcomes for students at those schools, although it remains a partial outcome – many of their students may have gone on to other colleges of further education but the data is not always recorded or released.Contextualise Today’s data will show that, unsurprisingly, fee-paying schools in wealthier areas send more students to third level. Vital details that could help people contextualise and understand this information, however, are blocked by the Government.“Are fee-paying schools all that good and are the State schools all that bad?” Denny asks. “Probably not, but parents cannot know for certain because the information that might help them decide is censored. Ireland, incidentally, is out of line with other English- speaking countries in publishing no information on school performance. Making an informed decision is precisely what the educational system seems determined to prevent. Those who argue against providing exam and other data on schools are implicitly saying that they know the limitations of this information but that the public does not.”So what might better data look like? Dr Aedín Doris, Prof Donal O’Neill and Dr Olive Sweetman are lecturers and researchers at the department of economics in Maynooth University. They researched school outcomes and the factors that influence how well schools do.“It does make sense for the media to provide information on school performance, but that information should be meaningful,” they say.“If you take The  Feeder School tables as the measure of a school’s success, it will appear on the surface that fee-paying schools are good schools. What we do in our paper on value-added approaches to assessing schools, however, is control for factors that might have affected the post-primary school’s cohort of students, including how they got on in primary schools, parental levels of education and their socioeconomic background.“It must sometimes be disheartening to teach in a Deis school given that the current rankings as published in The  don’t give them proper recognition for their work, and this could impact on morale, as well as encouraging teachers to focus on the students who need to make a little more progress in order to make it to third level.“A value-added approach may not be able to indicate a school’s precise numerical ranking, but they could, for example, say what schools are in the top 10 or 20 per cent.“We think this would provide meaningful information for parents and policy-makers, but the Department of Education is reluctant to undertake value-added evaluations and allow meaningful comparisons to be made,” the researchers say.“They do provide whole school evaluations, but they are very qualitative they don’t seem fit for purpose but could indicate if there are serious problems in the school.“In our work, we also looked at variables that correlated with high or low value added including streaming, student supports, school type, and characteristics of the principal.“One of the few variables that we found to be associated with value added was having a female principal. This is replicated in other international studies, too. We found no relationship between school type and value added.“People know of the good schools in their area, primarily through word of mouth, and a successful school is doing something unique, and not always measurable.”"},{"url":null,"title":"which secondary school should you send your child to","story":"The problem of school choice is, of course, a particularly urban one: for parents in rural areas or smaller towns, your child goes to the local school.In The Paradox of Choice, psychologist Barry Schwartz argues that having too many choices and decisions can feel overwhelming, particularly when the stakes - your child’s future prospects, as you see it - are so high. There is a tendency to worry over the small details and wonder if, in this case, there’s a better or more suitable school around the corner.The problem of school choice is, of course, a particularly urban one: for parents in rural areas or smaller towns, your child goes to the local school.There’s a good reason that The  Feeder School lists has proven so popular with parents over the years: they’re desperate for whatever information they can get about schools. But how many students from each school goes on to third-level is just one component of what a parent might consider when choosing the school that is best for their child.Dr Rose Ryan is director of access at Maynooth University, where a high proportion of students are the first in their family to go to third-level.“When they’re making a decision about a school, parents look at school league tables and think that, because a certain number progress on to higher education, it makes for a good school,” she says. “Maybe it does, and maybe it doesn’t, but as a parent and professional, there is a lot more that goes into a school.”Surprisingly, perhaps, the single largest component in how well your child might fare - academically, at least - in any given school has little to do with the school itself. Instead, parental income and parental level of education may have the strongest impact on a child: if a parent has the emotional and financial capital to give consideration to what school is right for their child, they’re already engaged with and invested in their education. In addition, a school with a 100 per cent progression rate may have some terrible teachers but, if it’s fee-paying or in a wealthier area, parents are more likely to be able to pay for grind teachers outside schools.Culture of careEven in an excellent school, only a small percentage of students will excel academically, says Ryan.“There are hundreds of thousands in the school system,” says Ryan. “Parents want their children to be in a school that cares for them and cares about them. If a school has this culture of care, they support the students academically but they also see the wholeness of the inidual, and so academic performance, sensitivity, thoughtfulness, imagination, spirts and drama are all important. Parents pick up on subtle cues about where to send their children, but I had one metric, it would be to see how the school supports the weakest students, not the strongest, The best indicator of the school’s culture is how they helps students with personal, financial, social, family, cultural or learning challenges.”In Irish education, at least, power rests with the school principal. The school’s board often - or usually - falls in line behind the principal. If, in your search for the right school, you find the principal and teachers cagey and defensive from the outset, this can be a bad sign.“A supportive principal provides leadership to teachers,” says Ryan. “They set the tone and culture and what is expected of students.”Indeed, this is a topic that often comes up with former students of a school: what their teachers expected of them. If it’s assumed they won’t go on to third-level or further education, they’re likely to fulfil this prophecy - and what teachers assume about their student may be guided by their principal.At Mercy College in Inchicore, Dublin 8, the school principal, Michelle O’Kelly, leads a team of educators that promote college-going from the first day of school. Following their principal’s cue, teachers in this socially disadvantaged area treat every girl as equally likely to attend third-level as a student from a wealthy family in a fee-paying school - and it has, as expected, led to higher progression rates.St Joseph’s in Rush, north county Dublin, took a similar approach: like Mercy College, it improved guidance counselling, school planning, connections with a university (in this instance, Trinity College) and teaching and learning. Both schools also ensured that the student voice was not just listened to, but heard and acted upon. At St Joseph’s, this approach has seen third-level progression rates more than quadruple, from a base of 15 per cent, in a decade.Student and parent voice“The idea that one middle-class person of a particular age knows what’s best for the school is flawed,” says Ryan. “There is often a sense that the teacher is the font of all wisdom and authority but, in the best schools, teachers are facilitators of knowledge and students are treated as equal partners. Institutions that listen to the experience of students and enact meaningful change are much better institutions. When students talk about a good school, they don’t talk about how great it was that 30 students got 500 points or there was a 90 per cent third-level progression rate: they talk about how respectful staff were to them and that there was a nice place to eat lunch in the school.”The best schools also have meaningful ways for parents to engage with the school, rather than simply being cash cows for “voluntary contributions”.Other important factors to consider:* Diversity: Exposure to different ethnicities, sexualities and socioeconomic backgrounds helps a child learn about different perspectives and experiences.* Extracurricular activities: what is your child interested in and can they do it in this school?* Religion and ethos: they may say that they value all children equally, but what actually happens to the children of non-religious families during religion class? Are there meaningful opt-outs? What if a child - perhaps your child - comes out as gay, bisexual or transgender - will they be told not to talk about it, or will they be actively supported in an environment that does not tolerate homophobic or transphobic bullying?* Wellbeing: How does the school actively uphold policies and procedures that support young people’s health and wellbeing. When it comes to bullying, don’t just look at the school’s undoubtedly impressive written anti-bullying policies: ask on the local grapevine what really happens with reports of bullying.* Subject choices: if they don’t have, for instance, a good choice of language or science subjects, can they facilitate students to study these subjects remotely?Where to get info on schools:* Word-of-mouth: There’s perhaps no better source of information than the local grapevine. If you can bear yet another WhatsApp group, there’s plenty of parent groups who can fill you in on what the local schools are really like (although you should bear in mind that these groups can also be hotbeds of unfounded rumours).* Whole school evaluations: You’ll find these on the Department of Education website. While they do give a good overview of a school’s strengths, weaknesses and areas that have or could improve, they’re not always up-to-date.* Open days: Most in-person open days are still on hold due to the Covid-19 crisis, but many schools run virtual open days. These should give you a sense of the school’s ethos and values, subject options, wellbeing and pastoral care supports and approach to student and parent voice. One thing to look out for is the school’s teaching and learning approach - and a good sign is if you notice that the school emphasises the word “learning” over the word “teaching.”What do you think?What’s education for? Hopefully turning out emerging adults, who are considerate of others. People who are able to work as teams. People who are able to weather the storms of adolescence, who are on the way to finding out who they areActively looking at a DEIS school because league tables do not give the full picture, just a very narrow slice \u0026amp are just classist imo. This school probably won’t do well according to the league tables but is more likely to have the supports my kids need to reach full potential.How many SNAs do they have? Certain ‘high achieving’ schools have no SNAs, no students with Special Education Needs \u0026amp no soul.If I could get both my kids into non-fee-paying schools that are co-ed, religion-free and have no real uniforms, that would mean a lot more to me than any ‘ranking’ possibly could.What’s the transition year offering in each school. What extra curricula like drama performances, school choir, newspaper available.Kudos to Schools that have as many pupils complete 6th year as start 1st, that have daily library access, that have choir, sports, clubs, that have lockers and are open to study before and after school. Points lost for uniforms, bullying, bad toilet facilities and snobbiness.As much as schools can do, the home life of students will make or break them in most cases.

Almost exactly the same as the number of new cases reported on Thursday, 23,817.It may not feel like it, but those numbers show there is a gulf between the pandemic then and now. The virus and how it is managed has changed hugely over time. That change is ongoing, and even amid the bleak picture of curtailed services, cold classrooms and continuing hospitalisations, there are grounds for optimism.Most importantly, it seems that a combination of vaccines, voluntary behavioural change, public health restrictions and “mildness” of Omicron may be curbing the worst outcomes associated with Covid infection – ie ICU admission and death. There are fewer people in ICU than before Christmas, and the number of people receiving oxygen therapy outside ICU – a key measure of how much pressure it is under – is relatively low.In stark contrast with this time last year, which was peppered by emergency meetings and saw the return to schools disintegrate on impact, one high-powered meeting this week was described by an attendee as “nearly totally uneventful”. It’s said Nphet’s meeting was edging towards optimistic on Thursday – that while the data is threadbare (due to Christmas reporting gaps), it is encouraging. It seems the disease, for whatever reason, did not penetrate into older cohorts and more vulnerable populations. Even though significant concern remains over the sheer number of infections, rather than new restrictions, minds are turning to planning for exiting this phase. Schools have resumed. Colleges will resume in-person tuition as planned.It’s a markedly less depressing vista than last January. There are signs that the current wave of infection will be surfed, rather than it crashing over us.This winter was always going to prove the acid test for the Government’s 2021 strategy, which was to vaccinate, reopen slowly and move past controlling Covid with lockdowns. An unspoken element was that vaccines meant a level of infection and illness would be tolerated as it wouldn’t endanger hospitals or kill (as many) people.Tolerating Covid as other diseases meant moving away from harsh measures to control the spread of disease, and decommissioning systems of pandemic management such as Nphet and the testing system. All this was being planned for, and had to be paused, due to a nasty Delta wave that forced a reversal in the last steps of reopening, and the dizzying impact of Omicron. But that strategy is still basically intact. It may be bloodied and bruised, heavily bandaged, perhaps even missing a limb or two, but it is more or less still the plan.If current trends hold, and the worst is avoided, it will be a qualified success for the Government’s winter plan. There will be little thanks for it: close contact rules mean difficult, disrupted weeks are ahead. The traditional tensions over the pace of reopening will emerge, and there is every chance that numbers could stall or surge again as behaviours change and activities resume.Managing the vagaries of the disease as it waxes and wanes, and different variants emerge, will continue to challenge. Balancing the health of society will remain a confounding public policy problem. Yet more problematic variants may emerge. But if the Government can point to a winter without full-scale lockdowns or severe mortality, it will mark another meaningful change in the pandemic.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"state","story":"State papers: Perception on the Shankill Road in 1990s was \u0026lsquofear of encroachment\u0026rsquo-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":null,"title":"inside","story":"Decades of progress overshadowed by Putin crackdowns and confrontation with WestRussia\u0026rsquos land of the midnight sun said to have inspired creator of Chanel No. 5Atomic icebreakers and floating power plants to help Kremlin develop Arctic shipping routeMinority nations feel squeeze as Putin\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquopower vertical\u0026rsquo crushes republics\u0026rsquo autonomyHistory of bloodshed and tragedy haunts stunning region shared by Muslims and ChristiansOil wealth and new mosque and churches help keep Tatarstan on Kremlin\u0027s sideOfficials claim West wants to \u0026lsquoGermanise\u0026rsquo and instil special identity in strategic regionNato monitors heavily armed Kaliningrad as locals long for borders to reopenAttack on renowned Memorial rights group deepens opposition anger and international alarmSaint Petersburg Letter: Russia\u0026rsquos old imperial capital celebrates 200 years since birth of Crime and Punishment creatorEnergy giant hopes vast forests will offset carbon costs and ease green transitionCircassian heritage trampled and property rows continue as Winter Olympics city boomsKremlin criticised as most Russians reject vaccination and hospitals face huge strainKremlin changes tack on global warming and looks to vast forests to offset emissionsRussia and Japan co-operate on Sakhalin despite row over nearby Kuril islandsIndustry and struggling communities fear wildlife support could stifle Far East developmentCity with echoes of San Francisco is thrillingly original, yet tarnished by graft and neglectGrowing energy, security and diplomatic links between Moscow and Beijing worry WestDecembrist rebels and their aristocratic wives embraced \u0026lsquoreal Russia\u0026rsquo in Siberian exileFears for permafrost as tusk hunters feed Chinese market starved of elephant ivoryInside Russia: Melting permafrost threatens critical infrastructure and feeds global warmingStalin\u0027s popularity growing as Kremlin focuses on Soviet triumphs, not tragediesInside Russia: Party wonders how far it cane press Putin after years in soft \u0026lsquosystemic opposition\u0026rsquo roleInside Russia: More protests planned as officials reject calls to address e-voting complaintsMoscow Letter: Poet\u0026rsquos statue has been a magnet for generations of Russian dissentersOn the eve of an expected sham election, many of Putin\u0026rsquos political opponents are already jailed or dead"},{"url":null,"title":"young africans","story":"Young Nigerians dance out onto world stage with pride, confidence and high ambitionWomen-led organisation aims to stop atrocities of dictatorship from reoccurringIn the Gambia, a flourishing comedy scene is used to convey serious messagesStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"asda accused abandoning farmers going back pledge sell british","story":"Asda has been accused of abandoning British farmers after the supermarket chain went back on a pledge to sell only British beef.The retailer said it was reneging on the commitment it made in October, because beef prices have risen considerably off the back of soaring costs. Rising energy and fertiliser prices have forced producers to increase their prices by about 20 per cent since the start of the pandemicRichard Findlay, livestock board chairman of the National Farmers Union, said: “It is incredibly disappointing that Asda has gone back on its commitment to source 100 per cent British beef.“Given the significant changes to trade and agricultural policy, it is more important than ever that our retailers champion British food and farming and that, fundamentally, any sourcing commitments they make are honoured.”Neil Shand, the chief executive of the National Beef Association, added: Our supermarkets need to support domestic producers as much as possible - now more than ever.Asda, the UK’s third largest supermarket chain, made the initial commitment after it was taken over by the billionaire Issa brothers, entrepreneurs from Blackburn who made their fortunes running petrol stations.However, it will now sell beef produced in both Britain and Ireland. Irish beef is around 20 per cent cheaper than British beef and accounts for about 80 per cent of the UK’s beef imports.A spokesman for Asda said: “We know that it is important to our customers that the beef on our shelves has been produced to high welfare standards and is affordable. Unfortunately, the price of British beef has risen and whilst we continue to work hard to keep prices as low as possible for our customers, these increases are significant.”Martin Lines, chairman of the Nature Friendly Farming Network, said that the supermarket had “abandoned British farmers”.“It feels like another PR stunt, he said. As soon as the dust settled, they walked away. It’s a pattern of warm words but poor actions. We’re bitterly upset and cross but have come to expect nothing better.Joe Stanley, a beef farmer from Leicestershire, described the latest move as “death by 1,000 cuts”.“This is just another blow for beef farmers’ profitability,” he said.Waitrose, Marks and Spencer, Morrisons, Co-op, Aldi and Lidl are still committed to selling solely British beef.A Co-op spokesman said: We\u0027re proud to support British beef farmers and Co-op was the first national supermarket to commit to only selling 100 per cent own brand British meat and poultry. We also only use British meat ingredients in our frozen products and sandwiches and ready meals.More from NewsMike Pompeo: How I lost six stone in six months by giving up pancakesNo need for a fourth Covid vaccine, say government scientistsNo increased Covid risk in Tube trains, theatres or hairdressers, research findsThursday dating is a hit with millennials suffering app fatigueWas Prince Philip to thank for blocking Tony Blair\u0026#39s knighthood for so long?More from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"hundreds gyms face closure covid plan b measures harm public","story":"Hundreds of gyms are facing permanent closure this winter, it has emerged, as the Government was accused of “harming public health” by not including the industry in funding support.Plan B measures introduced in December to help slow the spread of the Covid omicron variant have led to a fall in revenue of more than £200 million, ukactive, the not-for-profit health body, said.City centre gyms and studios have had a 70 per cent reduction in footfall in December, and there are “serious concerns” that people will continue to stay away during the new year – a time period which normally sees 25 per cent of new joiners sign up.The initial UK lockdowns had already resulted in 400 gyms, pools and leisure centres closing, ukactive said.Without support, an additional 400 could also shut, meaning more than 10 per cent of the UK’s facilities will have been lost during the pandemic. There were approximately 7,200 facilities in the UK before Covid.It comes after the Government announced a new Better Health campaign to encourage people to lose weight in 2022.The marketing campaign teamed up with 15 weight loss and fitness organisations to help people understand these risks and provide tools and resources to lose excess weight.More than three in five adults are at increased risk of disease or becoming seriously ill with Covid due to being overweight in the UK.The Chancellor made no specific funding available for fitness and leisure facilities in the omicron support package announced in December, ukactive said.Rishi Sunak announced a £1 billion fund, mostly for hospitality and leisure firms, to help businesses through the omicron wave.Huw Edwards, CEO of ukactive, said the decision to exclude gyms, pools and leisure centres from the financial support package “threatens a growing number of facilities with closure”.“These decisions are regressive and will harm our public health, especially now, in the depths of winter, during a vital time in the year when this essential sector is on the frontline, providing safe facilities and spaces to support community health needs,” he said.Mr Edwards also accused the Government of “not heeding” the advice of Sir Chris Whitty, the Chief Medical Officer, who has stressed the importance of exercise during the pandemic.Sir Chris told the ukactive conference in November “as we come out of the Covid crisis, it’s very important we try to get people who’ve got out of the habit of regular exercise back into a situation where they’re doing so, and encourage others who’ve taken up exercise in a way they previously hadn’t, to continue to do so”.The organisation has called for new grants to be approved for health and fitness businesses to “compensate for a lack of trade from Government intervention” and for the furlough scheme to be reinstated.Business rates for all health, fitness and leisure businesses should also be suspended for the first quarter of 2022, it said.“As we start this new year we remain fully focused on our personal health and wellbeing as we continue to live with the threat of Covid,” Mr Edwards said.To help the NHS we must “dampen down the need” for people seeking treatment, he said, adding: “Sport and physical activity can play such a bigger role in doing that, and if there is political will, we can make it a reality.”The Treasury was approached for comment.By Huw Edwards, chief executive of ukactiveWhen Professor Chris Whitty spoke at the ukactive conference in November 2020, he made very clear the importance of physical activity to our lives. “There is no point in life where doing more exercise does not improve health in multiple ways,” he said, before adding, “as we come out of the Covid crisis, it’s very important we try to get people who’ve got out of the habit of regular exercise back into a situation where they’re doing so, and encourage others who’ve taken up exercise in a way they previously hadn’t, to continue to do so.”But in the past few weeks our political leaders have not heeded this expert advice from the Chief Medical Officer in England. The decision to exclude support for gyms, pools and leisure centres from the latest Covid financial support package threatens a growing number of facilities with closure – particularly those in city centres which have suffered the greatest loss in footfall due the omicron guidance. These decisions are regressive and will harm our public health, especially now, in the depths of winter, during a vital time in the year when this essential sector is on the frontline, providing safe facilities and spaces to support community health needs.For far too long, national policy on physical activity has been reactionary, muddled and restrictive, and this urgently needs to change. This was reinforced recently by a House of Lords Committee that said Westminster had overseen an “uncoordinated and fragmented” sport and physical activity strategy that failed to deliver change.And let’s be clear this isn’t about lack of evidence on the value of physical activity. There is a library’s worth of evidence which many organisations champion on a daily basis. Here are three of the most powerful statistics:As we begin 2022, the focus on participation in physical activity is likely to grow. This summer, we host both the Women’s Euros and the Commonwealth Games, which are global celebrations of elite sport. Yet a large shadow will be cast over these major sporting events while large tranches of the infrastructure that supports our national physical activity levels remain under constant threat of closure.So things need to change and they can change.Firstly, and in the case of Westminster, we need to see all government departments acknowledge their role in supporting the physical activity of the nation. It’s unfair and wrong to determine the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) as having exclusive accountability for this agenda – it doesn’t. The Treasury’s use of the tax system, investment in infrastructure via the Levelling Up Department, and the promotion of physical activity from the Department of Health are equally important to the work of DCMS.Secondly, we need to stop conflating elite sport, inspiration and population changes in activity. This conflation is to the detriment of everyone and means our sector has fallen short of playing its fullest role in society. It has created false hopes on matters such as “legacy” from major sporting moments. It has also deflected important focus away from the parts of our sector that are the lead drivers of activity on a mass scale – with fitness activities and swimming provision becoming essential, alongside walking, cycling and running.Thirdly, we need the Government to work with the sector to create a new strategy that brings together the required changes to investment, regulation and taxation that can grow the reach and impact of sport and physical activity on the physical, mental and social wellbeing of the nation.As we start this new year, ukactive remains fully focused on our personal health and wellbeing as we continue to live with the threat of Covid. We also care for the much-loved NHS which continues to meet the challenges of these unprecedented times. Ultimately, the best way to help the NHS is stop people needing it so much by dampening down the need for people seeking treatment. Sport and physical activity can play such a bigger role in doing that, and if there is political will, we can make it a reality.More from NewsMike Pompeo: How I lost six stone in six months by giving up pancakesNo need for a fourth Covid vaccine, say government scientistsNo increased Covid risk in Tube trains, theatres or hairdressers, research findsThursday dating is a hit with millennials suffering app fatigueWas Prince Philip to thank for blocking Tony Blair\u0026#39s knighthood for so long?More from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"nicola sturgeon greens charge scottish politics getting nastier","story":"It’s hardly cutting edge journalism to reveal that there’s nothing as ex- as an ex-MP. The reality of life after parliament is very far from the common assumption by the public that former politicians easily glide into high-paying sinecures.The reverse is more often the case, with former MP on your CV being more of a hindrance than a help. After my own defeat in 2015, it took me many months of effort and sleepless nights to get to the stage where I could be confident that I was earning enough to provide for my family and keep a roof over their heads.Scotland being smaller than the UK, our ex-MSPs don’t always have a great time of it either. The writ of the governing SNP runs throughout civic and even industrial Scotland, and non-nationalist ex-politicians inevitably find the marketplace for their skills less receptive than it is for those who maintain a close personal relationship with serving ministers.Normally, former Green MSPs (of which there are more than you might think) could expect to prosper in this new political environment, their party having kissed the hem of the first minister’s gown in return for two prized places around the ministerial table. Alas, if, like Andy Wightman, you performed an act of apostacy while still serving at Holyrood, and resigned the party whip on a point of principle, then you are, pretty quickly, deemed an un-person.Wightman’s grievance with his former sandal-wearing colleagues stemmed from his unfashionable predilection for accepting the facts of biological science: the Green Party in Scotland, as elsewhere in the UK, is primarily focused on trans rights rather than the environment. It was not enough for Wightman to believe that trans people should not be victimised and to campaign for their rights he was unhappy with the censorious attitude of his party on the issue and believed that the open, public debate that was required on trans rights was incompatible with his party’s views.So Wightman parted company with the Greens, stepping down as an MSP in May last year. He has since had little success in gaining alternative employment and recently tweeted that he had obtained only four full days of work in the last seven months.One might have expected his former colleagues in the Scottish Greens to offer at least some sympathy to someone who was among the hardest working and most respected MSPs of their former parliamentary team. Alas, the “be kind” injunction frequently used by trans ideologues was revealed to be no more than that: mere words. Paul Rodger, the Scottish Young Greens policy officer, said on Twitter: Cw Andy Wightman. Never been prouder of the human race than learning that no one will pay him, almost gives you hope.The delight at another’s difficult circumstances was shared by Rodger’s party colleague, Ewan Smith, elections and campaigns officer, who said: CW: Andy Wightman. Lol, Imao.Both men are young and both have now deleted their appalling comments. But in Twitter veritas, as it were. Deleting tweets after the fact is less a sign of remorse than an indication of having been caught saying what you think. And what many people in the Scottish Greens think is that anyone who disagrees with them on trans issues, even if all they want is for these difficult issues to be discussed publicly (in other words, the overwhelmingly vast majority of the population), then you deserve to exist in penury, with no job, no income, and all the appalling consequences which flow from that.A desire to see your political opponents (as Wightman has become) not only outside parliament but also below the poverty line is not confined to the Greens. At the 2015 general election count for my own constituency, as I walked around the conference centre where the count was taking place putting on a brave face for the TV cameras and my own activists, I overheard some young SNP activists gleefully speculate about how it would not just be former Labour MPs who would now be unemployed, but their staff as well. Oh joy! What fun! Their laughter still rings in my ears and I hoped at the time that my own, now unemployed staff, had not overheard.This kind of politics is cruel and unnecessary. Engraved on a wall in the Scottish Parliament building is the phrase coined by Canadian poet Dennis Lee: Work as if you live in the early days of a better nation. Is this the better nation our rulers wanted? Where men and women are mocked for being unemployed? Where party affiliation is considered so much more important than an inidual’s principles and convictions?Scotland perhaps can be a better nation than it once was, although on present evidence it has gone backwards in the devolution era. With the SNP and the Greens in charge, it is unlikely to make much progress in the right direction.More from NewsMike Pompeo: How I lost six stone in six months by giving up pancakesNo need for a fourth Covid vaccine, say government scientistsNo increased Covid risk in Tube trains, theatres or hairdressers, research findsThursday dating is a hit with millennials suffering app fatigueWas Prince Philip to thank for blocking Tony Blair\u0026#39s knighthood for so long?More from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"religious leaders must reclaim role world politics","story":"My grandfather, Nelson Mandela, fought a repressive apartheid system. It was, for the most part, a political struggle. But Desmond Tutu proved to him that another, often underutilised force can tackle the pressing social-ethical issues of our time: religion.Tutu’s death came at a time of mounting crises, including Covid, the refugee crisis, climate change racial tensions, misogyny and bigotry, to name but a few. These are global challenges which often ide us in potentially catastrophic ways. The world desperately needs leaders who, through faith, understand the realities of these issues. They should come forward and offer solutions.Tutu became a household name by challenging the repressive South African status quo with his unshakable Christian beliefs, aided by the philosophy of “Ubuntu”, or communality. He never shied from using religion as a shield against immorality.For years, he confronted apartheid by invoking Christian values against those who committed atrocities. He risked life and limb, time and again, to ensure equal rights for all. It was for this reason, among many others, that my grandfather appointed him Chairman of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission.Yet, as the Baptist minister Michael Eric Dyson argues, while Tutu believed restorative justice and forgiveness were vital to preserving humanity and confronting evil, modern society struggles to move forward. There is a deficit of moral leadership, of principled women and men who offer models of social change.This is where we should draw our most important lesson from Tutu. He understood that religion should be used as this bridge between faith and real-world issues, acting as a platform for political activism which inspires and compels. Today there are already important examples we can learn from. Take the Buddhist monks who marched against the military junta in Myanmar, or those confronting Islamophobia and anti-Semitism.Or Dr Mohammad bin Abdulkarim Al-Issa, one of the world’s leading Islamic scholars, who became the most senior Islamic leader to visit Auschwitz, leading a delegation of Muslim leaders there to symbolise a groundbreaking shift in attitudes that have lasted decades and ned continents.And closer to home in South Africa, the Muslim World League runs the Mercy and Peace institute, providing a safe space for victims of abuse, especially the women and children whose lives are threatened by domestic violence and human trafficking. This is where faith and religious values come into the equation, helping solve real world issues. Elsewhere, leaders like Rabbi Arthur Schneier host powerful interfaith dialogue talks around the world. But these examples are unfortunately the exception, and not the rule.Compared to the late Tutu, far too many of today’s religious leaders have fallen short. They have a tendency to confront the world’s mounting sufferings by issuing banal declarations — often only to their own followers. Although their rhetoric may be inspiring, they lack the conviction to ensure their words inspire action and progress.It’s important to want change. But it’s just as important to illuminate the path towards change. Tutu and my grandad were a lot alike in their determination to do as much. In the world we live in today, where people are vilified for honouring their voices, we need more people like them, especially during these days of the pandemic, extreme poverty and inequalities.Both men knew that injustice, in any form, warranted a response. As South Africa and the world mourns the passing of Tutu, religious leaders must learn that our communal problems require more than just empty rhetoric. This is how they can respect the legacy of action, inspired by faith, that he championed.Rest in peace, Archbishop Tutu.Ndileka Mandela is the head of the Thembekile Mandela Foundation and the eldest grandchild of Nelson MandelaMore from NewsMike Pompeo: How I lost six stone in six months by giving up pancakesNo need for a fourth Covid vaccine, say government scientistsNo increased Covid risk in Tube trains, theatres or hairdressers, research findsThursday dating is a hit with millennials suffering app fatigueWas Prince Philip to thank for blocking Tony Blair\u0026#39s knighthood for so long?More from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"revolt right brewing ready part","story":"Conservative MPs in Red Wall seats have got the jitters, and so they should. Two polls at the weekend are causing the alarm. One puts Labour 16 per cent ahead in those key seats that Boris Johnson would need to retain to win the next general election. And a constituency poll shows there is a new threat to the Right of Johnson\u0027s Conservative Party.  Some will argue that these are standard midterm problems and that a couple of polls mean little. But the data suggests that on the ground, something significant is happening which has, as yet, gone unnoticed in London. A revolt on the Right is brewing, and it poses a huge threat to the Prime Minister. This has happened before. Exactly ten years ago, I campaigned in the Barnsley Central by-election as Ukip leader. This urban South Yorkshire seat is rock solid Labour territory. Ukip barely got a mention in the polls or in media coverage of the campaign. On the stump, however, I became aware of a shift taking place. When the results were announced, Ukip came second with 12 per cent of the vote. The Tories trailed in third. Nine months earlier, at the 2010 election, Ukip had come fifth in that seat. That by-election marked the beginning of the insurgency that led to the EU referendum and the ousting of David Cameron from Downing Street. The latest constituency poll by Focal Data puts Reform UK, led by Richard Tice, at 15 per cent in Barnsley Central. A similar pattern is being repeated across many of the Red Wall seats, with Reform UK in double digits elsewhere in those key seats. Support is being built without the party spending lots of money or devoting many resources to publicity. It is the attraction of Reform UK’s policies rather than any enthusiasm for Sir Keir Starmer’s Labour Party that is putting the Tories in such peril. There now exists a very mobile electorate in Red Wall areas. A decade ago, I met lifelong Labour Party voters who were for the first time willing to switch their support to Ukip, believing we spoke their language on the key issues of EU membership, immigration and patriotic pride. At the 2019 European elections, they switched again in increasing numbers, choosing to back the Brexit Party. And they switched for a third time later that year when the general election was held, voting for the Conservative Party. Once the generational link with the Labour Party was broken, switching became easy.  People lent their vote to Johnson in 2019 to break the Brexit logjam and to take back control of our borders because the immigration issue still matters to them. Yet just two years on, the volume of illegal Channel crossings has enraged these voters. The North East now houses about five times as many asylum seekers as the South East, according to the Migration Observatory. The impact of this is plain for all to see. As the council house waiting list lengthens, there is a growing feeling that Johnson told voters what they wanted to hear about “taking back control” without really meaning it.   Such perceptions are electorally disastrous for any prime minister. Yet there is potentially an even bigger problem on the horizon. This year\u0027s massively increased gas and electricity bills are going to cause an enormous shock. Worse still, these large bills will coincide with tax rises. If Richard Tice can get the message through that 25 per cent of people\u0027s electricity bills is spent on green subsidies – and that the 5 per cent VAT energy rate has, despite promises, not been removed – then Reform UK will have its big chance.   The revolt on the Right ended the premierships of David Cameron and Theresa May. I founded Reform UK out of the Brexit Party, which had done its job successfully. For now, I am the party\u0027s president in a non-executive role, but I intend to increase the help that I\u0027m giving to Richard Tice. Brexit has not been completed properly. The net zero strategy is placing our nation at a significant disadvantage. And the Channel crossings are humiliating Britain.   I understand the disillusionment of Red Wall voters who thought Brexit would usher in a new politics. This has not happened. It’s just more of the same – a metropolitan Tory chumocracy totally detached from the rest of the country. If Johnson wakes up to this, he can still save himself. I suspect, however, that the revolt on the right will cause another prime ministerial casualty.  Listen to Nigel Farage on this subject on this week\u0027s Chopper\u0027s Politics, The \u0027s weekly political podcast, using the audio player at the top of this article or on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or your favourite podcast app.More from NewsMike Pompeo: How I lost six stone in six months by giving up pancakesNo need for a fourth Covid vaccine, say government scientistsNo increased Covid risk in Tube trains, theatres or hairdressers, research findsThursday dating is a hit with millennials suffering app fatigueWas Prince Philip to thank for blocking Tony Blair\u0026#39s knighthood for so long?More from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"tories party shirkers not strivers","story":"Boris Johnson has managed to start the year better than he ended 2021. He was right to resist further coronavirus restrictions, to decry attempts to “bowdlerise” our history following the Colston Four verdict, and to accuse anti-vaxxers of spouting “mumbo jumbo”.To some extent, the Prime Minister appears to have become reacquainted with his Tory testicles over the festive period.Yet as Jacob Rees-Mogg (another man who was seemingly gifted back his Conservative cojones for Christmas) pointed out at Cabinet this week – the biggest threat to Mr Johnson’s premiership is not Covid, nor sleaze nor even Downing Street’s wallpaper bill, but the looming cost of living crisis.Quite rightly, Mr Rees-Mogg questioned why on earth Rishi Sunak was proceeding with the planned rise in National Insurance Contributions (NIC), pushing the tax burden to its highest since Clement Attlee was prime minister after the Second World War.Even deputy Labour leader Angela Rayner couldn’t quite get her socialist tax-and-spend head around it, telling PMQs on Wednesday: “Inflation is about to hit 6 per cent … millions of British workers face a further pay cut and his Chancellor is handing them a tax hike.”The Resolution Foundation think-tank predicts the NIC rise, which comes into force in April and breaks a Tory manifesto pledge, will cost middle-earning households about £300 a year.Since returning to the office after the festive break I have been inundated with data outlining how Britons are increasingly starting to feel the pinch, with Paul Johnson, the director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, predicting it “could well be worse than the financial crisis”. And it’s not just tax, but household bills, too.“Millions of households could be thrown onto the energy breadline without urgent targeted support from Government,” screamed one press release from Uswitch, as Mr Johnson refused to scrap VAT on utility bills.Another pointed out how the price of petrol, which was roughly £1.11 per litre before the pandemic, is now the highest it has been in a decade, with experts predicting it could hit £1.50 per litre before long.Another, from the British Chambers of Commerce, warned that 58 per cent of firms expect their prices to increase in the next three months, the highest on record. Sixty six per cent of businesses cited inflation as a concern, also a record high.Such figures are deeply worrying – but so too is the Government’s seemingly cloth-eared response to the impending crisis. Like Gordon Brown blaming everything on the “global financial crisis”, we now have an intransigent Chancellor banging on about the need to tackle the NHS backlog, as if, miraculously, a £36 billion cash injection without any actual reform will suddenly solve all the health service’s ills.To make matters worse, yesterday we learnt that more than a million people are set to be dragged into the higher rate tax band by 2026.The Treasury’s plan to freeze income tax thresholds at a time of rapid wage and price inflation will push 1.2 million workers’ earnings above the 40p mark, according to analysis by the House of Commons Library.It is frankly hard to think of a worse way of treating the hard-working backbone of Britain that voted for Mr Johnson in 2019.During the Conservative Party leadership election, he had pledged to raise the threshold at which people start paying income tax at the higher rate to £80,000.Instead, we now have aspirational middle-income families finding themselves “fiscally dragged” into tax bands originally intended for the wealthy. This is a galling move by a Government seemingly incapable of controlling its own profligacy.For millions of people, even Red Wall voters at the last election, one of the main attractions of the Conservatives was that they were a party that supposedly stood on the side of people who want to get ahead in life.Like Mrs Thatcher’s manifestos in the 1980s, theirs was an appeal to the kind of people who want to save, buy their own home, get a second car, and go on a foreign holiday. The Tories have traditionally championed hard work and enterprise. They loathed benefit cheats and long-term unemployment. They represented the kind of self-improvement, taking-setbacks-on-the-chin, and getting-on-your-bike philosophy that Love Island star Molly-Mae Hague has, predictably, been criticised by the Left for espousing. (If Mr Johnson wants to capitalise on a half decent week, he would be wise to throw his support behind her Thatcherite thinking.)Lest we forget, this was precisely how he sold the Conservatives at the last election. There would be no tax rises. They weren’t those lazy Reds in Corbyn’s Labour, who wanted to confiscate your wealth. There was a more optimistic message towards immigrants: this is the country where you can come and be whatever you want to be if you work hard enough. The points-based immigration system was designed to judge people on their talents rather than their identity. And then, of course, there was Brexit: a brave new world, where buccaneering Britain would make its own way as a global free trade leader.But what has actually happened instead? We have 1.3 million people off work, because they are self-isolating, many with a mild bout of Covid. We have once again got millions working from home, crippling the high street and local businesses.We have higher taxes on workers – and the self-employed. And we have higher taxes on entrepreneurs via increased corporation tax. Contrary to claims that our corporation tax rates will still be the lowest in the G7, in fact our effective marginal corporate tax rates are now going to be higher than that bastion of economic dynamism, France. Zut alors!Meanwhile, there has been no attempt to take on the unions, with the likes of Unison telling public sector workers they can now take 28 days off without a sick note as a result of new Covid rules. A defiant email to its 1.4 million members this week read: “Proof of sickness cannot be requested earlier than 28 days.” Nice work if you can get it.And let’s not get started on the bloated public sector itself, with yet more money being ploughed into unreformed services, much of it likely to be eaten up in wages and pensions for middle managers so inadequate they would never be hired by any private sector company.Is this really the side the Tories want to be on – the shirkers rather than the strivers?While I appreciate that there is a pandemic-sized hole in the public finances, how does the Government expect businesses to pay their workers higher wages if they are contending with the effects of higher inflation themselves?Moreover, what possible incentive is there for employees to earn more money, if they are going to end up being taxed by stealth?The “fiscal drag” research suggests that this isn’t just going to affect high earners. An extra 1.2 million are expected to be pushed into the 40p tax band that starts at £50,070, than if the Government were to raise that threshold in line with forecast inflation to £56,270. But an extra 1.5 million low paid earners will also be pushed into the 20p basic tax rate that starts at £12,570, than if the personal allowance threshold rose in line with forecast inflation to £14,070 over the next four years. Such a freeze will collectively cost families in England, Wales and Northern Ireland £11 billion by 2026 – that’s an extra £430 for the average household.This isn’t just a betrayal of the electorate – but of Conservatism itself.More from NewsMike Pompeo: How I lost six stone in six months by giving up pancakesNo need for a fourth Covid vaccine, say government scientistsNo increased Covid risk in Tube trains, theatres or hairdressers, research findsThursday dating is a hit with millennials suffering app fatigueWas Prince Philip to thank for blocking Tony Blair\u0026#39s knighthood for so long?More from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"west looks putin crushes kazakhstans democratic uprising","story":"Two statues toppled, two worlds apart. In Bristol, a jury acquits protesters who vandalised a monument to Edward Colston, an 18th-century philanthropist whose fortune was built on the slave trade. In Kazakhstan, a huge effigy of the dictator Nursan Nazabayev is torn down by demonstrators engaged in a fight to the death between people power and a police state.Here in Britain, arguments over statues are about who owns the past. In this oil-rich yet dirt-poor Central Asian republic, the battles are very much about the present. This is a popular uprising against the brutal, corrupt and authoritarian elite that has ruled Kazakhstan since the fall of the Soviet Union. They fled to Moscow by private jet as protesters died in the streets.As if to underline the geopolitical significance of the Kazak revolution, Russian airborne forces poured in to support the regime, now led by President Tokayev. He appealed for help to crush “international terrorists”, although it seems clear that protests in the capital, Almaty, and elsewhere were sparked by a dramatic rise in petrol prices. In Kazakhstan, even more than in the West, the politics of energy are explosive. In this vast land of just 19 million people that stretches from the Caspian Sea to China, transport is crucial and average monthly wages are just £400. Clashes have been reported all over the country, as simmering resentment of the Communist Party and its 81-year-old leader, Nazabayev, boiled over this week.All indications are that the revolution caught Vladimir Putin off guard, but he has been quick to order military intervention by the Collective Security Treaty Organisation (CTSO), a bloc of six post-Soviet states led by Moscow. It is unclear how large this “peacekeeping” operation will be, but it comes at a time when the Kremlin has been engaged in a poker game with the West over Ukraine. With a large Russian army massed on the Ukrainian border, Putin issued an ultimatum last month, demanding that the United States not only keep out of any conflict but also withdraw its forces from other Nato members such as Poland and the Baltic states. While the crisis in Kazakhstan may delay any Russian invasion of Ukraine, it also exposes the weakness of the West. It looks very much as if we will be forced to watch helplessly as a democratic uprising is crushed by military force. Unlike Ukraine, Kazakhstan has hitherto been very much within the Russian sphere of influence. There are no limits on the harsh measures that may now be deployed. Putin has form in dealing with Muslim rebels. Up to 250,000 civilians may have died in the long war he fought in Chechnya from 1999 to 2009, which left the Caucasian republic in ruins.On the other side of the border, the world’s other leading authoritarian power, China, is watching anxiously to secure its oil supplies. Beijing is, like Moscow, hypersensitive to any potential Islamist threat. The Kazak population is overwhelmingly Muslim, as is China’s Xinjiang province, where mass incarceration and sterilisation have brought accusations of genocide. President Xi Jinping has recently replaced Xinjiang’s governor, but events in Kazakhstan will almost certainly prompt him to ignore foreign protests and instead reinforce China’s repressive policies against its own Muslims.Kazakhstan’s may be only the first authoritarian regime to collapse under the impact of the global energy crisis. Hence Putin will be at pains to send an unambiguous message to Washington and London: don’t even think about getting involved. After the humiliation of Afghanistan, President Biden will not dare to offer more than verbal support for the Kazak revolutionaries.As for Ukraine: the images of toppled statues in Kazakhstan may evoke memories of the 2004 Orange Revolution and the 2014 uprising in Kyiv’s Maidan Square. If, however, these images are soon succeeded by reports of Kazak protesters imprisoned, tortured or shot, Ukrainians will be in no doubt of the fate that awaits them in the event of a successful Russian invasion. Kazakhstan may seem to us to be a far away country of which we know even less than we did when Neville Chamberlain used that notorious phrase about Czechoslovakia. But this week’s political earthquake there will reverberate around our interconnected world, as heads and hearts are broken in the increasingly desperate struggle between democracy and despotism. Those who cheer on Black Lives Matter activists protesting about centuries-old grievances might ask themselves: do Kazak lives matter too?Daniel Johnson is the editor of TheArticle.More from NewsNo need for a fourth Covid vaccine, say government scientistsNo increased Covid risk in Tube trains, theatres or hairdressers, research findsThursday dating is a hit with millennials suffering app fatigueWas Prince Philip to thank for blocking Tony Blair\u0026#39s knighthood for so long?Asda accused of abandoning farmers after going back on pledge to sell only British beefMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"four ways make your christmas","story":"Four ways to make your Christmas with loved ones safer according to GPWe can still have a great time together – just follow these tips to help protect loved ones from the new Covid- strainthis.style.displaynone\" Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror video coronavirus-numbers-uk-records--,customFields:,clearance:Network,source:ceaefcdbe,sourceUrl:Copied from RSC,site:Mirror,brandSafety: General news – passed for ad targeting,enableJWPlayer:true,jwPlayerSiteID:hPpIvH,jwPlayerMediaID:dtzrPE,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:,pubmaticVideoPrebidEnabled:true,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,disableOzoneScriptOnDragonfly:true,pubmaticIdDisabled:true,fbia.mantisRecommender:true,RRET-.cutOffDate:--T::,blackFridayWidget.linkUrl:https:www.mirror all-about black-friday,blackFridayWidget:,partner.quicklinks.bar:true,enableSlideInSkinnySignUp:true,justpremiumDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,videoPlaylistEnabled:true,domain:mirror,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,publicationId:aeed-a--bac-edf,lotameLightningTagV:true,ampVideoCacheBuster:true,pubmaticDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,deleteAccountFromProfile:true,adHiddenLoading:true,adslotsFixedSize:true,blackFridayWidget.Link:https:get-latest.dev.convrse.media black-fridayblack-friday-widget-v.,sovrnDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,video.header.bidding.enabled:,chatEnabled:true,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,enableAboutTopics:true,converse.widget.enable:true,viafouraComments:true,adMobileBottomSlotLarge:true,video.jwplayer.playerId:DxFYnOv,flagsFromDataLayerForFBIA:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,fbia.converse.enabled:true,irisClientToken:,disableAHS:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,openxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,globalTrayEnabled:true,manualReconsent:,mpulse.enabled:true,nobidDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,og.image.for.section.and.topic:https:s-prod.mirror @trinitymirrordigital chameleon-branding publications mirror img logo-mirror-socialsharing.png,publicationName:Mirror,video.jwplayer.enabled:true,loadIrisManually:true,delayAdsUntilCMP:true,disableAdvertMaxHeight:true,preloadFonts:true,viafouraEnabled:true,PWA.enable:true,readNextEmbeds:true,removeSSO:true,chartbeatHeadlinePageTypes:[ home , channel , topic , section ],felix.endpoint:https:felix.data.tm-awx ampconfig.,breakingNewsPull:true,nobidVideoPrebidEnabled:true,adFixedMobileBottomSticky:true,magniteDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,footerNewsletterConfig:,xandrDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,consentText:We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Close contact with others – especially in unventilated spaces – increases your chances of spreading Covid-. If you’re spending the festive season with loved ones there are lots of ways you can reduce the risk, including taking regular rapid lateral flow tests, letting fresh air in and getting your booster. GP Dr Claire Ashley provides some simple tips for staying safe so you and those close to you can gather round the table and enjoy your Christmas fun. Take those tests  Meeting up with loved ones  You should all do a rapid lateral flow test before you mingle.They’re free, easy to do at home and the results show in half an hour – to order a pack, go to nhs.uk get-tested.“If you haven’t got any symptoms, rapid lateral flow tests are very good at picking up Covid-,” says Dr Ashley, based in the South West. “On Christmas morning, before granny comes over for lunch, taking a test is the best way to check you’re not infectious. “My family will all have a rapid lateral flow test the morning we travel down to see my parents, andanything comes back positive, or any of us has symptoms, we won’t go. “I’m aware our plans might be disrupted. It’s not perfect, especially after last year, but I’d rather everyone stays safe.”  As Dr Ashley points out, rapid lateral flow tests are designed to pick up Covid- cases with no symptoms, soyou do have symptoms such as a fever, cough or loss of sense of taste or smell, you need to isolate immediately and take a PCR test. Andyour rapid lateral flow test does show a positive result, you’ll need to isolate and only leave the house to take a PCR test to confirm it.If you have been in contact with someone with Covid- and are double vaccinated, you should take a daily rapid lateral flow test for seven daysyou have no symptoms. If you test positive or develop symptoms in those seven days, you must self-isolate, take a PCR test and follow the guidance on gov.uk.If you are unvaccinated, you must self-isolate for  daysyou are in contact with someone who has Covid-.Don’t forget the NHS COVID- app is still the fastest way to knowyou’ve been exposed to someone who’s tested positive, so keep it on.Open the window sLetting fresh air into your home is one way to help reduce the spread of Covid-. Opening windows and doors for just  minutes will help. “Covid- is an airborne virus and the research suggests that when you’re in a well-ventilated space the risk of contracting it is reduced,” says Dr Ashley. “That’s why being outdoors is much more safe, but that’s tricky when it’s very cold. Soyou want to reduce the chances of Covid- being passed on, have the windows open so you get as much airflow as possible.” Wear a face covering You must wear a face covering in public areas such as shops, places of worship, entertainment venues, and on public transport. It’s wise to wear a mask in crowded or enclosed spaces, eventhey’re not legally required. “Face coverings are really effective at reducing how much you’re spreading Covid-,” explains Dr Ashley. Get your booster Every adult in the country now needs to get a Covid- booster vaccine, because two doses does not give you enough protection against catching Omicron. Book yours now at nhs.uk covidvaccination.Get Boosted Now is the national mission to build a wall of defence against the Omicron iant. This mission is more urgent than ever before with Covid- because Omicron is spreading fast. Vaccines are the best way we can protect ourselves. You can get a Covid- booster  weeks after your second dose. Boosters give you the best possible protection against the virus and should signicantly reduce your risk of serious illness and hospitalisation.If you haven’t had your first or second vaccine, go to nhs.uk covidvaccination or call  to book it, or find your nearest walk-in centre.“It’s also very important for pregnant women to get vaccinated,” adds Dr Ashley. “The benefits of being vaccinated and boosted really outweigh the risks.”People with lower immune systems might need to be more careful about socialising this Christmas, as they could have less protection against getting severely ill with Covid-. This includes people who are taking medication that suppresses the immune system – eg, for rheumatoid arthritis – and those having chemotherapy.

Major shareholders in the energy firms will amass billions out of rising prices and the NI tax hike won’t hurt too many millionaire Cabinet ministers or company bosses. In fact, according to the High Pay Centre, by am today the average chief executive of a FTSE  company had already been paid the average British worker’s salary for . And he’s probably still skiing in the Alps. There’s always been a gap between the rich and the rest, but it feels like it’s becoming a chasm. And the main dference between the top % and everyone  is their expectation to be treated dferently.  Think back to the Mirror’s revelations of how Downing Street held festive knees-ups after barring the rest of us from having a cuppa with a lonely old relative. They were angered that it was even a story – as though it was a given that they were free to act dferently. Look at the Establishment attitude to the loaded heiress Ghislaine Maxwell being convicted of facilitating and participating in the sexual abuse of children. Her brother went on BBC Radio’s Today show to denigrate the jury’s verdict and tug on our heartstrings. Others sought to evoke sympathy for her by writing in newspapers about this charming woman who had been manipulated by the monster Jeffrey Epstein. If the paedophile-enabler had been a single mum on benefits, not a well-connected socialite, what are the chances of the BBC inviting her brother on to its flagship news show to plead her innocence  In the same case, we’ve seen Prince Andrew’s lawyers attempt to hide behind a silencing deal between Epstein and the woman who accuses him of sexual abuseto escape answering questions. And his family goes along with this stonewalling without being called out. Well they’re royal, ain’t they  Which brings us to the honours they dish out, most of which are bought. Sure, little people are thrown the odd bangle to disguise the charade, but the major gongs are status symbols the amoral rich seek out to show they are a cut above the rest. Last week, I named -year-old Folajimi Olubunmi-Adewole, who died in the Thames trying to rescue a drowning woman, as my Man of the Year. He didn’t make the New Year’s Honours list.  Tony Blair was knighted though, despite the Chilcot report stating he knowingly misled the country into a war which cost the lives of hundreds of thousands of Iraqis and  Britons. A petition to cancel his knighthood is climbing towards the one million that marched through London begging him to rethink his illegal invasion. But the man who has now made £million since leaving office will once again ignore it because that’s what the very rich do. That’s the power their wealth has bought. Chew on that in a couple of months when people you know are choosing whether to go further into debt with Scottish Power, or eat.

You can literally go in any direction.  aposWhen Iaposve spoken about that in the past I have been slammed a little bit, with people saying itaposs easy for you to say that because youaposve not grown up in poverty, so for you to sit there and say we all have the same  hours in a day is not correct. But, technically, what Iaposm saying is correct. We do. She went on: “I understand we all have dferent backgrounds and we’re all raised in dferent ways and we do have dferent financial situations, but I thinkyou want something enough you can achieve it. “It just depends on what s you want to go to get where you want to be in the future. And I’ll go to any .” She then added: “I’ve worked my absolute a*** off to get where I am now.” The comments were branded tone deaf on social media, with critics saying many hard-working Brits are struggling to make ends meet amid a cost of living crunch. She released a statement on Friday defending her comments, saying she was not commenting on anyone ’s le or personal situation she can only speak of her own experience. But Molly-Mae found an unlikely ally in Tory Minister Paul Scully.  Askedher comments were fair, Mr Scully told LBC: I think it is, but I think youaposve got to define success, because some of the comments that I was hearing in the lead up to my piece on this was about money, but success doesnapost necessarily equal money. It can be, you know, furthering your job, whether itaposs in public service or whatever. And I think an aspirational approach to le is no bad thing. What weaposve got to make sure, though, is that opportunity is equally distributed around the country. And thataposs why the levelling up agenda that we often talk about in government is so, so important to make sure that those  hours can be matched by the opportunities by education and business across the country. A spokesman for the Prime Minister said he had not discussed Molly-Maeaposs comments with Boris Johnson. In a statement, a representative for Molly-Mae said she had been referring to a quote that inspires her which states aposWe all have the same  hours in a day as Beyonceapos. Her opinion onyou want something enough you can work hard to achieve it is how she keeps determined with her own work to achieve more in her own le, the statement said. Molly is not commenting on anyone ’s le or personal situation she can only speak of her own experience. Her representative added: Social media users have shared a short snippet from this interview with words such as apos you are homeless buy a houseapos and apos you are poor be poorapos these are absolutely not Molly’s words, these are not Molly’s thoughts and this isn’t at all the meaning or thought behind that conversation.

The flirty comment had been left underneath his photo by -year-old Samatha Garcia, who Bradley had followed for some time. But living , miles apart, Bradley, from Coventry and Samantha, from Mexico, had never met. “A few days after she commented on my photo, I sent Samantha a message and said hello,” Bradley, , told The Mirror. The pair started chatting and realised there was a spark between them. There was just one problem - neither of them spoke the same language. While the pair chatted in Spanish, Bradley, who works night shts in a supermarket, was using online translator tools to try and communicate with Samantha. Still, the language barrier didn’t stop them. “We usually spoke every day and our relationship just grew,” Bradley explained. “After about a month of texting we had our first video call.”For more of the news you care about straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here Although he loved speaking to his beau on video, Bradley was still using translation tools to communicate with Samantha in Spanish. He said: “We knew it would be easierwe could speak more naturally. I’ve always liked Spanish and Samantha gave me the motivation to actually learn.” Determined to break down the language barrier, he hired a Spanish tutor and joined language learning website Duolingo in October . From then on, he used Duolingo almost every day and saw his tutor whenever he could. “I used it every day for  or  minutes,” he said, adding he fit sessions in around his shts at work. And as time passed, his vocabulary started to improve. But when the pandemic hit and his tutor moved back to Spain, Bradley relied solely on the website to improve his language skills.  And lockdown put the brakes on another of Bradley’s plans - a trip to Mexico to meet Samantha in person. “We planned everything for April , but obviously it got cancelled,” he recalled. “I booked the trip again for October, and luckily it went ahead.” After more than a year of speaking online every single day, Bradley and Samantha finally met in the flesh when his flight landed in Mexico City. “It was amazing,” he said. “From the minute I stepped off the plane and went through the doors of the airport, I was excited.” And luckily, the pair got on just as well in person as they had online. “We were both really nervous for the first few hours, but after that we connected like normal.” For the next three weeks, the pair travelled around Mexico where Bradley could practice his Spanish - and his skills were put to the test when he met Samantha’s family.  “They were lovely. We were constantly at her house speaking to them and watching TV. They were really nice to me,” Bradley said. After three weeks of bliss Bradley had to leave his beau and fly back to the UK - which was more dficult than he’d anticipated. “It was horrible. Being at the airport and saying goodbye was awful,” he said.So as soon as he was back on UK soil, Bradley started planning Samantha’s visit to the UK as soon as they could - but more coronavirus restrictions got in the way.“We planned for her to come for five months so she could live with me and get to know England properly,” he said.  After nearly six months apart, Samantha arrived in London in April , where Bradley was eagerly waiting to collect her. And, once they had both been grilled about Samantha’s visit by border force officials, Samantha and Bradley were finally reunited. For the next few months, Bradley showed Samantha around the sights of the UK, and in August he took her on a caravan trip to Paignton in Devon - where he popped the question in a park filled with flowers. “I’d been planning it for a couple of months but I was just trying to find the right time and place,” he said.

Christine Palfrey, , started to feel lethargic in  but assumed she was exercising too much for the amount she was eating. “I was working long hours and feeling tired all the time, but I just pushed through,” she said. But one Sunday in December that year, she woke up with an excruciating pain in her lower jaw. The ex-dental nurse made an emergency appointment to see a dentist - thinking some food had probably got trapped in her gums. But after having X rays, Christine said her dentist went silent. For more of the news you care about straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here He said it could be an abscess, but he didn’t want to speculate and said he would refer me to a specialist in the next couple of days which, of course, set off alarm bells, she recalled. But, knowing plenty about dentistry from her old job, Christine knew it was more serious. An abscess builds, so you don’t get sudden pain, she said. However, she could never have predicted the diagnosis she would soon receive. The dentist referred Christine to a specialist at Kingaposs College Hospital in London, Dr Kathleen Fan. After cutting into her gum, Dr Fan found a solid lump - confirming Christine didnapost have an abscess. She took a biopsy of the lump and sent the mum-of-one home to Bamford, Oxfordshire, to wait for the results.  Then Christine received a letter telling her to come back to the hospital - and bring her then-husband along, too. She recalled: The doctor had the results of the biopsy and said, aposThis is quite a tough one to tell you. You have a very rare form of cancer. I’m afraid it’s not benign.apos Christine was diagnosed with Adenoid Cystic Carcinoma , a rare, aggressive cancer that is usually found in the glands and the head. After her diagnosis, Christine was referred to another specialist in London who told her she needed an operation to remove some of the cancer. But although there were things they could do to treat the cancer, the specialist warned Christine it was stage  and incurable. She was given three to five years to live. Devastated by the news, Christine went ahead with the -hour operation the following week to give herself the best possible chance of survival. The surgery involved talking a section of bone from her left hip to replace the section of her jawbone, which was cut away to remove the cancer. It meant Christine had to learn to walk and talk again, and permanently changed the shape of her face. But the most dficult thing of all was breaking the news to her daughter Victoria, who was just a teenager at the time. “Everyone was crying, but I just kept telling Victoria, aposYou know how strong your mother is. She will get through this. We all will. I will still be me and this is just a bump in the road, so we just need to focus on the futureapos, she recalled.  After the operation, Christine had to undergo radiotherapy for a year, which took its toll on her body. And the strain of cancer also took its toll on her marriage to Victoriaaposs father - with the pair filing for orce in . However, the pair remained on good terms and amicably co-parented Victoria while Christine continued with cancer treatment. Over the years, Christine has had three more operations to remove secondary cancer on her lungs, but sheaposs continued working her office job throughout cancer treatment. And it was in the office she met Barry Weeks, who she at first thought was a bit of an idiot. However, after the pair were sat on desks next to each other, they bonded over a shared silly sense of humour and eventually fell in love. On Christineaposs nd birthday, Barry popped the question, and the pair walked down the aisle in November last year. Given away by her brother Tony and with Victoria, now , by her side as a bridesmaid, Christine said it was a perfect day. Now, sheaposs excited for what the future holds with her new husband and wonapost let cancer stop her from living le to the fullest. “At the moment, I am in a good place and there are no more secondaries.Do you have a real le story to share  Email jessica.taylor@reachplc“I have my next scan in February, so the base line is that I am not cured but I have been successfully treated.”Christine is now supporting Cancer Research UKaposs Play Your Part campaign, which asks everyone to think about how they can contribute to improving cancer treatments and, eventually, finding a cure.She said: I am following a positive le force and now Barry has given me even more to look forward to in the future, too.

That was her grandmother Angela Noake’s birthday and the teacup was once given to her and husband, Stanley, in , as an engagement gt. This was their beach hut, where the teacup has nestled since they first rented it  years ago, as have the blue and white mats, and the wooden bench Stanley made with a ltable lid to store buckets and spades. It is where their daughter Sue Steller, Heidi’s mum, had birthday parties as a girl where she brought Heidi as a baby to be shaded from the sun, where she “fried her an egg” or rustled up “salad and cold meats” after school for tea.  Where Heidi played with “shells for boats” and later card games like Spite and Malice, cosy against the wind, and where her own three children tottered early steps and now enjoy hot chocolate and pot noodles, boiling the “whistle kettle”. “I always have a tea in that cup with a digestive on her birthday, like she used to,” says Heidi, . “Immediately I get here I feel calmer, things are so much better in the beach hut. I could never, ever give it up.” The hut decked in blue and white, on Boscombe Beach in Bournemouth, which still has the same numbers her grandad carved, is her favourite place in the world. It was her grandmother’s, too, before she died in  aged , many years after her beloved Stanley. “She’d come down on her own to swim, with her lunch - a chunk of cheese, a tomato and a cracker,” smiles Heidi. “It was very much her place.”  Sue, , explains it was a sanctuary for both her parents. This hut, and two they rented before from , along the beach, were the stuff of dreams for Stanley, who was a Prisoner of War in Poland for five years during World War Two. Angela and everyone  thought him dead, while “all he could think about was ‘His Ange’”. They married as soon as they could when he ed in . “After what he went through he dreamt of days on the beach like this,” says Sue. This family’s story of love for their beach hut offers a glimpse of what these tiny, rudimentary sheds mean to us Brits. The passion can be hard to explain abroad, but it was certainly alive and well in Avon Beach, Christchurch, Dorset last Sunday. Dogged locals - and not so locals - queued for up to  hours to secure a beach hut rental there for the summer. Some were up at am to stand in freezing rain to nab a ft x ft box for up to £,. Among some  anoraks zipped tight against the wind, one fan dreaming of a staycation with ready windbreaks and a kettle came from as far as Leicester. In the past, people have travelled from Scotland.  There are approximately , beach huts in the UK. Some are rented, some privately owned. In Bournemouth the waiting list is now shut Heidi explains she was on it for  years in order to take on the rental of their hut from her grandmother in  . Buying a hut is no mean feat. Last July one in nearby Mudeford sold for a staggering £,. That one was a little more deluxe than the norm, but generally the huts are not dissimilar to how they have always been, evolved from the bathing machines on wheels that first carried modest bathers by horse down to the seafront . After WW, councils began providing them for changing and the Victorian and Georgian abandoned machines were regularly converted. Some of the earliest purpose-built examples were erected near Bournemouth Pier in . Today, in the pandemic-forced era of the staycation, they have become hot property. But for Heidi and many more, their huts are more than a roof and windbreaks. They are ingrained in their souls, and house precious memories.  Hilary Knight treasures the beach hut her elderly father built for her in , a year before he died. Harry Bickerton, a carpenter by trade, built the family’s original hut in Eastclf, Walton-On-The-Naze, Essex, in , and enjoyed happy days there with we Phyllis and daughter Hilary until it got swept away in a storm in the late Seventies. “There was nothing left, all the huts were lost,” she says. “There wasn’t a scrap of wood left at all, the sea claimed it all.” In , the family applied to rebuild the hut in the same spot, and Harry, then , erected it in the back garden in sections, to be taken down again and transported to the beach.  “The wood cost around £, but the labour was carried out for love. Every piece of wood inside was planed so there were no sharp corners,” smiles Hilary, . He enjoyed a year there before he died. “Last year beach huts along this stretch were selling for £, but I would not sell it for a million pounds,” she adds. “Every day we would go in the summer, the children say they would never swap our summer holidays. It was the freedom, going down in the early morning, making bacon and eggs. “Now my youngest grandchild brings their paddleboard.”  The Marshes - Southbourne It was the special place she would take her baby Hayley as a newborn and throughout her childhood. One day her little girl would become engaged within its wooden walls. And a few years on, would take her own newborn, Polly, to sleep, gurgle and crawl on the same sandy floor. Sarah Marsh, , adores the beach hut her family have rented in Southbourne, Bournemouth, since , when Hayley, now , was born. Now it holds even more layers of precious memories.  “Hayley’s husband Paddy proposed there in  as it’s Hayley’s favourite place in the world,” she says. “I used to put her down for naps there on a towel, she learnt to swim in the sea, and now she wants Polly to experience the same.” Last summer baby Polly made her first visit aged two weeks. “Our first grandchild loves the hut too,” Sarah smiles. The Coopers - Scarborough Watching families who have never even seen the sea, laugh and play in safety outside her beach hut, is the icing on the cake - or the flake in the ice-cream - for Laura Cooper. The mum-of-three, , bought her Scarborough beach hut on North Bay five years ago, after renting there for . And while long days there with her own sons are a constant pleasure, along with family get-togethers including her hen do, sharing it with others is an extra joy. For the last few years Laura, who runs Scarborough Friends of Refugees, has invited refugee families from Syria, Iran and Afghanistan to enjoy this particularly British pastime.  “It has been an enormous privilege to host beach barbecues for families who have endured the terror of war and faced persecution and atrocity throughout their childhood,” she says. “The simple joy of sharing a barbecue and facilitating play for children, some of whom are seeing the sea for the first time.

Katie Fox, , and Tony Rewcastle, , visited The Grand on New Yearaposs Eve after spotting there were rooms available for just £.The pair did not have high expectations after being left unimpressed by a visit during the summer, Katie toldYorkshire Live.But they ended up having a great time, despite only visiting as a joke, according to the holidaymaker. We noticed straight away that they had refurbished, said Katie, who then quipped: Theyaposd got a new carpet. It didnapost smell like an old personaposs home anymore.  And the pair stayed in a new, refurbished room, which Katie thought was a lot better than it was before. She admitted she was surprised to find they had the best time ever.

It was absolutely gorgeous, said Katie. She added: And there was a good atmosphere in the lobby. People were having fun they had music on, and there were kids running around with streamers and confetti.  Katie also praised the nice little touches made by staff: Theyaposd put a little chocolate bar in our room, all the hot drinks were in a bag sterilised, there was a little note saying happy new year, and they did free haggis at midnight.

I am sure there was perhaps some inspiration taken from the billboard I did, andthat is the case when Malik finds his we from it, I hope I at least get an invite to the wedding.” With Valentineaposs Day fast approaching back in , Mark had chosen to take drastic action in his hunt for a partner. He bought the m high and m wide billboard to advertise himself in Manchester city centre and had  applicants in just  hours. Speaking of the unusual stunt, Mark said he had over , requests and did eventually end up in a relationship. However, he said he didnapost find love from the ad. Now in a new relationship with someone he met in person, he admits he might approach it dferently in hindsight – especially as his new girlfriend told him she saw the ad but would never have considered applying because she thought he looked too desperate. Mark, who is the founder ofChristmastrees , said: “I don’t regret doing the billboard, but it comes with challenges and pressures that I hadn’t considered or foreseen.“The media attention and ‘going viral’ is a double-edged sword, it’s helpful for getting the word out, but on the other hand it was incredibly overwhelming. “It all became a little too much, to the point where, looking back, I probably wasn’t in the right frame of mind to be dating just after I did the billboard. “There are other pressures too, you can’t date everyone – or marry everyone, in Malik’s case – so you’re going to reject a lot of people. I was conscious of the fact that it takes courage to apply to date someone from a billboard ad, and I didn’t want anyone to come away from it feeling rejected or disappointed.  “Then there’s the other additional pressure of, whatI put up this billboard, and then I still don’t find someone ” Two years on, Mark also has some advice for what he thinks others need to do to make something like this successful. Details are very important, even down to the font. He added: “Use comic sans, it is the font of love, so I was disappointed to see that Malik hadn’t used it. “Be specic in what you are looking for. I didn’t specy my sexuality , and at one point half my applications were from men. “Have a thick skin, the internet can be a harsh place so be prepared to be called all sorts of things.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON LoveMarriageViralSexuality\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Their recommendations comes as England has reported more than three million Covid cases since December  - with more than one million logged just last week alone.The independent scientists are warning that these alarming figures are almost certainly an underestimate andmeasures were brought in last month it could have helped avert the current NHS crisis.Furthermore, ONS data published this week has revealed that an estimated .million people in the UK - or two per cent of the population - are experiencing long Covid as of December . Other worrying figures have also found that hospitalisations in children under  have trebled since the start of December.Todayaposs announcement from Sage comes as Boris Johnson also confirmed that no further lockdown restrictions would be introduced, but Plan B measures would remain in place for a further three weeks.  Five measures recommended by SAGE  Working from home where possible until the end of February Those in England who can work from home are recommended to, according to current Plan B measures that came into force on December . Plan B measures are still in place and will next be reviewed on January . Mr Johnson told MPs on Wednesday: In response to the latest data the cabinet agreed this morning that we should stick with Plan B for another three weeks with a further review before the regulations expire on  January. This means it could possibly be scrapped by the end of the monththey are not extended again.  Providing CO monitors and ensuring adequate ventilation air filtration in all classrooms This week it was reported that schools are teetering on the edge as more than a third of heads reported staff absence levels of over  per cent due to Covid on the first day of term. A snap survey by the NAHT union found the majorityhad pupils absent due to Covid, while nearly a thirdreported over  per cent of children were out of class because of the virus. In a bid to help stop the spread of Covid- in schools, the Department of Education announced plans to deliver , CO monitors to all state schools.  A poll by the NASUWT teachers union this week foundof the nearly , teachers who responded said they do not have access to a CO monitor in their classroom. From January , the government has said face coverings are recommended in schools with pupils in year  and above. It goes on to say they should be worn in most classrooms, and by pupils, students, staff and adult visitors when moving around buildings.  Revising the list of symptoms of Covid- The NHS website still lists the main symptoms of Covid as a fever, a new cough and the loss of taste or smell. The symptoms that have been associated with the Omicron iant have dfered with many reporting a runny nose, headache, fatigue, sneezing and a sore throat. Professor Tim Spector, the scientist behind symptom tracker app Zoe, described the symptoms of Omicron as being more similar to that of a common cold. This means itaposs much easier to missyouaposre infected with Omicron, with Prof. Spector warning anyone with cold-like symptoms to take a Covid test to make sure.   Requiring high-quality masks for indoor public spaces New rules brought into force last month required anyone aged  or over to wear a face mask to enter a wide range of indoor venues including public transport. FFP masks are considered to be highly-effective face coverings. Many countries in Europe, including Austria, require these specic masks to be worn in public spaces. Independent Sage is recommending the UK government follows suit and requires this specic grade of mask for indoor public spaces as well as providing them for free to households.  Adequate sick pay for those unwell with Covid- From December,  sick pay rules wee being temporarily relaxed to help free up GPs for the booster rollout, meaning workers won’t need to see their doctorthey are unwell over the Christmas period. Under previous rules, workers who are unwell need to show their employer a GP-signed sick note after seven days to receive statutory sick pay or benefit payments. However, this was relaxed to  days – meaning you won’t need proof until almost a month after you fall ill. Anyone in work who goes off sick wonapost be asked for one until after  days of sickness, which includes non-working days. However, this rule is currently in place until January , . After that, the rules willto the normal seven day period.

Warm bright colours make me feel good, that’s why I fill my house with them, especially in the winter. Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here I’m completely drawn to oranges and yellows, teak woods and bold clashing patterns and the ’s was a great era for that, I think that’s why my passion first arose. The ’s were a great era not just for interiors but also for music, fashion, furniture and architecture. I love reading books on these subjects and watching documentaries to better my knowledge of them, and that was my starting point.  I started to put together my ideas on what I wanted and also what I could do with the space I have here at home. I’m always on the lookout for inspiration. A recent documentary I watched was ‘Eames: The Architect and The Painter’ which I’d highly recommend for anyone interested in midcentury design. It’s already sparked a few new ideas for the future! And she advises checking out chain furniture shops alongside vintage and charity shops - with some of her homeware purchased from IKEA.  Also, I like to mix new with old. Quite a lot of modern retailers love to throwback to classic designs or put their modern spin on things. IKEA is great at creating mid-century replicas. Soyouaposre looking for a specic look, don’t discount modern shops you’d be surprised at what they have to offer, added Becky. Talking about how to recreate her groovy getaway, the mum of one says people shouldnapost be afraid of clashing patterns. She said: When it comes to recreating s and s interiors, I think wallpaper is the first thing to go for. I’ve changed the wallpaper in my apartment more times than I can remember- I’m a bit of a wallpaper addict. Iaposve never been shy of going for bold colours and patterns, and clashing, contrasting colours are always good when going for a ’s vibe. “Becky’s sense of style is out of this world. The level of detail is truly outstanding” says Alex Whitecroft, Head of Design atI Want Wallpaper.From her bold use of coordinated colours and bold patterns to her eye for mid-century furniture, her home showcases all of the key elements that made s interior design such a force and one that inspires even today.

Incredible pictures from Portland Bill on Dorsetaposs Jurassic Coast show the exposed clfside after the dramatic event.The break comes after recent stormy weather, with locals commenting they could see the rock beginning to crack under the pressure from the incoming winds.Strong waves whipped up by south westerly winds have crashed against the base of the clf, ultimately causing the massive block of rock to break off. Portland resident Jeffrey Webb noticed the dramatic fall walking his dog on Wednesday night.  He ed with his camera on Thursday to capture it the aftermath. The fall happened about ft from Red Crane, a fishermanaposs crane erected on a disused stone loading quay which is an ancient monument, and the whole area is popular with walkers and visitors. Marcus Dampier-Smith, who owns an old coastguard cottage on Portland Bill, said: This chunk of rock has been marked for falling for a while now.  Weaposve seen the large cracks running through it and knew it was only a matter of time. Weaposre lucky here that we have relatively little erosion in comparison to further along the Jurassic coast. But when chunks go here, they tend to go big. People love Portland Bill and walking over the rocks, but should pay attention to cracks and keep back from the edges. People do take risks. A similar rock fall happened further along the Portland coast just over a year ago and in  Pom Pom rock, an ancient rock stack on Portland that weighed hundreds of tonnes, was destroyed by high seas in a storm.  The whitbed limestone is a hard rock but has natural fissures which the weather erodes. Dane Gould, from Portland Bill Coastguard team said: The rock falls we get are not as big as some further along the coast, but they look very dramatic because the rock falls away in big chunks. This one is about  tonnes. The stone has natural fissures through it and the weather and waves have got in between the cracks and undermined it, gradually working it loose and then a big wave has got the pressure around the stone and pulled it away. A big wave can have a lot of power, people underestimate it. It could be dangerousyou walk on the wrong part, because it could fall away at any time.

Last July, George made a rare public appearance with Kate and his dad Prince William in the royal box at Wembley to watch England take on Italy in the final of the Euros. Cameras caught the young prince celebrating wildly with his parents when England went ahead early in the match.And at the end of the game, after England lost on penalties, his forlorn face summed up the heartbreak of the nation.At the game, George wore a grown-up suit that mirrored his dads, leading fans to ask why he wasnapost allowed to wear an England shirt like other youngsters of his age.Love the royals for the Mirroraposs daily newsletter to get all the latest news on the Queen, Charles, Kate, Wills, Meghan, Harry and the rest of The Firm. Click here to sign up. But according to royal author Duncan Larcombe, it was Kate who insisted on the suit - and for a very good reason.He told OK! : William was apparently keen on the idea [of wearing a football shirt], but it was Kate, the former commoner, who said no. She was showing George that being ’on duty’ requires a dferent approach… he has to learn to don the royal armour.“That doesn’t mean hiding his personality or feelings though – so George was encouraged to leap up and celebrate England scoring, to roar and wave and hug his mum and dad like any normal lad. And even to shed a tear when it all ended in heartbreak.  “George is only just beginning to understand his destiny, but Kate has got the journey planned.”Of course, George and Kateaposs other two children Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis will be gearing up for Sunday, when their mum celebrates her milestone th birthday.It is believed that Kate is in for a special day of low-key celebrations surrounded by her family and friends.But according to one royal expert, she could be in for a very big birthday party that will be thrown by the Queen herself.Royal author Ingrid Seward says she is absolutely certain that the monarch will eventually throw Kate a big birthday bash.And it could be a joint party with William, who also turns  in June after the Queenaposs Platinum Jubilee celebrations. Ingrid told True Royalty TVaposs The Royal Beat: I think it will be low key this weekend, and then later in the year - probably after the platinum jubilee celebrations are over - she and William, whose birthday is on June st, will have a joint party and really celebrate then.Iaposm absolutely certain the Queen will throw a bash for them.

As well as making sure they get the right food, plenty of exercise and lots of attention, there are also things that owners must learn to avoid getting on the wrong side of the law. While most owners know that failing to pick up their dogaposs mess while out on a walk can result in a fine, there are several lesser-known rules around walking and driving with dogs which could see even the most careful owners caught out. Here’s what every dog owner needs to know to avoid getting caught out and possibly hit with hefty fines. ID tagsThe first thing that owners need to bear in mind concernsidentity tags for dogswhen out in public.Failing to put a tag on your dog with your details on it could land you a fine, or even jail time. The Control of Dogs Order  law for England and Scotland says that a dog must wear a tag with their owner’s name and address on it. This means thatdogs are caught not wearing a proper identication tag, their owners are considered guilty of an offence against the Animal Health Act of . Owners could subsequently be hit with what was formerly a level  fine, which was capped at a maximum of £, until . However, the cap has since been scrapped, which means that anyone convicted could receive an unlimited fine or even a six-month prison sentence in the worst case scenario - although the fines handed out are likely to be much lower.  Lead walkingDog owners should also be aware of the laws in their area around letting dogs walk off lead.Although taking your dog off their lead is permitted in most UK parks, there are some spots where it’s illegal - and owners who fall foul could be fined up to £,. Local authorities can issue a Public Spaces Protection Order or Dog Control Order, which means that dogs must be kept on a lead in certain spaces - or in some cases, they prevent dogs from being allowed in the area altogether. Areas such as beaches, sport pitches and flower beds are the most common places that are off-limits to dogs, while they often have to be kept on leads near play areas and bodies of water. Owners should keep a lookout for signs in these areas alerting them to the rules concerning their dogs.  Similarly,another little-known lawabout where dogs are allowed off lead is likely to catch unaware owners out. The Road Traffic Act  says that it’s a criminal offence for a dog to be on a ‘designated road’they’re not on a lead.To help keep both dogs and drivers safe, the law requires dogs to be kept on a lead while they’re crossing a road, and also while walking on a pavement beside a busy road to prevent them from darting out into traffic.Even owners of the most well-behaved dogs could see themselves facing a staggering fine of up to £, and six months in prisontheir failure to obey the law results in a road accident, according toSelect Car Leasing . DrivingIf you are driving somewhere with your dog rather than walking them, there are yetmore rules to be aware of .Failing to make sure that your pet is properly secured in your car is a breach of the Highway Code, and could see owners hit with a fine of up to £, for careless driving. While the code isn’t specic about where dogs should be placed in the car, it’s recommended that they sit in the backseat or boot for safety reasons.Car dealer Peter Vardy also warns driversagainst letting their dog stick their head out of the window, which could be a sign that your dog isn’t secured properly in the car - as well as distracting others on the road.Although it’s not set out in law that dogs shouldn’t stick their head out of the window, drivers still risk being pulled over for ‘driving without due care and attention’, which could result in a fine and points on your licence.

Musician Feargan Lynn had a surprise on Thursday when a thin white letter popped through the letterbox with ten lines of text rather than the usual address.Sharing the hilarious moment on Twitter, Feargal gave Royal Mail a shout out, congratulating the mail deliverer for tracking him down.“Hearty applause to @RoyalMail Cushendall and Ballymena for being able to deliver this letter to me today got a much needed laugh!” he wrote. “They had a first name, the village where I grew up and half the postcode.. the rest is more like my le story!” In typical Northern Ireland fashion, likened to your mother trying to describe someone in the middle of a story, Feargal felt like he was reading his le on the page.  The full description said: “Feargal, Lives across the road from the Spar, his ma and da used to own it, his mother was Mary and Da Joseph, moved to Waterfoot after he got married, plays guitar and used to run discos in the parochial hall and the hotel in the s. “Friends with the fella runs the butchers in Waterfoot too.”Speaking toBelfast Live , the Cushendall man said he was “more than amazed at the reaction” to his post which has over K likes on Twitter so far.Feargal said: “I decided last year to write handwritten letters after a singer   songwriter friend Hannah Scott wrote a song called The Letter about keeping the art of letter writing alive. “I wrote to a friend over Christmas whom I’d known all my le from summer holidays and I didn’t put my address on the letter - this was her response. “It was like seeing my le on an envelope.” Feargal’s discos in both Waterfoot and Cushendall were attended and loved by many in the community - with the letter bringing a warming sense of nostalgia to his followers on Thursday.

Jenny Afia, speaking during a BBC podcast, said the Duchess of Sussex denied the claims but she did not want to negate anyoneaposs personal experiences. Speaking to Amol Rajan, the Schillings law firm solicitor spoke out about reports Meghanaposs behaviour had led to an internal review. Miss Afia said that the word “bullying” was a “very very damaging term … particularly for career woman.” She added the Duchess “absolutely denies” any such accusations. Miss Afia told the podcast, called Harry, Meghan and the Media: “I think the first thing is to be really clear about what bullying is because the term gets used very, very casually.“My daughter called me a bully last week when I asked her to brush her teeth – sheaposs seven years old. “So the term is used very freely and itaposs a very, very damaging term as we know, particularly I think for career women.” She was speaking on a new podcast series based off of Mr Rajan’s BBC documentary which examined the relationship between the royal family and media.  Mr Rajan’s podcast was thought to have been delayed after the documentary emerged in November. This was because of tensions of how the royals would react to the show. A two-minute trailer emerged for the podcast on BBC Sounds in November, with the first episode originally due later that month. However, the corporation decided to delay its release. Ms Afia added: “What bullying actually means is improperly using power repeatedly and deliberately to hurt someone, physically or emotionally. The Duchess of Sussex absolutely denies ever doing that. “Knowing her as I do I canapost believe she would ever do that. I wasnapost there at the time but it doesnapost match my experience of her at all and Iaposve seen her at very, very stressful times. “That story is absolutely untrue that she is a bully. That said, she wouldnapost want to negate anyoneaposs personal experiences.” Palace aides announced in March last year that they had decided to launch an internal inquiry into claims that Meghan’s behaviour drove two of her personal assistants to quit and “undermined the confidence” of a third.  This comes as the Mail on Sunday will pay only £ in damages to Meghan after it published a private letter she had sent to her father. The nominal sum confirmed that the paper, as well as its associated website MailOnline, accepted defeat in the long running case and will not be taking it to the Court of Appeal. The paper will also pay an unspecied amount of money for the separate case of infringing Meghan’sby publishing signicant parts of the letter.

Dawn Paisley Mills, a mum-of-five from Toxteth, bought a bottle of Mionetto Prosecco on a Ryanair flight from Liverpool to Faro on July , , and was shocked when she read what she thought was the price.She said the bottle, a gt for her boyfriend, should have cost €, but when she ed from her flight she noticed a charge of £ from Ryanair on her bank statement, reported the Liverpool Echo.Dawn spent the next  months sending numerous complaints and requests for a refund to Ryanair - but it turned out the £ was the cost for herflight to Manchester six days later and not the bottle of prosecco. “I don’t usually buy anything on flights but a couple sitting next to me had bought the bottle and it was quite pretty and it was tiny, said Dawn.  “So I called them over so I could buy it as a present for my boyfriend. I didn’t think anything of it. I wanted to pay with cash but they said they were only taking cards, so I put my card in and paid.“I filmed myself with the bottle of wine to put on Facebook to let my friends know that I was on the flight. I was saying ‘look, I’ve bought this wine as a gt’.“I got home five days later and went into my bank account and saw I had been charged £. I was asking my bank to get the money back and they were telling me to give them all the evidence, so I sent them all the paperwork, the pictures of me. My bank askedI had a receipt, but at some point I cleared my bag out - you’re not going to keep a receipt you think is for €.”  Dawn said she made many attempts to get a refund, but struggled to get any response from Ryanairaposs automated customer service system. She said: “When you phone them, you don’t speak to people. They’re all automated calls and every time you ring through, this call puts you onto another automated voice which brings you back to the beginning, so you don’t get to speak to anybody. “Then they tell you to go online and when you go online, they’ve got these ‘chatbots’. You’re talking to these chatbots, trying to tell them what’s happened and then the chatbot says ‘we’ve not got enough information’ and then it cuts you off.” It wasnapost until last Wednesday, January , that she actually found the truth about what had happened. Dawn explained the payment for the bottle of wine had not shown up on her bank statement, which led to her confusion - and it likely means she got the bottle for free, as the card machines on the flight had been faulty.

Jake Herbert only started x-rated account in a bid to get some extra cast but was soon earning up to £, every month with just pictures of him. The -year-old had already worked as a naked butler in Ibiza and was used to getting his kit off, and after signing up requests for content came pouring in, the Daily Star reports. OnlyFans allows content creators to share naked images and videos with their fans who pay a monthly amount to access the snaps.  Creators can also interact with their fans to get tips, make paid requests and even receive gts. The lad told the BBC : I was like, ‘Alright then, how much ’ And they actually started putting some not bad figures on.” Jake was earning between £, and £, a year for the cheeky content, but his account went viral after he got his dad involved.But, things hotted up and the money came flooding in when Jake got his dad involved. The young lad started by posting some topless photos of himself and his father after they visited the gym and it “just went mental”.  Jake added: I knew to get to the next level I’d have to do something that would really get everyone talking. At the beginning he was like, ‘How are we making so much money ’ He was getting bits of banter from where he was working and he was umming and ahhing about it, and I was like, ‘Dad, we just need to make this money. It’s not that we’re actually doing anything’. The -year-old persuaded his dad to get on board and now makes up to £, a month taking his annual income up to around £,. But, he doesn’t vy up the cash equally and instead gives his dad the odd £.  He noted: I know I should [pay him more], but I started the thing. It’s my page and I built it up. Jake claims he doesn’t care what people think about his posts because he knew it would lead to a big payout and get him more subscribers.

Andrew could find out on Friday whether he will face a full civil trial in New York over allegations he sexually abused Ms Giuffre in  on three occasions when she was just , claims he denies. If it gets the go-ahead and he loses, his accuser could also be awarded a settlement which legal experts predict could be as much as £million. There is a possibility Andrew could make an th hour offer of a ­signicant out of court settlement, but those with knowledge of the case have confirmed no ­discussions have taken place yet. A source said: “It is crunch time for Andrew on several fronts. “He is meeting all the costs himself so he needs to raise cash fast to pay bills which are increasing by the day. “If there was the potential to settle, well, that is an option, but it is in no doubt that the Queen would not assist him in doing so.” Senior royals including Prince Charles and Prince William were ­understood to be ­“absolutely furious” when they learned of suggestions that the monarch could be asked to settle Andrew’s bills.  A source said: “They are both of the opinion that Andrew can sort out his own mess.” The Mirror can reveal the Queen “would not assist” in any further financial settlement to Ms Giuffre over the sex allegations. Sources have revealed the Duke, who vehemently denies the claims, “wants to clear his name”, but realises a civil trial could cause catastrophic reputational damage to the monarchy. A source with knowledge of the proceedings said: ”No discussions have been had regarding a financial settlement. This is a US civil ­litigation, and given that the vast majority of US civil litigation is settled out of court, it would always remain an option on the table.”  Ms Giuffre has consistently said she wants to face the Duke in court. Andrew, , owns Chalet Helora in the ski resort of Verbier with ex-we Sarah Ferguson. It is ­understood to be his only method of raising substantial amounts of cash. The pair agreed last September to sell the seven-bedroom property to a wealthy European investor. They bought it from millionaire French socialite Isabelle de Rouvre in  for £.m. But the deal has not been completed. Sources close to the Duke suggest he wants to push the sale through “urgently”. Andrew and Fergie still owe £.million from the original purchase. Ms de Rouvre last year threatened to take them to court in Switzerland after they missed a payment date in December . The Yorks later agreed to pay the cash once they complete the sale of the property. As Andrew prepares to hear his fate Fergie, , and their ­children are this week enjoying “a final family holiday” at the chalet.  She was joined by daughters Beatrice, , and Eugenie, , and their families. One royal insider said: “It’s a stressful time for Andrew, so Sarah and the girls thought it would be best to be out of the way. They also know this will be the last time they get to enjoy the chalet so are making the most of it.” New York district judge Lewis Kaplan on Monday unsealed a  deal  between Ms Giuffre and paedophile Jeffrey Epstein, who ­trafficked her to pals for sex. It revealed the late financier had given her £, to stop her suing any future “potential defendants” linked to Epstein. Andrew’s lawyers claims he falls into that category and the case should be thrown out.

In order to ease the demand for Covid tests and critical worker shortages, the Covid test rules in England are set to be relaxed from January . Brits will now no longer need to confirm a positive lateral flow test by taking a follow-up PCR test. Lateral flow tests work dferently to PCR tests, and are used by people who donapost have symptoms of Covid-, in a bid to find those who are asymptomatic and at danger of spreading the virus. But do you know everything there is to know about them  Now experts have shared six lesser-known rules about lateral flow tests you might not know.  Rich Quelch at pharmaceutical experts Origin, has shared advice in a bid to help Brits understand the rules and regulations, Birmingham Live reports. Lateral flow tests arenapost recyclable Whether your Covid test is positive or negative, they should all be placed in the general waste bin. First place all the used items in the plastic pouch provided in the kit. The government website explains thatyou’re doing a home rapid lateral flow test, you should dispose of the used rapid lateral flow kit in your waste bin at home or at work. Used test kit items could include the:swab test strip sachet extraction tubeHowever, some of the kit package may be recyclable. Recyclable materials include:cardboard packaging cardboard tube holder paper instruction bookletDonapost reuse them Lateral flow tests canapost be reused, as they will provide inaccurate results, experts have warned. Despite there being a national shortage of lateral flow kits, Brits are discouraged from doing this. This is particularly important to rememberyouaposve received a void result, meaning there is one line next to T, and no line next to C, or no lines at all.  This means your test didnapost run correctly, but you canapost use the same one again.The NHS Inform website explained: You should take another LFD test using a new test kit – do not reuse anything from the first kit.Lateral flow tests donapost cause any risk to the brain According to health chiefs and medical experts, misinformation about lateral flow tests is re. Despite the risk of slight discomfort in your nasal passage, there is no risk to your brain when conducting a test. Posts have been shared on social media suggesting the stick goes so far back it draws samples from the blood brain barrier. A spokesperson for Public Health England told Reuters that the tests need to collect samples from the blood brain barrier is not true. It said: There is no point in the respiratory tract or nasal cavity where the brain is accessible. It would not be possible to touch the brain with a swab without drilling through the cribrorm plate. No cancer risk Along the same lines, misinformation spread on Facebook after a live video broadcast ly suggested ethylene oxide-coated swabs in lateral flow tests cause cancer.The Department for Health and Social care has addressed claims that Covid- tests pose a danger to humans. It told Reuters: Lateral flow tests have been rigorously tested and are safe to use on a regular basis. Any suggestion otherwise is inaccurate and harmful misinformation. Ethylene oxide is only used in the sterilisation of swabs and it is one of the most commonly used sterilisation tools in the healthcare industry, principally applied by manufacturers to keep medical devices safe.  Time to wait Check the waiting time in the instructions that came with your test kit, but most results should show up within half an hour. Wait for the time shown in your test kit instructions, and then read the result. If you read the result later, and a faint line appears, this could be an inaccurate result. The government explains: Do not leave it longer than the waiting time specied in the test kit instructions as this may affect the result. You must report all results The public is urged to report all results from a lateral flow test, whether itaposs positive or negative. The government asks people to report a result every time you use a rapid lateral flow test kit and as soon as possible after you get the result. You canapost report a result after more than  hours, and you can only report one result at a time.

John Brelsford embarrassed the vulnerable child at St Wilfrid’s Primary School, Sheffield, who was left “crying” after the incident.During the lesson, Mr Brelsford split his class by gender, and then asked some of the boys to switch sides to create equal teams, reports BirminghamLive. The teaching assistant then gave one of the boys a female name, and branded him a baby when he got upset. He had previously called pupils stupid and pathetic, aposscreamedand shouted at them. The then headteacher Delia Evans said: I am concerned that John doesn’t see that his conduct is unprofessional and what he is doing wrong, despite previous training and warnings. Employment Judge Chris McAvoy-Newns threw out the claim of unfair dismissal.  He added: I find that [Mr Brelsford] was dismissed for conduct and not because Mr Truby or Mrs Evans held a personal vendetta towards him. Although there are some suggestions that Mr Truby was losing patience with him a long time before January , had there been such a vendetta, I find that it is likely that they would have escalated the dismissal process much more quickly than they did. There were a signicant amount of incidents concerning [Mr Brelsford] from February . These concerned [his] behaviour towards children, in particular, the way he spoke to or interacted with them... Although none of the incidents giving rise to the disciplinary warnings were precisely the same, they all followed the same theme and concerned [Mr Brelsfordaposs] conduct with children which the [school] considered to be inappropriate.

Tyler Finnigan suffered le-changing injuries when he accidentally slipped onto the tracks at Motherwell train station in April last year. He was only  when he had to have his arm amputated after his hand was sliced off by the moving train.The teen, from Scotland, also suffered such severe head trauma that he was placed in an induced coma at Queen Elizabeth University, the Daily Record reports. Doctors put  staples into his wound and also saved his right ear by sewing it back on.  Tyler, now , has suffered severe mental health issues and has contemplated taking his own le since the accident. He is also devastated by the loss of his independence and haunted by traumatic night terrors. Dad Kevin, , is now trying to raise funds to buy him a state-of-the-art prosthetic arm to improve his quality of le. Tyler does not have enough bone in his limb to be able to use an NHS-issued prosthetic. Tyler said: I struggle with le on a daily basis. I canapost dress myself or tie my own shoelaces.  I need help getting in and out of the shower. I canapost do simple things, like cut up a potato or butter bread. The worst part is going outside because Iaposm so paranoid everyone is staring at me. I take panic attacks whenever I hear a train and I have night terrors about the accident. I feel like all my friends have abandoned me and Iaposm in constant pain. Iaposve contemplated suicide, but all I want is my independence - more independence than I have now. Getting a prosthetic arm that would help me do that, it would mean the world to me. Tyler had been looking forward to starting a mechanics course the week after his accident but his plans for the future became impossible as a result of his injuries. Kevin is desperate to help his son and is trying to raise money for an articial limb that works by recording electric signals - and they can cost up to £k. UK-based prosthetics firm Otto Bock currently offers the technology privately but the cost is priced per patient. Their articial limb, DynamicArm, is similar to others available in America made by companies such as Open Bionics and Mobius Bionics. The security guard said: Tyler has been struggling with his mental health and has been really low. It is heartbreaking for me to see him like this and feel like there is nothing I can do. A prosthetic arm that works will make a massive dference to his le. Iaposm concerned about his mental state of mind, he feels like Iaposve got to help him wash and get dressed. He gets so frustrated that he canapost put on his own shoes. Getting him this arm is so important, itaposll help him regain his independence. Iaposve been working all through Christmas to save as much as I can. Iaposve got epilepsy so Iaposm meant to be off sick as I still have seizures. But I want to see my boyaposs quality of le back again. Iaposll keep going until he gets the arm. We just need to take each day as it comes.Donations to help Tyler get the prosthetic arm can be made here. *If youaposre struggling and need to talk, the Samaritans operate a free helpline open   on  .

The final outcome of his case is not yet known, but what fascinates me is sex offender Ghislaine Maxwell ’s little black book.As our brilliant US Editor Christopher Bucktin disclosed,  Brits appear in this secret contact directory. US law officials are reviewing more than , phone numbers and dozens of email addresses in search of further evidence. There are no allegations of wrongdoing against any of those named. There’s nothing criminal about appearing in somebody’s contacts book. When I was a political correspondent, mine contained the private details of Tory MPs and ministers. That didn’t make me one of them.But there was traffic. I would call them for a story, a quote or some background information. They were in there for a reason. The FBI sees these named Brits, including some lords and ladies, merely as “potential witnesses, unless the evidence leads them ­where”.Fair enough. But what are Tony Blair, mentioned once, and  of his former Cabinet members, doing in the little black book  Why is Lord Peter Mandelson in there with “home” and “country home” phone numbers This list tells me rich, powerful and influential people, from pop stars to presidents and politicians to princes, rubbed shoulders in an international Establishment of “the beautul people”. Lawyers at Maxwell’s sex trafficking trial agreed the little black book should not be made public. Nonsense. It already has been, at a case involving Prince Andrew’s rape accuser Virginia Giuffre. Let’s open this Who’s Who of the jet set, and ask them why they were persons of interest to Maxwell and her dead lover, paedophile Jeffrey Epstein. Plan B doomed to fail The reality of the Government’s Plan B to combat surging Omicron transmission is now clear. It is an abdication of ministerial responsibility, a Do-It-Yourself strategy for the population, with these rules: Buy more masks, and wear them at all times, unless appearing on TV to save the Prime Minister’s face. Don’t go to the office, work from home, whether you get paid or not. Do get yourself vaccinated to boost the Tories’ flagging political fortunes. Don’t party with pals, except in work-related gatherings exempt from the rules, with permission from Downing Street. Travel abroad irresponsibly to facilitate the import of new virus iants. On demand, show your Covid pass to anyone in authority. These rules will be reviewed regularly to avoid a lockdown that would save lives, but upset the Covidiot wing of the Conservative Party. Any inquiries should be made to the Department of Lateral Flow Testing, Notmeguv House, Whitehall.  aposLevelling upapos So that’s what the Government means by “levelling up”. It’s about filling in potholes for former Tory peers. Viscount Pothole – I’m sorry, Gage – , got a £, grant from the Getting Building Fund to do up the driveway to his Firle Estate in East Sussex. Building back better! I hope his stately home doesn’t need redecorating because the Boris Wallpaper Finance Fund is running low.

Blue can be quite flighty so I didnapost let go of her, so didnapost put my hands out to protect my face, and my whole face went straight into the kerb.” Abbi has owned the -year-old horse for four years and has won awards in show jumping competitions with her. She never thought she would sustain such a serious injury away from the arena. Now she has been left unable to feel her forehead entirely and is waiting to see the long-term damage left by the fall. Abbi said: It was really deep. I was dying to see what it looked like properly so my mum took a picture while I was sat in AE waiting for it to be stitched up. It was a deep gash from one brow straight into the other one. It went down to my eyelid as well and I have  stitches in there. There wasnapost any surgery but they gave me anaesthetic, though I couldnapost really feel anything anyway.” It took staff around forty minutes to stitch up, and the plastic surgeon checked all of her movements. Abbi had both eyes closed for two or three days and feared her sight may never . She added: I looked like a goldfish with golf ball eyes. A few of my friends have kindly said I look like an ant too.” I still donapost have feeling in my forehead but Iaposm hoping that will come back.” After three days, one of Abbiaposs eyes finally started to go down and she was able to film some videos for her followers to explain what had happened. Now she is sharing her story to warn other horse riders to stay safe even while off their horse - urging them to wear hats even when they think they are safely on the ground. Abbi said: One eye slightly opened and thataposs how I managed to make the TikToks and explain what was going on. Itaposs had about .million views which is almost the population of Scotland.  [Medical staff] said there would be a scar and it would affect my eyebrows. That was a bit of a worry as Iaposm into my make up. Even [when Iaposm] not wearing make up Iaposm a girly girl. I might have to get my eyebrows tattooed on or draw them on every day. The chances of injury when out show-jumping were high, but I never thought it would happen now. Since her accident, Abbi has resolved to stay optimistic and still hopes to ride her beloved Blue again in the future. Abbi said: Iaposd tell people to make sure they wear the correct footwear and even a hat. A lot of people donapost put their hat on while handling their horse on the ground, you just think everything will be fine. If Iaposd worn a hat my injury wouldnapost be as bad. Iaposm hoping to get back on board, Iaposm desperate to get on.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON Horses\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

William Stewart, , and we Carol, , who were both unvaccinated, had been hospitalised after eight members of their family tested positive for Covid .The couple, from New Hampshire in the US were on le support for eight days, and two weeks, respectively, during which Mr Stewart suffered from lung, kidney and renal failures due to Covid complications.Their devastated family were initially only allowed to see them remotely using iPads but were allowed to gather around their beds, dressed head-to-toe in protective gear, as they both took their last breaths. Melissa Noke, one of the couple’s daughters, told the Boston Globe that her parents were inseparable and the true definition of apossoul matesapos. She explained how the hospital staff wheeled her parentsapos bed into the same room so they could die together. “Placed both beds side by side, placing my mother’s hand into my father’s hand,” she told WMUR. “As soon as they touched hands, my father took his last breath, and then my mother  seconds later.” Mrs Noke said her parents first met when Mr Stewartaposs mum babysat for Carol who was just four at the time. They lost contact but reconnected as adults, and within a year fell in love and got married before going on to have three daughters Melissa, Malissa and Melinda. They have also left behind seven grandchildren.  Mrs Noke said is planning to get the Covid jab and is urging others to so the same so they don’t have to endure the pain her parents went through in their final days. She said: “I just want people to get vaccinated, because you never know what tomorrow is going to bring. We want to spread the story as much as possible about their love story, and what happened to them.  Before the couple died on December  a crowdfundraiser was launched by their nephew Tim Stewart to pay for their medical bills as they did not have health insurance.He said in a post announcing their deaths, he wrote: They fought a long and hard battle with Covid, both intubated and on le support. We never really have enough time with our loved ones.

He finally left prison this week and said he was most looking forward to a hug from his mum - as well as a corned beef sandwich. Stokesapos lawyer Michael Diamondstein said: “Today is a tremendous day. We’re all very thankful. “However, it’s also a sad day, because it reminds us of how lawless, unfair and unjust Philadelphia law enforcement was for so long.”  Shortly after Stokes was sent down, Lee was found guilty of perjury - lying in court- but, as no one informed him, Stokes was left to rot in jail. A charging document read: “Defendant said Willie Stokes told him he killed Leslie Campbell [in ]. “Defendant knew Willie Stokes had not made such a statement.” Stokes was jailed for le in  for the murder in north Philidelphia.  His mother, Gloria Williams, missed her son’s release as she was so nervous it would not happen after several setbacks over the years. Sister Renee said: “We just want him home. It’s been a long fight.” Lee has himself completed his own sentence for rape, murder and perjury and now works on an assembly line. He admitted he was ‘weak’ in accepting the bribes from the two detectives in the s, who have both since died.  Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner will make a decision on whether to retry Stokes later this month. He said: “This remarkable case is marked by prosecutorial and policing practices that were too pervasive during the so-called tough-on-crime s and s, and unfortunately persist in far too many jurisdictions today. “Prosecutors have an obligation to seek justice, and to redefine prosecutorial success — not by ‘wins’ in the form of convictions, but by accuracy and fairness in resolving criminal investigations and prosecutions.” Five other men are said to be in jail in similar circumstances to Stokes.

Itaposs no great surprise therefore that, after one forensic psychologist from the US took to Redditaposs Ask Me Anything forum, they were bombarded with questions about the more disturbing aspects of their job.Curious commenters were certainly not left disappointed, with the aposrelatively newapos professional opening up candidly about their line of work with all types of clients - including those who have committed murder. The unnamed inidual says they currently work at a conditional release program that provides therapy, case management and evaluations for those with severe mental illness.  Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. They explain these patients have previously been committed to the state hospital on account of the dangerousness of their offence and their aim is to bring them safely back into society. One of the main questions Reddit users had was whether or not people were aposevilapos by nature or because of apossociety parenting circumstancesapos. The forensic psychologist, who writes under the username u hippokuda, stated that they believe both things to be true, going on to address the dferences between psychopathy and sociopathy. They wrote: If you look at apospsychopathsapos vs apossociopathsapos thataposs an example of innate vs environment. Psychopathy is something people are born with and we can see neurological dferences that inhibit their ability to empathize with people. Whereas someone who is a apossociopathapos is not inherently born with it and behave in a way that could be a product of their environment . And you can see that they are able to empathize and have connections with people, but perhaps shaped in an antisocial lens. However, they went on to say they believe that even for the psychopaths itaposs still both, remarking that not everyone with psychopathy is a serial killer. Some of them participate in our society in socially acceptable ways . Even when you look at a lot of serial killers youaposll see that a lot of them have pretty signicant histories of trauma and abuse, they explained.For this particular forensic psychologist, the realisation that psychopathy can be found in aposeveryday peopleapos is the most interesting thing theyaposve learned so far, with the user remarking that they are always startled by just how aposnormalapos a lot of my clients present. They add that even when meeting people outside of work, they now canapost help but wonder how many gnarly people are out there that are flying under the radar.No doubt many of those whoaposve read the thread will now feel the same way.

This was devastating to my dad as my parents were best friends and started dating when they were , the man explained on Redditaposs AITA forum.I played sports and my dad was my coach so I had a much closer relationship to him then my mum. I was supposed to spend one week at my mumaposs then the next week at my dads. But I would usually just lock myself in my room at my mumaposs. Usually my dad would drop me off and I would get on my bike and ride the couple miles back to his house.  He added: My mum would ask me things and I would literally pretend like she didn’t exist. It got so bad that lawyers got involved thinking my dad was turning me against my mum. My dad encouraged me to spend time with my mum, but I couldn’t. My mum tried putting us in therapy but I would just sit there till the time was up not saying a word to her. Eventually my mum broke down and let me just live with my dad. The man hasnapost spoken to his mum since he as  and would even ask his dad to get her to leaveshe turned up to watch his games. She would try to speak to him at the end of matches and he would walk right past her without even acknowledging. I cut her whole family off besides a few of my cousins that were around my age. She showed up to my high school graduation and I asked a couple teachers to remove her and they did. She never dated anyone  to my knowledge and was still attempting to reconcile with my dad a few years before he passed, calling it the aposbiggest mistake of her leapos and begging my dad to forgive her, he continued. When my dad passed a couple years ago she tried to show up to the funeral and I met her outside to ask her to leave. My fiancée Rachel was with me when I did this and my mum cried after learning we were engaged saying she couldn’t believe I hated her still this many years later. For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here. Last week the man received a letter from his mum with a large cheque inside. In the letter she told him she couldnapost live with herself not being invited to her only sonaposs wedding and that the whole family is so upset theyaposve cut off. She also told him sheaposd been keeping tabs on him via his cousins. I ripped the cheque up and sent it back to theaddress. She shouldn’t have even known my address as I keep her blocked on all social media. I called up my cousins who admitted that since I was  they have been providing my mum with updates on me prom pics, college updates, engagement photos and they sent her my address, he continued. I was so mad that I told them they wouldn’t be invited to the wedding anymore because I don’t want my mum getting access to it. Rachel is saying I’m going too far now and uninviting my cousins along with freezing out my mumaposs whole family because of her actions is an a**hole move. The man to Reddit to question whether he was taking it too far by uninviting his cousins. Acting out as a -year-old is to be expected. Deciding not to ever forgive your mum is totally your right , one Reddit user commented. The fact that you are still throwing tantrums like a -year-old, at the age of , makes you the a**hole. Another added: Why are you punishing your mum so severely  She made an awful mistake years ago, a mistake many parents do. They have a right to their own lives and moral failings. Honestly I would encourage you to explore why you feel this hatred for your mum that seems disproportionate. Punishing your cousins for showing compassion does seem like going too far.Do you have a story to share  We want to hear all about it.

The incredible home at Down End Point, a renowned beauty spot in North Devon, would see them make a drastic jump from their busy lives in London., with daughters Nicole and Lauren. And it wasnapost any ordinary style home . The five-bedroom house includes a four-storey tower from which inhabitants can gaze across the sea. It was set to include a further four bedrooms in the main body of the house, a sauna, a cinema and a ft glass-edged infinity pool with views over Croyde Bay. Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here Like every episode of Grand Designs, this one began with a sombre Kevin McCloud wearing a hard hat on site and warning the over-eager couple that they may have overstretched themselves. But Edward confidently told the TV presenter that they would be finished in just  months, and would spend no more than £. million. However, the project ended in disaster as the couple ended up splitting, while the family were plunged into millions of pounds of debt. But now the home has finally gone on the open market - for a whopping £M after Edward Short, , has spent a decade working on Chesil Clf House in a bid to get it up to scratch. The property featured on Channel aposs Grand Designs and was described as the saddest episode ever after it aired in October . And Mr Short hasnapost held back on what it has cost him personally, as he told thelast year: There’s no point in regrets, but obviouslyI had any idea of what it would cost the marriage and my family, I wouldn’t have done it. I had started it it’s not easy to back out of this. He added: There were quite a few days where I looked temptingly at the clf edge and thought le might be better down there, but that wouldn’t have helped anyone, would it  I couldn’t give up on that image I had of [the house].”  But despite all the problems, Edward remained adamant he would finish - and now estate agent Knight Frank has now announced the sale of the main house and its annexe known as The Eye. The estate agent described it as one of the most impressive waterfront homes on the North Devon coast. It comprises of five bedrooms and bathrooms, four reception rooms, a sauna and a cellar. The property will also include the three-bedroom studio annexe known as The Eye and double garage.  A Knight Frank spokesperson added: Chesil Clf House is positioned on a three-acre site between surfers’ paradise Saunton Sands backed by the impressive UNESCO Biosphere Reserve of Braunton Burrows, and the idyllic cove of Croyde, beyond which sits National Trust-owned Baggy Point. “Not only does the property boast high design and build quality, it also has a south-facing position and an ease of access to the water with a private beach and foreshore.” Christopher Bailey, Head of National Waterfront, Knight Frank, added: “Chesil Clf House will be the most signicant coastal property to come to the open market in the West Country for many years.  “It is iconic in the true meaning of the word and there is nothing  to compare it to on the market right now. “It certainly sits at the very top of the national coastal waterfront market and I have no doubt it will attract keen interest globally.” Edward said earlier the time was right to move on. He added: I’ll always be proud to have finished this. I owe it to my family to have a real end result, but the time has come to move on. I will have achieved what I set out to do, never deviating from the plans, and for that I’ll always be proud. The house has been anchored into the bed rock of the clf, painstakingly engineered to a level that leaves no possibility for erosional hazard. Edward said he had no option but to sell it to cover the large amount of money he had to borrow. He added: These past ten years have been a marathon slog - and I have got used to being a millionaire in debt. Iaposve accepted the only way forward is to finish and sell it.

Erika McDougallaposs boy Jeremy spotted the shiny disc-shaped craft in the sky as they sat in their garden. She said: Jeremy was in the backyard with me just chatting before having a late dinner. Marisa, my daughter-in-law was inside in the kitchen. Jeremy was facing the mountain range. All of a sudden he stopped talking to me and said: aposWow look at that. What is itapos  But by the time I turned around it was gone. He described it as an amber colour light brighter than heaposd ever seen.  He said he thought at first it was a plane but too bright. It hovered for a second then took off and disappeared. By the time he finished describing it to me it appeared again. There was absolutely no noise. Once Jeremy and I saw it together he called Marisa to come outside and see it. It was pretty high up and far away, at least from our vantage point. Erika added the family watch commercial airlines fly in and out of Los Angeles airport, Calornia from their home in Corona every day - and this was something theyaposd never seen before in over  years. She added: In the second video that my son took, there was actually a large passenger plane flying underneath the UFO on its normal flight path.Heading the opposite way of the UFO. But my son zoomed in on the UFO so youaposre not able to see this aeroplane unfortunately. But you do hear me mentioning it in the video. We have seen dozens of planes daily for over  years from our backyard location, since the flight path falls against the hills in our neighbourhood.  Weaposve never seen or experienced anything like what happened. The brilliance was amazing. And it was not coming from the sun setting. It was all from the object. Erika doesnapost believe the object was a drone and added: It was way too high. We have friends that have drones. Thereaposs no way they go up that high. Plus the brightness was incredible. None of us had ever seen something that bright. It was nothing weaposd ever seen and weaposve lived in this house for  years. The strange sighting comes after the Pentagon finally admitted it probes UFO sightings after remaining silent on the issue for decades.

This has been great and much appreciated and at first I thought she was happy to help out because she expressed how much she wanted a grandchild before my son was born. For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here. Although the arrangement had been working well, the womanaposs mum has now started asking for money to babysit. She has recently said she now wants to be paid for looking after my son and is upset that we haven’t paid her at all, she continued. She did not indicate that she expected payment in the first place. The woman said that her mum pays no rent or money towards food and amenities, and has even gone on a few holidays with them as well, so she couldnapost help but be surprised when her mum brought up payment. If anything I’m more hurt that she feels this way, as my point of view us paying her feels like a transaction and not the fact that it’s her grandchild, the woman continued. I’m more than happy to pay for expenses that she might incur for looking after my son but in our case, there isnapost any because she lives with us. Butshe wants payment then I might as well take my son to a nursery when Iaposm back at work. The post sparked a debate among users as they argued who was in the wrong. Many people in the comments said her mum was unreasonable to ask for money when she lives in the house rent-free, as one person said: It seems strange that she’s asking to be paid for childcare when she’s living rent-free as a family member. Another said: Say yes - happy to pay you. At the same time, we set up the rental agreement for us housing you subsidising your living expenses and then we can knock it off what you owe us…! But others thought it was odd that she hadnapost been paying her. You assumed she was happy to do it for free infor room and board, one person wrote. Now you know this isnapost the case she will, of course, want to pay rent and you will, in turn, pay her for the childcare. While someone  said: I would pay her. It is hard looking after a -month-old all day every day. I think it is odd that you donapost. But a third person said: This type of request doesn’t come from thin air. She either feels like you’re using her and so has asked for payment to end the arrangement, or you or your [darling husband] may have accidentally insulted or offended her by mentioning the extras you do pay for. If she were truly happy with you and your family she would never have asked for money, so you do need to delve a bit deeper before having a go.Have you got a story to share We want to hear all about it.

Brooks Nader, a Sports Illustrated model living in New York, shared her bizarre experience on social media after receiving a notication on her iPhone that an unknown AirTag had been “moving with her for a while”. The notication, which popped up just after pm on Wednesday night, told her that the owner of the device could “see its location”. After checking her pockets, the -year-old realised the tracker, which was designed to locate easily mislaid items like keys, had been slipped into her coat pocket. It wasn’t until several hours after she left the New York bar that she realised it was with her. Ms Nader posted on social media after realising that whoever had planted the tracker, would have been able to follow her home. In an Instagram story, she called out Apple, asking the tech giantthey took into consideration the “danger and potentially fatal consequences this device has”.“Ladies, check your bag, coat, pockets, and surroundings,” she added. “Disturbed isn’t even the word.” In another post, she discussed the dangers of posting one’s location while out and about - something she said she learned “the hard way”. “If you’re going to post at a restaurant, drinking with your girlfriends, working out, whatever you’re doing —it has a location that’s obvious or geotagged, wait until you leave to post it,” she said. “I have made that mistake so many times and it’s very easily avoidable. Just wait until you’re home or you’re walking home or whatever until you post that.”The model told Mail Online that her coat had been sitting on the barstool at the Odeon in TriBeCa, which had been her first location of the night.“I went to bathroom left my coat on the chair and that’s when I think someone slipped it in,” she said. “They then followed me for five hours all the way home.” Ms Nader said she never thought anything like this could happen to her. “I hope that my story can help raise awareness and encourage ladies to look out for this notication and keep their belongings close, especially when out and about.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON AppleTribecaSports IllustratediPhone\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Keep warm and decide whether youll be able to turn back, find shelter or stay where you are and call for help.It is a good idea to let a responsible person know the details of where you are going and what you are doing.Having the right kit is essential not only to keep you warm and dry but to keep you safe. The kit you buy, and use should reflect the type of activity that you intend to do and the conditions you may face.Outdoor shops will be able to provide you with advice on what you may need. The following list details the essentials for general hillwalking:Wear well-fitting boots suitable for the terrain you will walk on and the activity you plan to do. Gaiters may be beneficial for areas that are particularly boggy or where ticks may be present.A layered system of clothing is always best as you can adjust for the temperature better. The base layer should wick away the moisture with an insulating mid-layer and a breathable waterproof jacketand trousers.A hat and gloves should be packed also. Avoid any materials that may absorb water e.g. cotton T-shirt or jeans. If possible, wear clothing, especially a waterproof jacket that is a bright colour, so that you can easily be found in the event of an emergency.Always, always have a map and compass and know how to use it. Smartphones or GPS are excellent navigation aids but should not be relied on solely. Make sure you have the right map for the area you are walking in and check that your compass is working each time before you set off.Only use a rucksack big enough for the items that you will need. You may have to keep the contents in a waterproof bagthe rucksack is not waterproof..removeA whistle, head torch , survival bag, group shelter, first aid kit and mobile phone are essential.

It#s estimated that  million plant pots and seed trays are sold every year and the majority are sent to landfill or are incinerated.But there are non-plastic alternatives such as biodegradable pots made using materials like coir, wood chips, bamboo and rice husks.A growing number of garden centres and nurseries use biodegradable pots, but it#s worth checking out their sustainability policies.You can also make your own pots using newspaper or toilet roll tubes.And now is a good time to make your own supplies of biodegradable pots so you have stock for the planting season in a couple of months.If you#ve got a supply of old newspapers to hand, simply roll a cm-wide strip of newspaper tightly around a glass tumbler, leaving cm beyond the bottom of the glass.Fold the excess paper across the bottom, then press the glass down to flatten the pot#s base.There is no need to fix your paper pot with tape, just slide it off the glass.When ready to plant, just fill with compost.Taking good care of existing plastic is a good way to ensure you don#t have to keep buying it – so reuse any plant pots you have again and again for new seedlings, cuttings and plants.If you look after your propagator trays and lids, repairing themthey crack, they will last for several seasons.You can also reuse compost bags to store compost or turn leaves into leaf mould.The added bonus of recycling or reusing items in the garden is that it also reduces cost – as does growing from seed rather than buying established plants.Even in winter, you can grow something from seed, you just need a seed tray and a window ledge, or small cold frame or greenhouse – whatever space and budgets allow.For anyone growing their own vegetables, January is great for sowing onions.If you sow onions then, it saves the expense of buying onion sets – small bulbs – later, and you can have a much larger crop of onions in the summer.Onions seeds do not have a long shelf-le, so it#s best to buy new seeds each year.Seeds will germinate between C and C, one or two weeks after sowing.When large enough to handle, transplant to inidual small pots and keep in a bright, frost-free place until April when they can be planted outside.Varieties to try include: Setton – high yield, yellow skinned and good storage potential Red Baron – a late maturing red onion with globe shaped bulbs and strong taste and Hybound – an early iety with bronze-brown skins which is excellent for long-term storage.January is often the coldest month in the garden but there are still some things you can be doing to keep busy.As the Royal Horticultural Society says, January might be the middle of winter but, as the days en, the garden starts to grow.It is a great time to plan for the coming gardening year and to order seeds and plants.Enjoy the fresh air on dry sunny days, and check your winter protection, stakes, ties and supports are still working after any severe weather.Also, put out food for birds and leave some garden areas uncut, a little longer, to provide shelter for wildle in your garden.Top three jobs this month: clean pots and greenhouses ready for spring, dig over empty or unused plots, and prune apple and pear trees."},{"url":null,"title":"argylls own natural winter wonder","story":"Hair ice is a type of ice that forms on dead wood and takes the shape of fine, silky hair.It is believed to be caused by a fungus and occurs in hard and dead wood, although the reason behind its formation remains unclear.The conditions for hair ice to occur are fairly specic, requiring just the right temperature, moisture and wood type – and it seems that the #temperate rainforest# of Argyll provides just that.Dr Phil Anderson from the Scottish Association for Marine Sciencefirst noticed hair ice when he moved to Taynuilt from Cambridge  years ago and has begun looking into the phenomenon.He said: #Hair ice is not that common butyou want to find it, Argyll is about as good a place as anywhere in the world.#I first noticed it in my garden there was this fragile bit of ice sitting in the sunshine where it shouldn#t have been. I#ve since seen it up Glen Lonan and other places locally.#I#ve worked in Antarctica and studied how snow hardens but I found hair ice formation absolutely fascinating. It#s just weird!#Dr Dorothee Gotz works at Lallemand Aquapharm, which has a lab at SAMS, and shares an interest in hair ice formation.Lallemand Aquapharm holds a culture collection that includes fungus and, as a microbiologist, Dr Gotz recognised that the fungus responsible for hair ice formation would be worth including in the collection.She said: #I saw hair ice for the first time three years ago in Sutherland#s Grove, so I took a sample to add to our collection.#It#s a fascinating bit of microbiology. A fungus that forms ice and degrades wood is certainly of interest and could potentially have industrial applications.#Both scientists are keen to find out why this phenomenon occurs but say there is very little published literature on it, perhaps because it is so rare.#We don#t know what#s in it for the fungus,# explains Dr Gotz. #It needs to expend a lot of energy to create the hair ice and there is no apparent benefit to doing this.#Water is a problem for micro-organisms when it freezes, as ice can puncture the membrane. Perhaps the fungus is trying to expel the water before it becomes a problem.#Hair ice is most likely to form on dead wood with no bark. It also forms on certain trees more than others and prefers hard woods such as birch.#As a rough guide,the gritters are out, then hair ice might be out too,# said Dr Anderson. #You’re most likely to find it on a crisp, sunny morning after a clear night.

petrol station already there and replace it with “an enhanced roadside services offer” which would be open  hours as part of the redevelopment of Monktonhall Services.A drive-thru coffee shop will also be built on the site as part of a separate plan which has received the green light from the council.The former Travelodge building has been demolished and a new hotel is no longer planned.The new development would have an increased focus on HGVs, including a standalone refuelling area for trucks and lorries comprising two pumps.There would be a secure parking and rest area for HGVs, complete with a shower and toilet block for drivers’ use.This facilities block would be formed from a former tourist information block on the site.This parking area would have space for up to  large vehicles.A new petrol filling station – including a retail kiosk and forecourt including six pumps, three jetwash bays and two air vac water bays – is a key part of the plans.Eight charging points for electric vehicles would also be created.There would also be a bin store, car and cycle parking and landscaping, and an internal road layout is planned at the site which is located at the junction of the A, Edinburgh City bypass and B.A supporting statement, issued on behalf of the company by chartered surveyors and property consultants Graham + Sibbald LLP, said: “The proposal will redevelop the established services to modernise the existing offer on-site.“The enhanced facilities are intended to react to current and predicted trends in the roadside industry such as increased demand for EV charging points and the provision of a safe place for HGV drivers to rest and refuel to support the haulage and logistics sector.“In this way, the site will develop economic resiliency and be future-proofed for these coming trends.”And it added: “The principal vehicle access to the site will remain in its current location, where vehicles access the site from the southeast corner via the internal one-way system. Site egress will remain at the roundabout to the northwest of the site.“This internal road layout will also be used by vehicles exiting from the adjacent site to the east that has recently received planning consent for a drive-thru coffee shop.”The coffee shop, with a floor area of  square metres, would provide hot food and drinks and would have drive-thru facilities, as well as outdoor and indoor seating areas, and toilets.Open seven days a week from am to pm, it is earmarked to provide employment for  to  full-time staff.Thirty-eight parking spaces, four of which would provide electric vehicle charging points, and a motorcycle parking area are planned.Graham Wilson MRICS, MFG’s property director, said: “Motor Fuel Group is excited about the proposed development of our BP station at Monktonhall.“Improved parking facilities for HGV drivers, shop and ‘food to go’ offerings for customers and the addition of an EV charging hub with eight ultra-rapid chargers will be a great asset to the local area.“As soon as final planning approval is given, we will start the redevelopment [we are] hoping to complete in .”Colin Beattie, MSP for Midlothian North and Musselburgh, said of the plans: “I welcome the proposals to replace the current facility and the job creation which comes alongside that.“We know that HGVs are vital for our supply chain and the dedicated rest space for HGV trucks in this area will assist the sector greatly in many respects.”Kenny MacAskill, MP for East Lothian, said: “The current site is looking rather dilapidated and a replacement can only be of benefit.“The jobs will be an additional benefit but hauliers and travellers will welcome it.”"},{"url":null,"title":"10-school-classrooms-go-virtual-covid-cases-rise-east-lothian","story":"Schools opened their doors following the festive break but staff shortages, due to Covid-, meant some classrooms were empty.Wallyford Primary School and Pencaitland Primary School were among schools with classes that did notin person, while a class at Ross High School ASN base was also learning remotely from home.An East Lothian Council spokesperson said: “The majority of our schools have ed to in-person teaching.“However, due to the impacts of teaching staff self-isolating, a number of pupils are temporarily learning at home.“This mainly affects children in primary school and a small number of our specialist communication bases.“All of our schools have contingency plans in place so they can make the move to remote learning quickly and are grateful for the support of their families.

It is opposed also by many who see what is happening in other countries that have previously brought in euthanasia laws, with all their supposed safeguards, who are now widening out proposals for those who might be included in categories able to access euthanasia services.The fact that some people want this service doesn’t mean we should legislate for it.My own view is that we should never legislate to say that a member of the medical profession must kill another human being, eventhat person wants it.There are those who say that many safeguards will be put in place, both for the medical profession and to protect those who may, in time, be vulnerable either to persuasion by others, directly or indirectly, to end their lives.Reading Iain Macwhirter’s article, while heis suggesting we might want to go down this road, is as good an argument as any for reasons why we absolutely should not agree to this legislation.Actions in The Netherlands, Belgium and where show that, once started, this opens the way to the “slippery slope”, as some people call it. It’s worth reading.If you want to commit suicide, so be it. If you want to use the services of Dignitas, so be it. Sad, but that is your choice.But don’t ask anyone  to do it for you, and wrap up the actions in words which pretend it is something . And don’t legislate to allow this action to be taken by the population at large.This is about killing another human being, and is not an action which you should ask anyone  to do for you, particularly in our medical profession.Councillor Eileen McCartin MBE, Scottish Liberal Democrats, Paisley.  SUFFERING IS IMMEDIATEYOUR recent coverage of the sensitive issue of assisted dying has highlighted the deeply-held views of parties on both sides of the argument. Of course there must be debate, much of which will be theoretical and none the worse for that.I write, however, with a plea that the suffering of those who genuinely wish for an end to their lives, and for whom there is no hope of recovery or effective palliative care, should be remembered at every stage of this debate.The pain, discomfort and constant nausea suffered by my mother as she died of lung cancer could not be eradicated by even the strongest medication, and even the kindest, best-informed care of the professional staff around her could not make her comfortable.The suffering of those whose illnesses are incurable is immediate, not something that can be put off until such time as a decision about assisted dying has been taken.We must of course have full and open debate on such a dficult matter, but I look forward to a decision sooner rather than later, given the extensive coverage of it as Liam McArthur’s Bill progresses through the Scottish parliament.Wendy Bellars, Pittenweem.  PROTECTION OF LOVED ONESI AM disappointed to find three articles in the Herald over the past two days, all in opposition to the provisions in MSP Liam McArthur’s Bill on Assisted Dying.I am writing for the opposite perspective, as a supporter of the Bill to give those with a terminal illness with no hope of a cure, but who are still mentally competent, a choice about the time and manner of their death.There is no evidence that the current blanket ban on assisted dying protects the vulnerable people who are the concern of some opposed to the Bill.There is, however, evidence that many people with terminal illness, like my mother with motor neurone disease, for which there is no cure, would have liked to choose the time and manner of her death without involving any of her family in an illegal act.We also know that some terminally ill Scots are being forced to travel abroad to access assisted dying. Some are suffering as they die at home, and some even feel forced to end their own lives due to a lack of choice in Scotland.Dying people do not just want this choice for themselves, but want to protect their loved ones from witnessing them suffer a bad death, the effects of which can be traumatising and long-lasting.Fiona McOwan, Limekilns, Fe.  MY CHOICES SHOULD BE RECOGNISEDGREAT strides have been made to protect the rights of the living, but those of the dying have been left behind with current laws that are inhumane and undemocratic, and abuse every citizen’s rights.I have traumatically witnessed “bad deaths” of loved ones against their confirmed wishes and as someone who lives with disabilities , my choices when dying should be recognised.It is time for Scotland to join with compassionate democracies such as New Zealand and Oregon in reforming the law to allow choice of safeguarded medical assistance in dying, for mentally competent, terminally ill adults.Liam McArthur’s proposals are about protecting and safeguarding inidual choice when nearing death, in addition to investment in excellent palliative care, not instead of it. Those opposedshould have their inidual choices safeguarded also, but should not be allowed to dictate mine or anyone ’s.Of course, safeguards are necessary – and the proposals provide robust ones. But objections on the basis of “slippery slope” or excuses that putting the work into enforcing those safeguards will take effort, is lazy, abusive law-making.Talk of “killing” and “assisted suicide” is dangerously misrepresentative. Choice of assisted dying is not about ending le, but compassionately supporting informed, veried inidual choice in ending death.To default to the current regressive laws condemns too many dying people to futilely torturous deaths, despite every palliative care possible, against their confirmed choice. The choices of the dying matter.Caroline Brocklehurst, Gfnock, Glasgow.  STARMER’S LACK OF INSPIRATIONNO -ONE wants rid of this rancid government and mess of a Prime Minister more than I do. However, Keir Starmer’s recent speech shows that he lacks political instinct.Nowhere was this more evident than when parading his patriotism, with multiple references to the Queen at a time when even hard-line royalists are questioning the use of royal fundsbeing used to shield ‘Randy Andy’, as he was playfully called by the pop press back in the day.Then there’s Starmer’s defence of Tony Blair’s knighthood. Yes, Blair has been given a free pass by the media despite the Chilcot Report, and has even been lauded for his entirely wrong advice on the vaccine world has vaccines.The media is not the people, and the people despise Blair.Yes, Starmer also had a go at the dreadful Corbyns, but he still sounds like a man looking over his shoulder for inspiration rather than looking like a leader.Amanda Baker, Edinburgh.  POWER OF ENGLISH NATIONALISMIN this brave new world we must never underestimate the power of British or English nationalism.In the s the dogmatic force of Margaret Thatcher prepared the way for a devolved Scottish Parliament.In the s the corrupt chaos of Boris Johnson will pave the way for an independent Scotland probably also the same for Wales, along with a united Ireland.In modern times, with plummeting personal polls, Boris is possibly the worst Prime Minister ever. However, like Maggie, he is a positive catalyst for Scottish independence.Tory party leaders remain opposed to devolution and continue to undermine it, even as Boris talks up his “precious” four nations.The fact is, English nationalism now controls the Tory and Labour parties as the disaster of Brexit continues to create havoc throughout the UK.Grant Frazer, Cruachan, Newtonmore."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/13356658.jpg?type=article-full","title":"new-ways-tackle-glasgows-low-recycling-rates","story":"For my building we have inidual wheelie bins, some of which are jealously guarded, and we are responsible for taking them out of the back garden to the roadside for emptying.At some point in the year we moved to an eight-day rolling rota for bin collection but a week was skipped and no one was surethis meant that the rota kept going or repeated a week.By \"no one\", I dont only mean my neighbours but also the woman who answered the phone at the council when I rang up to ask. She insisted they were emptied on a Saturday, which hasnt been the case for some time.So each week is a bit of refuse roulette. One person takes their bin out and then everyone  copies, hoping and praying that the initiator knew what they were about.I had a sneaking suspicion as to who had filled my bin upso I tried to put my bin bag in their bin. Foiled again: it was full to the brim with cardboard.You can see the neighbourhood recycling point from our bin shed. Its literally  seconds walk away. What was going on  Abject laziness  Confusion  Who doesnt understand, by now, that cardboard can and should be recycled I fished it all out from their bin and mine, broke the boxes down flat and took it to the recycling. This is who I am now. Fun at parties  You betcha, yes, sir.Online shopping cardboard made up the bulk but also food delivery boxes. Everyone everywhere seems to order these food delivery boxes now and, every seventh or fth or eighth day when the bins go out, you can bet theres cardboard boxes sitting on top of and next to the normal bins.Whats the correct etiquette for dealing with this  Other than writing a newspaper column and hoping the recycling refuseniks read it.In December, Sepa released its latest recycling figures for Scotland, which didnt make many headlines. According to the environmental agencys data, household recycling rates fell by three percentage points on the year before. Glasgow, despite the poor efforts from the folk around me, actually increased its recycling rates.Dont be too excited though the city is still the worst performing local authority on the Scottish mainland.In Glasgow, we recycled just .% of our rubbish. Over the border in East Renfrewshire that jumps to .%, which is the second highest after Angus on a whopping .%.The councils communities convenor Mark Salmond attributed Anguss success to improvements in kerbside collection and a redesign of recycling centres. \"Absolutely delighted,\" Mr Salmond said of his warm feelings towards residents efforts.Angus has invested a signicant sum in recycling facilities and introduced a raft of measures, such as its Special Waste Action Team and Community Clean Up and Fly-tipping Prevention Fund.I was reading of a council in England that sent officials to peoples doorsthey were seen to be putting the wrong rubbish in the wrong bin. It wasnt about enforcement, apparently, but just having a friendly chat and faintly shaming people into doing the right thing.In a similar yet more gentle vein, Christchurch city council, in New Zealand, launched a scheme that saw officials stick large gold stars on the wheelie bins of successful recyclers and remove bins of those who fail to recycle properly.Ideally we want reuse rates to trump recycling rates. My friend gave me my Christmas present wrapped in familiar paper. Familiar because I bought it. Last year. Hes kept it a full  months and reused it this year. Genius. Im doing the same thing but Ive made a note of who gted what so that no ones offended by it ending up back in their possession.Surely, though, its a compliment. I cared enough to buy such good quality wrapping paper that it endured a second use a year later. Ultimately, youre giving the gt of trying to save the future of humanity. Youre saying, \"I care enough about you to try to ensure a future for your children.\" And think of the money saved.Its a lot of effort, though, reusing and recycling. Reusing, particularly horribly disposable items like wrapping paper and gt bags, should be the norm with no shame in re-gting or re-wrapping,its possible, which is an excellent festive message to bear in mind for next year.Recycling, though, is a right nuisance. Washing out milk cartons and cans, collapsing boxes, getting the last of the peanut butter from the bottom of the jar.Photograph by Colin Mearns September \" alt\"HeraldScotland: Bales of crushed aluminium drinks cans at Glasgow City Council#s Blochairn recycling facility in Glasgow.Photograph by Colin Mearns September \" class\"editor-image\"Its not an enjoyable chore, and everyones busy, so the question is how to improve recycling rates. How to persuade people that peeling infinite labels from infinite bottles is worth that extra step.One way, in Glasgow, would be making recycling points more accessible. Yes, mine is mere feet away and yet people within spitting distance still cant be bothered to use it. But I also frequently see people driving up to it. If youre having to drive to get to a recycling point then its too inaccessible to be regularly, easily used.On the other hand, having recycling bins right on the doorstep creates a danger of being too accessible: ideally people should be throwing less waste away overall, sorecycling is a little bit tricky then people are more inclined to reuse.Glasgow is a patchwork of dferent recycling and refuse systems, which have been designed to deal with the iety of residences across the city, but which dont all work.My friend lives in a tenement flat in Mount Florida where he and his neighbours received a rather chiding letter telling them that the food waste bins were being removed due to the residents failure to prevent contamination in their bins.Someone stole my food waste bin off my front step years ago so its not something I think about but, now that it occurs to me, I cant remember seeing any of my neighbours putting out the little grey bins either.They definitely still exist as Im cat sitting in the west end of Glasgow at the moment and Ive just moments ago put an apple core in a food waste bin. Unless its redundant here too and Ive spent years leaving rotting food waste for the owners to find when they come home.Glasgow City Councils Resource and Recycling Strategy - reports that residents have a thirst for increased and clearer information on recycling, and the council makes a pledge in the same document to provide it. Yet its also withdrawn food waste recycling.Strong messaging to encourage behavioural change, ease of access and consistency - three vital elements to improving our dire recycling record and ensuring instead a gold star for the city entire."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/13357572.jpg?type=article-full","title":"top-six-new-fitness-crazes-2022","story":"FOR every yin there is a yang, and so it is in winter.

Since then it’s caught on across Europe, the USA and even India among people frustrated at litter strewn around parks, paths and roadsides.The idea is to pick up as you run and when you have a full bag, tie it up and leave it by a bin for council collection.Author and raconteur David Sedaris and designer Wayne Hemingway are known to combine litter picking with exercise.

It comes, however, only after millions in public funds have been spent on an ill-conceived vanity project opposed across parties and the communities most directly affected.#No-one disputes the need to modernise air traffic services, which support operations on our leline air routes. Sadly, months and millions have been wasted by SNP Ministers and HIAL on a centralisation that was never going to get off the ground.”Meanwhile, Alistair Carmichael MP said that the “costly and unnecessary” plans have ended “not with a bang but a whimper”, and called for reform of the board of HIAL to ensure the communities that the airport operator serves are heard.“Above all we need to reflect on how this sorry state of affairs came to be in the first place,” said Mr Carmichael.“Retreat on the centralisation plan is only a temporary fix of the underlying problem. HIAL is supposed to be accountable and responsive to the needs of the entire Highlands and Islands and it is clearly not living up to that aspiration.“If we are to avoid another similar fiasco in the future then we need to look at further reform to ensure that our communities are heard on the board of HIAL.”Richard Hardy, Prospect National Secretary, welcomed the announcement and said that the union and HIAL remain in “sensitive negotiations” in relation to the future delivery of air traffic services.A HIAL spokesperson said: “We have been clear that ATMS is the best option to maintain the long-term sustainability of air services for the Highlands and Islands. Nevertheless, we are committed to working with Prospect and our air traffic control colleagues to try and develop a new solution involving compromise by both sides.“We would encourage those with an interest in ensuring the delivery of a safe, resilient, and sustainable air traffic operation for island communities to recognise the delicate nature of these negotiations and engage in constructive dialogue to reach that end.” copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Dr Jaffa is essentially a spokesman and an apologist for the salmon farming industry.#It#s no coincidence that wild salmon stocks have collapsed in all areas of the northern hemisphere where open net salmon farming has developed.#Peter Cunningham, biologist with the Wester Ross Fisheries Trust, said: #It is the salmon farming industry#s inability to manage parasitic sea lice that is the major threat to wild salmon. It is a natural parasite but they multiply and become much higher in number on open cage salmon farms.#Sampling by the WRFT in the spring of  supports contention that cumulative levels of infective sea lice were again much too high between Skye and the mainland of Scotland to protect migrating post-smolt salmon within these waters in the next spring.#Salmon populations in rivers Applecross, Ling, Sheil, Glenmore, Glen Beag, Arnisdale, Broadford, Sligachan and many others around Skye are particularly vulnerable.#  "},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/258343311_483851062940065_6761478433370174788_n.jpg","title":"skyes mavis sails first tall ship at","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine, as part of the Greenock to Leith voyage last year.

A second line next to the marker T is a sign of a positive result.However, many people have reported a faint second line on their test result, while others have seen a bold line after testing positive.As part of the Executive’s efforts to reduce the transmission of the Omicron iant, the public has been encouraged to take an LFT, otherwise known as a rapid antigen test, before leaving home.New rules around those who test positive for the virus has seen the isolation period cut from  days to seven — but onlyyou test negative on day six and day seven using a LFT.Read MoreCoronavirus Northern Ireland:  deaths and , new cases reported over the New Year periodFully vaccinated close contacts must also test themselves every day during that period.As a result of the increase in demand for LFTs, there is a shortage of the home testing kits and a lack of available slots for PCR tests at Northern Ireland’s drive through sites.Queen’s University virologist Dr Connor Bamford said that no matter how faint the T line may be, you are more than likely carrying the virus, and booking a PCR is vital as it is the “gold standard” when confirming the presence of Covid-.“The LFTs measure roughly the amount of virus in the sample,” he explained. “The amount of that colour is roughly proportionate to how much virus you#ve got in that sample.“A bigger, bolder line means more virus and a fainter line might mean less virus.“However, in both cases you#re likely to be infected. If the LFTs pick up anything, you are very, very likely to be infected.“In a couple of hours it can go from very faint to very, very bold and so in both those cases you probably have enough virus to spread that on so you should be isolating and booking a PCR to confirm that.“If you#re seeing a faint band you should be treating it as positive. You are positive, you are infected, soyou can see anything on that LFT you should treat it like it is Covid and you should isolate.”Dr Bamford said LFTs tell who is most likely to be contagious and infectious and are a great tool in the fight against Covid as they are so easy to use.“LFTs are very helpful and very reliable especially looking at asymptomatic people and looking at who is more likely to be contagious,” he added.UK Government advice on LFTs states “even faint lines” shows a test is positive.“Lateral flow tests used by the UK Government go through a rigorous evaluation by the country’s leading scientists,” the official guidance says. “This means they are accurate, reliable and successfully identy those with Covid- who don’t show symptoms and could spread the virus without realising.Lateral flow tests are not being offered in isolation, but alongside a range of other measures to drive down cases and break chains of transmission.”Most ReadWatch: Stormont row erupts over UDR book in background of Jim Allister during committee meeting‘Hearty applause’ for Royal Mail after service delivers letter to Co Antrim man using just his descriptionMajor security alert takes place onboard easyJet flight at Belfast International AirportWhat does a faint line on lateral flow test mean Tributes paid to popular Co Armagh footballer Oisin Fields following sudden deathTop VideosPlayVideo: Major security alert onboard easyJet flight at Belfast International Airport PlayVideo: Man appears in court charged with murder of Aidan MannPlay Larne FC tune released as local singer out to prove it’s a ‘cracking place’ ahead of Linfield clashLatest CoronavirusMapping coronavirus in Northern Ireland: Covid cases by location and the seven-day rolling averageCovid situation is ‘dire’ in Northern Ireland schools, says teaching unionHealth trust apologises to grieving families after death certicate delays hold up funeralsFionola MeredithOpinionWho will stand up for the people who can’t wear masks Covid restrictions: Givan and O’Neill at odds over stricter enforcement of face masksLatestCarer plans -hour danceathon to Toto’s Africa in aid of food bankBarack Obama leads tributes to ‘trailblazing’ actor Sidney PoitierJudge dismisses criminal charge against ex-New York governorChester’s ‘entire future’ on line in extraordinary Covid dispute, warns chairmanDominic Cummings makes fresh claim of rule-breaking drinks in No  garden,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Specsavers is encouraging avid readers to have regular eye tests so they can continue to indulge their hobby. Presbyopia is the gradual loss of our eyes’ ability to focus close up as the lens becomes less flexible. A natural part of ageing, it usually becomes noticeable around the age of . The condition is common and typically isn’t a cause for concern.

For most people, the answer is a simple eye test which will identythey need reading glasses, multi-focal glasses or contact lenses to make words clearer – and le easier. Maeve Walsh, director at Specsavers Crescent Link in the Waterside and Ferryquay Street in the city centre, says: “It can sometimes be dficult for people to assess themselves whether they have presbyopia, which is why we always encourage regular eye tests, usually every two years. “As we age, it’s completely natural for our eyesight to worsen and it shouldn’t be something we worry about, providing our eyes are in good health. “My advice to those with presbyopia would be to carry your specs with you at all times and get into the habit of having them close by. This will help with activities like reading, and will also ensure you’re not straining your eyes, which can sometimes cause other problems.” To find out more about presbyopia, or to book an eye test visit:https:www.specsavers eye-health presbyopiaandwww.specsavers stores derryorwww.specsavers stores crescentlink Top five signs you have Presbyopia .

Reporter: Staff Reporter Dec   addthis, Lynch’s, the local family retailer which operates a number of Spar and Eurospar stores and supermarkets, have opened their third local supermarket bringing their total store number to eight across the North West and Mid Ulster. googletag.cmd.push Lynch’s Eurospar, Greysteel is the third outlet from the retailer to open under the popular Eurospar brand and has allowed management to more than double the number of jobs available, now employing  locally. Acquiring what was previously a Centra store on the site, company director Paul Lynch says the community needed a larger format supermarket brand that would not only bring a host of fresh and local produce and ranges, but would be convenient and complemented with services vital to the local area. Paul said: “We have invested around pound, to bring our supermarket experience to the Greysteel area and are so proud to open the doors. “We have more than doubled the size of the space which allows optimum navigation throughout the aisles, where shoppers will find an increased iety and range of fresh and local foods including our own meat offering and pre-packed ranges. “Importantly, we have continued the on-site partnership with Nicholl Fuels to offer locals a -hour fuel service with pre-pay pumps and we have  parking spaces to allow shoppers to conveniently load their cars safely.” The team has also retained important services including the Post Office, ATM, Lotto and PayPoint and added even more amenities and initiatives to bring value and choice to the area. The deli now serves an extended range of hot and cold food to go alongside Barista Bar coffee and Spar bakery, and shoppers can take advantage of the many deals available including the current  Deals of Christmas campaign which drops the price of big name items and festive essentials every week in the lead up to Christmas. Paul continued: “Eurospar also price matches over a thousand branded products to Tesco each week, so paired with our consistent schedule of value deals, we’re bringing a huge amount of savings for shoppers.” As is the Lynch and Eurospar ethos, the team in-store will implement outreach initiatives with the local community, sponsoring and supporting local clubs and organisations, while also fundraising for charity partner Cancer Fund for Children. Paddy Doody, sales and marketing director at Henderson Group, which owns the Eurospar brand in Northern Ireland added: “We now have  Eurospar supermarkets in Northern Ireland, each one bringing a wealth of convenience in a large format supermarket to their areas. “The Lynch’s are experienced independent retailers and know how to engage with their local communities, with an incredibly high bar set for customer service. “Its fantastic to see the Eurospar brand thriving under our independent retailers and we wish Lynch’s the best of luck with their new business.” The new supermarket in Greysteel joins Lynch’s portfolio of stores including Eurospars in the Skeoge area of Derry and Draperstown in Magherafelt, plus Spars in Dungiven, Claudy, Newbuildings and Trench Road in Co Derry, and Clonoe in Coalisland.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on. --  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnailsADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Last updated    : Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular MultimediaDerry Christmas: Christmas time Out and About around Derry pubs overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry GP, Dr Tom Black: We are in a position where we are just going to have to work our way through the next four to six weeks.Local NewsIn an exclusive interview with The Derry News, Chair of the British Medical Associations Northern Ireland Council, Dr Tom Black, says no new restrictions will stop virus figures rising over the next few weeks as Omicron iant is already baked into the system overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Thursday, th January,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The family of late Bobby Mullan have donated pound, to Altnagelvin Hospital in his memory Newsletter DerryNowAltnagelvin receives pound, donation from family of late Bobby Mullan overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  A -year-old man appeared at Derry Magistrates Court and had his sentenced deferred to June, .Local NewsMan charged with disorderly behaviour and assault following Christmas Eve incident overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Friday, th January,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Claudy Rovers were founded in .

Patrick continued: Feis means everything to me. I have spent my whole le competing. I have been on the committee for some time. Easter has always been Feis week in our family.You may have got away on Easter Sunday, but the rest of the week was Feis. My grandmother sang in a choir at the first Feis, and my grandfather was on the second committee. My father competed in the Feis in the late th century and he was the official accompanist from  until he passed away . Feis is part of me. It is more dficult to sum up what it means to Derry. There is no doubt that in the early days it was the only place to express your talents, it was the only  for many but now thereare many outlets. One thing is certain that when you look at the talent that started their careers on the Feis stage such as Dana, Roma Downey, Frank Gallagher, Paul Murphy, and many more, it has done more than its fair share for this great town in taking our name abroad. In November , Derry and Strabane District Council voted unanimously to support theFeis Doire Cholmcille Committee, as theymark this incredible milestone. Commenting on the motion, Aontuacute Councillor,Emmet Doyle,said: “The Feis Doire Cholmcille has been a cultural staple throughout the last  years in this city. Going back to Tuesday, June  to Friday, June , , the first Feis which was organised in conjunction with the Gaelic League. It is steeped in history, indeed on the third day of the first competition around  participants took part. In the late s there were around , participants. “The committee that runs Feis is made up of volunteers, they put so much time and effort into this event, they are real cultural ambassadors when it comes to Gaelic culture in this city and district. “Over the hundred years of Feis Doire Cholmcille some of the best talent of this city and across the island have come through the competitions of the Feis. It is just as important to those who value gaelic culture as those who value the Jazz Festival, as Halloween, as St Patrick’s Day and should be treated as such.” DUP Alderman, Hilary McClintock, agreed the Feis is ‘an institution within this city’. Ms McClintock said: “Many young people have not only taken their first step to fame and stardom, they have developed confidence and self esteem which has stood them in good stead throughout their lives.” Sinn Fein Councillor, Emma McGinley,added: “A few of us will have our own memories of taking part in the Feis growing up. We have no doubt the centenary should be celebrated.” As part of the centenary year, the Committee are also doing a few exhibitions with pictures and memories over the  years. They wrote: To complete the set of  Feis Books for the Centenary, we are only missing the year, . Feis goers, could you please check your attics and ask your friends.It would be fantastic to have the complete  Feis.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on. --  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnailsADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Last updated    : Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular MultimediaDerry Christmas: Christmas time Out and About around Derry pubs overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry GP, Dr Tom Black: We are in a position where we are just going to have to work our way through the next four to six weeks.Local NewsIn an exclusive interview with The Derry News, Chair of the British Medical Associations Northern Ireland Council, Dr Tom Black, says no new restrictions will stop virus figures rising over the next few weeks as Omicron iant is already baked into the system overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Thursday, th January,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The family of late Bobby Mullan have donated pound, to Altnagelvin Hospital in his memory Newsletter DerryNowAltnagelvin receives pound, donation from family of late Bobby Mullan overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  A -year-old man appeared at Derry Magistrates Court and had his sentenced deferred to June, .Local NewsMan charged with disorderly behaviour and assault following Christmas Eve incident overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Friday, th January,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Claudy Rovers were founded in .

Its clothing perfectly suited to the GAA fan looking for something slightly dferent, without club crests and sponsor logos.Fergal, along with his twin brother Fergal and friend Paul Hughes – Chairman of Derrytresk– is happy with how their brand has progressed. Originally, they had planned to launch for Christmas, but a change saw them get the ball rolling in April, in time for the twins th birthday celebrations.“It gave us something to focus on and one of the jumpers has  on the back, to signy the year we were born,” Fergal told the County Derry Post.There was always an interest in designing and a clothing brand was never far from his thoughts. During his playing days, hed never be far away when new kits were being deigned. A retro jersey released as part of Slaughtneils gear range had his fingerprints on it.“We are from a farming background, it is not the sort of thing youd associate us with...getting into fashion,” Fergal jokes.“But, its always something we have been interested in. I just think a lot of the GAA gear is based on playing members and wanted to do something dferent to appeal to our non-playing members as much as players.“A lot of it will carry club badges and sponsor logos, whereas not everybody wants to wear that kind of product to go to games.”Still playing for the clubs recreational team, he coaches the U footballers and hurlers. There is a pride in pulling into Emmet Park and seeing the Gael Foacutersa range, across dferent ages and colours. Interchangeable caps. Beanies. Shorts. Sweatshirts. T-Shirts. Half-zips. From black to white and green to mango, there is something for everyone. “I am not necessarily going to pull on my club gear, but I still want to pull on something that will associate you with the GAA,” he explains of their brands unique selling point.The name – Gael Foacutersa #WeAllBelong – was spun out of that inkling he had all those years ago.“I always had it in my head, thatI ever did start up a brand, that Gael Force would be the name I would go with,” Fergal explains.“We wanted to keep the Irish slant on it as well. It is very important to the club and community.”And so, Gael Foacutersa – True Gael – was born. After some scribbling with the lettering, the logo eventually came to le by accident. “The plan was to launch it on the lead up to Christmas”, Fergal adds. “Then we thought, the idea is there and well get something out there. Me and Francis, it was our th birthday in April, wed give ourselves a date to work to, to have the product launched.“We are very thankful for the support we have got from everybody. You now notice now the orders coming in, even from other counties, so it definitely seems to be going the right way.”Nestled deep within the brand is the importance of knowing that the game is much more than being part of the squad and taking to the field. It is about identity. A sense of belonging and inclusivity. Being part of a community of like-minded people with a mutual love for traditions and heritage.“So much of our young children and adult lives have become about the constant need to train, to diet, to play, to watch, to support, to belong but ultimately to win,” Gael Foacutersa outline in the story on their website.“Gael Foacutersa is about getting away from these pressures and the responsibilities of the game.We want to take it back to the basics. It’s about the enjoyment of it all and putting smiles on peoples faces.“The Gael Foacutersa range offers high-quality, comfortable and eye-catching men’s and ladies leisurewear. It aims to reinforce the customer’s sense of identity. To be more than just about the game. It’s about being part of something bigger.” googletag.cmd.push For the full range, check out their website: www.gaelforsa.ie  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on. --  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnailsADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Last updated    : Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular MultimediaDerry Christmas: Christmas time Out and About around Derry pubs overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry GP, Dr Tom Black: We are in a position where we are just going to have to work our way through the next four to six weeks.Local NewsIn an exclusive interview with The Derry News, Chair of the British Medical Associations Northern Ireland Council, Dr Tom Black, says no new restrictions will stop virus figures rising over the next few weeks as Omicron iant is already baked into the system overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Thursday, th January,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The family of late Bobby Mullan have donated pound, to Altnagelvin Hospital in his memory Newsletter DerryNowAltnagelvin receives pound, donation from family of late Bobby Mullan overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  A -year-old man appeared at Derry Magistrates Court and had his sentenced deferred to June, .Local NewsMan charged with disorderly behaviour and assault following Christmas Eve incident overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Friday, th January,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Claudy Rovers were founded in .

Hundreds of people turned out for the first day of vaccinations at the Centre, which played an important role in the initial drive to deliver First and Second vaccinations. The Foyle Arena is now open to walk-ins and bookings from am to pm, Monday to Saturday, and am to pm on Sundays. Mayor Warke joined them to receive his booster jab, and said he was impressed by the swt organisation of the effort and the professionalism of staff on site. He said: “This is a rapidly changing situation and I am extremely impressed at how these measures have been so quickly put in place to meet demand. I want to acknowledge the work of the Western Trust staff who are doing such an amazing job in very challenging circumstances. “I also want to thank all the staff at the Foyle Arena, and previously at Templemore, who are playing a vital role in this effort. “The Trust are aiming to vaccinate  people a day at the Foyle and I would appeal to everyone attending to please follow the advice of the professionals and lets do all we can to get as many people as possible protected in the weeks ahead.” The campaign is expected to continue until January and to safely accommodate the numbers of visitors to the centre Members of Foyle Arena, there will be some minor impacts to services over the coming weeks, though most will continue as normal. This includes changes to studio class timetables, and alternative temporary arrangements are now in place for Members, with a wide range of leisure services also available across other Council owned leisure Centres. Director of Health and Community with Council, Karen McFarland added: “There has been a speedy response to the recent developments in the Covid pandemic, and we were happy to be able to step up once again to provide much needed facilities to help progress the Trusts Vaccination Campaign. “Measures have been put in place to mitigate any impacts and while most of our leisure services will continue as normal, there may be some disruption to some activities which we will communicate directly to our members. “This is a short term campaign, and I really appreciate everyones patience as we assist in getting vaccinations to those who need them. “With high volumes of people expected to attend I would appeal to people to please follow the guidance at the centre and the directions of staff – they are there to help keep things running smoothly. “The safety of our staff and the public is our first priority and I would ask for everyones cooperation over the coming weeks.” With the volume of people accessing the Foyle Arena, additional parking is available for members at Clooney Park West playing fields. To find out more about leisure services available across all Council sites, and any changes to timetables please go to: derrystrabaneleisure The Western Trust this week issued an appeal to staff to help in the escalated operation as vaccinators. People are being encouraged to use the booking system as the number of walk-ins that can be accommodated will be limited. Vaccinations are also available from GP surgeries and local pharmacists. Over s who have yet to get their first dose of the vaccination can also receive it at the vaccination centres.

These proposals are being brought forward by a new partnership between Derry-based property developer South Bank Square and housing provider Choice. The new plans include a mix of social and affordable homes ranging from one to four bedrooms, comprising a mix of terrace, detached and semi-detached houses as well as a number of bungalows and apartments aimed at those aged  and over. Proposals also include signicant areas of open space, a woodland walk, allotments, childrens play area, and a tenant hub. The project represents poundmillion of investment to the City Region, and will see the creation of approximately  new jobs over a period of eight to  years. Martin Mallon, Managing Director of South Bank Square said: “We are delighted to unveil these updated proposals for the Ballyoan site. “This new partnership with Choice Housing Association represents a signicant multi-million pound investment in the North West and will see the development of hundreds of new family homes over the next ten years. “The comprehensive planned development of this site will be key to delivering some of the thousands of new family homes that we know are very much needed in the city now and over the forthcoming years. “The new proposals will include expansive areas of open space, children’s play areas, a woodland walk, as well as proposed improvements to the local roads infrastructure. “It is fantastic to be able to announce this level of investment in our home city and we expect that this scale of investment will bring with it many job opportunities for local people and local suppliers in the North West. “Enabling works have already started on site following our planning approvals granted earlier this year and we hope to commence house building on site early in .” Michael McDonnell, CEO at Choice added: “We are thrilled to move forward with these proposals in partnership with South Bank Square. This project will unlock huge potential to create much needed, high quality social and affordable homes for a range of people in the city. “As well as relieving housing stress in the city, this project will allow young families to get on the property ladder by bringing forward a number of affordable homes, as well as offering professionally managed, exceptional private rental opportunities too. “Extensive planning has been carried out to ensure the needs of young families, disabled people, and the elderly are catered for, with plenty of green space, allotments, a play park and a tenant hub included in our ambitious plans. “We hope to be able to secure planning permission for these homes so that we can begin to deliver them as soon as possible.”   *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on. --  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnailsADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Last updated    : Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular MultimediaDerry Christmas: Christmas time Out and About around Derry pubs overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry GP, Dr Tom Black: We are in a position where we are just going to have to work our way through the next four to six weeks.Local NewsIn an exclusive interview with The Derry News, Chair of the British Medical Associations Northern Ireland Council, Dr Tom Black, says no new restrictions will stop virus figures rising over the next few weeks as Omicron iant is already baked into the system overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Thursday, th January,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The family of late Bobby Mullan have donated pound, to Altnagelvin Hospital in his memory Newsletter DerryNowAltnagelvin receives pound, donation from family of late Bobby Mullan overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  A -year-old man appeared at Derry Magistrates Court and had his sentenced deferred to June, .Local NewsMan charged with disorderly behaviour and assault following Christmas Eve incident overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Friday, th January,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Claudy Rovers were founded in .

Invest NI and the Department for the Economy , believe that Northern Ireland’s ranking in the ONS survey is not truly reflective of the level of innovation activity that is actually being delivered across the region. This could be down to the fact that many businesses simply don’t recognise what they do as innovation.  In response to the ONS, DfE launched Innovate NI in October  this is an initiative that supports local businesses to progress through a four-step innovation framework for successful innovation to create value. The initiative also provides official recognition for innovation activity, helping businesses to understand where they are in their innovation journey and recognise their innovation achievement.  As a business further develops their innovative project, they can have their activities assessed by Innovate NI. If deemed to be innovative, they receive recognition so they can clearly see the level of progress that theyre making.  Mary agrees with the need to encourage businesses to identy as innovative.  “One thing is for sure we don’t shout about our innovation achievements enough. I firmly believe the NI economy is much more innovative than the ONS survey portrays during the pandemic, we found that NI actually had a lot of innovative businesses with erse offerings and locally we showed a high level of resilience in dealing with a very signicant economic shock. “But I do think micro-businesses in particular, sometimes struggle to see themselves as being innovative and struggle to understand all the supports that are available to them. That’s why Innovate NI’s recognition scheme is so important and it is one of the reasons we decided to support the work of Innovate NI with the Economic Recovery Innovation Grant.” Economic Recovery Innovation Grant The Economic Recovery Innovation Grantis funded by the Department for the Economy’s Economic Recovery Action Plan. The grant was launched on th November and it provides small-to-medium-sized businesses, including micro- businesseswith the opportunity to apply for a grant of up to pound,.  This grant was created to help businesses progress their innovative idea - this idea must be new to the business, or the market, for example, a new product or service, or a new process within the business. The grant will help a business that is currently working on an innovative project to test and develop it, with the end goal of commercialising the product or service, or implementing the process fully in the business. The pound, can be used to fund development costs and the actual implementation of that innovative idea into the business. Businesses hoping to apply must complete Invest NI’s eligibility checker and satisfy the scheme’s eligibility criteria including being registered with HMRC and being a Northern Ireland-based SME or social enterprise.  They must also have a valid Silver Level Innovator recognition from Innovate NI. Silver Level Innovator recognition means businesses have already started to test and develop an innovative idea for their business.  Businesses can checkthey satisfy the eligibility criteria on Investni andthey do, they can submit an innovation assessment to find out their innovation level. Once issued, Invest NI will invite the eligible, Silver Level Innovator to apply for ERIG. Mary says the reason why businesses must have the Silver Level Innovator recognition to qualy for the grant, is to ensure that the grant is put to good use.  “We want local businesses to further develop innovative projects, services or processes that will enable them to grow. A business that is recognised as Silver Level has already completed the ideation and selection steps of the Innovation Framework, so we know the grant will be used to progress an idea Innovate NI has assessed as potentially innovative. “Using the grant to achieve commercialisation or implementation would then, hopefully, allow a business to progress to Gold Level Innovator status.” Innovate NI also provides help, support and signposting to ensure businesses progress through these innovation levels. This helps to avoid repeating the same step over and over again. This signposting will also help businesses know where to go for the right help. “Innovation can be something big or something minor, but it can make a major change for an SME or micro business. Just go checkyou are eligible and where you are on the Innovation Framework - it could completely change the way you do business.” The closing date to apply for the Economic Recovery Innovation Grant is pm on Monday, st January . Grants will be allocated on a first-come, first-served basis. Visit Invest NI to learn more about the grant and whether you are eligible.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on. --  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnailsADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Last updated    : Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular MultimediaDerry Christmas: Christmas time Out and About around Derry pubs overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry GP, Dr Tom Black: We are in a position where we are just going to have to work our way through the next four to six weeks.Local NewsIn an exclusive interview with The Derry News, Chair of the British Medical Associations Northern Ireland Council, Dr Tom Black, says no new restrictions will stop virus figures rising over the next few weeks as Omicron iant is already baked into the system overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Thursday, th January,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The family of late Bobby Mullan have donated pound, to Altnagelvin Hospital in his memory Newsletter DerryNowAltnagelvin receives pound, donation from family of late Bobby Mullan overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  A -year-old man appeared at Derry Magistrates Court and had his sentenced deferred to June, .Local NewsMan charged with disorderly behaviour and assault following Christmas Eve incident overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Friday, th January,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Claudy Rovers were founded in .

Neighbouring Fermanagh  Omagh had the second-highest rate of . while the lowest figure was to be found at Ards  North Down with .. The overall rate for the North stands at . cases per . people. While there are suggestions that another full-scale lockdown may be imposed by the Executive, given that the new Omicron iant of Covid has long-since embedded itself within the island of Ireland, no matter what restrictions are put in place, Dr Black – who is the Chair of the British Medical Associations Northern Ireland Council – said that rates will continue to rise over the next few weeks. He said: “It doesnt matter what restrictions we put in now because the effects of the fth wave, which is Omicron, are already baked into the system. What is going to happen over the next few weeks cannot be altered now. “ the horse has bolted. That ship has sailed. We are in a position where we are just going to have to work our way through the next four to six weeks. “This will include another two weeks of a huge infection rate, two or three weeks after that will be hospitalisations – hopefully not in large numbers and not too much pressure on Intensive Care Units. The pattern so far is that hospitalisations are not as bad as they were last January with the Delta iant.” Although the Omicron iant is generally regarded as being weaker than the Delta one that struck  months ago. Dr Black says that while young people who have been fully vaccinated maybe able to cope with it, the elderly may be more vulnerable to this iant. He added: “In September , Derry and District had the highest rate in Western Europe and we are more than four times higher than that rate now. The rates that weve seen in the past are so modest compared to what were seeing at the moment.   Figures from the Department of Health of positive Covid- cases in the North of Ireland.  “The rates at this moment are just phenomenal. You always worry about older, vulnerable people getting infected – certainly in Derry in the last week, weve seen more than five hundred patients in Derry and Strabane over sixty years old becoming infected. Across Northern Ireland that figure is more than three thousand. “Your worry from that is do those elderly and vulnerable patients end up in hospital  So far, our numbers for hospitalisations have only increased to around ten per cent in the last week or so. But we will be watching it very closely because although the Omicron iant is clearly a milder disease for younger people, we dont know yet how it will affect the elderly. “With Omicron, the factor here is how infectious is it. I think thats the major reason weve seen such a big increase. As throughout the pandemic, every time we think were successful, we become complacent and loosen up and complacency always leads to failure. “There was something about us being too complacent before Christmas in terms of bringing in enough restrictions early enough. That to some extent is the problem with a democracy. Politicians want to react to public sentiment rather than anticipate public sentiment. “You see in China, they closed down a million-person cityafter they get three positive results. WhereasBoris Johnson seems to be quite content to tolerate hundreds of thousands of infections per day because he thinks thats what the public seems to be wanting to tolerate. “Its a strange dichotomy in terms of how democracies respond to these pandemics.” The Health Service has been under considerable strain ever since the pandemic began almost two years ago. And Dr Black warns that the strain both the virus and the extra workloads it has brought upon the medical sector may well affect important services being delivered by the Health Serivice. He continued: “We worry about how the virus will affect iniduals in terms of their own health but also the effect that is happening on the Health Service with respect to the ability of staff to attend work. “The BMA mapping before Christmas suggested ten per cent of staff to be off with illness and a further ten to fteen per cent off due to isolation. Unfortunately, we seem to have been proven to have been correct. “Were seeing signicant numbers of staff missing – not just in general practice but in hospitals with nurses, doctors, paramedics and particularly in the ambulance service as well with response times from ambulances longer than we would want. “I see some of the ambulance services in the north of England were saying thatyou had a heart-attack, dont wait for an ambulance – go directly and get a lt to hospital. “Thats an extraordinary situation that were in that the virus is limiting the services for patients in other areas such as heart-attacks and strokes.” Meanwhile, the Western Trust has said it will continue with the temporary suspension of visitors to patients in hospitals, such as Altnagelvin in Derry. A short statement on the Western Trusts website read: “We would like to thank the public for their cooperation in relation to the recent changes to our visiting arrangements. Your support helps us to provide safer care for your relatives and friends who are currently in hospital. “Due to the continued pressures on our hospitals and the high level of COVID- transmission in the community, visiting remains suspended across our hospital sites and facilities. This does not apply to birthing partners, for maternity arrangements.” The Foyle Arena is serving as a mass vaccination centre. It is open between am to pm except on Friday, January  where it is open until pm. The centre is closed on Saturday, January  and Tuesday, January . Its opening hours on Wednesday, January  are pm to pm. The Shantallow Community Centre will be offering vaccinations on Tuesday, January  between pm to pm.

Neighbouring Fermanagh  Omagh had the second-highest rate of . while the lowest figure was to be found at Ards  North Down with .. The overall rate for the North stands at . cases per . people. While there are suggestions that another full-scale lockdown may be imposed by the Executive, given that the new Omicron iant of Covid has long-since embedded itself within the island of Ireland, no matter what restrictions are put in place, Dr Black – who is the Chair of the British Medical Associations Northern Ireland Council – said that rates will continue to rise over the next few weeks. He said: “It doesnt matter what restrictions we put in now because the effects of the fth wave, which is Omicron, are already baked into the system. What is going to happen over the next few weeks cannot be altered now. “ the horse has bolted. That ship has sailed. We are in a position where we are just going to have to work our way through the next four to six weeks. “This will include another two weeks of a huge infection rate, two or three weeks after that will be hospitalisations – hopefully not in large numbers and not too much pressure on Intensive Care Units. The pattern so far is that hospitalisations are not as bad as they were last January with the Delta iant.” Although the Omicron iant is generally regarded as being weaker than the Delta one that struck  months ago. Dr Black says that while young people who have been fully vaccinated maybe able to cope with it, the elderly may be more vulnerable to this iant. He added: “In September , Derry and District had the highest rate in Western Europe and we are more than four times higher than that rate now. The rates that weve seen in the past are so modest compared to what were seeing at the moment.   Figures from the Department of Health of positive Covid- cases in the North of Ireland.  “The rates at this moment are just phenomenal. You always worry about older, vulnerable people getting infected – certainly in Derry in the last week, weve seen more than five hundred patients in Derry and Strabane over sixty years old becoming infected. Across Northern Ireland that figure is more than three thousand. “Your worry from that is do those elderly and vulnerable patients end up in hospital  So far, our numbers for hospitalisations have only increased to around ten per cent in the last week or so. But we will be watching it very closely because although the Omicron iant is clearly a milder disease for younger people, we dont know yet how it will affect the elderly. “With Omicron, the factor here is how infectious is it. I think thats the major reason weve seen such a big increase. As throughout the pandemic, every time we think were successful, we become complacent and loosen up and complacency always leads to failure. “There was something about us being too complacent before Christmas in terms of bringing in enough restrictions early enough. That to some extent is the problem with a democracy. Politicians want to react to public sentiment rather than anticipate public sentiment. “You see in China, they closed down a million-person cityafter they get three positive results. WhereasBoris Johnson seems to be quite content to tolerate hundreds of thousands of infections per day because he thinks thats what the public seems to be wanting to tolerate. “Its a strange dichotomy in terms of how democracies respond to these pandemics.” The Health Service has been under considerable strain ever since the pandemic began almost two years ago. And Dr Black warns that the strain both the virus and the extra workloads it has brought upon the medical sector may well affect important services being delivered by the Health Serivice. He continued: “We worry about how the virus will affect iniduals in terms of their own health but also the effect that is happening on the Health Service with respect to the ability of staff to attend work. “The BMA mapping before Christmas suggested ten per cent of staff to be off with illness and a further ten to fteen per cent off due to isolation. Unfortunately, we seem to have been proven to have been correct. “Were seeing signicant numbers of staff missing – not just in general practice but in hospitals with nurses, doctors, paramedics and particularly in the ambulance service as well with response times from ambulances longer than we would want. “I see some of the ambulance services in the north of England were saying thatyou had a heart-attack, dont wait for an ambulance – go directly and get a lt to hospital. “Thats an extraordinary situation that were in that the virus is limiting the services for patients in other areas such as heart-attacks and strokes.” Meanwhile, the Western Trust has said it will continue with the temporary suspension of visitors to patients in hospitals, such as Altnagelvin in Derry. A short statement on the Western Trusts website read: “We would like to thank the public for their cooperation in relation to the recent changes to our visiting arrangements. Your support helps us to provide safer care for your relatives and friends who are currently in hospital. “Due to the continued pressures on our hospitals and the high level of COVID- transmission in the community, visiting remains suspended across our hospital sites and facilities. This does not apply to birthing partners, for maternity arrangements.” The Foyle Arena is serving as a mass vaccination centre. It is open between am to pm except on Friday, January  where it is open until pm. The centre is closed on Saturday, January  and Tuesday, January . Its opening hours on Wednesday, January  are pm to pm. The Shantallow Community Centre will be offering vaccinations on Tuesday, January  between pm to pm.

And a great way to make sure you’re on an even footing when it comes to motoring in  is by making some simple and easy checks around your car to confirm everything is as it should be. googletag.cmd.push But what should you be focusing on  Here, we’re going to take a look at some of the areas you might want to focus on. Interior   vw,vw,px, px\"  Don’t forget to vacuum areas in the middle of the cabin, too    Alright, so a clean interior isn’t critical to the roadworthiness of your car, but it’s a great place to start things off when it comes to checks. Plus, a tidy cabin will be far less distracting, while a lack of loose objects will ensure that nothing interferes with the major controls. So remove any items such as bottles or packets and wipe down areas such as the buttons and heating controls to ensure they’re bright and clean. A quick vacuum in the footwells can really help too. Tyres   vw,vw,px, px\"      Tyres are absolutely crucial. After all, they’re the only point of contact between your vehicle and the road so it’s paramount that they’re in good condition. First off, give the walls of the tyres an inspection are there any cracks or cuts  If so, they might need replacing. When it comes to tread, the legal minimum in Ireland is .mm. To check this, you could use an accurate tyre gauge – available to purchase from most motor factors and retailers – or a € coin. This latter method requires you torun a € coin along the centre of the wheel. If the gold part of the coin is not visible, then the tyre tread is ok. However,it is visible your tyre could be approaching the minimum legal depth so you should get them checked. You also need to check the pressure of the tyres. You’ll find the correct pressures for your vehicle either on the door sills or behind the fuel filler cap. Find this and simply inflate your tyres to the right pressure using a compressor, which are found at most petrol stations. Lights   vw,vw,px, px\"  Check that all of your lights are operating correctly   Lights are critical at this time of year. Not only are they needed to light up the road ahead, but they’re also required to make sure you’re visible to other road users. It’s why it’s a good idea to give them a check over. You can test your headlights – both dipped and full-beam – by operating them when parked close to a shiny surface, such as a garage door. When it comes to your rear lights, you could ask a friend to watch as you test them – or you can, again, reverse near to a reflective surface and operate them while looking in the rear-view mirror. Make sure you test your indicators, too – a blink that moves too quickly might mean that a bulb has blown and needs replacing. Washer fluid   vw,vw,px, px\"      You might have noticed that there’s a lot of dirt and grime on the roads at the moment and a great deal of this tends to end up on your windscreen. Because of this, it’s best to make sure that you’ve got plenty of washer fluid in your car so you can quickly and effectively clear your windscreen. On most cars, you’ll find the washer bottle under the bonnet, signied by a blue cap. Top it up to the correct level and make sure you’re using washer fluid – water on its own can freeze and cause damage to your car’s washer system. While you’re here, make sure your wipers are working effectively too –they’re making a rubbing noise or are smearing the windscreen, they’ll need replacing. Oil   vw,vw,px, px\"  Locating your car’s dipstick is a simple task. It’s usually marked out under the bonnet by a yellow cap.   While we’re under the bonnet, it’s a good idea to check your oil levels. This is easy to do, too. Simply remove the dipstickand clean it off with a rag or paper towel. Then, re-insert it back into its holder remove it again just after. Now, you’ll be able to read your car’s oil levels using the guide on the dipstick. If it’s too low, top it up via the oil filler using the correct oil for your car – you can find this in your vehicle’s handbook. Remember, only fill up in small increments and check your dipstick after each time. This helps to avoid overfilling. Windscreen   vw,vw,px, px\"  A windscreen might be requireda crack appears    Your car’s windscreen takes a real beating at this time of year, which is why there’s a greater chance of cracks or chips appearing. Take this opportunity to give your car’s windscreen an inspection to make sure that there’s nothing out of the ordinary. If you notice a small chip, then it’s a good idea to get it professionally repaired rather than leaving it to develop into a crack. This preventative repair is far cheaper than the cost of replacing an entire windscreen, after all. Remember, driving with a cracked windscreen can be deemed a motoring offenceit’s obscuring your view. If you’re stopped by police with a heavily cracked windscreen, it could lead to penalty points and a fine.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on. --  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnailsADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Last updated    : Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular MultimediaDerry Christmas: Christmas time Out and About around Derry pubs overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry GP, Dr Tom Black: We are in a position where we are just going to have to work our way through the next four to six weeks.Local NewsIn an exclusive interview with The Derry News, Chair of the British Medical Associations Northern Ireland Council, Dr Tom Black, says no new restrictions will stop virus figures rising over the next few weeks as Omicron iant is already baked into the system overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Thursday, th January,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The family of late Bobby Mullan have donated pound, to Altnagelvin Hospital in his memory Newsletter DerryNowAltnagelvin receives pound, donation from family of late Bobby Mullan overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  A -year-old man appeared at Derry Magistrates Court and had his sentenced deferred to June, .Local NewsMan charged with disorderly behaviour and assault following Christmas Eve incident overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Friday, th January,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Claudy Rovers were founded in .

And a great way to make sure you’re on an even footing when it comes to motoring in  is by making some simple and easy checks around your car to confirm everything is as it should be. googletag.cmd.push But what should you be focusing on  Here, we’re going to take a look at some of the areas you might want to focus on. Interior   vw,vw,px, px\"  Don’t forget to vacuum areas in the middle of the cabin, too    Alright, so a clean interior isn’t critical to the roadworthiness of your car, but it’s a great place to start things off when it comes to checks. Plus, a tidy cabin will be far less distracting, while a lack of loose objects will ensure that nothing interferes with the major controls. So remove any items such as bottles or packets and wipe down areas such as the buttons and heating controls to ensure they’re bright and clean. A quick vacuum in the footwells can really help too. Tyres   vw,vw,px, px\"      Tyres are absolutely crucial. After all, they’re the only point of contact between your vehicle and the road so it’s paramount that they’re in good condition. First off, give the walls of the tyres an inspection are there any cracks or cuts  If so, they might need replacing. When it comes to tread, the legal minimum in Ireland is .mm. To check this, you could use an accurate tyre gauge – available to purchase from most motor factors and retailers – or a € coin. This latter method requires you torun a € coin along the centre of the wheel. If the gold part of the coin is not visible, then the tyre tread is ok. However,it is visible your tyre could be approaching the minimum legal depth so you should get them checked. You also need to check the pressure of the tyres. You’ll find the correct pressures for your vehicle either on the door sills or behind the fuel filler cap. Find this and simply inflate your tyres to the right pressure using a compressor, which are found at most petrol stations. Lights   vw,vw,px, px\"  Check that all of your lights are operating correctly   Lights are critical at this time of year. Not only are they needed to light up the road ahead, but they’re also required to make sure you’re visible to other road users. It’s why it’s a good idea to give them a check over. You can test your headlights – both dipped and full-beam – by operating them when parked close to a shiny surface, such as a garage door. When it comes to your rear lights, you could ask a friend to watch as you test them – or you can, again, reverse near to a reflective surface and operate them while looking in the rear-view mirror. Make sure you test your indicators, too – a blink that moves too quickly might mean that a bulb has blown and needs replacing. Washer fluid   vw,vw,px, px\"      You might have noticed that there’s a lot of dirt and grime on the roads at the moment and a great deal of this tends to end up on your windscreen. Because of this, it’s best to make sure that you’ve got plenty of washer fluid in your car so you can quickly and effectively clear your windscreen. On most cars, you’ll find the washer bottle under the bonnet, signied by a blue cap. Top it up to the correct level and make sure you’re using washer fluid – water on its own can freeze and cause damage to your car’s washer system. While you’re here, make sure your wipers are working effectively too –they’re making a rubbing noise or are smearing the windscreen, they’ll need replacing. Oil   vw,vw,px, px\"  Locating your car’s dipstick is a simple task. It’s usually marked out under the bonnet by a yellow cap.   While we’re under the bonnet, it’s a good idea to check your oil levels. This is easy to do, too. Simply remove the dipstickand clean it off with a rag or paper towel. Then, re-insert it back into its holder remove it again just after. Now, you’ll be able to read your car’s oil levels using the guide on the dipstick. If it’s too low, top it up via the oil filler using the correct oil for your car – you can find this in your vehicle’s handbook.

At a media briefing, he stated there were inherent internal contradictions in the bans and said, Weve seen these before where you ban flights except for your own citizens. Is it that some passport holders will have the virus and some wont  Does the virus read your passport  Does the virus know your nationality or where youre legally resident  Our concern here is that we apply public health principles, not political principles to selecting measures that are used to control the spread of disease. He made the comments in the wake of tightening border restrictions across dozens of countries in response to the Omicron iant. WHO Director-General, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, also called on countries to take rational and proportional risk-reduction measures. He said, Blanket travel bans will not prevent the international spread of Omicron and they place a heavy burden on lives and livelihoods. Dr Ryan suggested other ways to manage risk: There are ways that you can de-risk travel in terms of having increased testing, more testing before departure, more testing on arrival, quarantine until negative testing. There is a whole series of things that can be done that will manage the risk of importation of disease or even exporting disease to another country which fall short of blanket bans. The idea that you can put a hermetic seal on most countries is just frankly not possible. We all know that, weve seen that happen before. And certainly there has to be consistency. If [the bans] are being applied, they have to be consistent.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on. --  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnailsADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Last updated    : Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular MultimediaDerry Christmas: Christmas time Out and About around Derry pubs overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry GP, Dr Tom Black: We are in a position where we are just going to have to work our way through the next four to six weeks.Local NewsIn an exclusive interview with The Derry News, Chair of the British Medical Associations Northern Ireland Council, Dr Tom Black, says no new restrictions will stop virus figures rising over the next few weeks as Omicron iant is already baked into the system overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Thursday, th January,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The family of late Bobby Mullan have donated pound, to Altnagelvin Hospital in his memory Newsletter DerryNowAltnagelvin receives pound, donation from family of late Bobby Mullan overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  A -year-old man appeared at Derry Magistrates Court and had his sentenced deferred to June, .Local NewsMan charged with disorderly behaviour and assault following Christmas Eve incident overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Friday, th January,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Claudy Rovers were founded in .

They also provide underage hurling via St Patricks, an amalgamation with their parish neighbours St Colms Drum.When Derry won the All-Ireland title in , the countys most successful era, Richard Ferris was part of the winning formula and scored a goal in their opening round against Down that season. Joe Irwin won an Ulster medal with the county and Eunan Rafferty was also on Derry teams in that era.The clubs recent underage development work has provided Michael Mullan to Derrys Ulster minor winning team of , with Tiarnaacuten McHugh, Dara and Ruairi Rafferty part of the group who repeated the feat two seasons later on their way to the All-Ireland Final.Current senior captain Tiarnaacuten Woods has represented Derry at minor and U level, with McHugh and Ruairi Rafferty – who have played senior hurling with Kevin Lynchs – having also played the wee ball game for the county.On the camogie field, Una Rafferty and Aoe Kelly have represented Derry at minor and U level respectively. It has all comeas a result of the work being done at the club.“It is great to have Richard Ferris back involved again,” Shane adds. “He has set up a winter programme in place for the players in first to fth year , with the older players getting looked after under the senior  with their strength and conditioning.”The current senior group has benefited from the influx of youth as they have one eye on the Derry IFC Quarter-Finals later this month.McGonigle paid tribute to those who have sat on club committees down through the years and it has been bolstered with new blood coming on board in recent years to help with the clubs progression. Another great development has been an influx in new coaches coming forward at primary school level. Every bit helps. Like many other clubs across Ireland, Drumsurn reaches deeper into the locality. They are more than just GAA. Its a social hub that knits everyone together, regardless of age. It offers an identity.On top of their day to day club activities and s. Fitness classes, male and female, are a valuable facet of the club, while they also host Irish dancing and bowls.The club has also recently formed a mental health committee and have put in place a full winter program to complement this initiative. There are also plans for Irish language classes. There is never a dull moment. The clubs heart beats strong.“We as a club are very community focused,” Shane stresses. “In the past year we have brought the Action Cancer big bus for two days and also provided a defibrillator in a cabinet for our communitys use.”Since moving to their current premises, Billy Doran Park, in , they have added a training pitch and a club gym.The Club Committee set out a three-phase ground development plan in . The first phase of a new kitchen plus internal and external toilet blocks was completed in  with the changing rooms refurbished in .Phase , currently going through planning, includes a walking track, new floodlights and ball-wall. It all leads into Phase , a floodlit G pitch.“Our proposed ground developments are going to cost in excess of pound,,” McGonigle points out. “For a club of less than  members, this is a massive undertaking.”Drumsurn have set themselves a target of having phases two and three complete for their Centenary Year in .“Unfortunately, as with many other aspects of le, Covid has put a stop to conventional fundraising activities for the moment,” Shane outlines. “So we decided to set up Drumsurn GAC Competitions as a way of raising some much needed funds.” For more information and details on how to enter Drumsurns competition, visit www.drumsurngaccompetitions    *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on. --  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnailsADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Last updated    : Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular MultimediaDerry Christmas: Christmas time Out and About around Derry pubs overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry GP, Dr Tom Black: We are in a position where we are just going to have to work our way through the next four to six weeks.Local NewsIn an exclusive interview with The Derry News, Chair of the British Medical Associations Northern Ireland Council, Dr Tom Black, says no new restrictions will stop virus figures rising over the next few weeks as Omicron iant is already baked into the system overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Thursday, th January,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The family of late Bobby Mullan have donated pound, to Altnagelvin Hospital in his memory Newsletter DerryNowAltnagelvin receives pound, donation from family of late Bobby Mullan overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  A -year-old man appeared at Derry Magistrates Court and had his sentenced deferred to June, .Local NewsMan charged with disorderly behaviour and assault following Christmas Eve incident overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Friday, th January,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Claudy Rovers were founded in .

We’re encouraged to make these ongoing health measures as much a part of the holiday as mulled wine and mince pies. Such steps can help protect our nearest and dearest while we’re together. The gt of protecting one another from COVID- – including the Omicron iant – is the one that truly keeps on giving. The weather outside may be “frightful” but, gathering indoors, we can still open windows to allow fresh air to disperse the virus. Embrace face coverings, there are seasonal styles aplenty to add festive flair to commuting and high street shopping trips. Every adult in the country needs to get a COVID- booster vaccine, because two doses does not give you enough protection against catching Omicron. Get your booster now at nhs.uk covidvaccination. Get Boosted Now is the national mission to build a wall of defence against the new Omicron iant. This mission is more urgent and more important than ever before because Omicron COVID- is spreading fast. Vaccines are the best way we can protect ourselves. You can get a COVID- booster  weeks after your second dose. Boosters give you the best possible protection against the virus and should signicantly reduce your risk of serious illness and hospitalisation. And, swter than shaving or applying makeup, taking rapid lateral flow tests are a quick and easy part of your getting ready routine before venturing out. If you have been in contact with someone with COVID- and are double vaccinated, you should take a daily rapid lateral flow test for seven daysyou have no symptoms. This will help slow the spread of the virus and allow you and your loved ones to continue your plans that dayyou test negative. If you are unvaccinated, you must continue to self-isolate for  daysyou are a contact of someone with COVID-. Don’t forget the NHS COVID- app is still the fastest way to knowyou’ve been exposed to someone who tested positive for COVID-, so keep it on. A very merry Christmas and a happy New Year, celebrate safely and let’s make it a good one. ‘It’s vital to ventilate’  Leeds University Professor of Environmental Engineering Catherine Noakes, pictured, said: “As Christmas is coming people will naturally be spending more time indoors – welcoming friends and family into their home and attending social events together – as the weather gets colder.While we are all looking forward to spending time with friends and family this Christmas, it’s important to remember that coronavirus is still spreading and can easily transmit in the home even when people are vaccinated.“In an enclosed space, the infectious particles hang around in the air like smoke and can build up over time, increasing the risk of other people in the room breathing in the virus, especiallythere is no ventilation or fresh air helping to refresh the air.“That’s why it’s so important to ventilate indoor spaces by opening windows, evenjust regularly for a short time. This way fresh air can disperse and blow COVID- particles away to decrease the risk of others being infected.”  Wish List  Vaccinations  All adults now need to get a booster vaccine, as two doses do not offer enough protection against the fast spreading Omicron iant. Boosters are available  weeks after second jabs. Get Boosted Now at nhs.uk covidvaccination to signicantly reduce your risk of serious illness and hospitalisation.  Taking tests  Make taking rapid lateral flow tests part of your festive preparations. Use any unused stocks of rapid lateral flow tests that you may have at homeCollect from your School Universityyou already obtain test kits from thereCollect from your local PharmacyCollect from your local Community Test sitesOrder online at gov.uk   Fresh air  Opening doors and windows for ten minutes can help you and your loved ones stay safe.  Face covering  To protect yourself and others, face coverings must be worn in shops, indoor venues and on public transport. A full list of where it is required to wear a face covering in the UK is available on gov.uk  *Sponsored Content  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on. --  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnailsADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Last updated    : Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular MultimediaDerry Christmas: Christmas time Out and About around Derry pubs overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry GP, Dr Tom Black: We are in a position where we are just going to have to work our way through the next four to six weeks.Local NewsIn an exclusive interview with The Derry News, Chair of the British Medical Associations Northern Ireland Council, Dr Tom Black, says no new restrictions will stop virus figures rising over the next few weeks as Omicron iant is already baked into the system overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Thursday, th January,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The family of late Bobby Mullan have donated pound, to Altnagelvin Hospital in his memory Newsletter DerryNowAltnagelvin receives pound, donation from family of late Bobby Mullan overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  A -year-old man appeared at Derry Magistrates Court and had his sentenced deferred to June, .Local NewsMan charged with disorderly behaviour and assault following Christmas Eve incident overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Friday, th January,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Claudy Rovers were founded in .

McDermotts calming influence helped Banagher seal a Derry intermediate title, as well as paving the way for their run to the clubs first ever Ulster hurling victory and final appearance. Pic by MT Hurson.  A tight corner back, McNicholl had a solid season, helping his team to a county final, where they hung onto Slaughtneils coattails for a signicant period. The young defender showed energy and ability in a full back line that was sorely tested against the Derry and Ulster champions in the final, but McNicholl stood up and looked the part throughout. Pic by Mary K Burke.  McCloskey sat at the heart of the Banagher defence and performed the role he has for years with his customary no-fuss and high level of effectiveness. Unerring in his defensive responsibilities and appetite for a battle, Ruairiacute Roe has relished the inidual duels with opposition attackers, as well as marshalling the defenders around him consistently. Pic by MT Hurson.  Shted around in the Ulster series, McGuigan had been a confident figure at full back, and took advantage of his man-marking role further out the field to point against Dunloy. Any attacker coming into direct opposition to McGuigan found it dficult to have a major impact on the game as he helped Slaughtneil to a ninth successive Derry title and fourth Ulster crown. Pic by Mary K Burke.  Aggressive and committed, Farren earned praise from fellow half back Mark Lynch after their county final win and was named man of the match. His intensity and industry formed a key part of a resolute Banagher defence, and he often popped up as the man who delivered the ball into the opposition half. A very solid season from the Banagher man. Pic by Mary K Burke.  Bradley has the sweepers role down to a tee and was excellent in the recent Ulster wins over Dunloy and Ballycran. His versatility is key to the Slaughtneil system, slotting seamlessly into the deep-lying role, while on occasion being pushed further up the field during games in which the Emmets look like they are in control. Pic by Mary K Burke.  Hitting - in the Ulster semi final, McGrath has added an extra dimension to his game this season and was a thorn in the side of the Dunloy system. His physicality and incessant running leaves opposition half forwards often looking over their shoulder for the burst forward, or the defence-splitting passes that feed Slaughtneils talented inside forward line. Pic by John McIlwaine.  One of two Slaughtneil men making both the football and hurling teams of the year, Rogers has been unstoppable. From rising from his sick bed to hit - against Dunloy to repeating his goal heroics in the Ulster final, his record speaks for itself. Usually stationed further forward, he is thoroughly enjoying his role in the centre of the pitch. Pic by Ramsey Cardy Sportsfile.  With a physicality and fitness that takes him up and down from the full forward line to midfield regularly, Foley drove Na Magha to within a whisker of the Ulster JHC final. His accuracy and consistency from frees gives his side the cushion of a few points heading into any game and his versatility was clear during the Ulster series of games. Pic by Seamus McQuillan Mono Pix.  Top-scoring with - in the county semi final win over Ballinascreen, Bradley was the man Lavey looked to to try and turn things around in the final defeat to Banagher, and his late free set a few St Marys hearts fluttering. He has the energy and commitment to torture the most attentive half back, while his accuracy from frees ensures any discretions are punished. Pic by Mary K Burke.  ODoherty recovered from a shoulder injury to take his place against Dunloy and Ballycran, firing over frees and moving defenders around just ashed never been away in the first place. Whether supplying quality ball from deep positions, or slotting scores at the other end, journalists are advised to bring an extra pen where ODoherty is concerned. Pic by John McIlwaine.  Lynch performed superbly in the county final win over Lavey, and was influential as Banagher dug deep in their semi final win over Swatragh. A passionate performer, his non-stop movement troubles defences and he has the composure and experience to find big scores at crucial times to help St Marys over the line. Pic by Mary K Burke.  McKeever had another good season in both club and county colours, and was arguably Derrys intercounty player of the year. He showed both the physical presence to win his own ball and a keen eye for goal. Hit a point in the county final against a strong Slaughtneil defence and can look forward to another good season for both Derry and Kevin Lynchs. Pic by Mary K Burke.  McGilligan racing off after scoring the goal that finally defeated Swatragh in the IHC semi final is an abiding image for the year. A real threat when he is moved inside, and equally when left around the middle of the field to allow his physicality and skill to win contested ball. If played at the edge of the square in their Ulster final, expect a titanic battle with Rory Porteous. Pic by Mary K Burke.  Rogers goal against Dunloy caught the eye, but the strength and composure shown by Cassidy to catch the ball, hold off Ryan Elliott and pop it to Rogers while on his knees deserves recognition. Often described as the unsung hero of the Slaughtneil attack, Cassidys industry and clever movement are the key that unlocks even the most tight defence.

Runners-up Slaughtneil have two, with Loup taking three and Lavey the remaining one. googletag.cmd.push  Bradleys error against Kilcoo stands out because it was so uncharacteristic. His metamorphosis into a championship-winning goalkeeper has been so complete that these kind of errors are rare in his game. The Watty Grahams mans accuracy and speed of thought have been crucial as his side ended a -year wait to lt the John McLaughlin Cup. Pic by Mary K Burke.  As well as getting his hands on the John McLaughlin Cup, Carville found himself sticking over a point in the Ulster championship meeting with St Eunans as the captain led from the back. His form was as inspirational as it was consistent, and he drove the high levels of commitment and determination needed to ensure Glen delivered on their promise. Pic by David Fitzgerald Sportsfile.  When Slaughtneil were all at sea in the final, Rogers stepped out of defence and swung over a point. It didnt look like being the Emmets day, butanyone was to get them going, it was going to be him. Derry GAA supporters must wish they could clone Rogers, such is his influence and ability in both codes. One of two players to make both teams of the year. Pic by Mary K Burke.  An ever-present at full back for the county champions, Dougan has been a solid presence throughout the championship campaign against some of the provinces top forwards. Like many of his Glen team mates, the full back has not looked out of place among Ulsters elite, mixing it with the best and coming out in credit to relate the tale. Pic by David Fitzgerald Sportsfile.  Doherty has had an astronomical rise since the chance to play in a MacRory final was snatched away by Covid. He was key to a fine season with Derry and a senior championship win with Glen. Now a mainstay for both club and county, Doherty is someone the opposition will actively be looking to stop when they scan the teamsheet. A remarkable season for Doherty. Pic by David Fitzgerald Sportsfile.  McFaul has had an incredible season. Stationed at centre back, he has acted as the pivot for Glen, hurting opposition teams from deep and orchestrating attacks from the number  position. Continuing the form shown for his county early in the year, he has been the driving force behind Glens final deliverance of the sought-after county title. Pic by Philip Fitzpatrick Sportsfile.  McGills scoring threat from deep positions was a mark of Laveys last few seasons. He notched a point in the quarter final win over Ballinderry and a goal in the semi final against Slaughtneil. With pace to burn, the Erins Own man has plundered opposition halves with abandon, and has the stamina and tenacity required to be just as effective in his defensive role. Pic by Mary K Burke.  That Glen laboured without him against St Eunans is a mark of how important Bradley was to their operation. On his , he bossed the game against Scotstown and was excellent all season. The Watty Grahams midfielder has put three or four solid seasons under his belt and continues to improve year on year. Pic by David Fitzgerald Sportsfile.  CDP Team of the Year : Intermediate Football  We take a look at the players who made the final XV.    Reinventing the high catch in midfield, Glass achieved this season that for which he came home from Australia. The face mask only added to the intrigue as he dominated midfields all year. He came home from Australia with a goal in mind - win the John McLaughlin Cup - and he has helped his club to that accolade with some aplomb. Pic by Philip Fitzpatrick Sportsfile.  Devlin is a constant threat in a free-scoring Loup side and took Bellaghy for three points from play in the quarter final. His link play and vision were key to his sides success as they reached the semi final of the senior championship for the second consecutive year. Devlin is one of a number of talented Loup forwards and one to continue to watch. Pic by Mary K Burke.  The position of half forward is half workhorse and half linkman, and Mulholland performs the role admirably. On hand to take a pass and carry the ball into attack, he greases the wheels of the Glen machine. With energy and precision, he also has an eye for a score, and has popped up with important ones on a number of occasions throughout the season. Pic by David Fitzgerald Sportsfile.  Another of the Loup danger men, ONeill also scored - from play against Bellaghy, and has the ability to cause problems wherever he plays. The St Patricks man is a key component of a forward line who have now had a number of years to gel and overseen a consistent improvement year-on-year in the green and white jersey. Pic by Mary K Burke.  The highlight of Tallons season was volleying the ball into the Slaughtneil net in the county final, and his vision and ability to take his opportunities has been bang on this season. With a habit of arriving on the spot at crucial times, the corner forward has crowned a number of fine seasons by getting his hands on the Derry senior county title in . Pic by Philip Fitzpatrick Sportsfile.  McGuigans name was almost enough to strike fear into opposition supporters, and although he was curtailed well in the final, the Emmets man has had another prolic season. Led the Emmets attack with endeavour and style, balancing his exertions with a fine hurling season too to finish the year with a place in the Team of the Year in both codes. Pic by Mary K Burke.  Struck an impressive - from play in the quarter final win over Bellaghy, and was consistently a lively target man in the opposition half. Had a quieter game against the Glen juggernaut in the semi final, but OKane has been the go-to man in St Patricks inside line throughout the season, with his scoring record raising eyebrows.

It is with a heavy heart that I write these words but after a committee meeting tonight the tough decision was made that the club is folding with immediate affect, they said. It just seems to be very dficult at present to get enough men to commit to a game of football on a Saturday and it has been a struggle all season to do so. The club would like to thank the efforts of everyone who has played, managed, volunteered, attended meetings, sold tickets, bought tickets, organised events, washed jerseys, sponsored the team and supported the team over the years.

Registration had opened months in advance and entries sold out in record time, a clear indication that this race has become a firm favourite for the elite and the not so elite runner.For most, it is the sense of turning up on the day not knowing what to expect. The race has two unique selling points.Firstly, you have to run with a partner and you are only ever as good as your other half.Many alliances come unstuck on the hills and in the mud and friendships are often lost, regained and lost again as the race unfolds.Secondly, and perhaps more uniquely, only a select few know the course in advance and they are sworn to secrecy.This is unusual in that most of us go to a race knowing what to expect in terms of distance, terrain and elevation: not so with this one.The only information is that it begins and ends in Castlewellan and it is between eight-and-a-half and nine miles .The course this year was a very tightly guarded secret with only those entrusted to assist with the marking on the eve of the race getting any real insight.When asked to describe the course, the Prophet simply stated: lsquoit will stun the legs and play with the headrsquo.These words rang in my head as I ran around fields that I never expected to, climbed hills that I never climbed before and at one point,my eyesight is not failing, saw Sherpa Tenzing throwing down ropes and herding a cabinet of yaks.At the business end of proceeding, there was some real class on parade with Irish mountain running sensation Zak Hannapaired with Andrew Annett , a man in great form as evidenced by his superb win in the Armagh Ten.This international pairing with real climbing pedigree firmly lived up to their billing as odds-on favourites and were almost three minutes ahead of their nearest challengers, the youthful pairing of Jared Martinand Tom Crudgington .With many years of running ahead, both these young men are capable of winning the race in the not-too-distant future.The podium was completed by the last minute pairing of Jonny Scottand Aaron McGrady , who hooked up on the morning of the event due to late withdrawals.The chemistry was clearly good and the partnership worked as they came home in just over  minutes ndash  seconds adrt of Martin and Crudgington.The ladiesrsquo race was a tighter affair with Amanda Perry and Denise Logue from Ballydrain winning by  seconds from Dearbhla Coxand Niamh Donnelly .The podium was completed by Clair Quigley and Fiona McQuillan .The mixed team event is always closely fought and this year was no dferent. With a mile to go to the finish, eventual winners Aidan Brownand Nakita Burkewere still under pressure from Stephen Connolly and Caitlyn Harvey from North Down AC.However, in the final twists and turns the former prevailed and ran out winners by around a minute, finishing eighth and tenth overall respectively.The podium was completed by Neil McGeough, Newcastlersquos rising star, and his partner, Irish Olympian Kerry OrsquoFlaherty, an athlete more at home on the track and over barriers than climbing ditches.Throughout the field there was great camaraderie and the craic was mighty. Social media was buzzing after the race with participants commenting that this was the best course they had ever ran over, despite the numerous challenges that it presented.The race organisers are indebted to everyone, too many to mention inidually, who contributed in any way to the success of the event.It brought great joy to those taking part and spectating at a time when anything that improves our well-being is something to celebrate..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5_January2022_Down.jpg","title":"McCartan hopes for dream start back at the helm  ","story":"DOWN manager James McCartan will be looking for a dream start to hisat the helm this Friday when his Mourne side take on Donegal in the first round of the Dr McKenna Cup.The red and black outfit will travel to MacCumhail Park for a .pm throw-in, in what will be the first piece of action for the county this year.The ing fan favourite will not be under any illusions as to the level of stf competition his footballers will face off against, as they travel to the home of last yearrsquos Ulster semi-finalists.Antrim are the other outfit that make up Section A, with Down welcoming the Saffrons to Newry in their second game next Tuesday.McCartan has already faced adversities in his second stint as boss before his team have even lined out, due to a number of regular Mourne players ruled out of contention.Carryduff duo James Guinness and Owen McCabe, Bryansford shot-stopper Marc Reid and experienced Burren duo Gerard McGovern and Donal OrsquoHare are among those unavailable.The former All-Star man in charge, alongside assistant Aidan OrsquoRourke, have already began drafting in suitable replacements and have recently been given a notable boost in the form of ing former captain Niall McParland.The Glenn clubman has ed following three years teaching in Doha, Qatar, and will be someone who McCartan looks to in order to bring his wealth of experience to the rest of the side ndashespecially those who are up and coming talents.ldquoThe squad has changed but itrsquos good to see some new faces in the , said McParland.ldquoJames and Aidan have a handle on everyone in the county and they have a good squad together so far.ldquoI was happy to get the call to go back because I didnrsquot knowI would get it ndash I donrsquot take anything for granted, he continued.ldquoNow Irsquom fighting for my place in the team.Alongside this encouraging news for the county, current star Barry OrsquoHagan believes Down could benefit even further from an influx of Kilcoo players.However, the current champions of Down are currently hoping to retain their Ulster title when they face off against Derrygonnelly on January , which will see them out of action until things unfold.With this meaning they will not be available for selection for the Dr McKenna Cup, this doesnrsquot necessarily rule out some of the  featuring in the Division Two league campaign.ldquoAt the minute, therersquos probably eight or nine of them you would definitely want in, said OrsquoHagan.ldquoWhether they commit or not I donrsquot know, itrsquos up to those men, but you need the talent and the experience those boys have.ldquoObviously their full focus is on Kilcoo at the minute, as yoursquod expect..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5_January2022_TableTennis.jpg","title":"Owenbeg are on title march  ","story":"IT was an early Christmas present for Owenbeg with a double win over St Johnrsquos to keep their Division One title hopes on track.The current league champions still have three outstanding matches with league leaders Banbridge, so it is still all to play for in this ision.In Division Two, Drumaness kept their title hopes alive with their win over St Johnrsquos.

He also taught commercial subjects like arithmetic and bookkeeping, for use in commerce and industry.Dr Neilson and his clergymen sons were notable for their warm cross-denominational outlook.Fr Luke Walsh, PP in North Antrim, near Ballycastle, spoke highly of his old Kilmore tutor: ldquoI was educated by a Presbyterian clergyman, a man of as great moral worth and sterling integrity as Ireland could boast of.In , as Bishop of Down and Dromore, William Crolly described Rev James Neilson of Downpatrick as ldquoone of the most liberal and respected clergymen in Co Down.Around  Moses began compiling an Irish grammar, later assisted by his son William. In their pursuit of Irish studies, the two Neilsons collaborated with Patrick Lynch, principal of a distinguished Irish and Classical academy in Loughinisland, six miles away.In March  William Neilson was installed as minister of Dundalk Presbyterian Church. This was a perfect fit for his developing academic interests. Attached to the Dundalk congregation was a colony of Gaelic-speaking Scots Presbyterians living in Ballymascanlon.Originally from Argylle, they had fought for King William in . Hence it was a standing requirement that the congregationrsquos clergy be fluent in Irish.William thrived in Dundalk. In the late s Irish was still the first language with large parts of the population in Down and Louth . He preached widely in Irish. In July  he went on a preaching tour of Ulster, achieving wide popularity.RebellionBack in Co Down, and during the  Rebellion period, his preaching activities on one occasion brought him into collision with the military authorities. His father was actually Moderator in the year of the Rising.Dr Moses needed permission from General Nugent to hold the General Synodin Lurgan that August. One Sunday in  his son William was invited back to his fatherrsquos church, to preach in Irish. The event generated considerable interest, and the church was packed.The authorities were nervous in the wake of the rebellion and news of this unusually large assembly soon reached official ears.Halfway through the sermon a party of yeomen entered the church. With no space left to seat them, they occupied the twin staircases leading up to the pulpit. When William had finished preaching they promptly arrested him, and seized theof his sermon.The soldiers involved were likely from the Kilmore Yeomanry. Their Lieutenant at the time was Charles Hamilton, William Strain of Kilmore was a sergeant, and Patrick Soy of \"Tollinagrew\" a private.They marched William all the way to Down Gaol in Downpatrick, newly opened on the Mall in  . Their arrival likely caused some consternation with the Gaol Governor, because the Neilson clergy were widely known to be loyal to the Crown.Rev William bailed by Rev JamesScrambling to smooth over this military faux pas, the Governor sent across town for James Neilson, brother of the prisoner, and minister of the nearby Stream Street Presbyterian congregation. The Rev William was then bailed into the custody of the Rev James,with instructions to appear in court next day.Next morning the magistrate encountered a dficulty mdash he couldnrsquot understand the manuscript of Williamrsquos sermon, preached in Irish the day before. William helpfully offered to translate. It transpired the contents were innocuous, and the prisoner was promptly released. The details of this intriguing episode were recorded a century later by a Neilson descendant .Academic careerIn Dundalk William ran a Classical and mercantile academy similar to his fatherrsquos. In an astonishing burst of creativity, he continued to develop his skills as a linguist.In  he published Greek exercises in syntax, ellipsis, dialects, prosody and metaphrasis. In recognition of this, Glasgow University awarded him an honorary DD in . In  he was elected Presbyterian Moderator. In  he published Introduction to the Irish language, on the basis of which he was elected MRIA in .There were a number of advantages in learning Irish, William explained. For academics, it gave essential insights into other European languages. And for the wider population, it enabled competent communication with those large sections of the population whose first language was still Irish.In contemporary Ireland, he asserted, clergymen, lawyers and farmers could not conduct their business properly without a knowledge of Irish.Paradoxically, the subjects taught in schools run by the Neilson clergy, and others, eventually undermined the use of Irish nationally. The Industrial Revolution was in full swing, and employment opportunities in industry and commerce were exploding.For those without a knowledge of English, Irish-only fluency was becoming an overwhelming disadvantage. When the new national school system was instituted in Ireland in , teachers knew that English was now the essential passport to wider employment.The great Daniel OrsquoConnell ruefully acknowledged the new reality. ldquoAlthough the language is associated with many recollections that twine round the hearts of Irishmen, yet the superior utility of the English tongue, as the medium of all modern communication is so great, that I can witness, without a sigh, the gradual disuse of Irish.At that time there were a number of ieties of Irish, but under the new dispensation the vernacular spoken in East Ulster eventually became extinct. Fortunately William Neilson preserved many Co Down examples in his  Grammar. In the words of his descendant Joseph Nelson, Williamrsquos ldquodialogues and familiar phrases, which form the second part, are a complete guide to the ideas as well as the phrases of the peasantry.Untimely deathIn  William was appointed professor of classical languages and Hebrew at the Belfast Academical Institution. In April  he was elected professor of Classics at Glasgow University. However, he had contracted rheumatic fever, and died on the th of that month, aged only . He was buried in the family vault close to the west gable of his fatherrsquos church in Rademon.A full colour pamphlet based on this article has been produced by Rowallane and Slieve Croob Community Group, to accompany Joyce Gibsonrsquos ongoing Irish language classes in Ballynahinch Market House..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5January2022_LinenHall.jpg","title":"Tributes to former chief librarian at Linen Hall Library who was also decorated Gaelic player  ","story":"A LOUGHINISLAND man who was the custodian of some of Northern Irelandrsquos most precious books and written history will be buried tomorrow.The former chief librarian of Belfastrsquos Linen Hall Library, John Killen was hailed as a ldquogentleman and friend to all after he died peacefully at his home on Sunday.A respected author, historian and former Gaelic footballer, Mr Killen was aged .He had worked at Irelandrsquos oldest and last subion library for  years and became friends with some of its most regular visitors, such as the poet Seamus Heaney, writers Sam Hanna Bell, John Hewitt, Joseph Tomelty and the artist Padraic Woods.Mr Killen retired in January , after taking up his first role as an Irish reference librarian at the Linen Hall in .He was known for continuing the work of a former colleague, Jimmy Vitty, by establishing an extensive political papers section of posters, prisonersrsquo books and records from the Maze Long Kesh.The collection houses more than , separate items and is now used by academics and students from across the world.Among the many books written by Mr Killen was the story of the  year-old library, along with the Irish Christmas Book and The Unkindest Cut: A Cartoon History of Ulster -, as well as books on the Irish famine and the United Irishmen.One of his most recent books was The St Patrickrsquos Treasury, a celebration of the myths, legends and traditions of Irelandrsquos patron saint who is buried in the grounds of Down Cathedral.Mr Killen was also highly regarded as a county hurler and Gaelic footballer who won championship medals, having played for his home club Loughinisland, Downpatrickrsquos RGU and Queenrsquos.Loughinisland GAC said on social media the club was ldquodevastated to learn of Mr Killenrsquos death who had also been a member and secretary in .He won two championship medals with the club in  and .Mr Killen, who was reared in Saul, started as a Gaelic footballer with RGU.He won several Minor championships medals for the Downpatrick side, including leading them to victory over Loughinisland in the SFC final in .Queenrsquos GAA remembered on social media how Mr Killen was a former Sigerson Cup player from - and was also part of the first All-Ireland Freshers winning team in .The Linen Hall Library shared its reaction to the sad news on social media.It said of its former head: ldquoJohn joined the Library in  and dedicated the next  years to this institution.

Yet, we still see women disproportionately under-represented in areas such as education employment and leadership. No doubt women are also disproportionately affected by austerity including the cuts to Universal Credit and cuts to public sector jobs.ldquoIt is sad that still today, women continue to face long standing structural inequalities that push more women out of employment and into a state of economic deadlock.Taking a male view point on the subject, Cllr Glyn Hanna said: ldquoI have been involved in politics for years and also have a business. I have seen on many occasions that there remain equality issues for women in work places.ldquoI have three daughters who all have professional jobs. I have been told by them of their experiences of sexual discrimination and inequality and their feelings that they have to work harder to get respect doing a job.

Forwe donrsquot work together, then nothing changes.ldquoMy programmes are embracing, not preaching. They aim to break down the dferences we have as a society by promoting better knowledge, tolerance and understanding.ldquoThe laws that govern us all, especially those written in relation to females, do definitely need to change for equality to happen.She continued: ldquoWe, as a society, also have to encourage change from the ground level up. Educating our young people and changing adult preconceived perceptions are also so important.ldquoBoys and girls, men and women. We are all iniduals who should be treated fairly and equally. By law, and by society in general.ldquoIt is therefore important to engage and stand up for change now.

The Northern Ireland Protocol has disturbed the delicate balance on which the Belfast Agreement restsThe euro became an electronic currency in  with euro cash not appearing until .A new euro design is now planned by the European Central Bank, the president of which, Christine Lagarde, has said that after twenty years “it’s time to review the look of our banknotes”.I do remember what I considered especially elegant French franc banknotes.

However, in a recent article in the Irish Independent, Christine Lagarde wrote that it has been thanks to the single currency and market that since the euro’s inception trade among the eurozone countries has seen tremendous growth.She added: “People have been able to travel without worrying about the hassle and cost of exchanging money, and millions of students and professionals are studying and working abroad without having to deal with dferent currencies.”Of course, we have been living on the island of Ireland with both the euro and pound sterling.Perhaps some businesses have found it a drawback but as an inidual who visits the Republic frequently I can’t say it has been any great trouble to me.However, I do remember, when visiting the German city of Bremen in  in an official church capacity, being invited to a reception at the Bremen chamber of commerce.I asked a couple of businessmen whether they thought the single currency was a good thing and they were emphatic that it was.Albeit as someone who is not an economist by any means, I must say that I don’t get the impression that retaining the pound has been viewed as particularly detrimental to the UK, whereas I do acknowledge that many people feel Brexit has been.Which brings me to the current Brexit protocol debate.While as a church figure it is not really for me to advocate a party political view, non-party political principles are another matter.I believe it is clear that the protocol as it stands leaves a democratic deficit in that certain regulations will be made for us by an outside party, the EU.While Stormont would periodically have the ability to ditch the whole arrangement, or to retain it, and while some consultation with the Northern Ireland Assembly might be arranged, none of this seems to me to make up for proper democratic input into regulation making. Moreover, a Stormont decision could be by simple majority as opposed to requiring cross-community consensus, a fundamental value in the Belfast Agreement.On the other hand, it can be argued that putting up with this is a price worth paying for a peaceful future.However, because of strong feelings on the sovereignty issue, the protocol arrangements could in fact end up destroying the peace rather than protecting it and a collapse of the Stormont administration would surely be in no-one’s interest.Violence is certainly not the way forward yet neither is being cavalier about the possibility that it could .The Belfast Agreement rests on a delicate balance. Disturbing that balance, as the protocol does, is hazardous.It has been surprising that some politicians both at home and abroad have seemed not alert enough to recognise that protecting the Belfast Agreement requires protecting the interests and respecting the aspirations of all parts of the community.It is clear that the negotiators are going to have to come up with some very creative answers very quickly indeed.• Canon Ian Ellis is a former editor of The Church of Ireland Gazette• Peter Robinson is recovering from an operation.

In those circumstances, it is helpful to set aside the detail and look at the facts from the perspective of centuries of wisdom.Same-sex marriage was almost unthinkable anywhere on earth  years ago, but has now been widely accepted in much of the world. That is a simple fact.But for vast numbers of people around the globe the concept of two people of the same gender being wed to each other is upsetting, often for reasons of sincerely held religious belief or for ones of deeply embedded culture and tradition.To most people it is self-evidently reasonable that the owners of a private business could politely decline to participate in providing a non essential service that seems to endorse a message so abhorrent to their values.That the rights court at Strasbourg, which has often been seen as over-stepping its authority to enforce contested notions of ‘rights’, has declined to over-rule Britain seems to be part of a trend in which it is shying away from being seen as a vehicle for advancing the sort of hyper liberal politics that many reasonable people across Europe find objectionable.——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

I need the support of the Executive to carry the checks out.“In the absence of Sinn Fein putting it on the table then the checks would stop.”Having earlier said he will bring the issue of the Protocol before the Executive by the end of the month, he today said it will in fact probably be within a week to  days.Mr Poots had come under fire throughout most of last year because the checks which have been carried out on food and farm goods entering Northern Ireland from GBwere being performed by his own staff in Belfast, Larne, Warrenpoint and Foyle, as well as Belfast International Airport.More from this reporter: Click here: Kate Hoey voices fears over influence of anti-Union ‘activism’ in NI courts and media as fresh protocol report published Click here: Jamie Bryson claims victory over Protocol: here’s precisely how the loyalist believes he has found a way out  Click here: Bryson – It’s high time unionists weaponised the law as ruthlessly as republicans——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

The volume was, Conspicuous Gallantry, Anthony Leask’s book on the service of the men and women of thBattalion of the UDR.“Workplaces should be neutral spaces,” Mr McHugh said yesterday. “Nobody should be made to feel uncomfortable in their workplace. The role and record of the UDR is one of violent state-sponsored sectarianism. Mr Allister’s prominent display of this book during a Committee meeting had the very real potential to cause offense to the many victims of this now disbanded force.”The reference work Lost Lives gives a detailed breakdown of all the murders carried out by terror groups during the troubles, as well as deaths caused by legitmately armed security forces, both north and south. It lists deaths caused by the UDR as eight while by contrast the IRA claimed  lives. The INLA claimed , UVF  and UDA .

The UDR was responsible for .% of deaths.Mr Allister said that as he was working remotely “frankly the contents of my study are none of his business”.He added: “I note, however, that a book which testies to the bravery of the security forces in facing down the threat of terrorism raises such ire from republicans simply by existing! Sinn Fein IRA are so intent on whitewashing the shameful bloody record of the Provos that they cannot so much as tolerate Mr Leask’s excellent book being in my study.“Having blocked a centenary stone, a rose bush for the centenary and a tree being planted for Her Majesty’s Jubilee Republicans now move to try to dictate the content of my study because they are so easily offended!”During the exchange, committee chairman UUP MLA Steve Aiken openly chuckled while noting that not only did he have the same book visible from his shelf during video calls, but that he had many other items relating to his service in the Royal Navy also on display from his study. He was not working remotely during the hearing.The committee clerk turned to Mr Aiken and said he was not aware of any assembly rules that would govern items in Mr Allister’s study but that he would look into it. Asked some  hours laterit had found any rules which might regulate Mr Allister on the matter, an assembly spokeswoman said: “We have no comment to make at this time.”DUP Finance Committee member Ulster Keith Buchanan has said the objection by Sinn Fein is an insight towards their true attitude towards the British identity in Northern Ireland.“Most MLAs were embarrassed,” he said of the Sinn Fein interjection. “We have serious business to do and Sinn Fein’s greatest concern is the contents of someone’s bookshelf.“Sinn Fein defends and celebrates the most heinous of murders by the PIRA yet is offended by a centenary stone, a rose bush, a Queen’s jubilee tree and now a book about the UDR. It would seem that Sinn Fein’s so-called ‘new Ireland’ will have its own banned book list. The unscripted view put forward in a Committee meeting demonstrates a lot about the true Sinn Fein attitude and towards the British identity in Northern Ireland.”MORE NEWS:NHS apologises for discriminating against Christian nurse over cross necklaceA message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

To check the ground temperature, place the back of your hand on the ground.

As you will have heard in the media, this new Omicron iant of COVID is very infectious. But it does not appear to cause serious illnessyou have been double or triple vaccinated. But frankly I am shocked how badly the biochemistry of this virus has been explained by politicians and so-called experts. As a biochemist with an international reputation please forgive meI try to explain. When you are vaccinated in the arm the main antibody generated is called IgG. This should stop serious illness. But when you get infected in the respiratory tract you also produce another type called IgA. This is secreted into the tract. Also, there is a dferent T-lymphocyte response when you are infected directly there. So, vaccination in the arm will not necessarily stop you getting COVID because your vaccination doesnt activate the IgA production sufficiently. Furthermore, for your immune system to activate against COVID, you have to produce some of the virus and its antigen. This would make you test positive by PCR, which is very sensitive, and probably by lateral flow. Thus, the problem is thatyou get COVID, even mildly, then you would have to isolate for ten days, and this would spoil Christmas again. We can’t risk this. That is why Penarth Bridge Club will close until th January . But here is an interesting hand from last week where the challenge for North South was to bid a slam. But which one – six hearts or seven clubs The AuctionSouth opened the auction with his five-card heart suit. North with fteen points knows game must be on, and maybe a slam. So, he bid two clubs. South felt his hand was strong enough now to reverse, keeping his support for clubs till a later bid. North was tempted to jump to four hearts but this might prevent them reaching a slam. So, he bid three hearts, knowing his partner would bid on after his reverse bid of two spades. Indeed, South now needed to show his support for clubs and so bid four clubs. North now bid four no trumps, Roman key card Blackwood. They were playing   so South’s response of five diamonds must show three key cards with clubs as trumps. North now could see seven clubs must be on, as South’s key cards must be the ace of spades, the ace of hearts and the king of clubs..removeThe playTrick  – East led the queen of diamonds, declarer winning the trick with his ace of diamonds, discarding a spade from dummy. Trick  – North considered the hand. Was he going to take the spade finesse  In fact,the hearts were   or   then he could discard his losing spade on the final heart. But trumps first. He played the ace of clubs from his hand. Trick  – He followed this by winning the next trick with dummy’s king of clubs. Good news. The defenders trumps were  , so he would not have to risk taking the spade finesse. Tricks ,  and  - Declarer then won the next three tricks with his king and queen and dummy’s ace of hearts. Trick  – He then ruffed a heart in his hand, establishing dummy’s last heart as a winner. Trick  – Declarer then ed to dummy by ruffing a diamond. Trick  – He then played dummy’s winning last heart, discarding the two of spades from his hand. Tricks  and  – He then played the ace of spades, followed by a small spade which he ruffed in hand. Trick – Declarer then ruffed his last losing diamond with dummy’s last trump. Tricks  – Declarer then claimed the last trick with his remaining club, the grand slam making with thirteen tricks for score of  - one spade, four hearts, one diamond, two diamond ruffs in dummy, and five clubs in hand. Well bid and well played. Six hearts makes but not seven, because East held four trumps.What have we learnt . It is often a good idea to show your partner a strong hand by reversing, as here, before showing support for his suit.. Once again Roman key card Blackwood.is an essential part of your armoury to reach a slam.. Always checkyou can establish small cards in a suit by ruffing before considering a finesse.Penarth club resultsFriday  December . Trish Tracey and Tony Campbell. Jim Elder and Meryl Skipper.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThe latest modelling suggests Omicron cases will peak \"towards the second half\" of this month and then decline – probably more quickly than previous Covid waves.Since arriving in the UK at the end of the autumn, Omicron is now the \"dominant\" form of the virus and is \"seeded in all parts of Wales\", the first minister told BBC Radio Wales this morning.More than , new cases of Covid were reported in a single daylast week, and the nations positivity rate – the number of tests thata positive result – is at  per cent, a figure Mr Drakeford called \"really high\".\"The dficult January that we could see coming is I’m afraid with us, and the protections in place are really necessary to help us all get through the challenging weeks ahead,\" he added.There is some optimism the Omicron wave could fizzle out as quickly as it managed to spread here, as it appears to be doing in South Africa, the nation where the iant was discovered in November. And research suggests people are far less likely to fall seriously ill or require hospital treatment with Omicron, compared to the Delta strain.Mr Drakeford urged caution against \"learning too many direct lessons from South Africa\", but accepted thatthe same pattern – of Omicron infections falling as quickly as they rose – were repeated in Wales, then \"we’re in for a very challenging few weeks but that we may come out of the other side of it more quickly than we’ve done in previous waves\".Wales is currently at Alert Level Two, with restrictions mainly aimed at improving safety measures for businesses and public places, rather than closing them down.The first minister said he believed his government had taken \"proportionate measures\" at the right time last month, based on the threat of the Omicron wave. This included closing down nightclubs, but Mr Drakeford said this was a move copied across much of Europe, and clubs were generally accepted to be at a \"particularly acute\" risk of being \"super-spreader events\"..removeBut asked whether his government would have preferred a full lockdown during the current wave, the first minister said this would have been impossible without financial support from the UK Government.Englands approach to Omicron has been less restrictive, as seen on New Years Eve when Newport city centre was a comparative ghost town compared to the crowds in Bristol.
