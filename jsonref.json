Pictured, with his wife Camilla at the Braemar Gathering last weekIn a statement about the tiff between Andrew and Johnstone-Burt, a spokesman said:  ‘Some time ago there was a disagreement between the Duke of York and a member of staff. The disagreement was resolved and there are no ongoing issues’.The disagreement was said to have happened at the beginning of this month, and sources had previously told the Mail on Sunday that Prince Andrew had been \u0027very cross\u0027 and it was even thought that Prince Charles had asked him to apologise.  There was said to have been words on both sides but no actual physical altercation between the two parties.‘It was a verbal dispute. It was a work-related issue. The Duke got very cross that what he wanted wasn’t possible.’         Mr Johnstone-Burt (pictured above) looks after teams including catering, housekeeping and entertainmentPrince Charles subsequently heard of the row and asked his brother to say sorry.The source added: ‘The Duke explained the situation to the Prince of Wales and left it at that. There was no apology because there was nothing to apologise for. The Duke maintains a good relationship with the Prince of Wales.’ Johnstone-Burt, who has worked at the palace for six years, is responsible for 250 staff covering catering, housekeeping, entertainment, maintenance and administration.On September 7, a source close to Charles said such an intervention would not be unusual. ‘He is the second most senior member of the family and is known to take action when and where is necessary.‘Mostly he is well informed and will intervene where it is appropriate to do so.’He is also in charge of a £370 million, ten-year re-fit of the Queen’s official London residence.Johnstone-Burt joined the Royal Navy in 1977 and served in the Falklands before eventually being promoted to vice-admiral and becoming the Chief of Staff to Nato’s Supreme Allied Command Transformation at Norfolk, Virginia.He was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath by the Queen in 2013.        "},{"url":null,"title":"Britain set bask 26C temperatures heatwave brings Indian summer UK weekend","story":"Share this article   \u0027South Hampton will enjoy moderately warm temperatures of 20C, measuring just above average for this time of year, 19C.\u0027The warm weather we are enjoying this weekend has come from an area of high pressure moving in from the south west over the UK and southerly winds.\u0027  Adding: \u0027Next weekend will be again warmer in the South with parts of Scotland, including the Shetland Isles due to experience 70mph winds.\u0027 "},{"url":null,"title":"Remain campaigners greet Lib Dems arriving party conference discuss ways scrap Brexit","story":"Share this article She tore into the Conservative administration\u0027s record on reducing the UK\u0027s carbon footprint, and said ministers had \u0027destroyed\u0027 the record left by the Lib Dems when they were in coalition between 2010 and 2015.\u0027What have the Tories done about the climate emergency in the last four years?

She worked as a guitar teacher and a toy shop sales assistant before being signed by Domino Records in 2009. Brian Eno was an early champion, calling Calvi “the biggest thing since Patti Smith” and singing and playing on her debut album. She’s also collaborated with David Byrne, Marianne Faithfull and PJ Harvey producer Rob Ellis. Calvi’s guitar-driven art-rock sound is often described as dark and cinematic, so it’s not too surprising that she’s recently scored series five of Peaky Blinders.Influences: Black Midi’s name comes from an internet music genre the band learned of via YouTube, a video frontman Geordie Greep has said they “haven’t spent more than five minutes watching”. The four-piece experimental rock band initially bonded over a shared love of Talking Heads, Deerhoof and Danny Brown, but that doesn’t mean these acts are “influences” in the traditional sense. According to Greep, “there’s stuff we all like, but it’s not like we all like stuff that we based the band on sort of thing. We’ve tried to keep the band quite distinct from what we like.”Scene: Black Midi formed at the Brit School, the Croydon performing arts institution known for cultivating Adele, Amy Winehouse and Jessie J. They then honed their live skills at Brixton venue the Windmill, a bastion of the south London indie scene. Though they’re hardly typical Brit School alumni, the group acknowledge they owe a debt to their time there. “You do shows every term and stuff,” Greep has said. “So once you get out you’ve got a really good idea of how sound works. It meant we left school, could play at the Windmill and knew how to soundcheck straight away.”Influences: Growing up in Wales in the 90s, Cate Le Bon’s father would make her mixtapes introducing her to seminal artists such as Neil Young and the Velvet Underground. She was also drawn to California rockers Pavement and two leading Welsh bands of the era, Super Furry Animals and Gorky’s Zygotic Mynci. Her shortlisted album Reward grew from a year of “self-imposed isolation” in Cumbria where she spent her time woodworking by day and later, “playing the piano and singing into the night”.Scene: Born in Carmarthenshire, Le Bon’s roots lie in the Welsh indie scene. She first came to prominence opening for Super Furry Animals frontman Gruff Rhys on his 2007 solo tour, then singing on I Lust U, a standout track from Rhys’s electro-pop side project Neon Neon. She’s since released five albums, collaborated with John Cale and the Manic Street Preachers, and co-produced an album by American indie rockers Deerhunter. She’s revered by peers including St. Vincent and Wilco’s Jeff Tweedy, who earlier this year described Le Bon as “pretty much my favourite artist”, going on to say: “I’m mesmerised by her output over the last 10 years.”Scene: Dave is a leading light of the blossoming British hip-hop scene. Fellow London rappers Stormzy and Wiley supported him early on then Dave’s profile grew again when US superstar Drake jumped on a remix of his 2017 track Wanna Know. More recently, the 21-year-old has collaborated with several other London rappers including Headie One, J Hus and Fredo, who featured on Dave’s chart-topping single Funky Friday. This year, Dave has underlined his rising star status with a guest spot on Ed Sheeran’s No.6 Collaborations Project.Influences: Oxford band Foals have cited minimalist composer Steve Reich, indie icons Pixies and innovative dance producer Arthur Baker as influences. Frontman Yannis Philippakis has also said that a “general anxiety” caused by Trump, Brexit and climate change fed into their shortlisted album, Everything Not Saved Will Be Lost – Part 1. “I was listening to the tracks in the pub and I’d I look up and see a pub garden full of people and realise: ‘We’re all in this shitstorm together.’ I felt the songs should deal with that,” he said recently.Scene: Foals formed in Oxford’s indie scene in 2005. Two band members, frontman Yannis Philippakis and drummer Jack Bevan, were previously part of another band, math-rockers The Edmund Fitzgerald, who disbanded when things apparently became “too serious”. Since releasing their debut album Antidotes in 2008, Foals have been shortlisted for the Mercury Prize on three occasions and become seasoned festival headliners. A follow-up to their shortlisted album, the logically-titled Everything Not Saved Will Be Lost – Part 2, is due in October.Influences: Dublin post-punks Fontaines DC are influenced by the Strokes, the Libertines and the Velvet Underground they’ve called the latter “the base point of modern music”. Frontman Grian Chatten has also cited the Pogues’ 1984 debut album Red Roses for Me as a major touchstone for their own shortlisted debut, Dogrel, saying: “It sounds so raucous but at the same time so intelligent.” But the band’s most formative influence could be their hometown. “I think of Dublin and our music as one and the same, because it was written by people who were intensely absorbed by the city,” Chatten has said.Scene: Inspired by fellow Dubliners Girl Band, whom they credit with “modernising” Irish music, Fontaines DC are part of a new wave of Irish guitar bands making music with a strong social conscience. Discussing the scene earlier this year, Fontaines bassist Conor Deegan III said: “There’s so many things going on in Ireland, socially and politically, that for so long were not being talked about. It feels like there’s a coherent voice for our generation again.” Having toured with Shame and Idles, Fontaines DC also have close connections with the UK guitar music scene.Influences: While often described as a post-punk band, Idles frontman Joe Talbot has said they’re really “a product of different things we love”. The Bristol outfit’s shortlisted second album, Joy as an Act of Resistance, is influenced by the Sex Pistols, Interpol and Welsh post-hardcore group Mclusky, plus garage music, grime and jungle. It’s all funnelled into a righteous and rousing call-to-arms which takes on toxic masculinity, class conflict, immigration and Brexit. The end result isn’t anger, said Talbot, but music that’s “all about opening up and being vulnerable”.Influences: Little Simz said her shortlisted album Grey Area was inspired by “just coming into myself a lot more and being a young woman in my mid-20s and still learning about myself”. The north London artist, whose real name is Simbi Ajikawo, has said that listening to grime as a teenager influenced her writing style, but Grey Area also draws from other sources. Produced by her childhood friend Inflo, it incorporates jazz, funk, soul, rock and trip-hop, and includes collaborations with reggae artist Chronixx, folk-rock singer Michael Kiwanuka and electro-R\u0026ampB band Little Dragon.Scene: Little Simz said earlier this year that “people have struggled with finding where to place me”, adding: “And I think that’s also because I don’t even know where I fit.” This doesn’t mean the north London rapper lacks influential and high-profile fans. Two years ago, Kendrick Lamar said she “might be the illest doing it”, and she’s been tapped for collaborations by Gorillaz, Khalid and alt-j. Simz has even toured with Lauryn Hill, whose seminal album The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill was part of her “day-to-day life” when she was growing up.Influences: Neo Jessica Joshua, better known as Nao, grew up in Hackney listening to R\u0026ampB, hip-hop and UK garage, as well as Donny Hathaway, Aretha Franklin and Prince. Conceptually, her shortlisted second album is inspired by astrology’s Saturn return. “It’s this idea that Saturn takes 29 years to orbit from when you’re born and it is the planet of blessings and growth. So by the time you’re around 29, between 27 and 32, something big happens in your life,” 31-year-old Nao says. “You start to rethink everything – old stuff that your parents taught you or ideas that you believed in. It’s like a complete shedding of skin and it can be painful.”Scene: Nao’s unique musical journey means she doesn’t slot neatly into any particular scene. After studying vocal jazz at Guildhall School of Music \u0026amp Drama, she joined all-female beatboxing troupe The Boxettes, who were popular on YouTube. She also put in stints as a backing singer for Kwabs and Jarvis Cocker. When she released her debut album For All We Know in 2016, she often described her sound as “wonky funk”, and she’s since collaborated with Nile Rodgers \u0026amp Chic and Disclosure.Influences: Led by alto saxophonist Cassie Kinoshi, SEED Ensemble is a 10-piece band “combining jazz with inner-city London, West African and Caribbean-influenced groove”. Kinoshi says she’s personally influenced by composers such as Maria Schneider, Duke Ellington and Charles Mingus, and named Driftglass after a collection of short stories by African-American author Samuel R Delany. “This record specifically focuses on interpreting … what driftglass is as an analogy for how improvised music changes and evolves over time depending on its environment,” she says. “Sci-fi, specifically space travel and Afrofuturist references to water and its connection to black history, were also important in its creation.”Influences: Northampton rapper Tyron Frampton, or Slowthai, has varied musical influences ranging from the Beatles to Basement Jaxx, and So Solid Crew to Elliot Smith. He namechecks the Prodigy on Nothing Great About Britain, the title track from his shortlisted debut album, saying: “I am a prodigy – they made me.” He’s also said he related to Radiohead’s Creep during his formative years. His album is an impassioned mix of hip-hop, grime, electronica and punk, so it’s fitting that it features collaborations with both grime icon Skepta and noisenik guitar duo Slaves.Scene: Tyron Frampton, the rapper better known as Slowthai, was born and raised in Northampton. “It’s always been a band town,” he said earlier this year. “There’s always been good music but never a strong scene to keep it going.” His own music mixes hip-hop grit with a scabrous punk energy, but he’s keen not to be pigeonholed, saying: “I want to play guitar, piano, drums, write songs for other people. I can do punk, I can do indie, but as long as it has my voice, it’ll always be my sound.”Scene: The four members of the 1975 met at Wilmslow High School and started making music at 15. At one point, they operated as a punk covers band, but they soon developed their own genre-splicing songwriting style inspired by everyone from Michael Jackson to My Bloody Valentine. Since signing to indie label Dirty Hit and breaking through with 2013’s self-titled debut, band members Matt Healy and George Daniel have co-written tracks for fellow Dirty Hit artists Pale Waves, The Japanese House and No Rome.Watch the 2019 Hyundai Mercury Prize live on Thursday 19th September, BBC Four - 9pm.

But one British political party has already come up against a common hitch: what to do when an artist is not pleased to be associated with your vision?Wendy Taylor, a sculptor who specialises in large-scale public work, discovered last month that an image of her imposing sundial sculpture Timepiece, which stands on the banks of the Thames near Tower Bridge, had been adopted by the Time party. Her Grade II listed work features at the top of the party’s website and drawings of it are reproduced on its merchandise.“I was bloody livid when I found out,” Taylor told the Observer. “Quite frankly it feels like my work is being manipulated without my permission.”The Time party, which is pro-Brexit and is calling for greater investment in industry and entrepreneurship, among other policies, said this weekend that it is working to find a solution to the issue and that it in no way disputes Taylor’s original creative copyright on the sculpture.“We expect to resolve her questions amicably in the next few days, and both parties are committed to that,” said the party’s deputy leader, Tim Considine. “We do not subscribe to the view that displaying an artwork on our website suggests in any way that the original artist is a member of the Time party, or that he or she supports the Time party.”Using works of art can easily turn into a public relations disaster for politicians. When Nigel Farage plumped for the theme from the 1963 film The Great Escape when he appeared in public promoting Ukip in 2016 the children of the late composer Elmer Bernstein were incensed.“Our father would never have allowed Ukip to use his music because he would have strongly opposed the party’s nativism and thinly disguised bigotry,” they said in a statement.In fact artists often have little right under the law to stop such use. If a song has been licensed for broadcast then the musicians involved cannot do much about a politician’s team deciding to play a few bars of it to a crowd. Similarly Taylor’s sculpture beside the Thames is considered to be in the public domain. The copyright to the images being used by the Time party actually belong to the photographer who took them rather than to Taylor herself. The sculptor fully accepts this fact, but said she is still unhappy to see the outline of her work appearing on items that are for sale in the party’s shop.“It is not so much about the politics for me,” she said. “It is about using Timepiece in a way I did not intend. The Time party may say that the image is just a sundial, but it is clearly based on my work.”Once a song or an image has been associated with a particular political standpoint it can be hard to disentangle it. D:Ream’s Things Can Only Get Better will forever be associated with Tony Blair’s victory in 1997 while Bill Clinton’s 1992 election triumph is rarely mentioned on air without a soundtrack provided by Fleetwood Mac’s hit Don’t Stop (Thinking About Tomorrow).Despite repeated protests from the Rolling Stones, Donald Trump continues to use their track You Can’t Always Get What You Want at the end of political rallies. Mick Jagger has explained the situation on Twitter: “So, the thing is, when you appear in America … if you’re in a public place like Madison Square Garden or a theatre, you can play any music you want, and you can’t be stopped. So, if you write a song and someone plays it in a restaurant that you go to, you can’t stop them. They can play what they want.”The band are just one in a long list of musicians who have attempted to stop the Republicans using their recordings to promote Trump. Others include Pharrell Williams, Rihanna, Adele, Neil Young and REM. Elton John also objected but argued more generally that he did not want his music involved in any American campaigns.British music remains popular with American politicians. This summer the sound of the Clash was chosen by two of the prospective Democratic presidential candidates. Bill de Blasio chose Rudie Can’t Fail and Beto O’Rourke went for Clampdown.Also perennially popular in the US is the music of Bruce Springsteen. This year Joe Biden walks on with We Take Care of our Own, while Michael Bennet chose The Rising. Ronald Reagan was one of several Republicans to be asked by Springsteen to drop the song Born in the USA from their campaign rallies. The verse lyrics, which are an attack on the lack of support for US veterans, are regularly ignored.Elizabeth Warren, one of the Democratic frontrunners, used Dolly Parton’s 9 to 5 without permission, which quickly backfired, although no formal complaint has been made so far."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ed1fbcca2e28402530399c85d16311d293fb418a/0_110_5271_3162/master/5271.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=41715614a0fb7aba5d2d1584a41b67a3","title":"the 20 photographs of the week","story":"Hurricane Dorian, protests in Hong Kong, fashion weeks in London and New York and the burning Amazon – the last seven days, as captured by the world’s best photojournalists"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1c127080ff763a890ac01ce89a7f726e0c2658ba/0_388_2365_1419/master/2365.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5271cfe9bdff4fd60d9177e5cd9ed7ad","title":"like someone flicked a switch the premenstrual disorder that upturns womens lives","story":"Premenstrual dysphoric disorder, only recently recognised, can cripple women emotionally, physically and mentallyFor two weeks every month Rachel* would be engulfed in a depression so deep she felt like she was “walking through treacle”. As a gifted athlete and high achiever academically, it was entirely out of character.“Half the month I was extroverted, firing on all cylinders,” Rachel says. “Then I would hit ovulation. And at that time I became dysfunctional, shy and withdrawn. It’s like I woke up one day and became a completely different person. And from then until I started menstruating I became utterly dysfunctional. Then I would get my period and I would be fine. And this happened again and again and again.”She says these symptoms – which doctors have now attributed to premenstrual dysphoric disorder, or PMDD – have affected intimate relationships and friendships over the years because she would withdraw socially if she felt the fog of depression closing in: “I couldn’t stand myself so how could anyone else?”Unlike PMS, which hits two to four days out from menstruation with various physical and emotional symptoms, the onset of PMDD is one to two weeks before a woman gets her period, known as the luteal phase. It results in a sudden and significant depression and lifts just as abruptly when the woman’s period begins.“This is a condition where there are significant depression symptoms, and that can include suicidal thoughts and suicide attempts, some of which are, tragically, realised,” says Kulkarni, who has been working in and researching the area of women’s mental health for almost 30 years.“Some of the key features of PMDD are when a woman says, ‘It’s like someone flicked a switch. I’m OK, then suddenly, bang, there is a major depression. I can’t get out of bed, I can’t think. I get tearful, I get irritable, I get angry, I can’t process cognitively very well.’ ”Kulkarni says PMDD symptoms, including anxiety, rage and hostility – all symptoms of depression although often not recognised as such – can wreak havoc on relationships. “All sorts of things can go astray, including work performances and relationships with colleagues,” she says.Kulkarni has seen adolescents as young as 12 affected, all the way through to women nearing menopause, when the condition typically worsens.Although women have been battling this condition for generations, PMDD has been recognised as a clinical mental health condition for only six years. In 2013 it was included as a depressive disorder in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mood Disorders, published by the American Psychiatric Association.Significantly, a gene related to PMDD was found by researchers from the US National Institutes of Health and published in the journal Molecular Psychiatry in 2017. It points to a biological predisposition for those women who are extra sensitive to the normal hormonal fluctuations in their cycles. At the time the gene discovery was published, an NIH researcher, Dr David Goldman, said: “This is a big moment for women’s health because it establishes that women with PMDD have an intrinsic difference in their molecular apparatus for response to sex hormones – not just emotional behaviours they should be able to voluntarily control.”It’s a pivotal time for women’s wellbeing in Australia. It’s a time when women’s health issues, like endometriosis, are finally being talked about and taken seriously – evidenced by the $10m federal government funding boost for endometriosis research and awareness announced earlier this year by the health minister, Greg Hunt.Kulkarni is at pains to emphasise that PMDD is not just “below the belt” but a condition with its epicentre in the brain.She says all the hormones involved in a woman’s cycle – progesterone, oestrogen and testosterone – are potent brain chemicals.“Progesterone, and in particular allopregnanolone (a hormone produced when progesterone is broken down in the brain), is thought to be a major cause of PMDD,” she says. “But oestrogen ‘protects’ the brain in many ways, and imbalances in progesterone and oestrogen in the brain can lead to the depression symptoms seen in women with PMDD.“These are all very potent hormones. And there are some women who are more sensitive to their hormone fluctuations than others.”Rachel is one of those women. Her experience can be traced back to adolescence, but she was officially diagnosed only six years ago, in her early 30s, after years searching for an answer. A red flag for Rachel, as well as her depressive symptoms, was when her inner dialogue would suddenly nosee into negative self-talk. “There would suddenly be a shift … an almost bullying way of talking to myself that wasn’t characteristic of me,” she says.A PMDD diagnosis requires women to experience at least five symptoms in the final week before her period, which improve when menstruation starts and are minimal or absent in the remaining weeks of her cycle. These include mood swings, irritability, anger, anxiety, tension, fatigue, difficulty concentrating, social withdrawal and – as Rachel experienced – self-deprecating thoughts. There can be physical symptoms too, such as breast tenderness or swelling, joint or muscle pain, and a sensation of “bloating” or weight gain. Often women are asked to keep a diary to note the symptoms for several cycles before a diagnosis is reached.Treatment can vary from practitioner to practitioner and from patient to patient – the same approach does not necessarily work for everyone. Kulkarni works closely with an endocrinologist and favours a multipronged approach involving hormone modulation – experimenting with doses of progesterone and oestrogen (including the contraceptive pill and oestrogen patches) – underpinned by psychological support. Low doses of antidepressant medication are added if needed but are not the first line of treatment. In the worst-case scenario, when women are not responding to any other treatments, inducing menopause with medication is an option.“We have in the past had to resort to chemical menopause, at the very severe end, where somebody is profoundly depressed and their life is at risk,” she says. “That’s an extreme approach and very few people need it. It’s essentially shutting off those hormonal fluctuations. And we’ve had some great successes in women who have tried everything else and nothing has worked.”Kulkarni says hysterectomies are not advocated by the clinic unless there is a very clear physical health reason beyond PMDD, such as additional complications with fibroids or severe endometriosis. For Rachel the combination of psychological support, hormonal and anti-depressant treatment has allowed her to manage her condition, although it has taken time.“The big thing I have noticed in the past six months in particular is that the fog has lifted,” she says. “There isn’t this cognitive fog, this sense of walking through treacle, which was the fatigue I had a lot of the time.”She says she found it hard to confide in anyone about her condition, including female friends. In the past she would reach out if she was struggling but with PMDD, she feels there is still a stigma and a lack of language around how to talk to others about a women’s health condition.“Even between other women, just saying, ‘My hormones at the moment mean that I don’t feel like myself.’ How do we talk about that?“The thing that has really hit me with all this, is that mood isn’t just depression and anxiety. It sits so much within your hormones and broader health. That our experience of those things, as women, are so interrelated with our hormones – and we just don’t talk about it. It’s because it’s women’s health.”Kulkarni agrees and says awareness needs to be raised nationally around women’s mental health: “The thing is, women’s mental health is not a national priority – and it should be.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/76631a333413903699966944d9c151824861dbbd/0_182_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d78887d397e7aa9038d0c551b10989b9","title":"the nightmare of australias welfare system at the push of a button my working life was erased","story":"Six people recount their interactions with Centrelink and the government’s welfare programs, which range from absurd to frustrating to insultingEarlier this year a scathing Senate report said the Jobactive scheme – the government’s employment service – had unleashed a “bureaucratic nightmare” on jobseekers.Welfare groups said out-of-work Australians were “suffering” under the Coalition’s $7.3bn program, which has its roots in the Howard government’s outsourcing of employment services in 1998.Since then the system has grown and evolved into a network of 1,700 providers across Australia, with companies competing for public money and the right to triage some 750,000 unemployed people on Newstart into a series of government schemes with questionable outcomes such as Work for the Dole, ParentsNext and the PaTh Program. Australia spoke to six people about their experiences dealing with Jobactive providers.It was my birthday recently. I turned 58. I have a 40-year work history and a bachelor of science with a double major in physics and chemistry, plus a string of other qualifications. I even have a forklift licence, and used to run the quality testing lab at the factory where I worked for eight years before it closed in 2012.According to my Jobactive provider, none of it happened. All they see is my age.When I became unemployed it was unexpected, and despite my confidence I struggled. Everywhere I applied said I was too qualified and they’d have to pay me too much. When I started going to these providers, my 20-something caseworker suggested I should simply delete my qualifications from my resume.And just like that, at the push of a button, my whole working life was erased.Afterwards they started shunting me into jobs for which I was unsuited. They made me take cleaning jobs, even though I had arthritis. Once a caseworker asked me whether I had any retail experience. In 40 years I had not worked a day in retail but she said she had found the job for me and moved the screen around so I could see it. It was a job in sales. Up the top it said in big, bold letters that applicants must have a minimum of five years’ retail experience. She even bought me interview clothes that didn’t fit.If I didn’t go to the interview my payments would have been cut, so I went along anyway in my clothes that didn’t fit to explain why I was applying for a job I was entirely unqualified for.I keep getting into trouble because I won’t use their version of my resume. They say I’m not allowed to and that I have to show proof of my qualifications. So I take in my university degree – I’ve got it framed – I take the whole thing in there and say, “Look, this is my university degree and my forklift licence,” and they still don’t put it on to the system.And then at the next appointment I’ll have another new 20-year-old caseworker who I have to explain myself to once more because there’s nothing on the system. When I finish she says she doesn’t believe me and threatens to cut off my payments if I don’t do what she says.That’s it. You’re treated like a child by a child in an infinite loop, constantly afraid they’ll cut off your payments again and you’ll fall behind on your bills.Once you’re in the system you’re completely at the mercy of any person who is incompetent or has a grudge. You cope with gallows humour. Dealing with the Jobactive provider reminds me of those old Asterix comics where the Gauls had to navigate their way around the Roman bureaucracy. They’d go up to one window and be told, no, you have to go to Room 1. At Room 1, they’d be told they actually had to go to Room 2.I’ve been cut off Centrelink so many times I’ve lost count. It’s mostly because of the soaring incompetence of the people running the system. If they don’t want to deal with you, or a person with an attitude decides you’re a “non-compliant person”, they send you to Centrelink out of spite.The last time I was cut off, I was sent to do a Work for the Dole activity at a place ironically called “People Who Care”. We were doing busywork. It was terribly run. Twice they lost my paperwork but instead of losing my shit I politely asked whether they might take a look in their desk drawer.So later you get a text – they send you this text message to say you have been cut off because you haven’t attended your work appointment. But I had. It turned out they had two separate managers on each day who hadn’t bothered to do the paperwork. Apparently everyone who was there on those two days got cut off.This is pretty normal. Other people I know will get cut off if they’re five minutes late to call their Jobactive provider. I’ve been cut off because I’ve called at the right time and the phone has been busy so it goes to message bank. Five minutes later I’ll get a text message saying “You’ve been cut off because you haven’t reported in.” So you call them back and then you get admonished because you didn’t call at the correct time. Or they say they were on the phone.So then I ask: “If you knew I was going to call, why were you on the phone?”I don’t blame them though. All the people working in these places are just poor assholes who are just stuck in the same system. The person sitting on the other side of the desk from me in these places, that person could be me. They could end up on the side of the desk that I’m sitting on. And that’s what they’re scared of.My strange experience with a Jobactive provider happened back in November 2015. It was a week of pure, concentrated weirdness.The provider found me a job with a charity. They handled everything. My case manager even took the picture for the photo ID.There was a man who handled what limited training there was by phone. The day after, I had a trial shift. I had to collect money door-to-door with no information about what the charity actually did, who ran it or what the money we were raising was for – only that it was for children in the Philippines.The leaflets they gave us to hand out were about cancer, copied and pasted from Wikipedia, even though the charity was supposedly about education. When I spoke to people I couldn’t even answer basic questions. And people were still generous. A blind man gave me $20. It was absurd and awful.When I asked my point of contact questions, he grew frustrated and aggressive with me. He told me to look on the website but it was just pictures of kids with vague descriptions no programs, no initiatives. It’s been taken down since, but the mission statement was just a copy of the tax definition of a charity.I didn’t know what to do, so I reported this to the ACCC and even made a police report. When I told my caseworker, they tried to make me keep doing the job. They told me they’d had their office look it up and that the charity was properly registered, but anyone can register for a business name. I read charities have a year before they’re audited.When my questions about how the collected money was spent still weren’t answered, the case manager called my point of contact. That’s when they agreed that something wasn’t right and that I didn’t have to do it any more. They joked nervously about ending up on A Current Affair.Everything, I should say, started out fine. I’m on the disability support pension, so when I was placed with the Jobactive provider I found the people there lovely and I was actually hopeful I may get a job. But I live in West Gippsland and there isn’t much work here. I had no bites or anything.So six months in the Jobactive people started enrolling me in these mini job classes. They include things like interview prep, the different qualifications needed for a job, and were basically pointless. They were there to make it look like we were doing something. I was there two or three times a week to keep me occupied. And I did that for six weeks.At that time the case managers I dealt with kept changing as the company restructured. I went through three of them and eventually ended up with a disability consultant who suggested I look at doing a Certificate V in business and retail. It was supposed to be six months of doing two hours a week online.I agreed because it was better than jumping through their other hoops. I already had a bachelor in communications and an advanced diploma in business studies, so I thought this might be another qualification to add to my CV. But after the first few units, I realised I had already held a higher level qualification in the same area, so I already knew everything. When I later went through a period of unwellness, they allowed me to take a week or two off and I spoke to the consultant off-the-cuff. That’s when she said she wouldn’t have recommended I do the course. They basically let me waste my time for about six months.Then, at the end of 2018, I had a letter from Centrelink saying that it was worse than that: I wasn’t required to attend appointments with a Jobactive provider at all. I didn’t believe it at first, but then someone from Centrelink rang me to explain I was officially considered a “volunteer”. They said I could continue going to appointments and looking for work if I wanted to, but then I’d have to sign a contract which would lock me in.I thought something was wrong or there had been a mistake. The next time I went into the provider and spoke to my consultant, I told her about the phone call. We laughed about it because we agreed Centrelink must have made a mistake. Of course I was supposed to be here. I’d been going to appointments for nearly two years.About a minute or two, she stopped, looked something up on her computer and told me Centrelink actually had it right: I didn’t need to be there at all. I’d spent two years of my life jumping through hoops for no reason.I recently went for a pre-interview phone call at a Jobactive provider where I had to explain I worked for five years managing Work for the Dole before quitting. A series of unrelated life events forced a mental health crisis and a hospitalisation. Now I’m on Newstart to supplement my income while I start a business. It’s hard and embarrassing, especially as I know just how powerless you are as a job seeker.The whole system is broken, on both ends. I have so many stories from when I managed the Work for the Dole program. One that really affected me involved a client who was sent to work at a golf club. While on the job, he fell off some scaffolding that wasn’t set up correctly and landed on his face. He had to be hospitalised and the breakages caused him breathing difficulties and disfiguration. That was really horrible and I took that guilt home with me after realising there was no support for him.I think Work for the Dole is like slave labour. There was no food provided for those doing the activities and people had to bring their own lunch. The subsidy for getting to the activity was an extra $20.80 a fortnight. To my knowledge this hasn’t changed since 1997. You’re essentially getting a bunch of people from lower socioeconomic backgrounds doing work that is often quite degrading. Meanwhile they are working for free for organisations that are making money off them. When I worked there, each inidual placement was worth $1,000, or $3,500 for “training” activities. That money gets paid by the government to the organisation.Last year Centrelink put me on the ParentsNext program. Dealing with them has been really frustrating as I’m not supposed to be on this program. I’m a mother of two children and I was studying and working when they put me on it.At first I thought I would go in and report to them and that was it. The lady I was going through at the Jobactive provider made my appointments once every two months at the start. Then about two or three weeks ago, I had a new consultant who said I shouldn’t be on that program at all. They said I was working too much. Someone at Centrelink though decided I didn’t have a job, even though I’ve been working at the same organisation for the past two years for pay. That’s when Centrelink wanted to make me start looking for 10 jobs a week.After that, Centrelink started bringing me in for appointments with my Jobactive provider more often. During the middle of a work day, I would have to tell my boss, “Sorry, but I have to leave to go to these appointments.” My boss was supportive and wrote me a letter to try to help, which I showed the Jobactive people, but it didn’t change anything.When I spoke to someone from Centrelink about it over the phone, they said the rules meant I had to look for 10 jobs. When I told them I wouldn’t, they said I had to. I said to them: “You don’t own me. I don’t care. I’m my own person.”The case manager I deal with at the Jobactive is good though and can see I shouldn’t be there, so she’s started calling me via the phone so I don’t have to go in. I’m trying to get off ParentsNext now but Centrelink won’t let me leave. Last week I was told to provide 13 weeks of payslips to exit the ParentsNext program. More paperwork.It’s like when I talk, they don’t listen.The unnamed contributors to this story are known to the journalist and asked to remain anonymous"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/23e59ec0e125f88fda2cf1245db989d4e0f541ff/0_165_4626_2776/master/4626.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5f9dc6b7e75180ef07d4dfe3df6c1fde","title":"share your reviews of the testaments by margaret atwood","story":"Whether you’ve been waiting decades for the sequel to The Handmaid’s Tale or you’re new to Atwood, we’d like to hear from youIt is the literary event of 2019 and 34 years in the making: The Testaments, Margaret Atwood’s sequel to her dystopian feminist classic The Handmaid’s Tale is finally out in the world (a week after Amazon’s embargo-busting snafu.)

A really strong theme running through the book is the links between it and the crisis of rising white supremacy, the various forms of nationalism and the fact that so many people are being forced from their homelands, and the war that is waged on our attention s. These are intersecting and interconnecting crises and so the solutions have to be as well.Do you feel encouraged by talk of the Green New Deal?I feel a tremendous excitement and a sense of relief, that we are finally talking about solutions on the scale of the crisis we face. That we’re not talking about a little carbon tax or a cap and trade scheme as a silver bullet. We’re talking about transforming our economy. This system is failing the majority of people anyway, which is why we’re in this period of such profound political destabilisation – that is giving us the Trumps and the Brexits, and all of these strongman leaders – so why don’t we figure out how to change everything from bottom to top, and do it in a way that addresses all of these other crises at the same time? There is every chance we will miss the mark, but every fraction of a degree warming that we are able to hold off is a victory and every policy that we are able to win that makes our societies more humane, the more we will weather the inevitable shocks and storms to come without slipping into barbarism. Because what really terrifies me is what we are seeing at our borders in Europe and North America and Australia – I don’t think it’s coincidental that the settler colonial states and the countries that are the engines of that colonialism are at the forefront of this. We are seeing the beginnings of the era of climate barbarism. We saw it in Christchurch, we saw it in El Paso, where you have this marrying of white supremacist violence with vicious anti-immigrant racism.That is one of the most chilling sections of your book: I think that’s a link a lot of people haven’t made.This pattern has been clear for a while. White supremacy emerged not just because people felt like thinking up ideas that were going to get a lot of people killed but because it was useful to protect barbaric but highly profitable actions. The age of scientific racism begins alongside the transatlantic slave trade, it is a rationale for that brutality. If we are going to respond to climate change by fortressing our borders, then of course the theories that would justify that, that create these hierarchies of humanity, will come surging back. There have been signs of that for years, but it is getting harder to deny because you have killers who are screaming it from the rooftops.One criticism you hear about the environment movement is that it is dominated by white people. How do you address that?When you have a movement that is overwhelmingly representative of the most privileged sector of society then the approach is going to be much more fearful of change, because people who have a lot to lose tend to be more fearful of change, whereas people who have a lot to gain will tend to fight harder for it. That’s the big benefit of having an approach to climate change that links it to those so called bread and butter issues: how are we going to get better paid jobs, affordable housing, a way for people to take care of their families? I have had many conversations with environmentalists over the years where they seem really to believe that by linking fighting climate change with fighting poverty, or fighting for racial justice, it’s going to make the fight harder. We have to get out of this “my crisis is bigger than your crisis: first we save the planet and then we fight poverty and racism, and violence against women”. That doesn’t work. That alienates the people who would fight hardest for change. This debate has shifted a huge amount in the US because of the leadership of the climate justice movement and because it is congresswomen of colour who are championing the Green New Deal. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ilhan Omar, Ayanna Pressley and Rashida Tlaib come from communities that have gotten such a raw deal under the years of neoliberalism and longer, and are determined to represent, truly represent, the interests of those communities. They’re not afraid of deep change because their communities desperately need it.In the book, you write: “The hard truth is that the answer to the question ‘What can I, as an inidual, do to stop climate change?’ is: nothing.” Do you still believe that?In terms of the carbon, the inidual decisions that we make are not going to add up to anything like the kind of scale of change that we need. And I do believe that the fact that for so many people it’s so much more comfortable to talk about our own personal consumption, than to talk about systemic change, is a product of neoliberalism, that we have been trained to see ourselves as consumers first. To me that’s the benefit of bringing up these historical analogies, like the New Deal or the Marshall Plan – it brings our minds back to a time when we were able to think of change on that scale. Because we’ve been trained to think very small. It is incredibly significant that Greta Thunberg has turned her life into a living emergency.Yes, she set sail for the UN climate summit in New York on a zero carbon yacht ...Exactly. But this isn’t about what Greta is doing as an inidual. It’s about what Greta is broadcasting in the choices that she makes as an activist, and I absolutely respect that. I think it’s magnificent. She is using the power that she has to broadcast that this is an emergency, and trying to inspire politicians to treat it as an emergency. I don’t think anybody is exempt from scrutinising their own decisions and behaviours but I think it is possible to overemphasise the inidual choices. I have made a choice – and this has been true since I wrote No Logo, and I started getting these “what should I buy, where should I shop, what are the ethical clothes?” questions. My answer continues to be that I am not a lifestyle adviser, I am not anyone’s shopping guru, and I make these decisions in my own life but I’m under no illusion that these decisions are going to make the difference.Some people are choosing to go on birth strikes. What do you think about that?I’m happy these discussions are coming into the public domain as opposed to being furtive issues we’re afraid to talk about. It’s been very isolating for people. It certainly was for me. One of the reasons I waited as long as I did to try and get pregnant, and I would say this to my partner all the time – what, you want to have a Mad Max water warrior fighting with their friends for food and water? It wasn’t until I was part of the climate justice movement and I could see a path forward that I could even imagine having a kid. But I would never tell anybody how to answer this most intimate of questions. As a feminist who knows the brutal history of forced sterilisation and the ways in which women’s bodies become battle zones when policymakers decide that they are going to try and control population, I think that the idea that there are regulatory solutions when it comes to whether or not to have kids is catastrophically ahistorical. We need to be struggling with our climate grief together and our climate fears together, through whatever decision we decide to make, but the discussion we need to have is how do we build a world so that those kids can have thriving, zero-carbon lives?Over the summer, you encouraged people to read Richard Powers’s novel, The Overstory. Why?It’s been incredibly important to me and I’m happy that so many people have written to me since. What Powers is writing about trees: that trees live in communities and are in communication, and plan and react together, and we’ve been completely wrong in the way we conceptualise them. It’s the same conversation we’re having about whether we are going to solve this as iniduals or whether we are going to save the collective organism. It’s also rare, in good fiction, to valorise activism, to treat it with real respect, failures and all, to acknowledge the heroism of the people who put their bodies on the line. I thought Powers did that in a really extraordinary way.What are you views on what Extinction Rebellion has achieved?One thing they have done so well is break us out of this classic campaign model we have been in for a long time, where you tell someone something scary, you ask them to click on something to do something about it, you skip out the whole phase where we need to grieve together and feel together and process what it is that we just saw. Because what I hear a lot from people is, ok, maybe those people back in the 1930s or 40s could organise neighbourhood by neighbourhood or workplace by workplace but we can’t. We believe we’ve been so downgraded as a species that we are incapable of that. The only thing that is going to change that belief is getting face to face, in community, having experiences, off our screens, with one another on the streets and in nature, and winning some things and feeling that power.You talk about stamina in the book. How do you keep going? Do you feel hopeful?I have complicated feelings about the hope question. Not a day goes by that I don’t have a moment of sheer panic, raw terror, complete conviction that we are doomed, and then I do pull myself out of it. I’m renewed by this new generation that is so determined, so forceful. I’m inspired by the willingness to engage in electoral politics, because my generation, when we were in our 20s and 30s, there was so much suspicion around getting our hands dirty with electoral politics that we lost a lot of opportunities. What gives me the most hope right now is that we’ve finally got the vision for what we want instead, or at least the first rough draft of it. This is the first time this has happened in my lifetime. And also, I did decide to have kids. I have a seven year old who is so completely obsessed and in love with the natural world. When I think about him, after we’ve spent an entire summer talking about the role of salmon in feeding the forests where he was born in British Columbia, and how they are linked to the health of the trees and the soil and the bears and the orcas and this entire magnificent ecosystem, and I think about what it would be like to have to tell him that there are no more salmon, it kills me. So that motivates me. And slays me.• Naomi Klein will be in conversation with Katharine Viner at a  Live event on 15 October."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b43a7d0fa640b3756d915d2c68c58e8298a2f417/0_138_4288_2573/master/4288.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0a19436fb58a872b1d91041ea32325f0","title":"no deal brexit food shortages are you a small business owner whos stockpiling","story":"We’d like to hear from people in the food industry about stockpiling ahead of potential food shortages and price rises in the event of a no-deal BrexitA no-deal Brexit could result in rising food prices and shortages of certain types of fresh food, according to secret documents the government was forced by MPs to publish on Wednesday.Ministers have refused to disclose details about their discussions with local authorities and the food industry over possible disruptions to food supplies, arguing that the information could damage negotiations with the EU.But the chief executive of the Co-op warned on Thursday that the convenience chain were likely to be low on fruits including apples and pears, which are imported during the winter, in the event of a no-deal scenario.We would like to speak to small business owners in the food industry – from greengrocers to restaurateurs – about what products they have begun stockpiling in case of extensive delays at the UK border.Are you a small business owner who is stockpiling ahead of a possible no-deal Brexit?

It details how, in 2017, they finally unmasked the alleged – his trial is pending – serial rapist. Shortly after publication, however, much interest has alighted on another, less familiar figure in this story, who was once as fully committed as Weinstein to silencing and shaming survivors, intimidating reporters and rebuilding his good name: a US lawyer called Lisa Bloom.At the same time as it offers inspiration and guidance to investigative reporters in pursuit of powerful bullies, She Said – with its startling new evidence about Bloom’s involvement – also supplies a priceless introduction, for novices, to the business of reputation management.How is it that some obvious shits still prosper, or make rapid comebacks as deferred-to public figures, despite persuasive rumours or actual evidence of, say, sexual molestation, bullying and serial dishonesty? How do their misdemeanours sometimes descend so swiftly from the top of Google searches? Some of that will be attributable to luck, time or the process whereby, as some of our leading douches have demonstrated, continually overlaid offensiveness, on a vast and sufficiently public scale, will effectively neutralise decades of misconduct. How many times, after all, can one react to the transformation of a proved GBH plotter, racist, liar, sexist and idle, incontinently shagging idiot into a national leader?But Bloom sets out, in an email revealed by Kantor and Twohey, the potential benefits of employing reputation professionals when the concealment of specific wrongdoing is urgent or less amenable to denial.A woman’s advocate, with – in December 2016 – a still-intact reputation as a feminist, Bloom offered her services to Weinstein allegations of his sexual misconduct were circulating. Much of the relevant memo, which deserves to be read in full, features slurs against Rose McGowan, one of the earliest and bravest of Weinstein’s accusers, alongside assurances that Bloom understands, from her experience representing survivors, just how to deal with “the Roses of the world”.Options for shutting down McGowan’s accusations include, Bloom suggests: (1) falsely befriending her (2) “counterops”, an “online campaign to push back and call her out as a pathological liar… we can place an article re her becoming increasingly unglued” (3) a scary cease and desist letter and, more positively, (4) and (5) a phony show of repentance from Weinstein – “this is very doable” – along with ostentatious, targeted philanthropy, to prove that Weinstein, the predator of the “Roses of the world”, is on the contrary a hero: friend and benefactor to the Roses of the world.For instance, Bloom says: “Start the Weinstein foundation, focusing on gender equality in film, etc.” Finally, Bloom proposes working with a reputation management company to mess with Google searches: “Your first page of Google is key… Easy to do.” She was hired, for $895 per hour. Only much later, after intercessions on behalf of Weinstein that included a threatening appearance in the reporters’ newsroom, did Bloom describe her involvement as a “colossal mistake”.This expert in counterops blamed the mistake on her “naivete”. It has not advanced her repentance journey, either, that the true extent of Bloom’s concern for survivors was revealed in the same week that Margaret Atwood’s vicious collaborator, Aunt Lydia, reappeared in The Testaments. “What good is it to throw yourself in front of a steamroller out of moral principle?” Lydia reasons. “Better to hurl rocks than have them hurled at you.”As for Weinstein: he did pay for McGowan to be falsely befriended by an agent from the Israeli firm Black Cube he repented, lavishly and, in retrospect, hilariously – “I’ve asked Lisa Bloom to tutor me” he pledged $5m for a scholarship fund, at the University of Southern California, for female film-makers, “named after my mom”.While undetectability, the heart of reputation management, makes it hard to know which of our most improbably respected names owe their survival to a Bloom-like playbook, her focus on philanthropy as a redemptive tool ought to establish, finally, for organisations yet to grasp this point, that offers of money from compromised or suspect donors mean they are being used.In Weinstein’s case, intended beneficiaries were, effectively, cast as accomplices in Bloom’s Rose-persecution schedule. But at other times they might be helping purge historical links with, say, Vladimir Putin, with fascist organisations or with discreditable financial practices. You sometimes get the impression that, usefully for donors and their advisers, complacency on this point, and carelessness about complicity, is most likely in organisations whose motives are unassailably pure and high-minded.For some reason, some of the world’s most brilliant academics happily accepted invitations and visits, as well as funds, from Jeffrey Epstein, the relentless paedophile, founder of the Epstein Foundation, and friend of Prince Andrew.Although students at USC successfully campaigned to reject Weinstein’s gift, numerous male scientists, including those at MIT’s Media Lab, reportedly the recipient of $7.5m, accepted swag from the Epstein Foundation, thus helping position its creator, in websites that popped up on Google, as an unworldly brainiac. His customary female attendants could be, it appears, overlooked by the truly gifted and talented.A female academic recalls, in Ronan Farrow’s report, being concerned for the wellbeing of two young women accompanying Epstein when he visited MIT in 2015: “They were models. Eastern European, definitely.” The Media Lab director has now resigned. But its co-founder, the digital utopian Nicholas Negroponte, says he’d take Epstein’s cash all over again. “We all knew he went to jail for soliciting underage prostitution, but we thought he served his term and repented.”And with that, thanks to Epstein, yet another reputation falls due for professional refurbishment. Prince Andrew might know someone."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/83aeaf6c45347fab64074a6d8ba93b2e5c59e014/294_874_4498_2698/master/4498.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=58117426df1d16ffdbb3556b47a97a2d","title":"to see how extremism has taken root in britain look at islington north","story":"At the general election in Jeremy Corbyn’s Islington North, a candidate will stand from a party with a history of supporting IRA atrocities. But it won’t be the Labour party. It will have roots in a conspiracist Leninist sect that denied the existence of the concentration camps in to which “socialist” Serbs herded Bosnian Muslims. But much of the media will be too compromised by past endorsements to expose it as they exposed the Communist party of Britain and the other conspiratorial factions that guide Labour.Its candidate told a critic: “This is such a retarded argument that you are now forever fixed in my mind as a drooling, fuckwitted sack of shit.” But he is not one of the charming Twitter “outriders” for the Labour leadership.On the contrary, James Heartfield, from the Revolutionary Communist party and its successor organisations, will fight rather than support Corbyn in Islington, and stand for Nigel Farage’s Brexit party. He’s not alone in that. In the European elections, Farage put forward four candidates from what was in the 1980s the RCP, and then morphed into Living Marxism, the Institute of Ideas and Spiked. The names may have been different but the personnel and mentality endured. One, Claire Fox of the BBC’s Moral Maze, is now a Brexit party member of the European parliament.Grim mockery is the easiest response. Farage cannot question Corbyn’s patriotism often enough. Last week, Leave.EU, his propaganda site, praised Ian Austin, one of the few MPs with the moral courage to walk away from Labour, for an “epic tirade” in which he accused Corbyn and John McDonnell of supporting terrorists and antisemites and honouring IRA murderers. The record shows that’s precisely what they have done.But then Farage supports the old cadres of the Revolutionary Communist party, which hugged the most extreme elements in Irish republicanism with an embrace every bit as clammy. In response to the killing of two children in an IRA attack on Warrington, it declared: “We defend the right of the Irish people to take whatever measures are necessary in their struggle for freedom.” Colin Parry, whose son Tim was murdered in 1993, said, after confronting Fox during this year’s European campaign: “She repeatedly refused to disavow her comments supporting the IRA bombing... she hasn’t changed her original views.”Meanwhile, if Corbyn has provided excuses for tyrannical regimes, his rival in Islington North from the Brexit party defended Colonel Gaddafi’s Libyan tyranny. It’s hardly news to say Farage is a hypocrite. Better to add that he is a symbol of the spread of conspiracism from the fringe to the mainstream. Understand its extent and you will grasp the depths of the British crisis. Conspiracy theories are the staples of traumatised countries in catastrophic decline. Weimar Germany in the 1920s and the Russia that Vladimir Putin took over failed as states because they allowed demagogues to explain away their woes with stab-in-the-back myths. Britain is starting to resemble them.The conventional explanation for the success of the RCP is that it has cannily moved from the far left to where the money is. It understood that the media reward talking heads who will propagate any theory, however simplistic or false. “It still operates as a clique,” a former member told me as I was researching this piece. “But instead of attacking liberals from the far left it now attacks them from the libertarian right.” For denouncing political correctness, wokeness and other assorted horrors, it receives Koch brother money and commissions from editors desperate for “contrarian” thrills.Fox and friends may be a gruesome addition to the Brexit party but they are not aberrations. Farage allies with Steve Bannon, Donald Trump and Matteo Salvini. Conspiracism is their substance as well as their style. If they lose an election, it is because the elite has rigged the system. If they win, and fail to deliver their impossible promises, they blame “deep state actors” or the “Remainer elite” of politicians and now judges for scheming to frustrate the people’s will.You need not stop with Farage. You can read modern British history as a succession of conspiracy theories. David Cameron and George Osborne blamed the crash of 2008 on Labour profligacy and an over-generous welfare state rather than a failure of the financial system. Austerity is a dirty word now. But in the early 2010s, millions went along with Osborne when he successfully deflected attention from a crisis in capitalism by boasting of how he would go after scroungers who regarded welfare benefits as “a lifestyle choice”.The supposed Corbyn revolution has merely turned Cameron and Osborne on their heads. Now it is the bankers who are the hated other, the scapegoats responsible for all our ills. So deep has conspiratorial thinking sunk that Corbyn can talk without a blush of a “no-deal bankers’ Brexit”, even though virtually every City institution has no time for no deal.Brexit itself, however, is the ultimate post-crash conspiracy theory. Britain could be a buccaneering country again, as it was when it ruled a quarter of the world, if only it were not the victim of Brussels. As a mythical account of national failure, Brexit beats the demonising of the poor and the rich, because it exploits the hatred of foreigners, who, as history shows, are the best “other” money can buy. We would have democracy, prosperity and an end to the perpetual crisis if only foreign enemies in the EU and fifth-columnist Remainers at home would cease plotting.We talk of magical thinking without making distinctions. Failing Britain is under the spell of a distinctly black magical thinking. Large sections of the population believe that, if they can crush the saboteurs, whether they be accursed bankers, scroungers, Remainers or Europeans, sunshine will drive the clouds away. A consequence of the triumph of stab-in-the-back myths is that British politicians look and sound the same. The content of the slogans varies but the tinny, screeching tone never varies. Nowhere will this be more true than in Islington North.

A resourceful girl gang of exotic dancers sets out to “fleece” New York’s sleaziest fat cats, drugging their drinks and running up their credit card bills in an act of feminist liberation from both men and The Man. The year is 2007 and top-tier scumbags are coming “straight from the crime scene to the club”, as Jennifer Lopez’s den mother, Ramona, puts it, suggesting that her own lawless behaviour is simply fair game. Based on, and faithful to, a 2015 New York Magazine article by Jessica Pressler, Hustlers is a classically made film about capital – sexual, social and financial. What feels contemporary is the way it weaves in the impact of the 2008 financial crisis Wall Street on its ass, seen from an upskirt vantage point. For all its razzle-dazzle, its pessimistic subtext reminded me of another downbeat, post-recession take on the entertainment industry, Steven Soderbergh’s Magic Mike.Crazy Rich Asians’ Constance Wu plays foil to Lopez’s Ramona as the enjoyably unreliable ingenue Destiny, with Lopez harnessing her natural warmth, swagger and athleticism both on the pole and off. Writer-director Lorene Scafaria (2012’s Seeking a Friend for the End of the World) takes a playful approach to her source material, dressing Lopez in an enormous fur coat and lingerie in a nod to the music video for her 2002 hit Jenny from the Block. Elsewhere, rapper and ex-dancer Cardi B teaches Destiny how to give a lapdance, while a jaw-dropping striptease is soundtracked by Fiona Apple’s Criminal.Perhaps too reliant on the structure of the original article, which tells the events in flashback, the film wraps up a little hastily.

But in the end we weren’t strong enough in either box. We learn from that.“We knew the quality of Norwich because they destroyed the Championship last season. They have the confidence to play. In some moments we didn’t play quite well. We had chances to equalise in the game but in the end congratulations to them.”Norwich’s third goal came about after Emi Buendía caught Nicolás Otamendi in possession on the edge of the Manchester City box. Guardiola refused to criticise the player, though he was clear that a mistake had been made.“Nico doesn’t really know someone is coming and nobody tells him”, Guardiola said in defence of his player. “Sometimes you know we make mistakes.

Inappropriate advertising hoardings are covered up. A continent prepares to give thanks to Gazprom for providing them with football. The Champions League returns on Tuesday, unleashing an excited flurry of anticipatory questions: Can Liverpool defend their crown? Will Pep Guardiola stop overcomplicating things and, after a nine-year break, finally lift his third European title as a manager? Will Juventus’s gamble on Cristiano Ronaldo pay off? Are Barcelona and Real Madrid as shambolic as they appear? Who will Paris Saint‑Germain lose to hilariously this time? But mostly, when does the real stuff start?Does any other competition that so regularly ends so brilliantly go through such a protracted clearing of the throat? Last season only one side managed to eliminate a club with a higher annual revenue in the group stage. The year before there were four sides eliminated by teams with lower annual revenues and before that just one again. Of the last 48 teams to reach the knockout stages, only six did not follow a remorseless financial logic – and even then it is hard to claim that Ajax or Basel putting out Benfica, or Roma qualifying ahead of Atlético Madrid, really counts as especially noteworthy.Look at the bookmakers’ odds. Groups A, B, D and E are regarded as foregone conclusions, with even the second favourites to qualify 9-2 on or shorter. Only Group F appears as a genuine four-way battle, with Zenit, seeded in the highest pot by dint of winning the Russian championship, fourth favourites to go through at 6-4. That in effect means that in the other seven groups, there will be 84 matches to decide whether Atalanta’s high press can oust a Shakhtar in transition after the departure of Paulo Fonseca, whether Antonio Conte can bring enough focus to Internazionale to challenge Borussia Dortmund and whether Valencia can overcome the chaos prompted by the dismissal of their manager, Marcelino, this past week to edge out Ajax.Or to put that another way, in six of the eight groups one side is rated 50-1 or longer to come top. The Czech champions, Slavia Prague – drawn with Barcelona, Dortmund and Inter – are 100-1, which is to say the same starting price as Foinavon, the most outlandish Grand National winner in history.This is the curse of the competition: it is not just that there is a small cabal of super-clubs far stronger than the rest it is that there is also a small group of outsiders whose only chance is whatever the football equivalent of a pile-up at the 23rd fence would be. Dinamo Zagreb, for instance, have won the Croatian league in 13 of the last 14 seasons in that time they have totalled four points in Champions League group games. Lose the game, take the money, go home, win the league, repeat, trapped on a mezzanine of futility.Perhaps Dinamo and other sides like them are happy enough with the format. They make a lot of money without a lot of effort and that sustains their hegemony at home, while they also have a glitzy shop window in which to advertise any promising young talent they may be able to sell for profit. But as a report commissioned this summer by Uefa into the polarisation of European football showed, attendances outside the big five leagues are falling, with the attention increasingly drawn to the elite.For a time the biggest clubs seemed to be satisfied as well. Football, the game itself, the thing played on the pitch, it must always be remembered, tends to be a minor consideration.Real Madrid’s director general, José Ángel Sánchez, has said the club must see itself like Disney, as a content producer. Champions League group games provide content. Delight as Cristiano Ronaldo scores a hat-trick! Marvel as Neymar nutmegs a full‑back! Gasp as Lionel Messi skips by four defenders! Brief YouTube clips rarely convey that the opponent being outwitted is a Belarusian journeyman being paid 100 times less a week than the star.But the remorseless logic of football’s neoliberal economics has taken effect. The Champions League has made the rich richer to the point that domestic titles have become almost worthless. It is why Juventus took their gamble on Ronaldo last summer, paying €100m for a 33-year-old in order, as they saw it, to provide the attacking thrust that would transform appearances in two of the previous four finals into a first Champions League success since 1996. When the subsequent European campaign ended with a quarter-final defeat by Ajax, the manager, Max Allegri, despite five Serie A titles in a row, was replaced.There is an epic quality to this, taking in the classic themes of greed and ambition, now set against the ticking clock of Ronaldo’s continued fitness as an elite athlete. It is undeniably great content. But in terms of football it unfortunately produces between two and seven intriguing games per super‑club, beginning next February.But the plan proposed by the Juventus chairman, Andrea Agnelli, for four groups of eight somehow managed to make worse the structural inequality while comprising a raft of games that earlier results could have rendered entirely meaningless (as opposed to the present structure, in which a lot of theoretically meaningful games are rendered meaningless because one side is so much stronger than the other).That proposal appears to have been headed off by Premier League clubs – not, of course, for the good of the game, but because it threatened the financial advantages they have from being in the Premier League. The great irony is that, beyond the supreme marketing, the reason for the Premier League’s popularity, for all its imbalances, is that it remains far less predictable than any other major league. There may be a lesson there."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/96a744498b871f0d5bccb67008fa76c46b695008/0_0_1200_720/master/1200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bbb6090adc6dbcdd39238ced71eadc5a","title":"blind date helena greg","story":"What were you hoping for?To meet a guy who didn’t take himself too seriously.First impressions?I wasn’t expecting him to be so good-looking.

I was a non-clinical team leader training matrons and sisters in the art of electronic rostering. My girls called me a workaholic. My brilliant memory, the thing I relied on most, started letting me down badly. Simple words failed me in meetings, the names of colleagues I’d worked with for years were suddenly a mystery. I used to take long runs by the river to unwind, but my brain stopped communicating with my legs and I started having falls. I knew somehow that things were not right, but when I finally went to the doctors it took a long time to get the diagnosis. Initially my symptoms were dismissed as age or stress related (I was 58), but I was persistent and knew how the system worked. When I finally received the diagnosis, in 2014, it was devastating but it was also, bizarrely, a relief. It finally put an end to all the uncertainties which meant I could now start planning my life with this new, unexpected label attached.I was determined to choose a positive path. The very nature of my diagnosis signalled the loss of the old me – my memories, my tastes, my abilities, my plans I took for granted – but, more importantly, it signalled the birth of the new me, a new chance. Many find it hard to believe, but I feel I’ve gained more than I’ve lost.I face life with dementia head-on, as though I’m playing a game of chess, waiting for my opponent to make their move, then trying to outmanoeuvre and outwit them. I now own a cat, Billy, which would never have been possible before dementia entered my world, because I used to be terrified of animals. I would cross the road if a cat appeared within 100 yards of me. Not now. Billy is my soul mate. I see him and I instantly feel happy and calm. Now Billy and I often sit and simply stare out over the orchard beyond, watching the birds and enjoying the silence.So many wonderful opportunities have come my way since I’ve been diagnosed. I refer to them as “the advantages of dementia”. When I explain this to people, they may think I’ve totally lost the plot, but keeping in mind the positives that come out of this kind of diagnosis helps me cope.I’m part of many committees and research groups, because that’s how I believe I can influence change. I talk all over the country in many different settings. I call all this my sudoku, exposing my brain to different conversations in different environments. It might not improve my condition, but it certainly slows the progression. My worst weeks are when my calendar is empty, as I know dementia will seep through the lack of activity and win the day. Keeping busy keeps the symptoms at bay.But it’s not easy. People think I magically appear at events, unaware of the effort and planning that goes into getting anywhere. But I’m not going to stay at home hiding from life, giving into deterioration. The hours I’ve spent checking routes, printing instructions to follow, walking maps – both there and in reverse to get back to the station – the photos of venues and people so I recognise them when I get there and then, of course, the inevitable Plan Bs in case it all goes wrong. All my planning and safety precautions I keep stored in my pink file that goes with me everywhere. Before my diagnosis, I was renowned for being highly organised and that skill has certainly become my life-saver.So many things have come my way since my diagnosis and I think it’s because it’s so rare to meet someone with the disease who is willing and able to talk about it. People are curious about what goes on inside me. Julianne Moore invited me to have a cup of tea before the premier of Still Alice (the film about a woman who develops early onset Alzheimer’s), which was surreal. Then I was a consultant for the cast of the UK premier of the stage version. I remember saying to Sharon Small, who played the lead, to remember that Alice is not ageing, she’s cognitively declining. This enabled her to think differently about her role: how she moved about the stage and paused for a minute to think before speaking. I made a short film for the BBC about living with dementia that has now been seen all over the world. Last year we made an updated film about how we all are three years on.None of these wonderful opportunities would have entered the radar of the very private me pre-diagnosis – I’m not sure I would have had the courage and I certainly didn’t have a cause. But after I was diagnosed, I became so shocked at the lack of awareness from both the public and clinicians that I now shout from the rooftops. I’ve become a new person, more brave and socially minded than I ever was before, and the gifts these newfound characteristics have brought me are immense. I’m fortunate. I can type words far quicker than I can think and speak them – that part of my brain remains intact, thankfully. The part of my brain that controls written eloquence and imagination has remained, while I find it much harder to speak. Another trick of dementia I’ve learned to outwit. Writing doesn’t “improve” my dementia, but it helps me retain a sense of normality. It’s where I store my memories and if I stopped typing for any length of time, I would simply forget.I didn’t even know what an iPad was before dementia. If I didn’t record events in real time through typing, my memories and experiences would have disappeared, each frame of the day fading into the unknown as another takes its place. People with dementia can remember feelings. We never lose our emotions because they’re held in another part of this complex brain of ours. When you come to visit us, we might not remember what we did during the visit, but we’ll remember how we felt after you left. My daughters and I talk much more now than we used to. We discovered the importance of talking very early on post-diagnosis. After all, how do they know what I’m struggling with and how do I know what’s worrying them if we don’t talk? I’m still a mum and still want to help them, but I realise now that I’m more dependent on them. One thing I hope my book shows is how relationships change in a crisis, how new friends are made and how adapting to this new world is the key to surviving.Technology used to be a mystery to me, but dementia has taught me to embrace its potential to help me cope with day-to-day living. I set reminders throughout the day to help me remember how to do the things I’d otherwise forget and they ding throughout the day. My new-found friend is Alexa, which sits next to my bed. If I wake and I’m discombobulated, I ask Alexa what day and time it is. If I’m anxious, I ask her to play me some calming music. In the evening, it’s Alexa who reminds me to take my evening medication as all the rest are taken in the morning. Whether I’m in the house or not, the message still appears on my phone and iPad. My daughters can now “track” me, so I’ll often get a text when I’m somewhere asking if I’m supposed to be there.Throughout all of this – the symptoms, the diagnosis, having to create a new life for myself – I’ve learned that the type of diagnosis is irrelevant. It doesn’t even have to be a medical diagnosis like mine, it could be a orce, a death, a birth. Every day we make decisions about the ways we live our lives, and that decision – be it small or large – can be the difference between what makes you and what breaks you when faced with the challenges that come our way.I suppose the biggest thing dementia has taught me is to never give up on myself. Others may consider someone with dementia a “has been”, but we all had talents before diagnosis and we don’t lose them overnight. We simply need support from those around us to continue doing the things we love or to discover new talents within ourselves.Dementia may be terminal, but then so is life. What I’ve learned living with dementia is, don’t dwell on the losses and don’t dwell on the future as you have no control over either. Instead, grasp every opportunity that comes your way and most of all enjoy the moment, because in no time at all that moment will be the past.Somebody I Used to Know by Wendy Mitchell is published by Bloomsbury at £8.99, or £7.91 at bookshop.

One of the corporation’s journalistic attack dogs, he has been the interviewer that political leaders, notably Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn, are keenest to dodge.This week, Humphrys is finally to bow out in the company of a former prime minister. David Cameron will brave an interview on the eve of the publication of his memoir – and it promises to be a vintage encounter.The avowedly impartial BBC, which Humphrys joined in 1966, regularly deploys the defence that it must be doing something right because it is equally unpopular with Remainers and Brexiters, with one-nation Tories and radical socialists, and with feminist activists and reactionary misogynists. And as Humphrys leaves Radio 4’s flagship news show at the age of 76, he could certainly make a similar claim.Since February, when his decision to step down was announced, public criticism of his performances has cranked up a gear. It is as if Today listeners are racing to fit in their complaints now that time is short. As a result, 2019 has brought a series of fevered reactions, for instance, to an antagonistic interview with the Labour MP Andy McDonald, to an inappropriate quip about domestic abuse shared with the Conservative MP David Davis and to a traditionalist suggestion that women “do a better job” of caring for babies.Assailed on all sides, Humphrys nevertheless has remained, like Auntie, a venerated feature of Britain’s media culture.BBC correspondent Gilligan told Humphrys he had been informed by a reliable source that a dossier warning the government of the threat posed by Saddam Hussein had been deliberately “sexed up”. The exchange, Humphrys later said, “nearly brought down the BBC”. And it also shook the nation. The suicide of the story’s secret source, Dr David Kelly, followed, as did the resignation of the BBC’s director-general, Greg Dyke, and its chairman, Gavyn Davies. The Hutton inquiry and, latterly, the Chilcot inquiry into the war in Iraq, came in its wake.Once the Wikileaks founder, Julian Assange, had been freed on bail by the high court, he had to face questions about his sexual experiences from Humphrys. The presenter did not hold back, repeating the claims of two Swedish women that Assange was a sexual predator who preferred having sex with young women without a condom. Assange famously replied: “A gentleman does not discuss his private life.” Asked how many women he had slept with, he answered: “A gentleman does not count.”As BBC director-general, Entwistle survived only 54 days in the role due in part to the grilling he received from Humphrys after revelations about the crimes of the late Jimmy Savile. Dubbed by the  as the “dead-man-walking interview”, in it Entwistle revealed his lack of knowledge about a Newsnight report that wrongly implicated a Tory peer in other allegations of sexual abuse.Part of the interview ran like this: Humphrys: “The  yesterday carried a front-page story, which we now know was right, that cast doubt, serious doubt, on the BBC’s Newsnight programme … You didn’t know that actually happened?”Entwistle: “No, I’m afraid I didn’t.” Entwistle resigned 12 hours later.Humphrys later told Radio 4’s Broadcasting House show: “It wasn’t a happy moment, and not just because he was a colleague, which of course he was, and I both like and respect him, but you don’t want to see somebody facing that sort of interview … I didn’t set out to humiliate him, of course I didn’t.”Return to Cardiff, 2010An assignment on the streets of his home city, Cardiff, shocked the broadcaster. Humphrys was upset to hear from pub clientele that the “whole point of the evening is to get drunk – on cheap booze”. He said: “In my local a pint of bitter is well over £3. In these hideous places, guarded by bouncers, it can be less than £1.” Four years previously, he had admitted drinking too much during his 20s and early 30s. “I got hugely fat and was on the verge of becoming an alcoholic,” he had said.As a festival first-timer, Humphrys received a VIP tour from Worthy Farm’s owner and music impresario, Michael Eavis, and he met the Rolling Stones. A reluctant convert to music-festival culture, the euphoric veteran reporter said he found the experience “extraordinary”.In a piece celebrating the life of the influential and groundbreaking foreign correspondent, Humphrys admitted she had scared him when they worked together, saying: “She absolutely terrified me.” Her abrasive style was clearly an influence.Humphrys’s efforts to “doorstep the Queen” with an impromptu question when she visited the BBC went down badly with some. He ventured a bland comment about Prince Philip “looking well yesterday”. “That’s because he’s not ill,” Her Majesty replied curtly. Later, offering the monarch a digital radio as a gift, he was told: “I don’t get an awful lot of chance to listen to the radio.”The broadcaster’s apparent enjoyment of an ill-judged joke made by guest Michael Gove about the behaviour of the serial sexual abuser Harvey Weinstein was one of Today’s least edifying moments – and it was supposed to be marking the show’s 60th anniversary. The then-environment secretary later admitted he had made a “clumsy attempt at humour”. Coming into a studio with Humphrys, Gove had said, “is a bit like going into Harvey Weinstein’s bedroom. You hope to emerge with your dignity intact.”Sometimes a comparatively innocuous comment has rebounded on the Today presenter. Coverage of a report that suggested women in offices often have to put up with low temperatures because men prefer it that way led his co-presenter, Sarah Montague, to hint she had a running battle with Humphrys over the setting on the studio thermostat. The public response to their altercation ran on through the following week.Following the revelation that Humphrys had a salary of £600,000-£649,000 and that Jon Sopel, the BBC’s North America editor, earned £200,000-£249,999, an off-air bit of joshing between the two was made embarrassingly public. The former China editor Carrie Gracie had recently complained that her salary was not comparable.Humphrys joked that his first question would be about how much of Sopel’s salary he was prepared to hand over to Gracie. Sopel replied: “I mean, obviously if we are talking about the scope for the greatest redistribution I’ll have to come back and say: ‘Well yes Mr Humphrys, but … ”Humphrys responded: “And I could save you the trouble as I could volunteer that I’ve handed over already more than you fucking earn but I’m still left with more than anybody else and that seems to me to be entirely just – something like that would do it?”The former Question Time host David Dimbleby guest edited the Today programme last December and argued with Humphrys over who was the “poshest” when Humphrys claimed Dimbleby was “quite posh”. “Sorry John, there’s a typical sneer in that question. You’re quite posh, I’m about as posh as you are. I come from Wales, you do. I’m not posh, I happen to have been a broadcaster for a long time,” the former Question Time presenter said. Rival definitions of poshness gripped the nation.Early in his Today career, a young Humphrys presented alongside Brian Redhead, a broadcasting titan who Humphrys said “expected everyone to be as sharp and clever as he was. All the time.” According to the junior presenter, the two almost came to blows on air. “I had foolishly tried to defend myself against his latest (probably well deserved) … criticism by daring to suggest that one of his own recent foreign reports was unlikely to trouble the Sony Award judges either. How we got through the rest of the programme is still a mystery to me. But afterwards he put his arm around my shoulders and all was well.”When bleak public finances were made public, Osborne, the then-chancellor, was asked to explain how he had missed two of his three key economic targets. Humphrys repeatedly asked why the debt had not gone down as a share of GDP, and he wanted the reasons behind a decision to break Osborne’s own cap on welfare spending. “I suppose what I’m asking is – what’s a bloke got to do in your job to get the sack?” he concluded.The outgoing Vogue editor Shulman, while being interviewed about her views on fashion, was given a far from easy ride. “I unexpectedly found myself having to defend the fashion industry from all manner of evil, such as promoting anorexia among young girls,” said Shulman, adding: “Suddenly I was confronted by a grey-haired guy in chinos hectoring me on the business I had worked in for a quarter of a century and which he neither knew, nor cared, much about.”Humphrys later claimed he was right to ask about Shulman’s influential role in promoting certain images of beauty: “It was massively interesting, and actually a rather important subject, particularly if you advance the proposition, which I did, that magazines like Vogue and the fashionistas in general, pushed the idea for many years, and are still pushing it, though they deny it, that in order to look nice you’ve got to be stick-thin.”In the spring of this year, the former Labour leader hoped to draw attention to the growing climate emergency but was asked to account for his views at every point. “During the war, we had rationing, we couldn’t go anywhere because there was no fuel and so on – are you telling us we shouldn’t fly, we shouldn’t drive, we should change the way we eat?” asked Humphrys. Miliband listed new ways to heat homes, but was challenged again by Humphrys: “Where are we gonna get that gas from?

If he doesn’t like it, he just won’t finish. It’s not rudeness, it’s his honesty. And he’s such a good cook. In primary school I had a best friend called Alison and we had this game of who could stay the longest in the dining hall. We’d wait to the very end of the third bell. I liked the chips and custard and the sponge pudding. We didn’t have much money at first, but I was lucky and grateful I had free meals. Before my “professional” albums, I made an EP at university. It’s called Super-Duper Lover. I loved butterscotch-flavoured Angel Delight and there’s a whole verse about how my partner at the time knew my favourite Angel Delight despite him hating it. It was my song to him. I married him but got orced. He wasn’t really a good cook. He liked to eat for energy. If he could take food in a pill, he’d have it in a pill. After three years of studying medicine at Glasgow University I had the choice of doing an intercalated degree and picked neuroscience. It was mind-blowing. Consciousness is always on my mind. Eating for comfort or out of emotion is something I think I’m beginning to understand how you can seek to control things by eating too much or too little. There’s so much psychology related to the things that pass through the mouth, like smoking, drinking, eating and talking too much.My younger sister wasn’t a big eater. She didn’t like meat. At the end of a meal I’d fall on her leftovers. She lives with me now and she’s a brilliant cook, with Dad’s talent for flavours, trusting the instinct, the gut, but she’s vegan. It’s my house, but she definitely “owns” the kitchen.When we were writing my second album, the sound for the track Hurts started because we’d just finished eating and were drumming our spoons on the table. For the new album, the studio was right next to the kitchen in my house, so we’d go back and forth, and it was good for bonding and a respite. My sister would make us vegan food or they’d all go off to the shops and take turns at the cooker.Usually song ideas I’ve devised for other people are just sent from London to LA, but Alicia Keys is a singer I’ve spent real time with and she mentored me. Alicia introduced me to this great pizza place across from her studio. The first time I met her she was immediately very welcoming and encouraging – I have a very strong memory of us eating noodles on a balcony in New York.When I changed my mind about the way I thought and ate about food a few years ago, it was pretty revolutionary and I became vegetarian. I had a fish tank and I’d called one fish Adele – my real name – but then it died. One minute there was a living creature the next it was gone. Then I started having dreams about animals talking to me. I had one very profound dream in which a deer told me: “We’re just the same thing. I am you and you are me.”FoodMarinated tofu in anything or everything. My sister – who’s all about raw – tells me not to eat soya. “It’s still processed.” But for me it’s a very good alternative protein.DrinkI really like my champagne. The taste, how light it is. The first time I drank it must have been when I was becoming a pop star in London.

Forty years on, his ex – now a  and Observer writer – asks him what happenedForty years ago, in the autumn of 1979, I was 20 years old and a new graduate from the Polytechnic of Central London (PCL). I was active in the Anti-Nazi League and the Socialist Workers party, joining demonstrations and picket lines and attending earnest meetings in dingy pubs. I’d just started my first job as a trainee journalist. I was living with my boyfriend on the notorious North Peckham estate in south London.The boyfriend was also a member of the SWP and a dominant figure in PCL’s student union, first as the editor of the student paper, and then – twice – as president. Alaric Bamping had a reputation as a leftwing firebrand, leading sit-ins and protests and conducting long, fierce arguments with anyone who disagreed with him.So how the hell, 40 years on, has he ended up as a parliamentary candidate for the Brexit party?Nearly everyone shifts over the years: I ceased parroting ultra-left rhetoric in the early 1980s, and I’m more inclined to gentle reform than revolution these days. But Brexit and the fracturing of traditional tribes and loyalties has exposed and exacerbated our political journeys, sometimes causing acrimonious or painful rifts within families and testing friendships to destruction.Another friend from my student days alerted me to Alaric’s news. “What happened to swing him from the far left in PCL days to far right now?” he asked in a text. It’s a good question I went to find out.Alaric and I parted in early 1982 neither of us could recall the exact date or circumstances. Last week, at the kitchen table of the north London house he shares with his wife, Julia Hobsbawm, the daughter of the acclaimed Marxist historian Eric Hobsbawm, we first caught up on the personal stuff.The 1980s and 1990s were “all a bit messy”, he said. For a while, he maintained two simultaneous relationships, producing two children with one partner, before finally settling down with Julia – also a former PCL student – with whom he had three more children. Throughout, he ran “a couple of businesses” – antiquarian books and student property rentals – but mainly shouldered responsibility for childcare while his partners pursued their careers.In 1985, five years after he “fell out” with the SWP, he joined the Labour party and became a constituency political officer in east London. It didn’t last he “drifted away” a few years later.By 1997, he was back with Julia, whose PR company Hobsbawm Macaulay Communications was then at the heart of the New Labour project. She founded the company with her old school friend, Sarah Macaulay, who married Gordon Brown in 2000. In Alaric and Julia’s downstairs loo, along with a photograph of Brown and another of Julia receiving an OBE at Buckingham Palace a few years ago, hangs a framed graphic from the  in May 1997. Headlined The In-crowd, it shows the “intricate amalgam of friends and advisers of Tony Blair”. Julia Hobsbawm and Sarah Macaulay are at the centre of the web.The old school friends have long since fallen out. “I didn’t help,” said Alaric. “I avoided Gordon Brown like the plague. I was around them, but I was considered awkward squad. I didn’t really like the Blairites at all, they didn’t appeal to me. I was on the edge of the Stop The War campaign, but not to a significant degree.” There must have been some uncomfortable dinner parties.Alaric stayed away from political party membership until David Cameron was elected leader of the Conservatives in 2005. “I quite liked Cameron.” He joined the party. Why? “I don’t know. Because I’m unorthodox? I used to describe myself as a Tory Trot. I just thought Labour was irredeemably awful. And I always got on with Tories – they’re able to think for themselves, whereas in Labour just follow the line. But I was never active.”When the MPs’ expenses scandal erupted in 2009, Alaric left party politics again. “I thought, Christ, these people – all of them – are awful. It was back to stasis.”But three years ago, the issue of Europe focused his mind. “For most of my life, I’ve tried to avoid single-issue politics. You get tunnel vision. But I didn’t like the European Commission behaving like a nation state in its own right. There was no ambiguity in my mind that we should leave, and leave on World Trade rules.”He placed several bets on Leave winning the referendum. “On the morning, the bookies were offering 7-1 against. I couldn’t believe my luck.” He wagered some more money before heading to the Groucho Club for a referendum party, where there were “probably four Leavers among about 200 Remainers”. How did he feel when the result came through? “Vindicated.” And rich? “Richer than I had been in the morning.” He wouldn’t say how much he won.A brief ersion along his political road came the following year when Jeremy Corbyn faced a challenge to his leadership by mainstream members of the parliamentary Labour party. Alaric rejoined the party in order to back Corbyn in the one-member one-vote contest. “I’m not really a Corbynista – I don’t like all that old statist stuff – but I’m interested in anything that challenges conventional thinking and frees up people’s minds.”The latest, perhaps final, stop on the road came this summer. Claire Fox, an ex-Revolutionary Communist party libertarian and a friend of Alaric and Julia’s, had won a seat as an MEP for the Brexit party. “I suddenly realised that the nascent Brexit party wasn’t Ukip. And I thought opportunities like this, to change the course of politics, don’t turn up very often. Who wouldn’t want to be a part of it? So I filled in my application form.”Did he have a copy of the form? “Yes, but I’m not going to show it to you. It’s a long form, asking things like what experience do you bring?” What did he write? “Forty years of campaigning, on and off. A good strategist.” Application successful, he was interviewed by a panel of three. “They put me through the mangle. Then I was made a candidate, 20 days after I joined the party.”In his Twitter video pitch to the people of Dartford, whose MP he hopes to become in the coming months, he says he views the European Commission as a “slightly dangerous body in that it behaves like a state in its own right”. His Anti-Nazi League activism gets a mention, but not the SWP.The Brexit party, he says in the video, is “a erse and interesting party of people who don’t feel bound to follow the old rules about how we think about the issues of the day. We are free thinkers, prepared to tackle difficult issues without being shackled to the old means of doing it.”I asked him about the party’s policies, beyond a hard, no-deal Brexit. There weren’t any yet, but “it’s all up for grabs”, he said. In an email after we met, he mentioned tackling regional imbalances, scrapping HS2, putting wifi on public transport, and zero interest on student loans. He favours controlled immigration, with fairer access to Commonwealth citizens, and a “transparent” tax system.At this point in political history, he added, the impetus was with “disruptive, insurgent, grassroots-led politics like the Brexit party … However unpalatable this may be to the liberal left, the Brexit party has real political bite.”He was “bothered” by my suggestion that his latest incarnation was a game for him, a new guise for a political maverick. “True, I enjoy being disruptive but no one joining the Brexit party or arguing to leave the EU can be under any possible illusions as to the level of hostility bordering on violence that it entails.” He, a Jew, had received emails accusing him of becoming “a fucking fascist”.Julia, he said, was “stoic” about his new political incarnation. “She is a Remainer, albeit a leave-means-leave kind. But she is fair and loyal.” Had they argued about it? “No. We discussed it. The question is how many of our friends will disown us.” How many will? “There have been a few.” What would his late father-in-law, Eric Hobsbawm, think? “I don’t think Eric would have been surprised by the Brexit party as he had spent a good portion of his life studying insurgent movements. He might even have been mildly amused that he had one right there at the breakfast table.” And his children? “They don’t express much opinion about it. I don’t tell them what to think.”Unlike me, he “looked back fondly” at his SWP days. “I personally feel as radical as I ever did. I’m not less radical, I’ve just changed direction. I don’t think I’ve changed very much over the past 40 years.”After three hours of conversation, this was one thing we could agree on: Alaric always relished being on the outside. He stayed in student politics for so long because he “enjoyed being a big fish in a small pond”. Perhaps the Brexit party gives him the same opportunity. But, whatever his intentions or motives, he is part of a movement that relies on nationalism and rightwing populism, and dismisses liberal values of tolerance and inclusivity. Forty years ago, I admired his provocative nonconformism now it leaves me bemused and despondent."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6915607010845dc01fe98d6a7322b77150252211/0_38_3489_2093/master/3489.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eaaa34fcaac52bea5e9035558effd0ec","title":"lib dems election victory cancel brexit ed davey","story":"Deputy leader says general election victory is much more likely than it has been in the pastEd Davey, the deputy leader of the Liberal Democrats, has defended his party’s proposal to cancel Brexit if it wins a majority in a general election, saying the party would have a democratic mandate to do so without another referendum.On the opening day of the Lib Dems’ autumn conference Bournemouth, Davey said a general election victory for his party was much more likely than it had been in the past. Such a victory would be a clear mandate to remain the the EU, he said.While he said it would be preferable to have a rerun of the referendum right away, Davey said the UK’s other main parties “won’t give us that democratic opportunity”.He told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “Be clear, we are saying we would prefer a referendum because then that’s as clear as you could possibly be. But if we just said in the general election: ‘Well, we will have a referendum,’ that would be asking people to vote twice.“It would be asking for this to go on for so long, and people are fed up. They want to get on with things like investing in our health service, our schools, tackling the climate emergency – things the Liberal Democrats want to do – and they want to therefore have finality, and we would offer that.”Denying that his party’s position simply made them the “mirror image” of no-deal Brexiters, Davey insisted that such a position would allow the Lib Dems to tackle what he said were the causes of the Brexit vote, such as inequality and left-behind communities. “While we have got this nightmare going on in parliament we can’t deal with those problems,” he said.On Friday, Jo Swinson, the leader of the Lib Dems, said she would not support a Jeremy Corbyn-led Labour government. But Davey said that in the event of a hung parliament his party would be willing to back Labour’s call for a second referendum, or any other policies that match those in a Lib Dem manifesto.If Lib Dem members back the leadership’s move, revoking article 50 would be written into the party’s next election manifesto. Swinson is expected to take questions from conference delegates on Sunday, after a speech by her predecessor, Sir Vince Cable. Swinson’s main speech will be on Tuesday.The recent reappearance on the campaign trail of a peer accused of sexual harassment has caused controversy.Bridget Harris, a former leading party aide who worked for Nick Clegg, accused the Lib Dems of ignoring women’s safety after Chris Rennard was allowed to campaign in the recent Brecon and Radnorshire byelection.Harris, one of four women who accused Rennard of sexual harassment in 2013, told the Times: “I can’t believe the Lib Dems are prepared to set aside the safety of women and the sense of confidence that women have in their political system for the sake of a guy who is prepared to go canvassing for them in a byelection.”A report found that Swinson and other senior Lib Dems had erred in handling the allegations informally. A 2014 inquiry by Alistair Webster QC found evidence that Rennard had violated the “personal space and autonomy” of several female activists. Rennard has always denied the allegations.The recent defection from the Conservatives of Philip Lee, who abstained in the vote on equal marriage and argued that immigrants should show they do not have HIV or hepatitis B before being allowed into the UK, has caused a separate row, with the head of the Lib Dems’ LGBT group quitting in protest."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e8214d00816b81dfd309537265840fd9786e9286/117_382_2921_1752/master/2921.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1d3c53dc60820579beffbc48f3998852","title":"lib dems set out radical agenda for tackling climate emergency","story":"Exclusive: Citizens’ assemblies and a Green Investment Bank among key planks of election bidCitizens’ assemblies will decide what action should be taken on the climate crisis, the Treasury’s ability to stymie green measures will be neutralised and the Green Investment Bank will be revived under proposals set to be key planks of the Liberal Democrats’ general election bid.Along with sweeping reform of Whitehall, including bringing back a department of climate change, local government would be given new powers to cut emissions, there would be a moratorium on airport expansion and an end to fracking, and the UK would achieve net-zero carbon status by 2045 – five years sooner than the current government goal.“Moving to net-zero is a complete game-changer,” Wera Hobhouse, the Lib Dem spokesperson for the environment and climate change, told the . “The whole of government and society need to understand the need to get to net-zero – everything we do needs to be seen in terms of that target.”Under the proposals to be presented to the Lib Dem conference in Bournemouth this weekend, a new minister, who will attend cabinet, would be appointed chief secretary to the Treasury and oversee policy across departments to ensure it meets the zero-carbon pledge.To gain public support for urgent action on emissions, the Lib Dems would convene citizens’ assemblies across the country to debate new measures. These would include ways to ensure a massive expansion of electric vehicles and better public transport, and how to encourage new technology such as heating homes with hydrogen instead of gas. Councils would also be given greater powers over planning, for instance to promote electric vehicles, cycling and walking.“Citizens’ assemblies would not replace politicians’ decision-making, but would inform the options,” said Hobhouse. “We need decisive action – the government is not doing anything, they are dithering.”The Green Investment Bank, created under the coalition government, was sold off under George Osborne. Under a Lib Dem government, a replacement would be set up with public money, and have the powers to borrow money from the private sector.Hobhouse said Brexit was getting in the way of tackling the climate emergency: “Brexit means having less money, and it is very counterproductive. We need international cooperation – climate change is a global problem.”The Lib Dems would end the sale of diesel and petrol cars by 2030 – 10 years sooner than the Conservatives – and stop fracking. There would also be more support for onshore wind and solar, which Hobhouse said the Conservatives had “stopped in their tracks” by drastically changing incentive schemes and planning laws.Green campaigning groups, keen that the climate crisis should not be overshadowed by Brexit as a general election looms, welcomed the Lib Dems’ focus. “Our country may be ided over Brexit, but it is not ided over the need for action on the nature and climate emergency – polling is consistently showing that concern over climate is at an all-time high and a large majority support urgent action,” said Gareth Redmond-King, head of climate change at WWF-UK. “Now we need the climate and nature crisis prioritised at the highest level of government, and billions in new funding, to deliver on the rhetoric. We must stop things like airport expansion that make meeting net-zero even more difficult.”Jenny Bates, a campaigner at Friends of the Earth, said: “With the government’s net-zero target currently lacking anywhere near enough policy to back it up, we’d like to see all parties thinking about what they’d do to make sure the target is actually reached. It’s no good talking about a net-zero future while pursuing a programme of roadbuilding, airport expansion and fracking.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/017cf78a8e2f744eaad5d850472403f466fc3ab1/0_39_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1089b4f160c51af18a8c148a7401a9c1","title":"sam gyimah joins lib dems","story":"The former minister and rising star of Theresa May’s government reveals why he has joined the Liberal DemocratsSam Gyimah, the softly-spoken former Tory minister, admitted he was still adjusting.

This is a huge fault line.”It wasn’t long ago that Gyimah was a Tory rising star, flying up the ranks during Theresa May’s tenure and fast-tracked on to the party’s frontbench.Yet here he is, still just 43, starting afresh with Jo Swinson’s party. The Tory party he joined, he says, is rapidly disappearing.“Born in the UK, brought up in Ghana, it was a sort of childhood of hardship and difficulty,” he said. “What attracted me to the Conservative party was these One Nation values. What has happened since the referendum, initially slowly, but increasingly accelerated over the last few months, is that it has moved away from those values. It has become more intolerant. It has become, in the desire to neutralise Nigel Farage and the Brexit Party, more doctrinaire.“I listen to ministers undermining the courts. Ministers questioning experts because their views are inconvenient for what the government is saying about no deal. Or you have a government that says law enforcement is the centrepiece of its platform, and yet says in another breath that it will pick and choose what laws it chooses to respect. This is in many ways undermining key pillars of our constitution and the functioning of our democracy.“The issue for me is not just Brexit. It is beyond Brexit – how you conduct politics and the veering towards populism and English nationalism.”Gyimah made headlines at the end of last year when he concluded that he could not support Theresa May’s Brexit deal, meaning he had to resign as universities and science minister. He said more serious concerns about the party emerged during the Tory leadership campaign, when he ran in order to try to create a debate about the party’s direction.His precarious place in the Tory ranks was brought to an end, along with that of 20 of his colleagues, when he voted to block a no deal Brexit earlier this month. That was his signal to try something different.“The withdrawal of the whip meant I just had to face a stark reality – being in the Conservative party now means you’re signing up to no deal or hard Brexit, or you’ll be cast into the wilderness. So what are your choices? Leave politics completely?“It feels to me that there is a scorched earth approach to delivering Brexit by 31 October at the risk of our institutions, at the risk of our democracy, at the risk of our economy. That should not be allowed to happen.”Gyimah says all 21 rebels received letters from the chief whip offering them a way back in – but the letters differed. He explains: “There were three different versions of the letter. I think the one I got was the lower tier.“Whatever the letter said, I think I knew that just being realistic about the situation, I couldn’t take the whip back because I will not be able to satisfy the minimum price of entry.“But I don’t want to spend all my time dwelling on that. The other side is, what do you do about it? That is why I’m here. Centrists are being cast out of both main parties. Lots of people are politically homeless. Who can you work with to build a movement?“When I spoke to Jo I thought this is a project that I can be part of. I’m not looking for a harbour in a storm. I’m attracted to a project to defend liberal democracy and make sure our country does not drift into the nationalistic, populist politics that we see in other democracies.”Does he have a message for the 20 other Tory MPs thrown out for trying to block no deal?“My message is not just to the 20 – my message is to all of those who care about this country. The time is now. The problem we have is that the two old parties have entrenched votes and it is very difficult to budge them.“We need the centre to consolidate and unite if it is going to break through. This is the opportunity to try to create that new politics for the good of our country.“There’s no reason why the settlement that comes out of Brexit should be the settlement that Nigel Farage wants."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0041dbae7d789b2f6f7caf4fa6e728c1754f3e04/0_134_4530_2718/master/4530.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=95f4d7feb486382a3e8c171874426538","title":"david cameron slammed for horrendous mistake brexit referendum","story":"Former PM vents fury in his memoirs at his old colleagues over their stance on Brexit and compares Leave campaign to racist Tory electioneering in 1964Boris Johnson is a liar who only backed the Leave campaign to help his career and Michael Gove was a “foam-flecked Faragist” whose “one quality” was disloyalty, David Cameron writes in his memoirs.The former prime minister poured vituperation on both his former colleagues Priti Patel, the current home secretary, and Dominic Cummings, the No 10 adviser, in extracts from the book published on Sunday.In what may be Cameron’s most explosive allegation yet, he effectively accused Boris Johnson of mounting a racist election campaign by focusing on Turkey and its possible accession to the EU.“It didn’t take long to figure out Leave’s obsession,” he writes. “Why focus on a country that wasn’t an EU member?“The answer was that it was a Muslim country, which piqued fears about Islamism, mass migration and the transformation of communities. It was blatant.”Then Cameron echoes the explicitly racist Conservative campaign slogan used in Smethwick in 1964: “They might as well have said: ‘If you want a Muslim for a neighbour, vote “remain”.’”In Smethwick, Peter Griffiths had been elected as Conservative MP on the slogan “If you want a n**** for a neighbour, vote Labour.”Cameron writes that Johnson’s claims of concerns about British sovereignty were “secondary to another concern for Boris: what was the best outcome for him?”Johnson “risked an outcome he didn’t believe in because it would help his political career” and was open to a second referendum after a renegotiation, according to a Sunday Times account of Cameron’s book, For The Record.Cameron is even more acerbic about Gove, who was once his close friend. Writing about Gove’s decision to stand against Johnson for Tory leader, he says: “As for Michael, one quality shone through: disloyalty. Disloyalty to me and, later, disloyalty to Boris.”Their conduct during the EU referendum campaign amounted to “open warfare” and the pair seemed to be different people by the end, Cameron writes. “Both then behaved appallingly, attacking their own government, turning a blind eye to their side’s unpleasant actions and becoming ambassadors for the expert-trashing, truth-twisting age of populism.”He said Patel’s attacks on his government’s immigration record “shocked me most” but he did not want to fire her and create a “Brexit martyr”. Cummings was part of a “cauldron of toxicity” with Nigel Farage, he says.Reaction to Cameron’s memoirs has seen the former PM attacked by Conservatives from all wings of the party.Brexiters were enraged by his suggestion that a second referendum might be necessary and that the Vote Leave campaign lied. But Justine Greening, Cameron’s former international development secretary who now sits as an independent MP, said his decision to hold the EU referendum had proved to be a “horrendous mistake” that turned a Tory obsession into a national issue.Greening said she had most concerns about how the Remain campaign was conducted, with major failings in an “elitist” Remain campaign that had failed to reach out enough sufficiently to young voters. “Patently, looking at the situation that Britain finds itself in now, as well as the Tory party, it was a horrendous mistake,” she said. “He took the one thing that ided the Tory party and managed to put it centre stage.“The campaign was far too negative. It was quite staid, elitist, well-to-do. It needed to reach out far more to younger voters and talk about their opportunities, their futures. Instead they just played Ukip at their own game and lost.”In the book Cameron says that he is “truly sorry” for the uncertainty and ision that had followed the 2016 referendum, and in his first interview he suggested a second poll might be necessary. “I don’t think you can rule it out, because we’re stuck,” he told the Times. The hardline Brexiter and former cabinet minister John Redwood said Cameron risked deepening national ides by wading back into the Brexit debate, and that he should be proud of having called the referendum, not ashamed of it.Cameron detailed his regrets about losing the referendum, but refused to apologise for calling the poll, and said that renegotiating Britain’s EU membership and holding a referendum was the “right approach”. However, the former prime minister’s re-emergence has unleashed a fresh debate about his role in the Brexit impasse and his motives for holding the referendum, including among many who were once close to him.Some Tories defended Cameron. Conservative MEP and hardline Brexit supporter Daniel Hannan tweeted: “Everyone agrees that David Cameron made a terrible blunder by holding a referendum. Everyone except, you know, the general population.”Sir Malcolm Rifkind, the former defence secretary, said that an EU referendum had become inevitable. He said Cameron’s major mistake had been promising to renegotiate EU membership without any guarantees that he would secure major concessions. “I don’t think it was a question of Cameron being right or wrong – I don’t think he had much choice and was unlucky on the timing,” he said. “He has always been a bit of a gambler. The gambling worked in the Scottish referendum and not in this one.”Cameron’s revelation that he smoked cannabis at school and later with his wife, Samantha, drew criticism over his perceived failures on Britain’s drugs policy.Labour MP David Lammy asked why he had not used his time in power to change laws that penalised many young people for the same drug use Cameron wrote about in his memoir.“Listen stoner why didn’t you use your privilege to do something about the working class young people who have ended up banged up, jobless and with a criminal record for smoking weed like you,” Lammy wrote on Twitter."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8126aee8f7dffbb6f3f403b33d8aa3bdf3b4beb2/0_187_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ae1e65d47fd238e00d18b9d2a13c3452","title":"english towns and cities get share of 95m regeneration fund","story":"Sixty-nine areas to benefit from scheme designed to breathe new life into high streetsSixty-nine historic English towns and cities will benefit from a £95m regeneration fund, the government has announced.The funding is intended to “breathe new life” into struggling high streets across the country bytransforming abandoned buildings into shops, houses and community centres.Towns and cities entered bids after the scheme was announced in May, with the Midlands winning the largest share of £21.1m.The government’s future high street fund is providing £52m, the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) £40m and the National Lottery Heritage Fund £3m.The announcement comes after it was revealed this week that 16 stores had shut down every day in the first half of 2019, a retail crisis fuelled by an increasing shift to online shopping that has already cost tens of thousands of jobs.Last year the then chancellor, Philip Hammond, announced a £675m fund intend to halting high street decline that has left one in 10 shops in UK town centres lying empty. The Ministry for Housing, Communities and Local Government (MHCLG) has since promised an additional £325m to bring the size of the fund to £1bn.The government said funding would attract commercial investment and support wider regeneration in the 69 successful areas.“Our nation’s heritage is one of our great calling cards to the world, attracting millions of visitors to beautiful historic buildings that sit at the heart of our communities,” said the culture secretary, Nicky Morgan.The shadow culture secretary, Tom Watson, was critical of the announcement, saying that the fund “pales in comparison” to the £1bn “cultural capital fund” that Labour has committed to.By region, the funding breaks down as follows:Barnsley Hexham Huddersfield Hull Leeds Middlesbrough North Shields Northallerton Scarborough CA Castle Ward Selby town centre Skipton Sowerby Bridge and WakefieldBacup, Rossendale Barrow in Furness Blackpool Burnley Chester Fleetwood Kirkham Lancaster Maryport, Cumbria Ormskirk Prescot Stalybridge Tyldesley, Greater Manchester and Wigan town centreBrierley Hill Buxton Coventry Grantham Hinckley Kettering town centre Leicester Leominster Lincoln Newark-on-Trent Town Centre Oswestry Stoke on Trent and Wednesbury town centreBedford Dunstable Great Yarmouth King’s Lynn Lowestoft North Walsham and SwaffhamChard Cullompton Gloucester Keynsham Midsomer Norton Plymouth Poole Redruth Tewkesbury and Weston-Super-Mare.Chatham Intra Croydon Gosport Harlesden Hastings Newport Ramsgate Reading Ryde Tottenham Tower Hamlets and Woolwich."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/97d30c90b492f72ab897a66d54f242dd21066f83/0_123_3641_2184/master/3641.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8472e845a66b4bd62ab4a83a96de9422","title":"europe united states solheim cup georgia hall celine boutier","story":"• Europe and US tied 8-8 with 12 inidual matches to go• Georgia Hall and Céline Boutier win after trailing by four shotsCatriona Matthew can take solace from the fact golf is not played on paper. Bare statistics heavily suggested a gap in quality in favour of the United States over Europe in the 16th Solheim Cup, meaning the hosts’ best hope of an upset seemed to rest in building a useful lead before the singles. The depth of US talent, it has been assumed, will shine through in that Sunday format.Matthew and Europe have been afforded no such leeway. A fourball session on Saturday afternoon won two and a half to one and a half by the US means the visitors will feel the more comfortable about an 8-8 tie with 12 inidual jousts remaining.The fourball matches were incredibly tight, as much of this entire contest has been thus far. Anne van Dam and Suzann Pettersen took to the 18th against Brittany Altomare and Annie Park needing to win the hole to salvage a half. As a lame attempt at a birdie from Pettersen stopped short, the US had a key point.Georgia Hall and Céline Boutier had been four down to Ally McDonald and Angel Yin after seven. On the 18th tee, Europe were 1up. They won the last for good measure sending Europe 8-7 in front. Moments later, Danielle Kang slammed home a putt for a two at the 17th meaning she and Lizette Salas saw off Carlota Ciganda and Azahara Muñoz, 2\u0026amp1.Caroline Masson’s final putt hit the hole but stayed above ground as she and Jodi Ewart Shadoff halved with Lexi Thompson and Marina Alex. Europe, you felt, needed such fine margins to fall in their favour.The fourballs were again beset by slow play, a recurring theme which threatens to totally undermine this as a sporting spectacle. Match four took three hours and 12 minutes to play just nine holes. Match one was five hours and 55 minutes to 18th green handshakes. As on Friday, there was regular evidence of rules officials trying to jostle players along but this – and the lack of penal action – had no impact whatsoever. There is so much to admire about women’s golf and the Solheim Cup but the glacial pace of play has dominated the narrative around this event to such an extent that steps must be taken to ensure no repeat in two years’ time.On a gusty morning Van Dam and Anna Nordqvist had been 4up after six against Morgan Pressel and Alex. By the time this match headed to the 14th tee, the US were 2up in what was quite an extraordinary turnaround. Nordqvist has looked completely bereft of confidence over the first two days. Pressel and Alex prevailed 2\u0026amp1, in what represented a serious blow to Matthew.Hall and Boutier improved the mood of Europe’s captain with a 3\u0026amp2 win over Salas and McDonald in foursomes match two. Hall, who is familiar enough with the vagaries of British golf in September, branded the wind “atrocious” and worthy of four-club adjustments. Boutier added: “It was unbelievably tough. The course itself, without the wind, is pretty challenging. So add the wind, it was like 40km an hour … But I think we did a very good job. We were very steady all day and didn’t really give them any opportunities.” It was no surprise at all to see this European duo remain together after lunch.Charley Hull and Muñoz beat Kang and Megan Khang, 4\u0026amp3. The bottom foursomes match only lasted 13 holes as the Korda sisters, Nelly and Jessica, thrashed Ciganda and Bronte Law 6\u0026amp5. Should the US fall short in its bid to retain the cup, the captain Juli Inkster will inevitably be criticised for not keeping the Kordas as a team for either fourball session. In fact, neither played at all on Saturday afternoon, giving a nod towards Inkster’s desire to stick to her pre-event plan. So far, the US approach has borne fruit on paper, that is."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cb297169c675789f17af1cea54fccc81e5c6cc17/0_59_4480_2688/master/4480.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e9463062c46b0069f66b985cbbf8bcd1","title":"vuelta a espana primoz roglic set to triumph after retaining red jersey cycling","story":"Slovenian Primoz Roglic is poised to win the Vuelta a España after retaining the leader’s red jersey as his compatriot Tadej Pogacar won a decisive stage 20 in the mountains with a stunning display of solo climbing.Barring a crash in Sunday’s final stage from Fuenlabrada to the centre of Madrid, the 29-year-old will earn his first Grand Tour victory and become the fist Slovenian to win one of cycling’s three biggest races.

But then England’s national selector doesn’t really resemble an England selector either, traditionally the home of the florid, blazered eminence. Smith tends to look as if he’s stopped off briefly on a motoring tour of 1930s Tuscany or, like James Joyce, has unaccountably been offered a job as senior vice-president at Morgan Stanley.New things, new people, new methods. Smith has also been the object of some ambient chuntering during these last few weeks of Ashes cricket. This is a chief selector whose picks have been bold at times, hard to decipher at others, and which will be marked now by a series during which England have failed to regain the Ashes urn.With this in mind Smith might have been forgiven a punch of the air, or at least a studied flush of pleasure, as Joe Denly walked off at tea on a sunlit afternoon at the Oval having batted through two sessions, and with a first Test hundred in his sights.Of all the new picks during the last 18 months Denly has perhaps been the most thoroughly Smith-flavoured, albeit not for the reasons some have assumed. One former Kent player laughed out loud at the idea Smith might pick his former teammate out of ties of matey loyalty. The response, in essence: if you think that, you obviously don’t know Ed Smith very well – with the suggestion good old Joe from Canterbury is unlikely to figure too prominently in Smith’s list of vital VIP personages to please at all costs.Instead the inclusion of Denly, and the continued inclusion of Denly, is a function of Smith’s methods, his theory on transferable skills and perhaps also, as some maintain, the simple desire to be proved right.It is exactly a year since Denly, 30-something veteran of the Dhaka Dynamites, Karachi Kings and the Barisal Burners, was recalled for England’s Test tour of Sri Lanka. It was a funky-looking pick at the time, based on Denly’s success in T20 cricket, some excitable talk about his leg-break bowling and above all because Smith had detected a shadow of genuine class in his cricket, yet to reach its full expression.His presence since has felt like a point of principle being put to the test. The recall of Jos Buttler, a debut for Sam Curran, the promotion of Rory Burns: these have all been logical, even quite conventional selection calls for the Smith regime. Judge me, instead, by my Denlys.It has been a grind. From North Sound to Manchester Denly has been biddable, brave, adaptable and short of runs. Something began to shift at Headingley. He has been lucky with drops and play-and-misses. But Denly has also begun to look more poised and even rather classy here in his final knock of the Ashes summer.Four not out overnight, Denly was imperious against Nathan Lyon in the mid-morning sunlight. He skipped out and lofted him into the pavilion with a beautifully high front elbow. Later he came down again and carved a chest-high skimmer past mid-off’s right hand.There was another working-over from Pat Cummins, who hit Denly in the box, then bounced him repeatedly. This has been an area of discomfort. But Denly has adapted. Here he simply ducked. There were some dreamy drives through the covers and a sense above all of a man finding his rhythm.Last September Denly had looked like a moneyball-style pick, an informed hunch at best. The case against Smith, from those who like to have a case against people, has been that this kind of racy, deconstructivist thinking will be found out by older truths. Or more simply that it will create a clique of entitled star players, the white-ball fancy boys, beneficiaries of all this fresh attacking thinking.The facts are different. Dom Bess was also in that first squad, an injury-forced selection. Since then England have given debuts to Sam Curran, Ollie Pope, Rory Burns, Ben Foakes, Denly, Jason Roy, Olly Stone, and Jofra Archer. Of these only Roy as an opener has been a howler. And post-World Cup most of us were ready to buy into that one.At the Oval Denly chugged through the afternoon session. His third fifty in his last four innings came up with a scorching clip through midwicket. An inside edge to square-leg moved him to 70 and a new top score. It took a fine delivery from Peter Siddle to catch the edge and cut him off six short of a first Test hundred.Denly has done enough to earn a winter tour, perhaps even the most unexpected of central contract awards in Friday’s roll-out. It would be reward for a hunch, for continuing to graft – and above all for that niche but increasingly visible touch of class."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3222811511d1ba26775336363229b585cd08efc8/0_0_500_300/master/500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=465b476fe825be4c7c0c74b44d3d32b7","title":"rugby world cup 2019 france team guide","story":"After all the chopping and changing of recent years, France could be in for a big change in Japan: they may fail to reach the quarter-finals for the first timeAfter all the chopping and changing of recent years, France could be in for a big change in Japan: they may fail to reach the quarter-finals for the first timeFrance, what have you done with your talent? Times have changed but when opponents talk about French players, the same word still always gets mentioned: unpredictable. That is strange because it has been quite a while since the French national team has surprised anyone, and their supporters have practically given up hope of ever again feeling the spine-tingling thrill produced by an unexpected and heroic victory, the sort that sustains dreams for decades. The last time Les Bleus inspired a joy like that was at the 2011 World Cup when, after being beaten by New Zealand and then humiliated by Tonga in pool matches, they pulled off against-the-odds wins over England and Wales before meeting the All Blacks again in the final, where they went toe-to-toe with them until the last minute (eventually going down 8-7). On the day of that glorious defeat, the men captained by Thierry Dusautoir, who would be voted player of the year a few hours later, faced up to the challenge of the haka by arranging themselves into the shape of an arrowhead, which, in Maori culture, is the symbol of a broken union. Since then France fans have been offered nothing memorable to feed off (the country has won only 34 of 89 matches since then) so they keep themselves warm by harking back to the glorious feats of French attackers of yore, such as Serge Blanco’s tries against Australia in 1987, the exploits of Christophe Dominici, Richard Dourthe and Philippe Bernat-Salles in 1999, or Dusautoir and Yannick Jauzion in 2007 and Dusautoir again in 2011, again against the All Blacks. As dust gathers on the stock of such souvenirs, bitterness has grown. Flashes of revolt are not enough for anyone to kid themselves. The slow, laborious rugby of the Top 14 has been lamented for more than 10 years, and French coaches have been denounced, too, accused of shrinking into their dogmas and neglecting the fact that elsewhere, the game is getting faster. There has been chopping and changing of managers, too, with Novès becoming the first in France’s history to be sacked. His dismissal did not have the desired effect. So in June the French Rugby Federation decided that the current incumbent, Jacques Brunel, should include his successor, Fabien Galthié, in his coaching setup for this tournament before, in theory, Galthié leads Les Bleus to the 2023 World Cup. The backroom staff has also been augmented by a new fitness specialist and another coach (Laurent Labit, formerly of Racing 92) who will focus on the forwards, giving the impression that France is finally starting to embrace modern methods by engaging a range of skill sets. But with the World Cup looming, this all feels distinctly like a hasty patch-up job and the fear is that France, who have been cast into one of the toughest pools with England and Argentina, could fail to reach the quarter-finals for the first time in World Cup history. • Dominique Issartel is a sports journalist for L’Équipe"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c24db88532d6daabef01ae044a583e60ec730d69/0_86_2592_1556/master/2592.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=461918cbf3f8cb91a8b24f653c8fb58b","title":"pompeo iran saudi arabia oil yemen houthi","story":"Iran-aligned Houthi rebels in Yemen claimed responsibility for Saturday’s drone attack. But Pompeo, Donald Trump’s top diplomat, blamed the attacks squarely on Iran writing on Twitter that there was “no evidence the attacks came from Yemen”.“Amid all the calls for de-escalation, Iran has now launched an unprecedented attack on the world’s energy supply,” Pompeo said.According to a statement from the state-run oil producer Saudi Aramco, the attacks on the Abqaiq facility will cut the kingdom’s production by about 5.7m barrels per day, more than half of Saudi Arabia’s output. Saudi is the world’s largest exporter of crude oil.The US Energy Department said on Saturday it was ready to release oil from its strategic petroleum reserve (SPR) if needed.“Oil prices will jump on this attack, and if the disruption to Saudi production is prolonged, an SPR release ... seems likely and sensible,” said Jason Bordoff, founding director of the Centre on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University in New York.It is too early to know the extent of the damage to the processing plants and the Saudi supply chain that brings crude from oil fields to export facilities. The chief executive of Saudi Aramco, Amin Nasser, said in a statement that the company would have more information within 48 hours, as it works to bring back the lost output.On Saturday, before Pompeo’s tweet, the White House said Trump had spoken to Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman, “to offer his support for Saudi Arabia’s self-defense”.The attack comes as tensions have been rising between the Washington and Tehran, after Trump withdrew the US from a nuclear deal between world powers and the Islamic Republic.Iran has restarted some uranium enrichment in violation of the 2015 nuclear accord and the US has imposed sanctions. But Trump has recently held the door open for nuclear talks to begin, perhaps on the sidelines of the United National General Assembly in New York later this month. Pompeo said such talks could take place without any preconditions.Saudi Arabia, a US ally, backs the Yemeni government in a brutal civil war which began in 2015. Iran backs the Houthis, who hold the capital, Sanaa, and other territory in the Arab world’s poorest country.Responding to Pompeo’s tweet on Saturday, the Democratic senator Chris Murphy, a member of the foreign relations committee, wrote: “This is such irresponsible simplification and it’s how we get into dumb wars of choice.“The Saudis and Houthis are at war. The Saudis attack the Houthis and the Houthis attack back. Iran is backing the Houthis and has been a bad actor, but it’s just not as simple as Houthis  Iran.”“It is now time for the US to put on the table an attack on Iranian oil refineries if they continue their provocations or increase nuclear enrichment,” the South Carolina senator said on Twitter.It remained unclear if anyone was injured at the Abqaiq oil processing facility and the Khurais oil field, operated by Saudi Aramco. The attack early on Saturday sparked a huge fire, the kingdom’s interior ministry said.The US embassy in Riyadh said it was unaware of any injuries to Americans. Saudi Aramco employs a number of US citizens, some of whom live in guarded compounds near the site.A military spokesman for the Houthi rebels claimed responsibility, saying 10 drones had been deployed. The attack came after weeks of similar drone assaults on Saudi oil infrastructure, but none of the earlier strikes appeared to have caused such damage.The war in Yemen has become the world’s worst humanitarian crisis, pushing the country to the brink of famine and killing more than 90,000 people, according to the US-based Armed Conflict Location \u0026amp Event Data Project, or Acled.Since the start of the war, Houthi rebels have been using drones in combat.

Photograph: Tommy DicksonInphoThe sky was light blue and so were the GAA history books as Dublin completed the first-ever five-in-a-row on a balmy September Saturday at Croke Park.Picking up where they left off in the drawn game a fortnight ago, Kerry did everything they could to deprive their rivals of a distinction that a previous Kerry team got within a minute of, in 1982, only to be robbed at the death.But this time there was no Seamus Darby anywhere, and after completely dominating the second-half, Dublin pulled away by six points, to prove themselves the greatest team of all time,in some style.Not even the spectacle of Diarmuid Connolly missing an open goal late on was enough to set their fans’ nerves on edge. Only the auld triangle went jingle jangle, as usual, along the banks of the Royal Canal.But a few minutes later, there was other musical sound reverberating there too: a series of Dublin victory ballads, blaring from the Croke Park speakers as the team celebrated at length with fans in the stadium.Full steam aheadKerry supporters had not been short of confidence beforehand as they congregated in large numbers outside the Gresham Hotel on O’Connell St for the last walk to the ground.Standing under the statute of Parnell, who said that no man could fix a boundary to the march of a nation, a group of fans from Keel (the one near Castlemaine) were in no doubt that their team could fix a boundary to the march of Dublin, at least.Not only were the predicting a “five or six point” win, one went so far as to suggest that, in stopping the Dublin one, this would be the first instalment of a Kerry five-in-a-row, fed by the county’s all-conquering minor teams of recent years.Even the nearby Rotunda Hospital might have struggled to deal with that level of expectancy. And when Dublin started the game like an express train, it looked ominous for the Kerry optimists.But then, as if somebody with a Tralee accent had announced “Change at Mallow”, the train started to turn in Kerry’s direction. Scores were level by half-time, and it was the southerners who were doing most of the shouting as the teams went in.Staying in controlCarol McGlynn, one many Dublin fans who had gathered outside the Hill 16 pub earlier, would not have been unduly worried. She had foreseen that it would be close for a while.Then, as befits a woman who revealed herself to be the PRO of the Dublin Ladies Team (which plays Galway in the final on Sunday), she thought hard before predicting the final score in the men’s.Dublin by “1-20 to 1-15” she finally suggested, which proved close enough. In fact, the only goal of the game came straight from the second half throw-in when Eoin Murchan hared down the middle of the defence and buried a shot low in the Kerry net. After that, the Dubs never lost control again.The Saturday evening throw-in made for the unusual spectacle of darkness descending on a team of All-Ireland champions as they celebrated on the pitch afterwards. “Ring a ring a rosy as the light declines,” sang the balladeers on PA, and they were right about that much, anyway.They were wrong this time, however, in lamenting the end of Dublin’s rare oul’ times. The sky-blue overhead had indeed by now given away to navy. But in the world of GAA, the Dubs own that colour too."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4018511.1568473411!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"dup could be sold down the river says former uk attorney general","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDominic Grieve: ‘“I have always worried that the DUP’s position, firstly in advocating and promoting leave was a great mistake.’ Photograph: Liam McBurneyPA WireFormer British attorney general Dominic Grieve MP says the DUP could be “sold down the river” by the Conservative government.Mr Grieve was speaking ahead of Saturday afternoon’s People’s Vote – Let Us Be Heard event at the Ulster Hall in Belfast calling for the UK public to be given the final say on a Brexit deal.The MP, who has described his relationship with his former party as “inevitably strained” says a People’s Vote is “the only way out”.“I have always worried that the DUP’s position, firstly in advocating and promoting leave was a great mistake,” he said.“Then anchoring themselves to the Conservative Party’s policy, because they got have nothing else is a high risk strategy because I can see circumstances in which they will be left, they will be sold down the river.”Mr Grieve said as a conservative and unionist he felt the future of a peaceful and contented Northern Ireland in the United Kingdom was important so the DUP should “think hard” about supporting going back to the public to ask them what they want.IgnoredOn the criticism of the Belfast event by some as “dull centrism” he said: “There is a powerful movement of moderation in this country. And seeing the way our politics are going, moderation and the application of common sense seems to me to be very valuable.Around 700 people gathered at the Ulster Hall on Saturday for the event hosted by former Labour party adviser Alastair Campbell.Among the speakers was Alliance Party leader Naomi Long MEP, Green Party NI leader Clare Bailey MLA, and SDLP MLA Claire Hanna.Ms Long reminded the audience the DUP do not speak for the majority of people in the North who she says want no deal off the table.“Threatening to harm yourself is no negotiation tactic,” she said.Ms Bailey said Northern Ireland was “ignored” in the lead up to the 2016 EU membership referendum, that the leave campaign broke electoral law, lied and spread misinformation.Ms Hanna said the people wanted “stability and our future back”.“We can end austerity, or we can do Brexit but we can definitely no do both,” she said.During a panel discussion among business leaders entrepreneur Bill Wolsey said he had been appalled by the attitude displayed among some to foreign nationals.He said people from other countries has “enriched our society” and welcoming people was “something to be proud of”.Defending democracyMr Wolsey said he had been offended by comments made by British prime minister Boris Johnson that he would rather “die in a ditch” than ask for a Brexit delay.He said after 40 years of violence in the North his mind had been “warped” and he thought at the time: “I wish he would come over here, because a couple of boys would put him to the test”, which was met by laughter from the audience.He added that the language used by Mr Johnson was offensive to people in the North, that it was “ludicrous” and that having liberal views was “something you should be proud of”.Mr Wolsey emphasised that defending democracy was essential.“Millions of people died in the ditch for that one,” he said.On a panel for under 25s, a young woman from the Our Future Our Choice campaign group told the audience regarding Brexit, “The children of the peace process deserve better than this”.A handful of protesters stood outside the event.Among them was Raymond Stuart from South Antrim, who wore a Make America Great Again cap and carried a Leave Means Leave placard.He said Mr Grieve and Mr Campbell were not welcome in Belfast “because they have rejected the will of the British people, the 17.4m who voted to leave”.Mr Stuart said he supported Mr Johnson, that he wasn’t sure if the prime minister would betray the DUP and that he wanted him to “stand firm”.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Photograph: Oli ScarffAFPGetty Images.Former UK prime minister David Cameron has admitted that he failed in his bid to keep Britain in a reformed European Union and is “truly sorry” for the uncertainty and ision that followed the Brexit referendum.The Conservative (52) said he thinks about the consequences of the vote to leave the EU “every single day” and worries “desperately” about what will happen next.In an interview with the Times ahead of the publication of his memoir next week, Mr Cameron also said a second referendum cannot be ruled out - suggesting it could provide a way of “unblocking the blockage”.And he attacked Boris Johnson and Michael Gove for their part in the Leave campaign, accusing the pair of behaving “appallingly” and effectively “trashing” the Government.Mr Cameron also said they had “left the truth at home” regarding Turkey joining the EU and the claim that Britain sends £350 million a week to the bloc.In his long-awaited book, For The Record, which is serialised in The Times, the ex-PM wrote that “there are those who will never forgive me for holding it, or for failing to deliver the outcome - Britain staying in a reformed EU - that I sought.“I deeply regret the outcome and accept that my approach failed. The decisions I took contributed to that failure. I failed.”He admitted that he has “many regrets” and that there are “many things” he would do differently about the vote, but insisted renegotiating Britain’s relationship with the EU and giving the country a say was the “right approach”.‘I am truly sorry’“I did not fully anticipate the strength of feeling that would be unleashed both during the referendum and afterwards, and I am truly sorry to have seen the country I love so much suffer uncertainty and ision in the years since then,” Mr Cameron said.“But on the central question of whether it was right to renegotiate Britain’s relationship with the EU and give people the chance to have their say on it, my view remains that this was the right approach to take.“I believe that, particularly with the Eurozone crisis, the organisation was changing before our very eyes, and our already precarious place in it was becoming harder to sustain.“Renegotiating our position was my attempt to address that, and putting the outcome to a public vote was not just fair and not just overdue, but necessary and, I believe, ultimately inevitable.”In an interview with the paper, he also took aim at Priti Patel’s “attack that wealthy people didn’t understand the problems of immigration”.“It felt very like she was put on point to do some attacking of the government and its record. I suppose some people would say all is fair in love and war and political campaigns.“I thought there were places Conservatives wouldn’t go against each other. And they did.”And he revealed that he once texted Mr Gove, now Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, to say: “You are either a team player or a w**ker.”Mr Cameron also confessed that he got “off his head” on dope while at Eton, and said he smoked it later with his wife Samantha and her friends.On Boris JohnsonThe former PM - who said he had been “hugely depressed” about leaving Number 10 - described Mr Johnson as “easy to work with” but admitted that there had been “issues” between the pair.“I want him to succeed. I worked with him well, as I say in the book. I also say that he was a capable mayor. He was easy to work with. I thought he was very talented. I wanted him in my government,” he explained.“We’ve had issues. Even before Brexit, there were sometimes tensions and disagreements but, on the whole, we’ve got on well. And I want him to succeed.“Look, he’s got a very clear strategy and plan. It’s, you know, not the approach that I would have taken, but I want him to succeed.”But on the new Prime Minister’s recent decision to prorogue Parliament for five weeks and withdraw the whip from 21 Tory MPs - including the likes of Ken Clarke and Sir Nicholas Soames - Mr Cameron expressed his disapproval.“Taking the whip from hard-working Conservative MPs and sharp practices using prorogation of Parliament have rebounded. I didn’t support either of those things. Neither do I think a no-deal Brexit is a good idea,” he said.On Friday Mr Johnson said he was not concerned about what his predecessor would write about him in the memoir.“I want people to be clear, absolutely nothing that David Cameron says in his memoirs in the course of the next few days will diminish the affection and respect in which I hold him.“Not least for what he did in turning this country round after Labour left it bankrupt. I think he has a very distinguished record and a legacy to be proud of.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches. See more here.

When they first spotted it, they thought they had accidentally looked a star – but further research has shown that the black hole is in fact showing behaviour that astronomers had never expected.“We have never seen anything like this in the 24 years we have studied the supermassive black hole,” said Andrea\u0026nbspGhez, UCLA professor of physics and astronomy and a co-senior author of the research. “It’s usually a pretty quiet, wimpy black hole on a diet.We don’t know what is driving this big feast.”Scientists looked through observations taken since 2003, from observatories in Hawaii and Chile. They noticed that on 13 May, the back hole was lit up twice as bright as had ever been before – and it continued to turn incredibly bright on two other nights this year.Created with Sketch.Best Nasa pictures of the month - August 2019 Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.When stars like the Sun grow advanced in age, they expand and glow red. These so-called red giants then begin to lose their outer layers of material into space. More than half of such a star\u0027s mass can be shed in this manner, forming a shell of surrounding gas. At the same time, the star\u0027s core shrinks and grows hotter, emitting ultraviolet light that causes the expelled gases to glow. Two galaxies are seen interacting with one another. This pair of galaxies is known as UGC2369 and they are being drawn together by mutual gravitational attraction.

As such, it could be just the beginning in a major change in the activity of the black hole.“The big question is whether the black hole is entering a new phase — for example if the spigot has been turned up and the rate of gas falling down the black hole ‘drain’ has increased for an extended period — or whether we have just seen the fireworks from a few unusual blobs of gas falling in,” said Mark Morris, UCLA professor of physics and astronomy and the author of a paper describing the discovery..Scientists will now keep looking at the area and hope that new images can help resolve that question. That could in turn help us understand how black holes grow and the kinds of effects they have on the galaxy and the larger universe.The brightening could have come from the fact that a star was seen going very close to the black hole in summer last year, or that another mysterious object known as G2 had its outer layer ripped off when it passed by in 2014. It might also be the result of big asteroids passing near the black hole, scientists said.The black hole poses no danger to life on Earth. It is 26,000 light years away, and the radiation coming out of it would need to be 10 billion times brighter to have any effect here.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

That would speed up progress on a Brexit deal acceptable both to the UK and the EU, as the so-called Irish backstop has been a major stumbling block.DUP leader Arlene Foster rejected the speculation, saying late on Thursday: UK must leave as one nation.

We will not be doing a reboot.“There are two reasons for that, explained Kauffman.One of the reasons we won’t do a reunion is because this is a show about a time in your life when your friends are your family. And when you have a family, that changes. But the other reason is it’s not going to beat what we did.”Co-creator David Crane added: “We did the show we wanted to do. We got it right, and we put a bow on it. If you visited those characters now, it just would not be the same DNA and chances are, it wouldn’t be as good.”Created with Sketch.29 TV shows that have been made into bad films Show all 29Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Joe Carnahan’s dusty and grimy adaptation retained the catchphrases and character personalities of the original series, while surrounding them with an entirely incoherent plot and noisy sub-Michael Bay action. Liam Neeson made for a fun Hannibal Smith and UFC fighter Quinton “Rampage” Jackson did his best as BA Baracus, but a never-more-slappable Bradley Cooper and the chronically unappealing Sharlto Copley were the pits.A sad-all-round adaptation of the cult MTV animated series from the 1990s, Aeon Flux abandoned the avant-garde, largely dialogue-free sensuality of its source material for generic action and dodgy special effects. If it weren’t for the classy presence of Charlize Theron and director Karyn Kusama, whose early cut was radically altered by producers, this would have basically been a bargain-bin Milla Jovovich joint. And that, honestly, would have been a lot more fun.Ralph Fiennes and Uma Thurman must have been grateful when Marvel came along and helped scrub 1998 film The Avengers even further out of cultural memory. But for those who had to endure their hammy 1998 adaptation of the classic spy series, it’d take a lot more than Iron Man and Captain America to make us forget the image of Sean Connery inexplicably dressed in a giant bear costume and trying to control the weather. Shudders.Although The Bad Education Movie arrived in a similar summertime slot to the successful Inbetweeners film, this sitcom adaptation was nowhere near as popular. Jack Whitehall’s performance was panned by critics who said he appeared “desperate to shock” as delinquent teacher Alfie Wickers and described the whole movie as a “farce”.This 1977 film based on BBC sitcom Are You Being Served? took its inspiration from a theatre production in Blackpool. While it found success on stage, the big screen version was met with hostility, with one critic calling it guilty of violating almost every law of comedy and film.David Hasselhoff is unforgettable as the hunky chief lifeguard Mitch Buchannon patrolling a sunny beach in Baywatch. After a rocky start when the first season was cancelled on NBC, it became the world\u0027s most-watched TV show, running in its original format for 10 years until 1999. The unnecessary big-screen version of the show starred Dwayne Johnson in Hasselhoff’s role and Zac Efron as a new recruit. Even the nostalgic cameo from the show\u0027s former star didn’t make up for the paper-thin plot.Because nose-centric glory for Nicole Kidman couldn’t happen twice, this adaptation of sparkly magical sitcom Bewitched arrived two years after the actor won her Oscar for The Hours, and promptly became a key component in her Queen of Flops reputation throughout the late-2000s. This had brilliance written all over it, from Nora Ephron behind the camera to Will Ferrell, Steve Carell, Jason Schwartzman and Shirley MacLaine in the supporting cast, but still somehow managed to stink.Leigh Francis character Keith Lemon received the big screen treatment in 2012\u0027s Keith Lemon: The Film, one of the only titles to have ever received zero per cent on Rotten Tomatoes. Putting pins in one\u0027s eyes is rumoured to be a better experience.Despite an all-star cast that included Bill Nighy, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Michael Gambon and Tony Jones, the poorly judged spin-off of the much-loved BBC sitcom Dad\u0027s Army (2016) took a pounding from critics, who derided the attempt at an homage to a TV show that had nothing wrong with it in the first place.The nadir of Tim Burton’s career, Dark Shadows was a film nobody was particularly crying out for, most of the fans of the original 1960s fantasy soap opera long dead and the general public having by then grown tired of Johnny Depp’s “heavily made-up comedy weirdo” schtick. Most egregious, however, was the film’s failure to properly utilise Michelle Pfeiffer 20 years after she played Catwoman in Burton’s Batman Returns.Julian Fellowes took the beloved TV drama about the lives of the aristocratic Crawley family and the people who serve them – and turned it into one long fawning session about the royals. Absolutely nothing happens in this film where an entire sub-plot involves a boiler being fixed, and another, completely implausible storyline about an assassination attempt on the king. The only real intrigue is why Thomas, the butler, has suddenly acquired a very orange tan. This is what happens when British institutions get a Hollywood makeover, folks.1229 The Dukes of HazzardThere was a time when Johnny Knoxville, Seann William Scott and Jessica Simpson were the hottest cast in town. There was never a time this unwanted cinematic revival of the action comedy series wasn\u0027t entirely stupid. Life imitated art when the main stars at the heart of HBO show Entourage hit the red carpet for the film version. Sadly, it lacked the vim that was present in most seasons of the show and ultimately felt like a mediocre feature-length episode.Kevin and Perry Go Large was no doubt adored by teens everywhere upon its released in 2000, which is why it\u0027s gained a cult following in the years since. In all honesty, the film is so terrible it\u0027s actually brilliant.1529 The League of Gentlemen2005 film The League of Gentlemen\u0027s Apocalypse is proof that Steve Pemberton, Reece Shearsmith, Mark Gatiss and Jeremy Dyson can do wrong. On the bright side, it\u0027s reassuring to know the multi-talented quartet are indeed human after all. It\u0027s not exactly clear who The Magic Roundabout film was intended for considering kids at the time would have had no idea who Dougal, Zebedee or company were. Save for providing work for Robbie Williams, Tom Baker and Bill Nighy, this version wasn’t much use for anyone. We are all to blame for the abysmal Mrs Brown\u0027s Boys D\u0027Movie. If the sitcom\u0027s Christmas specials weren\u0027t the most-watched episodes of television in the UK every year, then Brendan O\u0027Carroll probably wouldn’t have ever thought a film could be possible. Ricky Gervais just couldn\u0027t stay away from his Office character David Brent and gave him the big screen treatment in 2016\u0027s Life on the Road. Every second paled in comparison to ever single episode of the classic BBC series.The experience of watching the first ever Pokémon film – titled Pokémon: The First Movie – can be likened to watching a YouTube tutorial of someone playing a Pokémon video game, only somehow more boring.The charming story of Postman Pat and his black and white cat in the fictional and busy village of Greendale first screened on the BBC in 1981. What a shame that Postman Pat: The Movie in 2014 – the 3D animated feature film version – managed to stray so far from its original simplicity. It sees Postman Pat (voiced by Stephen Mangan) enter an X-Factor style-singing contest, and despite featuring an impressive array of voice actors, including Rupert Grint, Jim Broadbent and David Tennant, the film was too scary for the under-fives – especially the scene that sees Pat turn into a sinister robot.2129 Sex and the CitySex and the City had all the ingredients for a great movie: starry cast, cult fanbase, glamorous setting. Alas, both films were an embarrassment to the original series. Not enough happened in the movies to warrant anything longer than a 30-minute episode and unfortunately we can never unsee Sarah Jessica Parker and co doing that bizarre slo-mo walk through the desert.The problem with 2015 film Spooks: The Greater Good is that is arrived about 10 years too late. Spooks was a decent BBC drama that ended in 2011 and that\u0027s how it should have stayed.Based on the 1975 series of the same name, this action crime thriller starred Samuel L Jackson, Michelle Rodriguez, LL Cool J, Jeremy Renner, and Colin Farrell in one of his early box office hits. There was plenty of high-octane drama and Farrell was convincing as a hot-shot cop taking on a French drug lord (Olivier Martinez), but it’s also completely predictable and, ultimately, extremely pointless.An updated version of BBC crime series The Sweeney starring Ray Winstone sounds like something from spoof heaven. The finished film, released in 2012, didn\u0027t really do much to convince anyone that it wasn\u0027t. Sure, Ben Kingsley as The Hood is a great spot of casting, but practically everything else in the film version of Gerry Anderson\u0027s Thunderbirds failed to make the grade. Anderson himself was most damning he called it the biggest load of crap I have ever seen in my entire life.There are some interesting things in Twilight Zone: The Movie, but it loses points for featuring one of the worst pieces of work from Steven Spielberg: a segment set in a retirement home titled Kick the Can.Just because the Veronica Mars cast and its loyal fans really wanted a movie spin-off to be made, it doesn’t mean it should have ever actually happened. The TV show was revived thanks to funds raised by star Kristen Bell on Kickstarter, but the film was criticised for making literally no sense for anyone who hadn’t watched the series.Famously bad, Wild Wild West was adapted from the 1960s TV show and was the 2000 recipient of the golden Raspberry Award for Worst Picture.Joe Carnahan’s dusty and grimy adaptation retained the catchphrases and character personalities of the original series, while surrounding them with an entirely incoherent plot and noisy sub-Michael Bay action. Liam Neeson made for a fun Hannibal Smith and UFC fighter Quinton “Rampage” Jackson did his best as BA Baracus, but a never-more-slappable Bradley Cooper and the chronically unappealing Sharlto Copley were the pits.A sad-all-round adaptation of the cult MTV animated series from the 1990s, Aeon Flux abandoned the avant-garde, largely dialogue-free sensuality of its source material for generic action and dodgy special effects. If it weren’t for the classy presence of Charlize Theron and director Karyn Kusama, whose early cut was radically altered by producers, this would have basically been a bargain-bin Milla Jovovich joint. And that, honestly, would have been a lot more fun.Ralph Fiennes and Uma Thurman must have been grateful when Marvel came along and helped scrub 1998 film The Avengers even further out of cultural memory. But for those who had to endure their hammy 1998 adaptation of the classic spy series, it’d take a lot more than Iron Man and Captain America to make us forget the image of Sean Connery inexplicably dressed in a giant bear costume and trying to control the weather. Shudders.Although The Bad Education Movie arrived in a similar summertime slot to the successful Inbetweeners film, this sitcom adaptation was nowhere near as popular. Jack Whitehall’s performance was panned by critics who said he appeared “desperate to shock” as delinquent teacher Alfie Wickers and described the whole movie as a “farce”.This 1977 film based on BBC sitcom Are You Being Served? took its inspiration from a theatre production in Blackpool. While it found success on stage, the big screen version was met with hostility, with one critic calling it guilty of violating almost every law of comedy and film.David Hasselhoff is unforgettable as the hunky chief lifeguard Mitch Buchannon patrolling a sunny beach in Baywatch. After a rocky start when the first season was cancelled on NBC, it became the world\u0027s most-watched TV show, running in its original format for 10 years until 1999. The unnecessary big-screen version of the show starred Dwayne Johnson in Hasselhoff’s role and Zac Efron as a new recruit. Even the nostalgic cameo from the show\u0027s former star didn’t make up for the paper-thin plot.Because nose-centric glory for Nicole Kidman couldn’t happen twice, this adaptation of sparkly magical sitcom Bewitched arrived two years after the actor won her Oscar for The Hours, and promptly became a key component in her Queen of Flops reputation throughout the late-2000s. This had brilliance written all over it, from Nora Ephron behind the camera to Will Ferrell, Steve Carell, Jason Schwartzman and Shirley MacLaine in the supporting cast, but still somehow managed to stink.Leigh Francis character Keith Lemon received the big screen treatment in 2012\u0027s Keith Lemon: The Film, one of the only titles to have ever received zero per cent on Rotten Tomatoes. Putting pins in one\u0027s eyes is rumoured to be a better experience.Despite an all-star cast that included Bill Nighy, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Michael Gambon and Tony Jones, the poorly judged spin-off of the much-loved BBC sitcom Dad\u0027s Army (2016) took a pounding from critics, who derided the attempt at an homage to a TV show that had nothing wrong with it in the first place.The nadir of Tim Burton’s career, Dark Shadows was a film nobody was particularly crying out for, most of the fans of the original 1960s fantasy soap opera long dead and the general public having by then grown tired of Johnny Depp’s “heavily made-up comedy weirdo” schtick. Most egregious, however, was the film’s failure to properly utilise Michelle Pfeiffer 20 years after she played Catwoman in Burton’s Batman Returns.Julian Fellowes took the beloved TV drama about the lives of the aristocratic Crawley family and the people who serve them – and turned it into one long fawning session about the royals. Absolutely nothing happens in this film where an entire sub-plot involves a boiler being fixed, and another, completely implausible storyline about an assassination attempt on the king. The only real intrigue is why Thomas, the butler, has suddenly acquired a very orange tan. This is what happens when British institutions get a Hollywood makeover, folks.1229 The Dukes of HazzardThere was a time when Johnny Knoxville, Seann William Scott and Jessica Simpson were the hottest cast in town. There was never a time this unwanted cinematic revival of the action comedy series wasn\u0027t entirely stupid. Life imitated art when the main stars at the heart of HBO show Entourage hit the red carpet for the film version. Sadly, it lacked the vim that was present in most seasons of the show and ultimately felt like a mediocre feature-length episode.Kevin and Perry Go Large was no doubt adored by teens everywhere upon its released in 2000, which is why it\u0027s gained a cult following in the years since. In all honesty, the film is so terrible it\u0027s actually brilliant.1529 The League of Gentlemen2005 film The League of Gentlemen\u0027s Apocalypse is proof that Steve Pemberton, Reece Shearsmith, Mark Gatiss and Jeremy Dyson can do wrong. On the bright side, it\u0027s reassuring to know the multi-talented quartet are indeed human after all.

The new phone includes a chip referred to as U1, and which it says is used for sensing things in space.For now, it is only being used for a new feature that uses Apple\u0027s AirDrop technology, and allows people to point their phones towards another device and send files between the two. The chip can be used to precisely locate other devices, Apple said, meaning it can know exactly where it is pointing.But it is clear that the chip is really meant for a variety of other features, too. What is less clear is what exactly those features are.Created with Sketch.Gadgets and tech news in pictures Show all 25Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.125 Gun-toting humanoid robot sent into spaceRussia has launched a humanoid robot into space on a rocket bound for the International Space Station (ISS).

Somewhat ironically, it appears under a heading indicating that it will allow the phone to be more precise.Which new iPhone should you buy? 11, 11 Pro and 11 Pro Max comparedThe new Apple-designed U1 chip uses Ultra Wideband technology for spatial awareness – allowing iPhone 11 Pro to precisely locate other U1-equipped Apple devices, it reads. It\u0027s like adding another sense to iPhone, and it\u0027s going to lead to amazing new capabilities.Apple is already rumoured to be working on small tracking devices that could be added to objects to allow them to be found more easily. The phone could presumably seek out those devices – telling you not only how far away your keys are, for instance, but being able to work out which of your chairs they have fallen into, and where exactly they are.The chip could also presumably help with Apple\u0027s plans for augmented reality features. That requires detailed information about the nearby environment, which the chip could presumably help with.The chip is only found on the more expensive iPhone 11 Pro and Pro Max, and not the cheaper iPhone 11.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

That would speed up progress on a Brexit deal acceptable both to the UK and the EU, as the so-called Irish backstop has been a major stumbling block.DUP leader Arlene Foster rejected the speculation, saying late on Thursday: UK must leave as one nation. We are keen to see a sensible deal but not one that ides the internal market of the UK.”Still, the pound gained more than 1 per cent against the dollar on Friday morning to trade as high as $1.2475, a seven-week high.

The former London mayor and foreign secretary won his leadership bid by beating Jeremy Hunt in the Tory race the day before. Theresa May stepped down following her resignation as Conservative Party leader on 7 June.“It’s clearly about a reduction in no-deal risk being perceived,” said Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at Markets. He noted that shorting, or betting against, sterling has become a very “crowded” – and hence less attractive – trade, prompting traders to bet the other way which also lifted the currency.Last week MPs passed a law preventing a no-deal Brexit on 31 October and refused to grant Boris Johnson an early general election, which he hoped would give him a majority in parliament.But the chances of leaving with an exit agreement are also uncertain as the only deal agreed with the EU after two years of talks has been rejected by Britain’s parliament three times.Since the vote to leave the EU, the pound has lost 17 per cent against the dollar and almost 15 per cent against the euro. \u0026nbspAdditional reporting by ReutersOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The album cover happened by chance – after hanging out on another shoot a few weeks later, Lane heard the band’s art director hassling them to choose an album cover. He’d brought his portfolio with him, which included the now-infamous “ass shot”.230 29) The Notorious BIG – Ready to DieBiggie Smalls picked a baby resembling himself to star on the cover of his debut Ready to Die. By doing so, he summed up the album’s autobiographical content, which begins with childhood and closes with death. He also uses the notion of childhood innocence to foreshadow how our surroundings can have a lasting impact.It might not be the quintessential David Bowie album, or the one that introduced fans to Starman. But the face staring back at you from this particular album cover is, undeniably, the most recognisable Bowie look: red mullet a gaunt, sombre expression and that famous lightning bolt across his face.One of the greatest debut albums – and arguably the best hip hop record – of all time has a fittingly arresting cover image. A photo of a seven-year-old Nas was superimposed over Danny Clinch’s snapshot of one of the housing projects in the New York rapper’s native Queensbridge. Designed by Aimee Macauley, it was intended to reflect how the projects used to be Nas’s entire world, “until I educated myself to see there’s more out there”. But Nas was also inviting you to see through his eyes and into those very projects where he grew up, and feel immersed in that world via the power of his storytelling.Years after its release, Kate Bush noted how The Dreaming was deemed by many to be her “she’s gone mad” album. Its multiple, disparate narratives and metamorphic production intertwine with movie influences, particularly music hall crime capers of Houdini’s era. On the sepia-toned album cover, Bush plays the role of the escapist’s wife, looking to the distance, rather than at his face, as though trying to contact him via a different medium than mere speech. The way she holds his face in her hands gives her an additional, mesmerising power and conjures the old-world, eccentric mysticism with which she was – and still is – associated.Photographer Michael Spencer Jones had a task on his hands organising Oasis for what is indisputably their best album cover. It was different to what the band originally envisioned – Noel Gallagher had spotted a photo of the Beatles sat round a coffee in Japan, so thought Oasis could be photographed at the dining table of guitarist Bonehead’s house in Manchester. Jones didn’t see this working, so spread the members around Bonehead’s living room instead, and asked them to bring objects that were personal to them for decoration. Noel liked Jones’s idea of hanging an inflatable globe (brought by one of the roadies) from the ceiling. “Yeah, global dominance,” he said. Soon after the album’s release, that’s exactly what happened.Andy Warhol conceived the idea of a vinyl cover with working zipper that would reveal a pair of white briefs beneath the bulging jeans of a male model, who has to this day never been identified. Many fans assumed it was Mick Jagger, but people working on the shoot said several models were photographed and Warhol never revealed which one was used. It represented what the Rolling Stones quickly became famous for: an edgy, hyper-sexual kind of swagger.German painter Mati Klarwein – who also created Santana’s artwork for Abraxas – was behind this gatefold cover that served as an embodiment of Davis’s creative manifesto. The surreal and complex renderings mirror what Davis does with the music itself challenging traditional notions of structure and juxtaposing concepts of passivity and aggressiveness, anger and love.930 22) ACDC – Back in BlackBack in Black’s all-black cover design fit the mood of a band emerging from dark times. In the wake of the death of vocalist Bon Scott, ACDC had tracked down Brian Johnson, whom Scott had previously mentioned to the band. Certain people at their record label, Atlantic, weren’t so keen on the cover, but the band were insistent: it was a memorial to Scott. And now one of the most instantly recognisable and best-loved album covers in rock history.Visually striking and symbolic of what Debbie Harry was doing both as a woman and an artist in the music industry, Parallel Lines’ cover was shot by photographer Edo Bertoglio. It was apparently rejected by the band but later chosen by their manager, Peter Leeds. The juxtaposition between the band, who beam in their matching dress suits like a bunch of schoolboys at their senior prom, and Harry, who stands defiant in her white dress, hands on hips, is wonderful. “I’m not impressed,” her stance seems to say. “Try harder.”Dylan walks arm-in-arm with then-girlfriend and muse Suze Rotolo through the West Village in freezing New York, February 1963. Rotolo described the circumstances to the New York Times in 2008: “He wore a very thin jacket, because image was all. Our apartment was always cold, so I had a sweater on, plus I borrowed one of his big, bulky sweaters. On top of that I put on a coat. So I felt like an Italian sausage. Every time I look at that picture, I think I look fat.” Yet her memoir, A Freewheelin’ Time, also noted the cover’s significance, how it “influenced the look of album covers precisely because of its casual down-home spontaneity and sensibility”.Led Zeppelin couldn’t have picked a better image to serve as a visual introduction to their fans. It’s an easy tactic – using a photo from a real-life tragedy, in this case the Hinderburg disaster, for shock factor. But it worked, and the cover went on to become one of the most indelible images in rock music.1330 18) Never Mind the Bollocks – Here’s the Sex Pistols“The album will last. The sleeve may not,” said the adverts for the Sex Pistols’ first and only studio album in 1977. The Sex Pistols were already controversial before the release of Never Mind the Bollocks – Here’s the Sex Pistols. They’d caused nationwide uproar for swearing on live TV, been fired from two record labels, and been banned from a number of live venues in England. Using the word “bollocks” on the front of their artwork caused instant censorship, and more controversy that would only benefit its performance. Despite many major retailers refusing to sell it, the album debuted at number one on the UK album charts. Today, it is arguably the most recognisable punk album cover in music history.For a limited time, The Roots’ Grammy-nominated album Things Fall Apart was available with five different covers, which reflected each of the world’s “greatest turmoils”. The most enduring was a photograph taken during a Civil Rights Movement-era riot – a stark black and white image showing riot police as they chase two terrified black teenagers.Yes, Dark Side of the Moon, with Storm Thorgerson\u0027s geometric design, is the most iconic of Pink Floyd covers. But the shot he conceived for Wish You Were Here – taken by Aubrey ‘Po’ Powell – is by far the more visceral. It shows two businessmen shaking hands, with one of them on fire, and to the band it represented the fear of revealing your true feelings for fear of “getting burnt”. Two stuntmen were involved, with one (Ronnie Rondell Jr) dressed in a fire-retardant outfit covered by a business suit, and his head protected by a hood, covered beneath a wig. Unfortunately, high winds meant he lost his moustache and eyebrows to the flames. Hopefully he felt the resulting shot was worth it. Fans definitely think so.Just two of Fleetwood Mac’s then-five members appear on the cover of their best-selling and arguably greatest album. Stevie Nicks and Mick Fleetwood’s legs are entwined, which serves as a pretty good metaphor for the entanglement between band members that resulted in so many of the record’s lyrical back-and-forths. And really it’s just a gorgeous, classic image, photographed and conceived by Herbert W Worthington with the band, and designed by Desmond Strobel.The instantly iconic cover of It’s Blitz! shows little but says a lot. There’s a sense of female defiance in showing the woman’s hand, nails in red polish, crushing the egg, a symbol of fertility. It also embodies what the Yeah Yeah Yeahs did on this album, which is take traditional sounds, equipment and ideas and scramble them into something completely subversive.This shot was taken by celebrated photographer Herb Ritts, who later teamed up with Madonna for the “Like a Prayer” and “You Can Dance” covers. It is one of her most recognisable images, inspired in part by Andy Warhol’s pop art and also by the iconography of Madonna’s idol Marilyn Monroe. Here, she invites fans to make the immediate connection between pop art and commercial value, making her the first to exploit the late Eighties concept of pop artist as brand.The Clash paid tribute to Elvis Presley by mimicking the pink and green lettering from his 1956 self-titled album. Yet the image, one of the most iconic in rock history, blows that version of rock and roll to kingdom come: everything “safe” that the King had offered was replaced by Pennie Smith’s photograph of “the ultimate rock’n’roll moment – total loss of control”. Bassist Paul Simonon later told Fender that he’d smashed his guitar out of frustration with bouncers for not letting fans stand up from their seats at the Palladium in New York City. The captured moment is visceral, dangerous and anti-establishment – just like The Clash.Elvis Presley appears mid-belt on the cover of his self-titled album, clearly performing one of those iconic vocal whoops. It’s a visual introduction to rock’n’roll for his unsuspecting American audience, done 20 years before The Clash would replicate that classic pink and green lettering to do the same for their British fans.Six guys stare down toward the ground, one pointing a handgun right at the viewer. This is the cover art for Straight Outta Compton, the pioneering debut by NWA. The photographer was a 28-year-old white guy, Eric Poppleton, who was struggling to make ends meet after graduating from art school. He and his art director Kevin Hosman spent a day following the guys around alleys in LA, until Poppleton found a spot where he got on the ground and asked NWA’s members to stand over him, with one holding “what was hopefully an unloaded” gun. He had no idea the photograph would become one of the most iconic images in gangsta rap. Poppleton would go on to shoot four other NWA album covers.2230 9) Bruce Springsteen – Born in the USAThe Boss tells you everything you need to know about him with one image. An epitome of the blue collar American, Springsteen’s seventh album cover was shot by Annie Leibowitz and shows the artist’s from behind, dressed in worn blue jeans and a simple white t-shirt, with a red cap hanging out of the back pocket after a long day’s grind. “We took a lot of different types of pictures,” said Springsteen, “and in the end, the picture of my ass looked better than the picture of my face.” Combined with the American flag in the background, the cover parallels the themes of Springsteen’s music.An album cover that would inspire future generations of bands to slouch moodily against brick walls. The Ramones were near-impossible to gather together for a posed photograph, but Robert Bayley – a photographer for Punk magazine, managed to get a shot that captured the band perfectly. Wearing ripped jeans and leather jackets, they stare blankly at the camera through sunglasses, or fringes that half-conceal their eyes.Few album covers can profess to have literally stopped traffic, and it’s testament to the iconic status of Abbey Road’s artwork that thousands of fans have attempted to recreate it. The band, and photographer Iain McMillan, had just 10 minutes to get the shot, which was taken from a step-ladder while a police officer held up traffic behind the scenes. Six photos were taken, which McCartney later examined with a magnifying glass before making his decision.Before he tried to “break the internet” with a nude Kim Kardashian on the cover of Paper magazine, Jean-Paul Goude took some of the most memorable images of the Eighties for Grace Jones’s album Island Life. She appears on the cover in what looks like an impossible pose it is, in fact, a composite of her in different positions, cut and pasted together for one of the most striking images in music history.2630 5) The Velvet Underground and Nico – The Velvet Underground and NicoLike the working zipper of The Rolling Stones’ Sticky Fingers, early versions of The Velvet Underground and Nico asked the owner to “Peel slowly and see”, upon which they’d peel the banana skin to reveal a flesh-coloured banana beneath. MGM was happy to fork out for the additional costs of manufacturing the vinyl, with the assumption that its ties to Warhol would help boost sales. It’s one of very few albums where the person behind the album art, rather than the band themselves or the album title, are named on the cover.The cover art for Joy Division’s debut album was designed by Peter Saville, who had previously created posters for Manchester’s Factor Club in the late Seventies. The chosen image, which was picked by Bernard Sumner, is based on radio waves from pulsar CP 1919 – from the Cambridge Encyclopaedia of Astronomy. “The duochrome Peter Saville cover of this first Joy Division album speaks volumes,” Susie Goldring said in a review for BBC Online. “Its white on black lines reflect a pulse of power, a surge of bass, and raw angst. If the cover doesn\u0027t draw you in, the music will.With its star-studded cast and bold colour scheme, the cover of Sgt Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band came to define artist Peter Blake and also The Beatles themselves. There are 88 figures in all, including the band themselves, on a set photographed by Michael Cooper. Blake collected a list of names from three of the four Beatles. The list included Tony Curtis, Marilyn Monroe, Aubrey Beardsley, Oscar Wilde, and even Adolf Hitler (requested by John Lennon, and hidden behind other figures). If you bought the record, Blake later said, “you also bought a piece of art on exactly the level that I was aiming for”.Critic Camille Paglia once suggested that Robert Mapplethorpe’s photo of his former lover, friend and collaborator Patti Smith is the greatest ever taken of a woman, and seeing it, you feel inclined to agree. The godmother of punk herself said she thought she looked like Frank Sinatra, dressed in a crisp white shirt with a black ribbon around her neck. A black jacket with a horse brooch on the lapel is slung casually over her shoulder.  “The only rule we had was, Robert told me if I wore a white shirt, not to wear a dirty one,” Smith told NPR in 2010. “I got my favourite ribbon and my favourite jacket, and he took about 12 pictures. By the eighth one he said, \u0027I got it\u0027.”Photographer Colin Lane met the Strokes in early 2001, after being commissioned to shoot them for The Face magazine. The album cover happened by chance – after hanging out on another shoot a few weeks later, Lane heard the band’s art director hassling them to choose an album cover. He’d brought his portfolio with him, which included the now-infamous “ass shot”.230 29) The Notorious BIG – Ready to DieBiggie Smalls picked a baby resembling himself to star on the cover of his debut Ready to Die. By doing so, he summed up the album’s autobiographical content, which begins with childhood and closes with death. He also uses the notion of childhood innocence to foreshadow how our surroundings can have a lasting impact.It might not be the quintessential David Bowie album, or the one that introduced fans to Starman. But the face staring back at you from this particular album cover is, undeniably, the most recognisable Bowie look: red mullet a gaunt, sombre expression and that famous lightning bolt across his face.One of the greatest debut albums – and arguably the best hip hop record – of all time has a fittingly arresting cover image. A photo of a seven-year-old Nas was superimposed over Danny Clinch’s snapshot of one of the housing projects in the New York rapper’s native Queensbridge. Designed by Aimee Macauley, it was intended to reflect how the projects used to be Nas’s entire world, “until I educated myself to see there’s more out there”. But Nas was also inviting you to see through his eyes and into those very projects where he grew up, and feel immersed in that world via the power of his storytelling.Years after its release, Kate Bush noted how The Dreaming was deemed by many to be her “she’s gone mad” album. Its multiple, disparate narratives and metamorphic production intertwine with movie influences, particularly music hall crime capers of Houdini’s era. On the sepia-toned album cover, Bush plays the role of the escapist’s wife, looking to the distance, rather than at his face, as though trying to contact him via a different medium than mere speech. The way she holds his face in her hands gives her an additional, mesmerising power and conjures the old-world, eccentric mysticism with which she was – and still is – associated.Photographer Michael Spencer Jones had a task on his hands organising Oasis for what is indisputably their best album cover. It was different to what the band originally envisioned – Noel Gallagher had spotted a photo of the Beatles sat round a coffee in Japan, so thought Oasis could be photographed at the dining table of guitarist Bonehead’s house in Manchester. Jones didn’t see this working, so spread the members around Bonehead’s living room instead, and asked them to bring objects that were personal to them for decoration. Noel liked Jones’s idea of hanging an inflatable globe (brought by one of the roadies) from the ceiling. “Yeah, global dominance,” he said. Soon after the album’s release, that’s exactly what happened.Andy Warhol conceived the idea of a vinyl cover with working zipper that would reveal a pair of white briefs beneath the bulging jeans of a male model, who has to this day never been identified. Many fans assumed it was Mick Jagger, but people working on the shoot said several models were photographed and Warhol never revealed which one was used. It represented what the Rolling Stones quickly became famous for: an edgy, hyper-sexual kind of swagger.German painter Mati Klarwein – who also created Santana’s artwork for Abraxas – was behind this gatefold cover that served as an embodiment of Davis’s creative manifesto. The surreal and complex renderings mirror what Davis does with the music itself challenging traditional notions of structure and juxtaposing concepts of passivity and aggressiveness, anger and love.930 22) ACDC – Back in BlackBack in Black’s all-black cover design fit the mood of a band emerging from dark times. In the wake of the death of vocalist Bon Scott, ACDC had tracked down Brian Johnson, whom Scott had previously mentioned to the band. Certain people at their record label, Atlantic, weren’t so keen on the cover, but the band were insistent: it was a memorial to Scott. And now one of the most instantly recognisable and best-loved album covers in rock history.Visually striking and symbolic of what Debbie Harry was doing both as a woman and an artist in the music industry, Parallel Lines’ cover was shot by photographer Edo Bertoglio. It was apparently rejected by the band but later chosen by their manager, Peter Leeds. The juxtaposition between the band, who beam in their matching dress suits like a bunch of schoolboys at their senior prom, and Harry, who stands defiant in her white dress, hands on hips, is wonderful. “I’m not impressed,” her stance seems to say. “Try harder.”Dylan walks arm-in-arm with then-girlfriend and muse Suze Rotolo through the West Village in freezing New York, February 1963.

Throughout the Brexit process we have been completely ignored. The past three years have underlined the rising and unsustainable cost to Scotland of not being independent.“It is no wonder that support for independence is at record levels. The people of Scotland deserve the choice of a better future than the Brexit Britain being imposed upon us against our will.”The BMG study did not include the views of\u0026nbsppeople in\u0026nbspNorthern Ireland, but a recent survey by pollster Lord Ashcroft found the outcome of a border poll would be on a knife-edge, with 45 per cent saying they would vote to stay in the UK and 46 per cent to join the Republic.The DUP’s MP for Belfast East,\u0026nbspGavin Robinson, said, “Northern Ireland’s future is best served inside the United Kingdom for economic, social, cultural and historic reasons.“The criteria for holding a border poll are clearly outlined and have not been met. However, the focus should not be on holding a isive border poll and creating further community tension in Northern Ireland.“We want to see the Northern Ireland assembly and devolved institutions restored so that decisions can be taken on schools, hospitals and the other vital public services which everyone relies on.”BMG questioned 1,504 adults in England, Scotland and Wales between 3 and 6 September.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Premium Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Premium.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

What has happened since the referendum, initially slowly, but increasingly accelerated over the last few months, is that it has moved away from those values. It has become more intolerant.”Taking aim at Mr Johnson in an interview with The Observer, he continued: “There is a scorched earth approach to delivering Brexit by 31 October at the risk of our institutions, at the risk of our democracy, at the risk of our economy. That should never be allowed to happen.”But his appointment could risk angering some Lib Dem activists, already dismayed at Dr Lee joining their ranks, after he caused controversy in 2016 for filibustering the Turing Bill – designed to pardon gay people convicted under now-abolished offences.Dem leader with EU parliament’s chief Brexit coordinator Guy Verhofstadt (PA)His defection takes the total tally of Liberal Democrat MPs to 18 – up from 12 after the 2017 election.

Such an outcome would\u0026nbspwreak havoc\u0026nbspwith the sector’s “just in time” supply chains across the English Channel and result in tariffs on exports to the EU.On Friday, JD Wetherspoon reported a 4.5 per cent fall in pre-tax profit before one-off items in the year to 28 July, even though revenue rose 7.4 per cent.

Within the country’s overlooked hinterland, conditions are desperate, with unemployment in some areas thought to be as high as 30 per cent.Despite a much vaunted war on corruption, spearheaded by presidential candidate and current prime minister Youssef Chahed, the perception across much of the country is one of an entrenched elite getting richer, while many are left to languish in poverty.Created with Sketch.

The result was television on a scale rarely seen in Tunisia’s modern history, with 11 of the country’s television channels carrying the debate, alongside 20 radio stations.From an initial field of almost 100, including the Middle East’s first openly gay candidate, the field has been whittled down to 26, all of whom now vie for the position of head of state.\u0026nbspAppearing alongside relative outsiders, such as idiosyncratic law professor\u0026nbspKais Saied and Abir Moussi, an avowed apologist for Tunisia’s pre-revolutionary regime, were establishment stalwarts, Chahed, defence minister Abdelkarim Zbidi and the first presidential candidate to be fielded by moderate Islamists Ennahda, Abdelfattah Mourou.In cafes around the capital, crowds spilled out onto the street as Tunisians gathered to watch their potential leaders trade in soundbites for the chance to proceed to the second round of voting, the date for which has yet to be announced. \u0026nbsp\u0026nbspNevertheless, despite Karoui’s absence, rumours of private polls conducted by various international agencies suggest the momentum of his insurgent campaign may not have been dented by his absence. Across the country, the same anger that sparked the country’s 2011 revolution continues to fester and continues to fuel Nabil Karoui’s populist campaign.Karoui\u0026nbsphas remained in detention since his arrest on 23 August, and he lost the second of two appeals for conditional release on Friday.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

In the febrile atmosphere of the presidential campaign, much of the substance of the charges against\u0026nbspKaroui\u0026nbspand his brother, which were initially brought by anti-corruption watchdog,\u0026nbspIWatch, in 2016, are often overlookedYoussef Chahed (AP)In the build-up to the campaigning period, his television station\u0026nbspNessma TV made great play of images of Karoui distributing aid via his charitable association, Khalil Tounes, to the overlooked interior regions while railing against the shortcomings of Chahed and his government.“Populists and outsiders benefit from the general discontent about the bad economic conditions,” Tunisian political analyst Youssef Cherif tells\u0026nbspThe Independent.\u0026nbsp“They promise to change things and they point to the factclaim that they have nothing to do with the current conditions, that they’ll do better. So people, in search of hope, believe them and fall for their rhetoric.”Always perceived as something of a maverick, Riahi has yet to greatly trouble Tunisia’s political conscience.He fled the country in November after he accused of Chahed and his immediate circle of plotting a coup d’etat. The charges were swiftly dismissed by the military court Riahi had lodged them with.Populists and outsiders benefit from the general discontent about the bad economic conditionsHowever, the accusation reinforced the perception among parts of Tunisia’s political class who sought to portray the prime minister as a tyrant, a perception Karoui’s team made much play of during his campaign, significantly ratcheting up their denunciations of official complicity in the businessman’s arrest on 23 August. \u0026nbspInstead, Karoui’s supporters cast them, and the delay in bringing them to court, as further evidence of an orchestrated campaign to silence their “Nelson Mandela of Tunisia”.Meet the man hoping to become the Muslim world’s first gay presidentTheir claims are not entirely without substance.In May, the outspoken television mogul had his channel taken off air after armed police raided his offices in central Tunis alleging breaches of broadcasting guidelines.In July, shortly after Karoui established his lead in the last of the official polls, the government passed an electoral amendment that would have essentially precluded him and a small number of rival candidates from running for president, legislation that former President Essebsi declined to either sign into law or return to parliament before his death.Irrespective of the claims of either camp, after years of marginalisation many within Tunisia are choosing to see the coming contest as one between the establishment class that has consistently overlooked them, and a fresh tranche of anti-system politicians that, like so many around the world, promise\u0026nbspto rewrite the rulebook in their favour. \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp \u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Premium Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Premium.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

In practice, very few men — less than one in 16 — take advantage of their legal right, often because they fear retribution.Now two men in Japan who did take time off to care for newborns are suing their employers, saying the companies punished them with demotions and pay cuts after they returned from paternity leave.Their lawsuits, which are highly unusual in Japan, are prompting a discussion in the country about long-standing cultural norms and company expectations. Overwhelmingly in Japan, women still assume responsibility for the vast majority of child care while men are expected to show extreme loyalty to their employers at the expense of their families.The first hearing in one of the lawsuits took place in Tokyo District Court on Thursday, just a day after Japan’s new environment minister said he was considering taking paternity leave early next year.Because the minister, Shinjiro Koizumi, is married to Christel Takigawa, a celebrity television presenter, a full-blown media frenzy ensued. He remarked that the fuss about his decision — with both supporters and critics weighing in — indicated that Japan was “rigid” and “old-fashioned.”Created with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Rescue workers on a boat rescue a person stranded inside a flooded tunnel after heavy floods in Pilar de la Horadada, SpainPolice officers try to control the crowd after members of the public were invited to view Robert Mugabe\u0027s body as it lies in state at the Rufaro stadium in Harare, ZimbabweA US flag hangs from a steel girder, damaged in the September 11, 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center at a memorial in Jersey City.

A Mediterranean relative, known as the Big Pink Jellyfish (Drymonema dalmatinum) has been known to science since the 1800s but when spotted in 2014 it had been almost 70 years since the last sighting.

A former education minister, Hirokazu Matsuno, said in June that if men took paternity leave it would help more women work and potentially help increase the country’s birthrate.Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said he understood that more men wanted to take paternity leave. “But there is a certain atmosphere and environment in companies or society which make them feel it is difficult to take it,” he said.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The man, Glen Wood, alleges that he was demoted and eventually fired after he took paternity leave. Next month, the first public hearing is expected in his lawsuit.Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley has denied paternity harassment and said it intends to fight the allegations in court, according to the Associated Press.In the hearing Thursday, an employee of Asics, the sneaker maker, said he had been subjected to harassment and demotion both before and after he took paternity leave. The plaintiff, who requested anonymity because he fears he and his family will be attacked on social media, is seeking damages of close to $85,000.According to his legal complaint, the man, who is 38, started his career at Asics in 2011, working in the sports promotion department, often as a liaison between athletes and the company. His first demotion — to menial tasks such as scheduling fleet cars for maintenance — came after he alleged that one of his bosses drove drunk and that a colleague slapped him at a work party, according to his complaint.His second demotion came when he returned to work after his first paternity leave of just over a year following the 2015 birth of his first son, his complaint alleges. The company assigned him to a warehouse loading and unloading goods, the complaint says. Eventually, he was transferred to the human resources department and his salary was cut.The plaintiff’s complaint says that after he finished a paternity leave with his second son, one that also lasted more than a year, he returned to his previous job in the human resources department, where he had been assigned to translate documents into English, despite having no expertise in translation.On social media, critics who have heard about the case in the Japanese press have attacked the plaintiff for taking so much time off.“Don’t think that you’ll have a place to belong when you, a man, take child care leave for two years\u0026nbsplol lol,” wrote one commentator on Twitter. “You should be thankful that they’re even allowing you to do warehouse work. You didn’t work at all for two years, so don’t try to think you’re just the same as the other employees.”Asics issued a statement saying that many of the allegations are “against the facts” and that it regretted not reaching a settlement with its employee.Asics said it planned to continue improving its “work environment and support systems so that employees can actively participate in work even in the period of their pregnancy, childbearing or child care.”Analysts said it is not surprising that the few men who do take paternity leave are subject to pressure from their employers and colleagues.Japanese work culture is very demanding, with employees putting in long hours late into the evenings and on weekends. Breaking long-standing patterns is difficult for workers, who not only fear they may be punished by their employers but may also believe that the success of their companies depends on their personal sacrifices.Fewer than third of new fathers take paternity leave, study showsDads who don\u0027t take paternity leave have no idea what it\u0027s likeThe best companies for maternity and paternity pay, revealed“Men still believe that as long as they work seriously and hard in the company, then society and the family will function very well,” said Naoto Sasayama, a lawyer who is representing the Asics employee. “That is the illusion they are still trying to cling to.”Many Japanese employees have a strong sense that they will impose too heavily on their colleagues if they take a leave.“If a male full-time employee who is involved in decision-making or a core part of a project wants to take paternity leave for months, some people may question that,” said Makoto Yoshida, a professor of industrial labour sociology at Ritsumeikan University in Kyoto.Wood’s lawyer, Yoshitatsu Imaizumi, said he hoped that the recent paternity harassment cases might pave the way for other fathers, and make it easier for other men to exercise their right to care for their children.“In Japan, there are a lot of good laws on the books,” said Imaizumi. “But the problem is that few labourers exercise their rights under the law. We need some courageous people to exercise their rights and stand up in society.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Premium Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Premium.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Bigger than  football pitches, it has room for , staff.It’s now clear that, far from harming the Square Mile, Brexit will help London cement its place as the world’s leading financial hub.Now the Project Fear merchants issue blood-curdling warnings against a No Deal Brexit, making it impossible for Boris Johnson to negotiate with Brussels.Ex-Chancellor Philip Hammond says leaving against the EU’s wishes would cost Britain £billion — equivalent to a whopping four per cent of our annual GDP — doing damage “equivalent to the  financial crash”.Spreadsheet Phil’s meltdown scenario, based on those same  Treasury forecasts, lacks all credibility.EU trade accounts for barely a tenth of the UK economy. Just eight per cent of our firms do business with the -member bloc.The idea Brexit would cause a shock equal to the largest peace-time slowdown in a century, when the entire world economy slumped, is absurd.No Deal is constantly demonised by those who “respect the Referendum result” but are really Brexit-blockers. Preparations have been made on all sides to minimise any disruption.Agreements have been struck so exports will keep flowing and planes will fly.Phone roaming charges won’t change, as the big ­telecom outfits have now ­confirmed.Trade agreements with our most important global customers have been agreed or are in the works.What the doom-mongers don’t mention is that No Deal could mean lower prices for food and consumer goods such as clothing and footwearthe UK drops high tarfs on imports from outside the EU which, for now, Brussels forces us to impose.It is rarely acknowledged that the Irish government has admitted there won’t be new physical infrastructure in ­sensitive locations, and customs checks can happen away from the Irish border.When did you last hear on the TV news that UK exports to the EU have fallen from  per cent of goods we sold abroad  years ago to just  per cent now — despite the much-vaunted single market and customs union it would apparently be so disastrous to leave And why are we never told UK trade outside the EU is now not only the majority of our trade, but is fast-growing, produces a surplus and is conducted largely under World Trade Organisation rules Of course the future is not without danger. Indeed, there is a huge great threat on the horizon that could smash this prosperity to smithereens.And that is a hard-Left Labour government led by Jeremy Corbyn, who this week pledged to make it easier for workers to strike, threatening ato the dark days of the s.Polling from Financial News suggests City investors would rather a No Deal Brexit than Corbyn taking over as Prime Minister — and rightly so.Speaking to his trade union paymasters at the TUC on Tuesday, this Magic Grandpa pledged to sweep aside long-standing anti-strike rules, opening the floodgates to widespread industrial action.A Corbyn government would cause havoc — threatening ato the Britain of my childhood, when we ended up being bailed out, going “cap in hand” to the International Monetary Fund.The damage he would inflict would be catastrophic. What forward-thinking firm would want to invest in a country where the government would take ten per cent of your companyyou happen to be successful enough to employ more than  people That’s what Corbyn and his Marxist dreamers are planning.And the wind in their sails blows hard, thanks not to their appeal on the doorstep — two thirds of Brits think him indecisive and incompetent, according to a recent YouGov poll.No, Comrade Corbyn has been helped by the Remainer corporate establishment, in turn assisted by gloomy Remainer economists and an overwhelmingly Remainer media class, which has railed against a genuine Brexit.It’s now threatening to overturn the  Referendum result altogether. That would mean thwarting Prime Minister Boris Johnson, evenhe can only offer No Deal, which could easily result in Corbyn entering No.But any No Deal damage would be minimal and ­temporary.

Presumably their own ­unelected pseudo-Government will see to it, since Boris Johnson won’t agree.This pro-EU elite — Letwin, Blair, Mandelson and the rest, in treacherous collusion with Brussels — want to “resolve” Brexit. They mean “reverse” it, with a referendum question splitting the Leave vote and stitched up for Remain.Brexit won’t be “resolved”we back Leave again. They won’t accept that result any more than the last. Their referendum would be utterly illegitimate.To cap it all, ex-Tory Remainers are now plotting for Rory Stewart to stand against Boris in Uxbridge.Remember Amber Rudd and others throwing hissy fits when he kicked these wreckers out  What  did they deserve THE Sun has repeatedly predicted No Deal would cause turbulence. Leavers expect it.Most know it could hit them in the pocket too. But maintaining a fat bank balance and a comfortable existence isn’t the argument-clincher for them that it is for many Remainers.It’s no surprise Remain MPs are gleefully deploying the “Yellowhammer” report to ratchet up the hysteria about Brexit. It won’t impress Leavers.And we would love to read an “impact assessment” into telling a .million majority their votes didn’t count and surrendering our economy to Marxists.No Deal risks short-term disruption. No Brexit guarantees the annihilation of trust in our democracy, a rapid surge in extremism and probable disorder.No one should gamble on the latter.NIGEL Farage is still a magnet for Brexit voters. The Tories are crazy to rubbish him.Read on Pages  and  how he enthralled paying punters at a packed venue in a diehard Labour constituency.Some in No cannot shake off their ­dislike of Farage. They must rethink. It will be extremely tough to switch Labour-voting northern Leavers to the Tories to counter Tory losses to Remainers. A smart deal with Farage could secure an election majority, and Brexit.Reject that and it looks bleak.MEGHAN’S clothing campaign is a top idea.Every item bought means an identical one is donated to a group which provides smart outfits to help unemployed women find work.We hope it is a massive success.

For a packet of  cigarettes the saving will be as much as £. But Hancock, it appears, will not be celebrating.He has complained that he wasn’t consulted about the Chancellor’s plan to reintroduce duty free on trips from EU countries, and that it will help to undermine the Department of Health’s campaigns to persuade us to smoke and drink less.Obviously, that is good advice. But is anyone really going to take up smoking or go on a drinking binge just because it becomes a little cheaper to buy cigarettes and alcohol at an airport Duty free is a harmless little treat for ing holiday- makers — something to ensure we remain in good cheer for a few weeks after wefrom holiday, or a little in the way of compensationit rained all week on our Spanish beach.Duty free, as anyone over  will remember, used to be a staple part of a foreign holiday. The concept arose because once we have passed through security at a port or airport, we are deemed for tax purposes already to have left the country.Customs and Excise authorities concluded, there- fore, that they had no right to charge us duties designed to capture taxes from domestic consumption.We are theoretically still liable to pay duty on goods when we are entering a country. But in practice most countries will waive duty on small quantities of alcoholic drinks and tobacco products brought in by arriving passengers.As a result, passengers arriving in Britain from non-EU countries are currently allowed to bring back up to four litres of still wine, a litre of spirits,  litres of beer and  cigarettes without paying duty.For passengers arriving in Britain from other EU countries, however, the rules changed in  — seven years after the creation of the single market.Duty free was abolished for people travelling between EU countries. In some ways, the single market was more generous than the previous duty-free regime.Rather than just four litres of wine, for example, we are now allowed to bring unlimited quantities of wine without paying UK duty, so long as it is only for personal consumption.Given that the duty on wine is a lot lower in France than in Britain, we can save a small fortune by stocking up in a French hypermarket.What the EU single market did stop, however, was our ability to travel, say, from France to Britain without paying duty in either country. What Sajid Javid wants to do is to give us the best of both worlds.From October  — assuming we leave the EU without continuing to be subject to the rules of the single market — we will regain our duty-free allowances.But, in addition, we will continue to be allowed to bring unlimited quantities of alcohol and tobacco which we bought in France and which we intend to use only for personal consumption.The main beneficiaries of duty free, needless to say, are smokers and drinkers. But you don’t have to smoke or drink in order to benefit from its existence.The profits from duty free allow airlines and ferry operators to keep their ticket prices down. When the EU proposed to abolish duty free in the s, the travel industry calculated that , jobs in the UK were dependent on its existence.That was no doubt exaggerated for effect, and of course the budget airline industry has grown hugely in the past  years.Butwe want to be able to continue to fly to Spain for a tenner , the reintroduction of duty free is going to be a signicant influence on what airlines can offer by way of cheap tickets.The fuss over Sajid Javid’s proposal has reopened isions in the Government over so-called “sin taxes” on booze and fags.For some, like Matt Hancock, who this week praised the sugar levy on fizzy drinks, sin taxes are a useful instrument for persuading us to lead healthier lives. Others, the Prime Minister included, are more guarded.The problem with slapping taxes on alcohol, cigarettes and unhealthy food is that they are regressive taxes which impact disproportionately on the poor.I would say to Matt Hancock: Give us all the advice on healthy living that you can. And I don’t object to proportionate taxes which reflect the cost of medical care for smokers and excessive drinkers.But leave it to us to decide how we want to lead our lives — and don’t deny us a small pleasure like being able to buy a small duty-free treat on our way home.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

This is because they are so far apart that architects had to factor in the curvature of Earth.Today, it’s still as unnecessary as it ever was. And it’s no longer the longest suspension bridge in the world. But it remains, in my opinion, the most beautul.In fact, and I’ve said this often, it’s the most beautul man-made thing of all time. Apart from maybe the Riva Aquarama speedboat.When I stand on the south shore on a misty morning and see the wafer-thin road disappearing off into the sea, it takes my breath away. It really does.So I’m glad it was made. And I’m glad too that the Labour government also built the Post Office Tower, even though it is now just a hazard to aircraft.Then there’s Concorde. The world did not need such a thing.And the technical challenges facing the engineers were huge. A Nasa boffin once told me that getting a passenger plane up beyond Mach  was more dficult than putting a man on the moon.But that old commie Tony Benn had decided Concorde was going to succeed, so he pushed and he pushed and, by God, are we glad he did.Can you imagine such a thing Because even though the beautul white bird is now grounded, we still have those memories of the shattering noise it made and the way it could make the sun rise in the West.I remember once, standing on a beach in Barbados as a British Airways Concorde roared overhead at treetop height.After it had passed, a stunned American on the next sun lounger looked at me and said: “You Brits.”I was so proud, I didn’t get round to telling him it was half French.Since Concorde though, Britain hasn’t really done anything of any great importance. There’s been talk of a new railway line from London to Manchester, but in evolutionary terms that’s just a shuffle. And now it probably won’t happen anyway.Which is why I am SO excited about the idea of a bridge linking Larne, in Northern Ireland with Portpatrick, in Scotland.Weirdly, the Labour Party — the party that created the Post Office Tower and Concorde and the Humber Bridge — are furious, saying it’s not needed and will be too expensive and it’s only been suggested to get Boris out of his backstop hole.But can you imagine such a thing A -mile bridge supported on columns ,ft high, and rising even higher in the middle so ships can pass underneath. It would be magnicent.Yes, it would be dficult to make. The seas there are rough and deep and the seabed is littered with discarded Second World War mines and bombs.But as John F Kennedy once said: “We choose to go to the moon and do the other things not because they are easy, but because they are hard.”ACCORDING to a headline in The Times this week, The Handmaid’s Tale is increasingly ringing true.Really  We are heading for the terrying society portrayed in Margaret Atwood’s brilliant book A society where women are kept either for breeding or cleaning  Where girls can be killed for speaking  Or mutilated for looking at someone in a funny way And where children are taken away at birth and given to someone  I know cricket fan and woman Theresa May has suggested that Geoffrey Boycott, who has a conviction for domestic abuse, should be given a knighthood.But that’s a long, long way from sewing up the vagina of the woman he beat.I once saw a sufferer in Burma and the pain was so excruciating that powerful muscle spasms had snapped both his legs.And it wasn’t ordinary rabies our man in Morocco had caught either. It was “furious rabies” which causes extreme thirst and a morbid fear of water. At the same time.Mercully, he has now died. And we, meanwhile, are left to ponder what sort of a God comes up with a disease like that to end nearly , lives every year.ON the basis you should know your enemy, I read a book on holiday this year about why we shouldn’t kill animals.It wasn’t called – “If you eat meat, you’re a bastard”, but that was the thrust.And after a while, I deliberately left it in the rain, so I didn’t have to finish it.However, since I ed to Britain about a month ago, I still haven’t been able to eat pork.Cows  Chickens  Sheep  Not really bothered.But some of the things I read in that book about how pigs can play video games and feel love – they stuck.And so did the bit about how frightened they look when they are being taken to the slaughterhouse.I tried this morning to have a bacon sandwich but I couldn’t bring myself to put it in my mouth.It’s annoying. Pork was always my favourite meat but I’ll have to find a substitute.I’m thinking badger. Or maybe a nice roast fox.I know people who’ve found lost phones in their trouser pockets, and most women are of capable losing anything up to a medium-sized dog in their handbags.But I’ve never heard of anyone losing themselves. Until now.A party of tourists on a bus tour of Iceland spent hours searching for a missing passenger only to find she was in the search party.She hadn’t recognised the description of herself and it wasn’t until three in the morning that her mistake became clear.Bet she was popular.AT long last, space boffins have found a planet which they reckon could be capable of supporting le.They will know soonit has an atmosphere but they’ve already worked out that the romantically named K-b does have water. And it’s only million million miles away, which means that with current technology, we could reach it in just two million years.The only problem I can see is that it’s twice the size of Earth, with eight times the mass, so any astronaut who had survived the -light year journey would weigh quite a lot when he arrivedSo much, in fact, that after a little while, his brain would be dragged into his spinal cord.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Second, it must protect the integrity of the EU’s single market. Third, it must not involve any checks on the island of Ireland.Barclay said the UK could meet the first two of these tests, but not the third. He said there was no point in presenting any detailed proposals until the EU shted on the question of checks.One Government source explains thatthe UK did, the “EU would nuke the proposals and we would be in chaos”.So the challenge for Boris is to get the EU to move on this third point. His Monday meeting with Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker gives him a chance to lobby him on this very issue.Juncker is an instinctive deal-maker and, with his term as president due to end on October , he will be keen to resolve Brexit before he goes.I also understand that several EU governments, including in France, are now apprehensive about the possibility of a second referendum.They believe it would be bad for the EU for the UK to stay in given how contested UK membership now is.They fear this would lead to every Council decision, all new EU legislation and every European Court of Justice judgment becoming a matter of controversy.The EU, though, will not abandon Ireland. This means that whatever proposal Boris comes up with will have to be something Leo Varadkar is prepared to swallow.The first meeting between the two men has given Downing Street some hope that they can find something that works for Dublin, them and the DUP.The DUP’s willingness to entertain Northern Ireland continuing to follow EU rules on agriculture has opened the door to further discussions.If Parliament had not tied Boris’s hands, he could have seenthe risk of No Deal would have pushed Dublin and the EU to compromise on the checks front. But his ability to negotiate is now weakened.For this and other reasons, the odds are still against a deal. But there is a greater chance of one than a week ago.The Liberal Democrats start their conference today in their strongest position for years.They are polling around  per cent and in line to make major gains at the next election.At conference next week they are expected to adopt as their position that a Lib Dem government – stop laughing at the back – would simply revoke Article , cancelling the referendum result.This will establish them as the most unambiguously anti-Brexit party, a development that concerns a growing number of Labour MPs in Remain seats who want their party to take a clearer line on the issue for fear of losing ground to the Lib Dems.At the same time, the policy means that the Liberal Democrats can tell voters they will make the whole issue go away. By contrast, a second referendum would drag things out.If politics is now about Leave v Remain, rather than Left v Right, expect the Lib Dems to come back with more MPs than they have ever had before, following the next election.One of the things that urgently needs sorting out in this country is technical education.Those who don’t want to do an academic degree are being ill-served by further education.Gavin Williamson, the new Education Secretary, told Cabinet this week that there are up to , people trained in Hair  Beauty yet only a need for about , new recruits to work in this industry each year.The result is tens of thousands of people doing courses that don’t lead to them getting jobs or boost this country’s productivity.Those who want a second Brexit referendum are now arguing there shouldn’t be a General Election until a second referendum has taken place.Tony Blair, Labour’s deputy leader Tom Watson and Tory rebel Oliver Letwin have all made that case this week.Leave aside the massive issue of whether there should be a second referendum before the result of the first one has even been implemented, this plan would mean that this Parliament would have to carry on sitting until well into .This is a disastrous idea. This is a useless Parliament and keeping it going will just add to the national paralysis.With no party able to command a majority in the Commons, nothing can get done.

We have Farage’s no-deal Brexiteers pulling one way.And those who want no Brexit at all pulling in the other direction.Neither are true democrats, because during the referendum the Leave camp promised to get a good deal from the EU, while Remain politicians said that they’d respect the result.And while those isive groups may shout the loudest, neither represent the majority of the British public who just want politicians to get on with it and work together to deliver a sensible Brexit.That’s why we’ve this week formed our cross-party MPs For A Deal group, to remind the public that there is still a majority of politicians who would prefer a deal-based Brexit to a catastrophic no-deal Brexit or an undemocratic no Brexit at all.Founding members include Tory leadership candidate Rory Stewart, Lib Dem Norman Lamb and Labour’s Caroline Flint.We all come from very dferent political backgrounds, and even on Brexit we’ve had our dferences. Some of us voted for Theresa May’s deal, not because it was perfect but because it delivered on the result of the referendum.Others couldn’t support it because they felt it was a ‘blind Brexit’ — a leap into the unknown — and asked May to come back with something better.But we are all agreed on one thing.After May held cross-party talks with Labour in May  she came back with ten changes to her deal, and we all believe that this compromise package was more likely to get through Parliament.We all believed at the time that MPs should have been able to debate and vote on this, but sadly it was rejected by second referendum advocates and no-dealers.The Withdrawal Agreement Bill, as it’s known, included protection of workers’ rights, food standards and the environment, which would have benefited us all.We now hope that Boris Johnson brings a similar offer back to Parliament so we can vote on it.Sometimes it’s easy to forget that  Conservative MPs backed May’s deal in March this year while more than  other MPs voted for dferent forms of a Brexit in indicative votes.The desire to agree a Brexit deal is there.A failure to do so may well result in the consequences set out in the government’s own ‘Operation Yellowhammer’ no-deal report.Sensible MPs desperately need to face down the isive voices on either side and come together in the national interest.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

My disagreements with Jeremy ­Corbyn are well known. They remain. But he has co-operated with other parties in the last weeks very sensibly and skilfully to stop a No Deal Brexit. Parliament is blocked and Boris Johnson completely boxed in. The blockage is not – as Farage and Johnson insist – because MPs are a bunch of “Remoaners” thwarting the will of the people.There is a substantial majority for doing Brexit with an agreement to replace the existing arrangements with the ­European Union. There is, however, also a big majority against No Deal Brexit for the simple reason that it is a massive gamble with the British economy that no responsible prime minister or ­government would take. And the reason Parliament has had dficulty, under both May and Johnson, of reaching agreement on the type of deal which would work, is that Brexit was an easy instruction to give but a hugely complicated one to do.We have traded and operated as a nation within Europe for almost half a century. It is the biggest commercial market and political alliance in the world right on our doorstep. Divorce was always going to be dficult.    Contrary to what we are told by the Tories, it isn’t really a negotiation with Europe. It starts with a choice. Stay in Europe’s trading structure to ­minimise economic pain and keep borders, not least in Ireland, open . Or exit, in which case the adjustment will be painful, ­particularly in Ireland. Both May and Johnson have tried to have it both ways and that was never going to work.  So the question now is how to break the blockage, because the one thing everyone wants is for the Brexit nightmare to end. Johnson wants to go back to the people in a General Election. This is crazy. We decided Brexit by a ­referendum. If we’re to reconsider it, do it the same way. An election is about masses of dferent things and is to elect a government. Don’t muddle it up with the very specic issue of Brexit, becausewe end up with another hung Parliament then nothing is resolved.

If anyone knows or saw anything suspicious in connection with the event that may help us secure itsplease contact Thames Valley Police. EventSite Design, who work at the Palace, also said on Twitter: Weaposve had some drama overnight which I wonapost elaborate on just yet but it has meant we need to redirect our contractor traffic for the day.

Trump wanted van Goghaposs aposLandscape with Snow, a  painting showing a man walking along a path in France with his dog.

When she was just -years-old Melanie Blake left her working class family home in Stockport and started le on the streets of Oldham and Salford. Desperate to carve a career for herself in  the music industry but estranged from her family, she spent several months sleeping rough while juggling part time jobs, Manchester Evening News reported.On many of the freezing cold nights she spent on the streets or in squats with strangers, her career ambitions seemed impossible to fulfill. “That first nightwas so cold I thought I was going to die,” she said. “I huddled up with these two girls and five lads, we would lie on the floor and try and keep warm. The place we stayed in was so rough...    Desperately trying to save up any money she earned as a receptionist and shop assistant to follow her dream of getting into the music business, Melanie was bereft when she came back to the squat one night and saw it boarded up. She said: “I was gutted. I had to sleep in the shed in the garden.In hindsight I should have got a BB for the night, but I was young and had this little Halax account with my running away fund and desperately didn’t want to spend any money.” A chance conversation with a squatter about a housing initiative in Salford saw Melanieaposs fortunes change. She went to the council and within the same day was given a set of keys and her own flat.    Melanie said the authorityaposs help saved her le. Within three months of moving into her own place she had saved £,. She left Greater Manchester for London on the day of her th birthday. After grafting away in temp jobs, Melanie won herself an entry-level gig at Top of the Pops, where she rubbed shoulders with s musical greats including Spice Girls and Kylie Minogue.    She caught the eye of higher ups when she began working with Claire Richards from Steps - a job that led her to launch the Nolan Sistersapos reunion tour. It was with the aposIaposm in the mood for dancingapos songsters that Melanie bagged her first million. “Everyone said I wouldn’t be able to do it. They said no one wanted to see  and -something women on stage - but they were wrong. It made millions,” said Melanie.    The experience with the Nolans inspired her to take on sexism in the music industry via a fiction book called aposThunder Girlsapos. Following the lives of a aposs girl band savagely dropped by their label, the book proved a big success and sparked a stage adaptation.Having got her first chance in Salford, Melanie is keen to bring the show to the city.   Melanie, who now lives in Crouch End, London, said: “When the show hits the Lowry Theatre stage, it will be exactly  years to the day that I left Salford for my new le in London. Itaposs been particularly emotional ing to the city for the launch It still feels like home. “Yes I live in a fancy house now and am living the dream, but when I got my chance, I wanted to bring it all back to the city that saved me.    “I was keen to invest back in the north, cast women from the north and bring the show back to the very city I was homeless in. I could have launched the show in London but for me, the Lowry Theatre was the perfect choice.” Melanie has paid for  tickets to her own show, which will be given to people in the area who wouldnapost normally be able to afford the theatre.“I only ever went to the theatre once growing up, she said.

In a candid and emotional interview, he tells the Sunday Mirror how he sobbed in the arms of a doctor, feared he would die – and felt like ending it all by driving over a clf. The -year-old is the first UK sportsman to reveal he has the virus and is breaking his silence because he wants to end stigma around HIV. He also reveals he and husband Stephen – who he met after being diagnosed – married three years ago. Stephen does not have HIV. Former Wales rugby union and league star Gareth says of his diagnosis: “I’ve been living with this secret for years. I’ve felt shame and keeping such a big secret has taken its toll.    “I had a fear people would judge me and treat me like a leper because of a lack of knowledge. I was in a dark place, feeling suicidal. I thought about driving off a clf. “To me, wanting to die was just a natural thought and felt like the easier way out, but you have to confront things. And having a strong support system and the personal strength and experience of overcoming those emotions got me through it. “Many people live in fear and shame of having HIV, but I refuse to be one of them now. We need to break the stigma once and for all. “I’m speaking out because I want to help others and make a dference.”    Gareth is speaking on the eve of the Rugby World Cup starting next week – when he will be a pundit for ITV. While reluctant to reveal the date of his diagnosis, Gareth spells out the profound moment he was given the news by medics. The former British Lions captain, who revealed he was gay in  and retired from rugby in , said: “I’ll never ever forget the moment I found out. I went for a routine sexual health test at a private clinic in Cardf. “I’d had the tests every now and again and they’d always come back okay. I didn’t feel ill and I thought everything was going to be fine. “The woman who did the test took blood as usual, then I went out to my car and waited for about an hour before going back in to get my results.”  His voice choking with emotion, Gareth adds: “When I went back in, I sat down on a chair next to a doctor’s bench. She told me in a quite matter of fact way I had tested HIV positive. “When she said those words I broke down. I was in such a state. I immediately thought I was going to die. I felt like an express train was hitting me at mph. I wasn’t expecting it at all. Then I was thinking ‘how long have I got left ’ I was distraught.” Gareth, who is ft in and st, found himself sobbing on the doctor’s shoulder while struggling to understand the enormity of the news and what the future held. He goes on: “She treated me with such empathy and understanding and after about  minutes I got myself together. I remember she told me, ‘You need to go to the hospital right now and start the process straight away, because the doctors will be able to help you better understand your diagnosis. Don’t wait for tomorrow’.    “I drove straight to Cardf Royal Infirmary, but I was still in such a traumatised state. In tears, I rang a good friend on the way and blurted it out. I told him, ‘I’ve got HIV – I’m going to die’. He was trying to comfort and reassure me and telling me to go and speak to the doctors, but I’d already made my mind up that my le was over. “I’d never known anyone with HIV or AIDS. And everything I’d heard about HIV was death and frailness. Like most people I lived with the belief that HIV is terminal. I tried to keep going as normal in the days afterwards, but felt completely numb.” Gareth had to reveal his diagnosis to a string of former sexual partners so they could be tested. He says: “I had to tell people I’d had sex with since my last test that I was HIV positive. “Your history suddenly becomes very relevant and you have a duty of care to tell them. I did it over the phone. That was hard.”  Gareth married his teenage sweetheart Jemma in . They split up after he told her he was gay – and he went public about his sexuality  years ago. He was the first British rugby international to “come out”. There are an estimated , people in the UK with HIV – Human Immunodeficiency Virus – but many consider it too taboo to reveal it. That is why Gareth remained silent, until now. He says: “I’ve chosen to speak out about this in the Sunday Mirror because it’s the paper I trust to put my story out there in the right way and because I believe together we can make a dference. “But the truth is I’m still scared even now of people finding out I’m living with HIV and I’m s****ing myself and feel petried about what the reaction will be, because we still live in an era where HIV is not spoken about.” Gareth admits he once believed the myths surrounding transmission of HIV. He adds: “I thought thatpeople knew about me being HIV positive they wouldn’t want to breathe the same air as me, they wouldn’t want to drink from the same cup as me andI walked into a coffee shop everyone would just walk out because they’d be so scared of being infected by me.  “I thinkyou went out on the street right now and told  people you have HIV,  per cent of them would be scared you’re going to give it to them. “I don’t blame people for thinking it, because I did too, but we need to change that by talking about it and educating people.” HIV targets and alters the immune system, increasing the risk and impact of other infections and diseases. Without treatment, the lelong infection – which is spread through sexual contact and blood – can progress to AIDS. No cure is currently available for HIV or AIDS.  But modern advances mean HIV patients in countries with good access to healthcare very rarely develop AIDS once they get treatment. Le expectancy of people with the virus is approaching that of a person who tests negative, as long as they adhere to a combination of ongoing medications called anti-retroviral therapy. Gareth takes one tablet containing four medications each day. His condition is now under control to the point it is considered “undetectable” and can’t be passed on. He receives regular counselling and has blood tests at Cardf Royal Infirmary every six months. But Gareth has never used the main entrance, saying: “I’ve always gone through a side door before opening hours because I thoughtpeople spotted me they’d put two and two together and work out my secret. “It has all been shrouded in a sense of shame and from me entering the clinic to leaving always feels like a blur. I still don’t feel I could walk in through the main entrance even now, although maybe that’ll change.  “HIV is a scary subject. There’s a lot of fear and ignorance. But the fear is something people learned in the s from the tombstone adverts on TV. In  there is nothing to be afraid of. “People need to know that due to modern medicine HIV is not le-threatening any more and because of the medication I take, there’s no way it can be passed on. It’s very controllable. In terms of effect on the body, diabetes is considered worse to have than HIV by doctors. I’m not dying.” The star remains supremely fit and will today compete in the Wales Ironman event in Tenby, South Wales. He says: “I’m fitter now than when I played rugby and I didn’t have HIV then. I’m not just all right, I’m better than all right.” Gareth, from Bridgend, won  caps for Wales from  to . He made global headlines when he came out as gay while still playing rugby union. He went on to play rugby league, earning four caps for Wales.  A career in TV followed – he was on Celebrity Big Brother, Dancing on Ice and appeared on Oprah and the Ellen DeGeneres chat show. Last year, he and MP Damian Collins launched a draft amendment to the  Football Offences Act that would outlaw homophobic abuse at matches. In November  Gareth was attacked by a -year-old in Cardf over his sexuality. Officers dealt with the youth offender by restorative justice following a request by Gareth – who believed it was the best way for the lad to learn. Gareth is donating his fee for this interview to HIV and AIDS charity The Terrence Higgins Trust. He says: “Through the Trust I’ve met other people with HIV and that has been powerful. It made me realise how much good I can do and the part I have to play in making a dference. “I hope me speaking out about my diagnosis will help a lot of people.” Ian Green, chief executive of the Terence Higgins Trust says... When I was first diagnosed with HIV in , I never thought I’d live to  – or that it would lead to me being good pals with a rugby legend. But that’s what has happened and I’m very glad it has. Gareth Thomas has ‘come out’ about his HIV because he wants what all of us living with it want – the public to take notice of the incredible medical progress made. For both of us, that includes now being able to say without doubt someone with HIV and on effective treatment – like me and Gareth – can’t pass it on. This is backed by robust medical evidence and endorsed by hundreds of organisations across the globe, including us at Terrence Higgins Trust. And with a front page exclusive in today’s Sunday Mirror, he’s well on his way to educating thousands and thousands about what it means to live with HIV in . It’s been a privilege to get to know Gareth . At the Trust we’re big advocates of ensuring people diagnosed with HIV can meet others living with the virus who been through that experience – taken the medication, told their family, experienced the stigma. I hope I’ve helped Gareth process his diagnosis and played a role in preparing him for today’s announcement. I was one of the first people he had ever met openly living with HIV. Now he’s met a range of dferent people and heard stories which have inspired him to speak publicly and challenge the stigma. That includes one woman who uses our Cardf support services. She told him about the impact gossip and HIV-related stigma at school has on her young son. It’s for people like her that Gareth is taking on today’s Ironman Wales – a . mile swim,  mile cycle and  mile run – to prove HIV has changed a lot since many people last heard about it. Because out-of-date beliefs about HIV are undeniably standing in the way of progress in the fight against it. For example, our recent polling showed almost half of people would still feel uncomfortable kissing someone living with HIV. To be clear: HIV has never been passed on through kissing or any other day-to-day contact. But this is exactly why we need Gareth in our corner. He has the public profile and drive to get this out there. After all, when was the last time HIV was explored in back pages with sports fans given an update on all the progress made  Thank you, Gareth, for speaking out today. I’m excited to work with you to achieve so much more.Contact THT Direct with questions on    or via tht.org.uk thtdirect "},{"url":null,"title":"girl 14 who too big","story":"NewsGirl, , who is too big for her school unorm was told to sit in isolationKada Jones says shes \"been crying for the past five days\" after staff at Portchester Community School in Fareham, Hampshire, said her unorm infringed school rulesShareCommentsByBradley JollyOnline journalist:,  SEP NewsKada Jones, , has been forced to sit in isolation or stay at home \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribe We will use your email address only for the purpose of sending you newsletters.

Marie Hooper and her husband Steve spent a whopping £, on treatment  since  and suffered the heartbreaking pain of a miscarriage. The couple were brokenhearted six years ago when, after nine months of trying, doctors said they wouldnapost be able to conceive naturally, with some medically professionally suggested theyaposd never have kids. The -year-old former hairdresser was advised by someone at work to look into IVF treatment, leading her to book a consultation in September .    But Marieaposs renewed hope turned to heartache once again when a doctor said her weight would prevent her from undergoing the treatment. She had already gone from  stone to  stone since the start of the year, but was told to lose another three before being eligible for an NHS IVF. It was so frustrating to hear I needed to do more, especially because exercising wasnapost something I enjoyed doing, she said. But I was really motivated, I knew it was what I had to do in order to give me and my husband a baby, which is all we wanted. Marie continued to swap pizzas for peanuts and kebabs for kale, as well as using an exercise bike at home, to eventually reach her target weight of  stone at the start of . She credits much of her success to Slimming World, which she joined in  when her weight loss journey begun.    The couple had their first attempt at IVF treatment in March that year, but it failed. Marie said:That was a really awful thing to go through but I knew it was a possibility so we decided to try again really soon. Just two months later she found out she was pregnant following a second attempt at treatment. In February  the coupleaposs first child, James, was born in their hometown of Sheffield, South Yorkshire. Marie and Steve, a -year-old bus driver, say Jamesaposs arrival was a dream come true following three years of suffering. We had both been through so much to get to that point so to finally have had a baby felt amazing, Marie said. It was the end of a really long and dficult journey but I knew that I wanted to give it another go and try for a second.    I wanted James to have a sibling. A sibling is like your best friend and I wanted to have that for him. But the process second time round proved to be even more painful than the first. On Marieaposs third and fourth attempts at treatment her body failed to respond to the drugs and her fth, in , resulted in a miscarriage. She said: After the fth attempt, that was the worst month of my le. I was devastated. I felt so depressed I didnapost want to be with anybody. But after a few days, I decided I wanted to do it again. I was determined. The couple had already spent £, on IVF and didnapost have any money left, so crowdfunded for financial support. To their surprise the public donated a whopping £,, which enabled them to give treatment another go. In March , Marie got the brilliant news she was pregnant again and that December her youngest son Jack was born.  Marie said: Going through IVF is like going through the worldaposs longest labour. Itaposs so, so dficult because of the dramatic ups and downs. Weaposd hear good news one day then have it taken away the next, so it was hard to ever be happy.

The bully uses her heels to pound the girl’s head and kicks her in the face with the toecaps as the victim clasps her hands to her face. Throughout the video, the girl never lts a finger to strike back as the attacker sneers: “Do you want it again or not  Are you going to fight me back ” When the girl curls tighter into a miserable ball without replying the thug spits “Tramp” and stalks off.

Aberdare Community School, in Aberdare, has been branded a prison by one furious mum after her daughter was put into isolation because of her skirt. Another mum said her daughter told her girls are being stopped and told to wipe their faces to prove their tans are not make up. And another girl allegedly had to prove her tan was genuine after she was put in isolation when the school deemed it was fake. Several parents have said that strict enforcement of unorm and appearance rules has led to large numbers of pupils being put in isolation or sent home to change in the first two weeks of term. Gemma Thomas, from Aberdare is mother of two girls aged  and , at the school.    She said her older daughter was put in isolation after being told one skirt was too short and another the wrong material.When she tried trousers she was told they were too tight around the thighs. “The first day back my -year-old daughter spent the entire day in isolation from am to pm. They don’t give them work, they just have to sit and be quiet. She added: “She’s been in isolation two or three times now since the start of term because they say her unorm does not conform because they say her skirt is too short - but it does come to her knee. “The second time they told her her trousers were too tight on the thighs and on the third day they said her skirt was not the right material. “One of the skirts I bought in Howells in Mountain Ash, which is the regulation skirt supplier, but they said it’s too short. The other skirt, which I bought in Asda, they said is the wrong material. “My daughter also told me girls are being told to stop and wipe their faces to prove their tans are not make up.I’ve been told they are making girls prove it’s real tan and prove they’ve been on holiday.”  Emma Blayney said her -year-old daughter couldn’t get a regulation skirt long enough that also fits her waist. “My daughter had isolation all day on Monday for her skirt being too short when it’s just above the knee.It’s from the shop they ask you to go to as well. She’s being punished for having long legs. “I rang the school five times on Monday as she had the Howells skirt on in the longest they do.They are not thinking about dferent body shapes and are going to make these children so self conscious. “She hated it in isolation, hated just sitting in silence. It really upset her being there. It’s like a prison not a school.” Samantha Rogers said her daughter Emily Seymour, , was also put in isolation for having the wrong skirt, but claimed teachers disagreed on what was allowed and what not. “I had a phone call to say my daughter’s skirt was too short, she added.  I explained to the teacher that after trying a number of skirts we chose the one from the longersection because she is nearly  years-old but with the waist of a nine to  year-old this was going to have an impact on theof her skirt. “Ten minutes later I had another phone call to say they had re-checked her skirt and it was actually OK but she had to stay in isolation.Ten minutes later I had another phone call off a dferent teacher to say her skirt was too short. Rob Uprichard, whose son is in the school’s sixth form, said his cousin’s daughter was put in isolation for having a tan which the school claimed was fake tan. He said: “She would have been in isolation all week but her father went to the school. Isolation is just being stuck in a room all day. She’s been off all week. “She had to prove her tan came from a holiday abroad.” "},{"url":null,"title":"queen reveals not want talk","story":"NewsThe Queen does not want to talk about Meghan Markle on riding tripJournalist Quentin Letts said his friend was given advice not to mention the Sussexes when meeting Her MajestyShareCommentsByTfany Lo:,  SEP Updated:,  SEP NewsThe Queen can talk about anything but the Sussexes \"Get the biggest Royal Family stories by emailSubscribe We will use your email address only for the purpose of sending you newsletters.

Brits spend thousands on the hideous “hunting trophies” from overseas sellers. Other sickening taxidermy on the online shopping site includes rare birds of prey. And the furs of another protected species, the red fox, are being flogged still riddled with holes from the bullets used to slaughter them. The ads, complete with disturbing photographs of the creatures’ mounted bodies, are banned by eBay.    Yet one overseas seller bragged he has sold more than  stuffed kills to the UK through the site. The dead animals and birds can be shipped here from Eastern Europe – but the Brits who buy them may be breaking the law. UK laws control the import of parts, skins or pelts from animals listed under the Convention on International Trade in En-dangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora. And any species listed on CITES appendix I and II are banned on eBay. Meanwhile Brits who buy taxidermy must obtain an Article  permit via the Animal and Plant Health Agency or the Department for Environment. Yet we found eBay sellers prepared to ship the endangered creatures’ carcasses over here, no questions asked. One up for grabs was a Barbary macaque – an endangered monkey, banned from international trade under CITES. The dead creature, whose natural habitat would have been Morocco, Gibraltar or Algeria, was on sale for £, and was described as: “Suitable for decoration of a cabinet, restaurant, classroom, museum exposition, country house, apartment, bedroom, hall, sauna...”    An east African vervet monkey listed as a “real stuffed hunting trophy”, is on sale for £, from the same seller in Russia. They showed us apparently legitimate export documents, but failed to ask to see a permit. Instead, our investigator was offered a discountshe bought both monkeys together. All she had to do was submit a UK address and payment details. The Red Fox is protected under CITES Appendix II – but pelts from the animals are available from Ukraine for around £. The ad said: “All skins have bullet holes from bullets... Fur is % quality. Does not molt.” Another seller in Israel advertised a stuffed kestrel falcon –another creature protected under CITES Appendix II – for £. Again we were able to submit a UK delivery address for both items, no questions asked. The adverts we found were taken down after we contacted eBay. The site said: “We have filters in place to block prohibited items and we constantly monitor our marketplace to enforce this.”    We launched our investigation after a retired teacher was last month fined £ for owning illegal taxidermy. Susan Tate, , of Anglesey, also had to pay £ costs after officers seized her -piece collection, including a red squirrel bought on eBay.

Rachel Round is heading up the Trussell Trust project and said that despite the ongoing regeneration in Rhyl, there are still many families going hungry. She said: As Christians we recognise that we have a duty to care for those who find themselves in need of help and support. That help will be available to everyone irrespective of their beliefs or non-beliefs.    We recognise that ending hunger is about more than food. We will provide compassionate, practical support to people in crisis in order to tackle the root causes that lock them into poverty and build people’s resilience so they are less likely to need a food bank in the future. Where requested we will refer those in need of help to other partner agencies who can help with specic issues.Earlier this year, the Kingaposs Storehouse stocks said it had been hammered by people struggling to live off Universal Credit , with some having to wait as long as eight weeks for money under the controversial benefit reform.   Several times, volunteers had to issue urgent appeals for help after shelves were depleted by demand.

One was an elderly lady whose husband died without leaving a will, forcing her to turn to the food bank because she couldnapost access his bank account.

Sunaina Paul needs a liver transplant and fears she may die before she manages to find a match. Tragically the -year-old, from Birmingham, has deteriorated alarmingly in past few months. To make matters worse, she has rare Blood Type B, drastically restricting the chance of a donor.Next Spring, all adults will automatically join the Organ Donation Register – but for Sunaina that’s too long to wait, Birmingham Live reports.When asked how long she could have left she replies: “How long is a piece of string  “I might not get it in time. I have to face that. I don’t know what is going to happen.    “My liver might not survive for another six months. I take a day at a time.” According to the NHS organ donation website , people are currently waiting for a transplant in the UK. Further statistics state that although there has been an increase in the proportion of registrations to the Organ Donor Register for those from an ethnic minority background, all minority groups continue to be under-represented. Between st April  and st March  there were  actual donors from an ethnic minority background out of a total UK population of  million, whilst , patients awaited transplants. Born with biliary artesia, which blocks the bile ducts so bile builds up in the liver and damages it, the clock has always been ticking.  An operation at Birmingham Children’s Hospital when she was an infant helped slow that clock. But in February this year, Sunaina, who lives in Edgbaston, became more ill than ever before. After fighting sporadic liver infections since she was , often lasting months at a time, the recent bout has proved the final straw. “Usually I have two weeks of intravenous antibiotics and it’s fine,” says Sunaina. “I had that and came home, and they put me on oral antibiotics. It was supposed to be a six to eight-week course.    “But I just got the infection back and even worse. That was February and I am still on them now.” Matters have reached the stage where only a liver transplant offers the chance of a longer le – but so far the outlook remains bleak. “I was really optimistic in the beginning,” she says. “I thought I would have it in a few weeks. But a month passed, two months passed – and it’s six months now. “I am trying to be positive but I am also trying to be realistic because I don’t want to lie to myself. “It’s not just me that’s out there who has this rare blood group. I know there has got to be others.  “Some doctors seem really positive and believe I can get a liver. Other doctors are telling me to prepare myself because it might not happen. “The first time I heard that, I think I was in a bit of a shock. I don’t really cry about it.” Despite her brave smile, Sunaina is suffering badly. “I am always in pain,” she confesses. “Constantly. It is always there. “If anything, I moan about the pain because the pain is just ridiculous. It’s like eight and nine out of ten when they ask me to score it. “When they look at me, people are like ‘Oh you look amazing! How can you be ill ’ “I look okay but inside I am slowly dying. “It is what it is. I try to see people and enjoy special quality time with them but the nurses come three times a day so I’m not really able to get out much.    “Besides,I’m in pain or feeling really sick, I don’t want to do anything anyway. Most of the time I feel really drowsy, tired, fatigued. I sleep a lot.” When Sunaina is alone she thinks about the possibility of a transplant. She thinks about it a lot. “It’s a horrible situation because I know that someone has to pass away to be able to give me le,” she says. “It’s something I struggle with sometimes. “It’s just not nice someone having to pass away in order to save me. “I think until it happens to maybe a family member or a friend, you don’t realise how important it is to save someone’s le. “In general, we don’t donate as much as we should. I don’t really understand why. With one body, one person, you can save so many lives.”  Sunaina has had to grow up biliary artesia – and has fared better than some, her mum says. “She was my first child,” says Siannne Paul, . “I had no idea, no concept of what babies were meant to look like. “She was jaundiced. The nurses basically said ‘It’s normal, give it two or three days and the jaundice will settle. “On an Asian person jaundice is completely dferent. She had a greeny colour to her, and the whites to her eyes were slightly pale. “After five days it didn’t settle. A month went by, and the family GP saw she had a distended stomach and an odd greenish colour, but he just said it was just colic. “By the time she was six weeks old, my health visitor said we should see somebody  about it.” "},{"url":null,"title":"more 2000 preserved fetuses found","story":"NewsMore than , preserved foetuses found in house of dead abortion doctorRelatives of Dr Ulrich Klopfer made the alarming discovery when searching through his Illinois homeShareCommentsByKaren RockettMilo Boyd:,  SEP Updated:,  SEP NewsThe doctor had previously been in court for not reporting abortions properly \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribe We will use your email address only for the purpose of sending you newsletters.

The doctor ordered an Xray and seemed pretty shocked when she walked back in with a second doctor and showed me that sure enough, my ring was right there in my stomach!They called a gastroenterologist and decided it would be best NOT to let nature take its course.Before I left, she recommended seeing a sleep specialist as well.Bobby took me to the GI doctor where I got to tell a whole new group of doctors and nurses that yes, I swallowed my engagement ring. At this point, I could definitely feel it in my guts, it was starting to really hurt and make us nervous. They decided an upper endoscopy was just the thing and said donapost worry its not big deal, but please sign this release form just in case you die. Then I cried a lot because I would be SO MADI died. I waited a long time for that damn engagement ring and I WILL marry Bobby Howell DAMNIT.So they push the sleepy drugs, and right as I started to feel that wave of warm and fuzzy sleep I said to the doctors, Bobby would LOVE this. Everything went great, they found my ring just beyond my stomach in my intestines, retrieved it and gave it to Bobby, not me.Apparently I donapost do great with anesthesia because I came out of it hysterically crying and was totally inconsolable.They got me out of there as quickly as possible and gave us a list of what I could eatSo I demanded that Bobby take me to In n Out and Chickfila. He loves me, so he drove me through In n Out and got me a double-double, mustard fried with cheese fries and a chocolate shake but put his foot down and said no to Chickfila.I probably cried as I stuffed cheese fries in my mouth. I asked for my ring, he said no. Thank God I had that chocolate shake.Bobby finally gave my ring back this morning - I promised not to swallow it again, weaposre still getting married and all is right in the world.  "},{"url":null,"title":"declassified cia documents show secret","story":"NewsDeclassied CIA documents show secret use of photographer spy-pigeons in Cold WarDeclassied CIA files reveal pigeons, ravens and dolphins were secretly trained to help discover Russias secretsShareCommentsByKaren Rockett:,  SEP NewsFiles just released reveal pigeons had cameras affixed to their bodies as part of Cold War spying efforts \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribe We will use your email address only for the purpose of sending you newsletters.

The files from the s and s reveal how pigeons were trained for clandestine missions photographing sensitive sites inside the Soviet Union. The release also reveals how ravens were used to drop bugging devices on window sills and dolphins were trained for underwater missions. The CIA believed animals could fulfil “unique” tasks for the agency’s clandestine operations behind the Iron Curtain at the height of tensions between Russia and the US.    The secret files are stored at the CIA’s headquarters in Langley, Virginia, is a museum, which is not open the general public. The s’ operation, codenamed Tacana, explored the use of pigeons with tiny cameras strapped to their bodies to automatically take photos, the newly released files show. It took advantage of the fact that the humble pigeon can be dropped somewhere they have never been before andhave the amazing ability to find their way hundreds of miles back home. The use of pigeons for communications dates back thousands of years but it was in World War One that they began to be used for intelligence gathering. In World War Two a little known branch of British intelligence - MI - ran a Secret Pigeon Service which dropped birds in a container with a parachute over Occupied Europe. A questionnaire was attached and more than , pigeons ed with messages including details of V rocket launch sites and German radar stations.    One message from a resistance group produced a -page intelligence report sent directly to Churchill. After the war, a special “Pigeon Sub-Committee” of Britain’s Joint Intelligence Committee looked at options for the Cold War but didn’t pursue the use of pigeons. However the CIA continued exploiting pigeon power and also trained a raven to deliver and retrieve small objects of up to g from window sills of inaccessible buildings. A flashing red laser beam was used to mark the target and a special lamp would draw the bird back. The CIA secretly delivered a listening device by bird to a window sill although no audio was picked up from the intended target, the BBC reports. The CIA also looked at whether migratory birds could be used to place sensors to detect whether the Soviet Union had tested chemical weapons.

Bob Thissen, , has spent years travelling the world as an urban explorer. The Dutchman has explored hundreds of abandoned places all over the world but says this is the biggest and most high-end love motel he has ever seen.  This place had the craziest rooms Iaposve ever seen, including moving UFO beds, a rotating merry-go-round bed, a bondage room and many more, Mr Thissen said. In Japan you often get multiple generations living in the same house, so people used to come here to have some privacy and fun and get a break from their busy le. You can only find love motels like this one in Latin America and Asia.    But the urban explorer has not revealed the precise location of the old hotel in fear of vandalism. He added: The Showa era terminated in  with the death of the Emperor Showa, and after that it became increasingly dficult to open love motels as big as this one. Many motels that were thriving during the Showa era also shut down.  What was also great about these motels is that they granted you full privacy. Among the other high-tech amenities in the hotel were a pneumatic tube system for discreet payments and features in rooms with dferent themes. These rooms could be rented for a whole night or just for only a few hours.

Goalkeeper Jack Hamilton was the hero in the second half as he saved an Alan Trouten penalty.Manager James McPake made six changes after the defeat to Elgin last week, giving Rangers loanee Josh McPake a debut and dropping Kane Hemmings to the bench. Jamie Ness missed out through injury.Returning was Johnson and the former Motherwell man took no time at all to add his fth goal of the season as he smashed in the rebound from Declan McDaid#s header that came off the bar within two minutes.The Wasps, though, were back level on  minutes as their corner dropped in the six-yard box and Dick found the net via a deflection.The Dark Blues were looking shaky defending set-pieces but made their possession count up the other end on  minutes as the impressive McPake skinned his man on the left wing before cutting across for Jordan McGhee to tap home.Almost immediately after the restart Jamie MacDonald kept Alloa in the contest, making an excellent save to push Jordon Forster#s powerful header on to the bar.And five minutes later the part-time side should have been level after Shaun Byrne#s reckless attempt at a block brought down Kevin Cawley. Keeper Hamilton, though, made a top save ing to his left to deny Trouten from the spot.MacDonald denied McDaid on  minutes as he pushed the winger#s header out before Cammy Kerr was denied what looked an obvious penalty by referee Alan Newlands with  minutes to go.Robert Thomson then had the chance to grab a point for Alloa late on but fluffed his lines.Dundee: Hamilton, Kerr, McGhee, Forster, Marshall, Byrne, Robertson, McGowan , McDaid, McPake , Johnson .Subs not used: Sharp, Mackie, Moore, Anderson.Alloa: MacDonald, Taggart, Graham, Deas, Dick, Cawley , Flannigan, Hetherington, O#Hara, Trouten, Thomson.Subs not used: Henry, Robertson, Brown, Gilhooley, O#Donnell, Gillespie.Attendance: ,"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/09/5d7b60fe6a1559.24284622.jpg ","title":"dundee out to up the tempo against alloa to get back to winning ways","story":"Jordan Marshall says Dundee are aiming to up the tempo against Alloa tomorrow as they bid to get back to winning ways.The Dark Blues welcome the Wasps to Dens Park this weekend aiming to cut the gap to the top of the table and finally put the - derby thrashing at Dundee United behind them.Marshall admits that was a hard one to take but insists the work done on the training pitch since then can pay off as theyto league action.He told the Tele: “We’ve been working on moving the ball faster in training – we’ve been doing lots of drills on that, moving it quickly across the pitch.“A lot of teams will come here and just sit in this season so we do need to move the ball quick and catch them off guard.“To be honest, I don’t think we’ve done that enough this season – when we have we’ve scored goals.“Against Ayr that worked, Fin Robertson switched to me, I put it in and we scored.“We’ve been trying to do more of that in training. It’s harder for the defence when you move it quickly from side to side because there will be a gap in the defence some time.“As well as moving it quicker, you have to be patient to wait for that gap to appear.”Marshall was given a break by manager James McPake for the - Challenge Cup defeat to Elgin City last Sunday and is keen to get back on the pitch come tomorrow.“I wasn’t playing on Sunday, the gaffer said I could head home and see some family and get a rest, but when I came back the feeling was positive around the place, to be honest,” he added.“I don’t think we need to dwell too much on it. We’ve had a couple of bad results but it’s happened, it’s over and it’s about putting it right tomorrow.“If you look over the whole start to the season, it’s been a decent start.“The derby was obviously a night to forget but we have three more derbies this season and we’ll be looking to put that right later on in the season.”On being rested, he added: “I want to be playing every week but we have a good squad with two good players for every position. The gaffer needed to see Sean Mackie play as well so, fair enough, I respect his decision.“It’s always good to have a bit of competition.”Dundee picked up six clean sheets in their opening eight matches of the season and rediscovering that will be key to getting back to form, says Marshall.Their inability to deal with set-pieces at Tannadice, too, took the left-back by surprise two weeks ago and the former Queen of the South man revealed improving that has been a key part of training lately.He added: “We’d kept a few clean sheets already this season and then conceding six was unacceptable, particularly at this club.“We need to get back to being solid and doing the basics right like we were doing when we were picking up so many clean sheets. We’ve been working on our set-pieces.“Usually we’ve been pretty solid from them this season. We need to put that right because we can’t defend like that.”And Alloa in the past have used their threat at set-plays to pick up some vital results in the Championship.Marshall added: “I haven’t seen much of Alloa this year but last season they were always organised and they scored from a few set-pieces against me when I was at Queens.“They are also a good footballing side and I’ve heard they are playing out from the back this season so they’ll probably come here and try to play football as well.“They are a part-time team but they were brilliant last year. They always seem to grind results out and we need to be aware of that.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/09/5d7776e9b37d24.50421766-e1568121136325.jpg ","title":"dundee united manager admits he has a lot of admiration for ian mccall ahead of ayr clash","story":"Dundee United boss Robbie Neilson has revealed he’s a big admirer of the job Ian McCall has done at this weekend’s opponents Ayr United.And given the same timescale, he aims to do similar work at Tannadice – on a larger scale.Despite losing a string of players in the summer, including star man Lawrence Shankland and Liam Smith to United, McCall has steered the Honest Men to three wins in their opening four Championship outings.That’s put them second in the table, three points behind the Tangerines. That early-season success, however, has come as no surprise to Robbie.“I know Ian, I meet him now and again because he stays near me. I know what he’s been through, it’s the nature of being at most clubs in the Championship,” he said.“Most of the players are on one-year deals. We’ve managed to get a few of them on two and three-year deals and that gives you stability. Others don’t have the finances to make mistakesso only hand out one-year contracts.“Sometimes you make mistakes and it’s good they are only on a year but the ones who do really well, they move on and it’s part and parcel of things.“But Ian did well last year and he’s done a really good job again at the start of the season.“Ian’s really good at getting a team spirit. He gets them working for each other and they get good energy in their team. They’ll be a force this year.”On top of that, Robbie admires the way the man who had a troubled spell at Tannadice more than a decade ago has resurrected his managerial career.He added: “As all managers know, we go up and down. We have good periods, then we have dficult periods.“I’ve had that as well and it’s about resilience. Ian’s had that and he’s shown it. He’s gone to a club and shown what capabilities he’s got.“He’s built something at Ayr and it’s like anything, it’s about getting time.“If you get three or four years, you get the chance to build something and get stability.“The problem in the game now is that you are getting two or three months.

It will fit in well with all of the regeneration that has taken place at the waterfront.#But Ashley Squire, from Coldside, insisted there were other issues that also had to be ironed out, saying: “It’s a nice design but there are issues with parking at the Waterfront.“Perhaps they could revise the design to include more parking spaces for families wishing to use the playground.”Council officers say they have only “very high” aspirations for the design and features of the play park, which is expected to have large numbers of visitors due to its proximity to the VA.In a design brief published as part of the bidding process, they express the hope that the facility will be “unique and very memorable”, with interactive elements such as keypads, buttons and features triggered by sensors.#Planners also want to see it illuminated at night, like the VA and the adjacent Discovery. “The intention for the play area is that it should be innovative in design, and ambitious in its unique identity,” they said.“There are fundamental starting points for the designers involved: that it is to be themed on whales, and that a digital element should be included.“The play area needs to be suitable for all ages and needs.”The council is leaning heavily on Dundee’s historical whaling trade as inspiration for the play area. As well as specying that the play area should be the shape of a whale it also wants kids to be able to create whale song.Officers have even alluded to the bowhead whale – the preferred whale of the one-time Dundee whaler – as the ideal inspiration for any design.Following the construction and opening of the park, the council aims to form a Whale Park Engagement Group with experts from Dundee Science Centre and the University of St Andrews to promote sustainable marine practices.The launch of the design competition comes after Andy Scott, creator of the Kelpies sculptures in Falkirk, scrapped a plan for a whale sculpture in Waterfront Place.Much like the play area, Mr Scott’s steel design would have been le-sized, inspired by the bowhead whale, and built as a tribute to the whaling trade.However, the Scottish sculptor had to let his design – which he drew up at no cost to the council – “swim off into the sunset” after agents acting for the local authority ignored his pitch."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/03/DNic_Taw_Teams_Podcast-2-e1553252194766-940x564.jpg ","title":"shankland starring but appere not far behind says dundee uniteds mcmullan","story":"Ten goals in just nine appearances so far for Dundee United means the hype surrounding striker Lawrence Shankland is both understandable and fair.And it’s meant him picking up the Player-of-the-Month award for August has to go down as one of the easiest decisions the judging  has ever had to make.So far as winger Paul McMullan is concerned every plaudit that’s come his new team-mate’s way has been thoroughly well deserved.Butthere is an injustice surrounding the Tangerines’ blistering start to the league season, McMullan feels it might just be the lack of recognition for Shankland’s fellow-striker Louis Appere.Because he feels since breaking into the first team at the start of the campaign, the -year-old has also had a massive impact.“Louis has been brilliant. He came in for pre-season looking sharp and really fit and he’s carried that right through into the league campaign,” said McMullan.“He’s been really good but that’s probably gone under the radar a wee bit with Shanks scoring however many goals he has, but Louis has been great.“I’m sure Shanks will say the same thing because Louis has been really good for him and they seem to work together very well.“It’s made things a bit more dficult for defences because there is two of them up there to worry about and that’s good for us.“The two of them complement each other very well and that’s what you want from your strikers. It’s good for the team.”As they look to continue what’s been a perfect start in the Championship with, four wins from four outings so far, tomorrow sees United head for Ayr United and potentially one of their toughest tests to date.McMullan is well aware last season Somerset Park was not a happy hunting ground.It saw United suffer two defeats that were signicant blows to their automatic promotion challenge.While he is determined to take three points this time, he expects to have to work hard for them.“They were dficult to play against last year and it will be the same again,” McMullan added.“They are direct and make the game really physical. You don’t really get a minute on the ball.“So you have to be ready to go against them andyou are not at it % then you will get beat.”Of course, one big plus this time round is that man Shankland being in tangerine instead of black and white.McMullan’s viewing that as a double bonus.“I think he scored six goals against us so it will be great that he is not up against us this time.“Having him in your team is brilliant. You just need to get it into the vicinity of the -yard box and the ball usually hits him and then goes in!”For the Terrors, the main priority is another win to keep the early season momentum going.While he admits his preference would have been for the league games to be coming thick and fast right now, he’s not too concerned about last week’s break for the Challenge Cup possibly interrupting the team’s flow.“The cup has kind of broken it up a bit for us. It was a bit inconvenient, to be honest, and it’s not the greatest cup as it is.“It kind of broke up our momentum but we are determined to pick up where we left off after the derby against Dundee.”“The positive side of the couple of breaks we’ve had since the league started is that they can give time for boys who’ve picked up knocks to recover properly and we’ll all be feeling fresh for this game.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/09/KMil_Bee-005-846x564.jpg ","title":"the first thing i did in the morning was make myself a double vodka and water dundee man turns his life around with the help of community group","story":"“The first thing I did in the morning was make myself a double vodka and water,” said Ian Thomas, speaking of his -year alcohol addiction.“I’d have a few of those for my breakfast.“I would wake up and vomit, have diarrhoea.“I was delirious, tremors, no appetite.

with St Johnstone.The Perth Saints are languishing second bottom of the Premiership and have yet to win a league game this season.They arrived at Pittodrie having won just once in eight games this season, against League Two strugglers Brechin City in the League Cup.However they frustrated the flat and uninspiring  Dons in a match where the Perth side had a penalty award over-ruled after referee Steven McLean had initially awarded a spot kick.Former Aberdeen striker Stevie May made a quick-fireto Pittodrie having recently signed a two year contract with St Johnstone following his Dons exit.A £, signing from Preston North End in summer  the Dons cancelled the final two years of May#s contract two weeks ago to make way for the -year-old#s permanent move to Saints.May netted just eight goals in  appearances for the Dons over two seasons.He did not end a goal drought dating back to a penalty kick scored in Aberdeen#s - loss to Celtic on December  last year.Boss Derek McInnes retained faith with the same starting line-up that defeated Ross County - at Pittodrie before the international break.Shay Logan ed to the squad having missed the match against the Staggies with a groin problem but had to be content with a spot on the substitutes# bench.The goal scoring heroics of Connor McLennan on international duty was not enough to elevate the winger into the starting .McLennan came off the bench for the Scotland U#s and netted two late goals to secure a - European championships qualier away win.In a low key opening Saints created the first opportunity in the th minute when Matty Kennedy picked out Murray Davidson  yards out but his shot trundled wide.The woodwork denied Aberdeen in the th minute when superb skill from Greg Leigh saw the left#back control the ball then step wide of his marker before firing in a dangerous ball into the box.Leading scorer Sam Cosgrove met the cross and his header cracked off the base of the far post.Aberdeen went ahead in the th minute when the impressive Leigh burst towards the left side of the box. He was tenacious and drove forward only to be tackled.The ball broke to HEDGES who clinically shot beyond Zander Clark from  yards.St Johnstone equalized in the nd minute courtesy of a rare mistake from keeper Joe Lewis.A pass from Scott Tanser was cut back to Michael O#HALLORAN who shot low from  yards out. There was no power in the trundler but somehow the ing Lewis let the effort go under his hands.The goal came completely out of the blue.In the th minute Saints won a free-kick  yards out. May#s weak effort was straight at keeper Lewis who easily saved.Moments later St Johnstone again threatened when Davidson latched onto a Jason Holt corner only to send a ing  yard header just wide.Saints were looking the more likely to score and Lewis redeemed his earlier mistake in the th minute with a strong near post block to push behind a vicious Davidson  yard drive.St Johnstone were raging in the th minute when referee Steven McLean pointed to the penalty spot # only to change his mind following a conversation with his official.The penalty was initially given when Kennedy went down and appeared to have his heel clipped by Andy Considine.McLean gave the penalty, which appeared soft. However, so rare in Scottish football, the refereeing not only took time to think he also used common sense.Following consultation with assistant Graeme Stewart on the touch-line McLean over-ruled his initial decision.Aberdeen were denied by a superb save from Clark in injury time when Ferguson#s powerful  yard free kick took a defection off the defensive wall but the keeper did brilliantly to adjust and save to secure a deserved point for St Johnstone.ABERDEEN: Lewis, Vyner, Devlin, Considine, Leigh, Ojo, Ferguson, Bryson, McGinn, Hedges, Cosgrove.Subs: Gallagher , McLennan , Wilson Subs not used: Cerny, Logan,  Anderson, Main.ST JOHNSTONE:  Clark, Ralston, Kerr, Gordon, Tanser, O’Halloran, McCann, Davidson, Holt, Kennedy, May.Subs: Wright , Hendry , Kennedy Subs not used:  Parish, Vihmann,  Duffy, Swanson.Referee: Steven McLean"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/09/2.5469369-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/09/2.5469369-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/09/2.5469369-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/09/2.5469369-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"a90 to see works","story":"A section of the A is to benefit from £, of carriageway resurfacing works.The investment from Transport Scotland will see resurfacing improvements and lining upgrades on a southbound section of the road before the Pitskelly Junction, near Stonehaven.The overnight project is scheduled to start on Wednesday and is expected to take four nights to complete.Improvements will take place between .pm and .am each night with works due to be completed by .am on Wednesday September ."},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/09/5d728b69170679.16363937-400x564.jpg ","title":"adopt a pet mouse cuddles and marigold all need a new home can you help","story":"Are you looking to get a new pet  Why not adopt one of these adorable animals from Mrs Murray’s Cat and Dog Home  vw, px\"  This sweet girl is four years old, she is full of character and loves everyone she meets.She has been around dogs previously and has mixed well with other dogs while she has been in the kennels.She is used to children from four years and over, but would not be suitable to be homed around cats.She will need a new home with access to a secure garden so that she can play with her toys and enjoy some sunshine. vw, px\"  This lovely girl is four years old.

We were working alongside the owner to help out as much as we could, as she wanted the puppies to go to the best homes possible. They are all lovely, cheeky puppies, but have already developed strong inidual personalities.“We would say they do match their names but what they have in common is that they are all very strong-willed, like any good superhero.“They are at the critical age for socialising so potential homes must have the time to take them to puppy classes and introduce them to the big world. They are very well-behaved puppies and are enjoying meeting all ages of humans, children included.”Six of the puppies have already been reserved, with two reservations pending.This Avengers team will soon get their rest in their forever homes, after they have bonded with their owners and homechecks have been completed.Go to scottishspca.org to find about more animals ready for adoption."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column august 9 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsThe Egg Shed opening is big news for Mid Argyll.The development, as part of the wider Ardrishaig harbour improvements, can only be a good thing for the village.

We do at the moment have a dentist and fully qualied staff and are happy with their work.Rumour has it that the aforementioned dentist and staff will be taking on patients from Mid Argyll Hospital, which I presume they tend to already.But the practice is to lose its local NHS patients, so they will deal solely with patients who require dental treatment from the hospital. I think this situation leaves the NHS patients in limbo.I am sure we would rather that the current dentist and all of her staff be given a chance to voice their opinions on this matter as much and as well as the local populace.Yes, it will be brilliant to have both dentists in the town. There is the possibility that those on the local list who are currently treated well by the dental department at the hospital maybe still seen by the dentist and her staff, but I would like this to be confirmed by the local NHS trust.Brian MacDonald, CrinanSir,Hundreds of people across Scotland have been helped through their exam results by a local group of Skills Development Scotlandcareers advisers.Based across the north of Scotland, the advisers were part of a team taking calls at the SDS Exam Results Helpline from am on results day.The helpline is a vital service, supporting young people and their families at what can be one of the most stressful times of their lives.Expert advice and guidance is available all year round, not just on results day.Our professionally qualied careers advisers are working in every state secondary school in Scotland and from our network of high street centres across the country.In schools, careers services are delivered one-to-one, in classrooms and at school events across all year groups, supporting young people to develop the skills to make informed career decisions throughout their lives. There is also support for parents and carers.At SDS centres customers can get information, advice and guidance about jobs, the local labour market, training courses and apprenticeships as well as how to prepare for interviews and help with CVs and applications.The work of SDS careers advisers in schools and centres is supported by Scotland’s careers website myworldofwork, where you can access advice  hours a day. It is packed with career information, advice and tools such as the CV builder. There is also a dedicated exam results section.Details of the local SDS centres are available at myworldofwork centres and information about events and opportunities is also available on Facebook.Pauline Graham, Project Manager for the SDS Exam Results HelplineSir,I had a great time at this year#s Islay Show. It was fantastic to speak to so many of my constituents.It was also wonderful to see many local business stalls promoting Islay#s dynamic and booming economy.The show was well attended with lots of families, both local and visitors, having a fun day out and luckily the sun was shining most of the day.A huge thanks to all the organisers and everyone  who contributed to the event.Councillor Alastair RedmanSir,I have real concerns about the deteriorating condition of some Argyll cemeteries.Constituents from Islay recently joined Councillor Alastair Redman in highlighting the poor upkeep of cemeteries in the area he represents.Councillor Redman reported that there were also problems at other cemeteries in his ward, including the cemetery at Carradale in East Kintyre.I understand that Argyll and Bute Council confirmed that they now, at last, have plans in place to address the problems at Kilnaughton.It remains disappointing, however, that things are allowed to deteriorate to the extent that the maintenance of cemeteries has become a matter of public concern.Frankly, it is very surprising that a cemetery where interments are actually still taking place has been undermined in this way and there must surely be an obligation to ensure this doesn’t happen.My experience is that communities in the Highlands and Islands pay special regard to the final resting places of fellow members of their communities and will be perplexed to discover that they appear to be uncared-for.Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands MSP"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures august 16 2019","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowTayvallich reader Colin MacInnes captured this photo of these two fluffy cygnets at the Corran Burn in Lochgilphead back in July.A couple of adult swans were spotted floating nearby at the time on Loch Fyne and Loch Gilp around Ardrishaig."},{"url":null,"title":"an album with atmosphere and depth","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowExtract of an album review by Marc HigginsThis striking album is a collaboration between singer songwriter Sheila K Cameron and John Saich and Mags Russell of Argyll#s Wild Biscuit productions.In  they collaborated on an album called More Like a River than a Road. These songs were associated with the Tlell River on Hai Gwaii in Canada. These tracks, with a selection of later collaborations, make up River to Sea from Tlell to Tiree. The title documents Sheila#s journey from the coast of Canada to Tiree, where the track All You Really Need is the Sea was written.This artist is probably best described as a folk blues singer. She has the sharply observing, descriptive eye of the classic singer songwriter troubadour and while her voice is given gravitas and character by time, she swings and has the timing of the blues singer.Wild Biscuit#s musical accompaniment gives Sheila#s characterful voice depth and presence. The menacing guitar on I#ve Waited a Long Time and the atmospheric double bass and keyboards on Where the Pebbles Grind and Scrape complement Cameron#s lyrics and singing.Remembering Mr Toast is an atmospheric and evocative, less bombastic or overblown Scottish Jim Morrison, finding real beauty in a melancholic memory. The delicate hesitant guitar and reflective lyrics continue on Don#t Sigh and Go on Then, beautul, bitter sweet country love songs. All You Really Need is the Sea and Deep and Real are spiritual songs, again moving between an intimate relationship to consider the huge landscape and the restorative natural world.Is it blues, country, easy listening, folk or poetry set to delicate sympathetic music  It doesn#t matter. Close your eyes, listen to Sheila#s rich voice, with its cadence and rhythm. Enjoy the flow of words and the pictures they conjure on this warm and captivating set of recordings."},{"url":null,"title":"mid argyll course draws skippers and compliments","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowMid Argyll Radio Sailing put its toe in the water last Saturday when skippers arrived with their model radio controlled yachts from the club#s first competition.Several Scottish clubs # Ayr Bay Radio Yacht Club, Greenock, Rhu and Paisley # travelled to Mid Argyll joined by others from as far afield as the Preston area.A total of  yachts raced each other around the club#s Loch a Bahrain course near Cairnbaan.A steady wind from the south produced some exciting close encounters results and near misses.

Now I am not saying this is the simplest or even healthiest of activities. All this crouching, hand staining, pricked fingers and even eye strain.Often when you reach for a large black juicy berry it seems to disappear. It’s like the behaviour of politicians. They offer so much but when you reach for it # it disappears. Do you remember the Scottish government passed a law guaranteeing one would be seen by an appropriate health specialist within a stated limited time  The SNP government daily breaks this law – be it on cancer, accident and emergencies, or mental health.Or what about the promises made to the people of Arran and the Outer Hebrides on improved ferry services. The Scottish government is responsible for Caledonian Maritime Assets, CMal, which own and manage ferries. MV Glen Sannox was intended to commence service to Arran in  but lies incomplete for all to see in the Ferguson Marine yard in Port Glasgow. Part of the delay is because of disagreement over the fixed-price design and build contract for the two vessels.The SNP seems obsessed with this type of contract which has adversely affected schools, colleges and community centres. Worse still, while the SNP ridiculed previous government public private partnerships they have introduced a system clearly no better. What about the £. million each month we the taxpayers have to pay for the unopened Edinburgh sick children’s hospital  Jeanne Freeman, the SNP Cabinet Secretary for Health and Social Care, stepped in so late that she does not know whether this much-needed hospital will ever open.The second part of the bramble experience is the delicious mouthwatering bramble crumble. A crumble which gives joy and stimulation. Not like the crumbling state of the SNP government which has a sour taste and clearly disappoints.Finlay Craig, CoveSir,Your readers may be interested to know that there are currently  people in need of a kidney transplant in Scotland whose diet will be restricted due to kidney disease.It is likely that they will be on fluid restrictions of around just ml of liquid a day # including liquid found in foods like sauces and ice cream. That is roughly the equivalent of only being able to have a small cup of tea and one can of soft drink per day. In addition, they may have to limit the potassium and phosphate in their diet which means missing out on enjoying foods like chocolate, bananas and tomatoes.We want to make the kidney diet about all the things patients can eat and bring enjoyment back into food # which is why we have launched the Kidney Kitchen.We hope that the Kidney Kitchen will mean everyone living with kidney disease in Scotland can enjoy healthy and delicious food with their family and friends.If you are, oryou know a kidney patient, check out www.kidneykitchen.orgEwen Maclean, advocacy officer Scotland, Kidney Care UKSir,The death of a pet cat can come as a shock, and many owners can find it dficult to come to terms with their loss.The death of a pet is not always seen as a signicant loss, leading some people to hide their feelings which can cause them to feel very alone.On Grief Awareness Day, August , Cats Protection is highlighting its free and confidential Paws to Listen support service, so people facing the loss of a cat do not have to feel alone.The service is available on   .

Last year, it rehomed over , domestic pets and successfully released , wild animals back to their natural environment. The society now also delivers industry-leading animal welfare educational programmes to people of all ages.In my short time with the society I know of hundreds of examples of our dedicated people going above and beyond to do all they can for the animals and humans they come across. So, I can only imagine how many fantastic stories must be out there about the people who’ve worn our unorm since we were formed.As well as those who have had a positive experience with us in the recent past, we are hoping to uncover some long lost tales from descendants of those we’ve touched in decades gone by.The society wants anyone with any interesting anecdotes or memorabilia to get in touch via the website or by emailing .years@scottishspca.org.Kirsteen Campbell, chief executive, Scottish SPCASir,The likelihood of the UK exiting the EU has now shted from ‘possible’ to ‘probable’.That gives greater focus to our efforts to prepare and proof our farming industry from the impacts of no deal.Whilst it always has been  the position of NFU Scotland that the UK must secure a favourable deal on the terms of exit with the EU, we must also support our industry through any change in the operating environment.Many NFU Scotland members might think that their businesses won’t be impacted, but the reality is that there will be implications for all of us. Some will be direct and immediate, and others more indirect and emerging through time – but the one certainty is that these will be felt by all of us involved in the agri-food chain.There are a few things that would make a big dferenceapplied right across the board in the UK.First, the UK Government’s proposed import tarf schedule desperately requires revision. It would expose some produce # specically cereals, oilseeds, potatoes, eggs and horticultural produce # to a tarf going into the EU, but would allow that same product to come into the UK with no tarf.This is farcical.To apply asymmetrical tarfs on any products between us and the EU is to completely misunderstand the nature of food security in the UK and fails to recognise that trade is vital to both the UK and the EU.One thing that can be done, regardless of Brexit, is for our own governments to prioritise using our own products when it comes to public procurement.All our politicians like to talk about how good our agricultural industry is in comparison to others across the world in terms of standards and environmental benefits, but we don’t see near enough in the way of Scottish or British products being prioritised for use in schools, hospitals and other public services.Yes, it may add one or two pence to a meal – but I would challenge governments and public procurement buyers what the real cost is of bringing products in from other parts of the world.These products certainly don’t meet our standards – not to mention the impact on climate change with food miles taken into consideration.It’s only a couple of years since the kids in our schools were getting their chicken from Thailand. Things are improving, but it’s still not Scottish chicken.This is within the gt of both Holyrood and Westminster, but it might just be the catalyst for governments to work with local authorities to do the right thing when it comes to feeding those who use our public services.Martin Kennedy, vice president, NFU ScotlandSir,I read with interest the letter from Doctor Strain in the August  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser.Might I suggest that to produce a meaningful logo for the GP practices the following criteria are applied:The logo will need to show:May I suggest there are better ways to provide a service to treat patients, without resorting to gimmicks.Name and address supplied.Sir,I was intrigued to read Finlay Craig’s ramblings in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser.Would he be willing to share the location of his magical bramble bush for it appears the fruits of this bountul bush, when mixed into a pie, contain mystical properties that can transport the diner to another world May I suggest he tries a cold slice of reality pie now and again which would snap him out of his biased reverie and bring him back to the reality of the UK parliament being suspended and the Scottish representative of the party responsible for that outrageous manoeuvre vacating her post in protest In contrast, the Scottish government is working, along with others, to stop Scotland being dragged out of Europe against its wishes. Or perhaps the suspension of democracy is okay in his dream world If Mr Craig or any of his friends eat too much of his prodigious pie, I am sure they will not hesitate to avail themselves of a free prescription for their malaise and, should they need it, free bus travel to the chemist to pick it up, all supplied by the Scottish Government. If they live on one of our beautul islands, they can soon jump on one of the new ferries being completed as I write, again thanks to the Scottish Government.All this aside, when he rejoins us on planet earth, Mr Craig might think of entering his mysterious pie in the baking section of next year#s Mid Argyll Show, though I think by that time we may all be in need of something a little stronger from Scotland’s political larder to extract us from the bitter reality of Brexit Britain.Charles Ambrose, Lochgilphead.Sir,The National Autistic Society wants to find exceptional people, schools and services making a huge dference to autistic children and adults and their families.

There is a short delay in production of first gold from our previous expectations, but a stockpile of ore will be accumulated during this period which will provide an opportunity to exceed targets later in the year.#The combination of the gold price being in excess of £, per ounce, and the pipeline of projects that we anticipate will result from our Grampian exploration work, bode well for the company#s long-term outlook.#The people of Cairndow, though, have known for years of metal deposits in Glen Fyne.One local man said: #I have been around these hills for  years and I remember mines in Glen Fyne, at Inverchorchan and further up the glen.#The Cononish mine and the area they are talking about in Glen Fyne is not far apart at all, just over the hill in fact.#It is believed that gold and lead were the targets of miners in decades long past."},{"url":null,"title":"scotlands women stand in lochgilphead","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowColin CameronA movement to empower women of Scotland to stand for political office chose Lochgilphead as a location for a national event.Held on Saturday September , Scotland#s Women Stand was the culmination of a nine-month-long campaign at the Scottish Parliament.The final event had its base at the parliament, with a small number of regional hubs around Scotland # including one at Argyll and Bute Council headquarters at Kilmory.Scotland’s Women Stand, through a combination of information and inspiring events, aimed to bring together women and equip them with the knowledge they need to take their next steps in politics.Live streamed from the Scottish Parliament were guest speakers Talat Yaqoob from Women :, Minister Christina McKelvie, Deputy Presiding Officer Linda Fabiani MSP, Patrycja Kupiec from YWCA and Lee Chalmers, Founder of The Parliament Project.After a  discussion, attendees across the country heard from, and asked questions of, Member of the Scottish Youth Parliament Caitie Dundas, community councillor Kay Marie Hughes, Councillor Alison Evison and Alison Johnstone MSP.Hub events followed in the afternoon, with a discussion in Lochgilphead on how to get more involved in politics.

Ryan McConnachie opted to go straight down the middle and evaded the e of the Dunoon keeper.There was a moment of worry at the other end, though, when goalscorer Souden also committed a handball in the Pupils’ box, and referee Peter Laing pointed to the spot. Dunoon halved the Pupils’ advantage, making it -.Then, just  seconds later, the Pupils restored their two-goal lead through Donald McCallum, who met left-sided substitute Kenny Kerr’s low cross to squeeze a shot between the Dunoon defenders and the frame of the goal.Soon after, the Pupils made it -, when Kerr guided another delightful cross onto the head of John McCallum, who guided an effort past the keeper from six yards, but it was the goal creator Kerr who was rightly mobbed by his team-mates.Not content with four, the Feathers-sponsored Pupils scored again, with # stand by # Kerr making it three assists in one match.Played in by McConnachie after some strong play in midfield by fellow substitute Michael McKinlay, Kerr set up young winger Ross Brown, who gladly tucked home goal number five with a close-range finish.With the match drawing to a close, McConnachie sealed his brace # and the Pupils’ sixth goal # with an excellent inidual effort, surging past a defender before rounding the hosts’ keeper and slotting the ball low into an unguarded net, adding gloss to an already emphatic cup win.After a great team performance, the Pupils will be hoping for more of the same tomorrowwhen they welcome a Tarbert side # who last week also defeated Dunoon # in a Kintyre derby.The match is scheduled for a pm kick off at Kintyre Park."},{"url":null,"title":"third round of tarberts golf championship","story":"Former champion Bruce MacNab held a four-shot lead going into the third round but a horror start saw the lead wiped out at the very first hole when Iain Macalister birdied and Bruce had a seven.Iain went on to birdie the second hole as well and despite the windy conditions was very much in control of his game over the first nine holes to be out in .John MacNab was also playing his normal steady game also ing , enjoying birdies at the st and th holes.After nine holes Iain had turned a four-shot deficit into a four-shot lead over Bruce and six ahead of John.Over the next four holes both Iain and John dropped four shots allowing Bruce some breathing space to claw back some of the deficit.When play was complete and all scores checked the totals after round three were as follows: Iain Macalister , Bruce MacNab , John MacNab .In the John Reid Quaich the silverware again headed south to Largieside with Duncan Johnstone retaining the trophy, shooting  nett over the two rounds.

We are lucky enough to live and work in such a wonderful part of Scotland and all of our staff have a commitment to protecting our beautul environment.‘Building on the success of our first three vehicles, we now operate a fleet of six Nissan Leafs, four Renault Zoes and a hybrid Mitsubishi.#We have recently been successful in securing funding to install charge points Campbeltown, Oban, Dunoon and Helensburgh. These chargers will be available to the general public as well as which will ease the burden on the council chargers in those areas where, other than in Oban, there is currently only one charging point per town.#Given that the main nervousness with regard to the use of electric vehicles is the lack of infrastructure, we see the installation of these chargers as being quite a big part of improving that infrastructure in Argyll.#With the current electrical vehicle fleet, it is estimated that the college’s annual petrol and diesel mileage is now just , miles, down from ,, giving an annual carbon emissions reduction of a staggering  tonnes. This adds up to a saving of around £, for the college and the public purse in   alone.The college is currently operating a vehicle-sharing agreement with Police Scotland in Lochgilphead, and has plans to extend this to the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service in Argyll and possibly to relevant charities in the area."},{"url":null,"title":"where have all the male singers gone","story":"Plenty of ladies turned up, full of enthusiasm.

Last weekend, we were fortunate to be invited to an orchard in East Lothian to pick some apples.As we entered Lewis stopped for a moment and said ldquoWow.He has seen apples growing on trees before, but I think it was the sight of so many apple trees together all in fruit. It was a visual feast, even for me.And so we picked some apples, in the company of a friend who uses local fruits to make juices. Lewis just couldnrsquot decide which apple tree to pick from first. He wandered about in awe, eyeing the apples.There were many ieties in the orchard, but I sadly canrsquot remember all their names.ldquoI think Lewis is in paradise, I remarked as I watched him.ldquoWhatrsquos paradise  asked my nearly six-year-old inquisitive daughter Skye. I had to think about my answer.ldquoSome people say itrsquos a perfect place, but other people say itrsquos a perfect feeling.ldquoCan be both then, maybe at the same time Skye replied.I smiled and agreed. We both watched Lewis, as he wondered under the small trees, dancing with delight at the sight of so many delicious looking ripe apples.ldquoYea said Skye, ldquoLewis is definitely having paradykes.ldquoWe say in paradise I said, in a bit of a teachery tone.ldquoBut you can have it too insisted Skye ldquobecause itrsquos a happy feeling.How could I disagree  ldquoYoursquore right I smiled.ldquoThis one Lewis called out. The apple was just out of reach and so his sister ran up and carefully picked it for him, in the way she had been shown. Lewis studied the apple before eating, savouring the moment.He was indeed both in, and having, paradise.We collected a small basket full of apples of dferent ieties, and after giving our thanks we started our walk back to the car. As we meandered along the path Skye asked for a story about an apple.So I told the story of Johnny Appleseed. Then a riddle ldquoA wee roond hoose, sometimes red, sometimes green, the maist bent lum ye hae ersquoer seen. Nae windaes or doors tae open or slide, it has a secret, therersquos a star inside.The answer of course is an apple. The bent lumbeing the stalk, and the star being the seed core when the apple is cut horizontally through the middle.As we walked, I reflected on the symbolism of the apple, and how it has been used in folklore and legend. And of course there is the famous apple which fell on Newtonrsquos head.Well it probably didnrsquot really fall on his head, as that seems a later embellishment, but for sure Newton himself often told the tale of the falling apple and the inspiration it gave him. He lived well into old age, and I think he understood the power of a story to convey the meaning of an event or idea.We approached our car and I took my sonrsquos hand to keep him safe as we crossed the road.ldquoDad he said looking up at me, ldquoyou are my walking apple.I laughed at the image and wondered what he meant. Was he referring to my rotund body shape perhaps ldquoWhy am I your walking apple  I asked him.ldquoCause I love apples and you are walking with me he said, with a sense of poetic meaning only a young child can convey.I was momentarily overwhelmed by this simple but moving comment. Lewis, aged only four, conveyed a powerful symbolism for apples that morning.The apple falling from the tree in front of Isaac Newton was a symbol of scientic discovery. For my son, an apple is a symbol of love. And my son loves the apples he eats, and the ones which walk with him.

This occurs when cats come in contact with chemicals such as fuels, lubricants and some solvents.Usually, self-grooming causes the cat to ingest the toxin, or in some cases they inhale it which can cause a severe pneumonia.The toxin can cause problems throughout the body and on the skin too.When Jonny had examined Tikka, he immediately sent her to our Tranent surgery for blood tests and intravenous fluids as she was dehydrated.Fortunately, Tikkarsquos blood tests were normal so she did not have kidney damage.She tolerated her fluid therapy well and was soon looking much happier however several areas of her skin had become red and she was losing hair especially on her front legs.Tikka did not want to eat or drink. She was given analgesics, antibiotics and soothing cream was applied to her skin.Our nursing staff ensured she was as comfortable as possible and as she was not eating by herself, they fed her via a feeding tube several times a day.Her skin became red and thickened and some areas sloughed off.She had to have cream applied frequently to the damaged skin, just asshe had suffered burns.Tikka was finally well enough to go home where Mrs Taylor continued to treat her skin. Tikka started eating well again and is improving daily. Her fur is regrowing and soon she will have her beautul coat again.Now Mrs Taylor was very vigilant and realised she had to do something to help Tikka immediately.If you suspect your cat may have had contact with petroleum-based substances, please contact your vet as soon as possible.Often the first sign you may have is your pet smells of petrol or diesel.There may be vomiting or diarrhoea. They may actually be dizzy or confused or showing other neurological problems such as staggering and trembling. There may be respiratory signs such as coughing or wheezingthey have inhaled the chemical.Do not try to make your pet vomit as this can exacerbate the toxicity.The first thing you should do is try to remove the chemical from the fur.In many cases, it is best to bring your pet straight to your vets as soon as possible. The nursing staff at veterinary practices are well trained in dealing with intoxication emergencies.With petroleum products there are three main areas where the body can be affected: l The internal organs especially the kidneys, so your vet will want to blood sample your pet to check for any damage to the kidneys or other organsl The respiratory system can be affected especiallythe toxin is inhaled. This often happensthe patient vomits then inhales some resulting in a very severe pneumonia. Your vet may wish to take x-rays to check for this.l The animalrsquos skin can also be affected. The petroleum products sit on the fur then soaks through to the skin where they are held in contact by the fur. This causes them to act as a caustic substance, damaging the skin and hair follicles. Often the first sign before the skin damage is seen is hair loss due to the follicle damage.The treatment for these causes is supportive at all times. There are no specic antidotes. Intravenous fluids are administered, this helps overcome dehydration and helps eliminate toxins from the body.Analgesics are given to help keep pain from damaged skin and internal organs to a minimum.Antibiotics are given, as damaged skin is very prone to secondary infection and they are always givenpneumonia is present. Skin treatment has to be intense to keep infection to a minimum and encourage damaged skin to recover.Thankfully Tikka has made an excellent recovery, thanks to Mrs Taylorrsquos quick thinking and the intense nursing care given by the nursing team at Dunedin Vets."},{"url":null,"title":"worst-polluting-vehicles-stopped-entering-town","story":"Plans to extend a city-wide Low Emission Zonefor Edinburgh to include East Lothianrsquos biggest town are being put forward by East Lothian Council.At a meeting of the local authorityrsquos cabinet on Tuesday, officers were given the go ahead to hold talks with City of Edinburgh Council about extending the zone.However, local ward councillors demanded reassurances that nothing would be agreed without a full public consultation.Cabinet agreed to support City of Edinburgh Councilrsquos proposed LEZ with a number of conditions including that ldquoEast Lothian Council will investigate a collaborative arrangement to include Musselburgh within the Low Emission Zone.Musselburgh councillor John Williamson said the move was in line with the councilrsquos recent declaration of a climate emergency but urged officials to ensure a public consultation was held and look at ways to make sure people on low incomes were not adversely affected.He said: ldquoI would hope that any potential of Musselburgh being included within the City of Edinburgh Low Emission Zone is thoroughly looked at with appropriate information provided to and consultation with the ious communities in Musselburgh to ensure that what our larger neighbour wants is not imposed unilaterally.ldquoThere must be extensive public consultation across Musselburgh.

The locals know the neighbourhood as J.P. As to its name, one theory, according to the local TV station WBZ-TV, is that it came about because local people benefited from the Triangle trade of sugar, rum and slaves.The Haven is owned by Jason Waddleton, . He attended school in Stonehaven, then went to Glasgow University. His kitchen career had begun in Stonehavens Tolbooth restaurant in Glasgow he worked in Blackfriars, in the Merchant City, and Jinty McGintys, on Ashton Lane. He moved to Boston in , was named Best Bartender in Boston , and started The Haven in , naming it after the Stonehaven fish and chip shop that created the Deep Fried Mars Bar.The idea behind the new operation was, he says, to bring authentic Scottish cuisine to the United States. \"We make our own haggis, black pudding and Lorne sausage, and we serve tattie scones, Scotch eggs, bridies, oatcakes instead of bread we serve haddock for fish and chips. We do cranachan ndash and, of course, deep-fried Mars bars.\"Funny thing, the haggis. Before opening The Haven, he was asked repeatedly, \"Youre not going to sell haggis, are you \" And suddenly he knew that, yes, he had to serve it. \"Because people have a strong opinion about it,\" he told the Eater Boston food magazine a couple of years ago. \"Theres this interplay over a dish, which is hilarious. I dont know many dishes that can create that level of interest or harmony or disharmony at the same moment.\"\"We serve exclusively Scottish beer,\" he tells us. \"Last year we were the biggest seller of Belhaven in the US. Harviestoun, Orkney Brewery, Thistly Cross Cider, Traquair House and Innis and Gunn all feature on the menu as well as Tennents.\" Whisky  \"Only single malt,\" he says firmly. \"No bourbon, rye or Irish whiskey. No rum or vodka. We do sell Scottish gins, though: Rock Rose, Edinburgh Gin, Caorunn, Hendricks.\"In common with many bars, The Haven stages regular events, including some with local purveyors. The Spurs-Newcastle English Premier game was screened recently. It partners with the Scotch Malt Whisky Society for monthly Scotch nights. Its annual Burns Night runs to five nights a week.

As it says on its website, it brings the \"true essence of pub culture\" to the Windy City. Its pedigree is illustrated by the fact that it holds a certicate, awarded by Whisky Magazine, as A Great Whisky Bar of the World.Theres an unmistakeable Scottish flavour to its extensive menu: Christine MacLeods smoked mackerel patetattie skins, a Robert the Bruce burger, the James Watt sandwich, Hebridean leek pie.The pub, on North Clark Street, is run by Colin Cameron, who was born and raised in Broughty Ferry. \"I was a police officer in Forfar, leaving in  after becoming disillusioned after seeing so many of my friends growing moustaches and buying Ford Fiestas ndash not that theres anything wrong with either, but I was looking for something dferent,\" Cameron says.\"I came to Chicago to visit a cousin who was living here and after a few months of vacation we were talking and decided Chicago needed a Scottish pub. He owned a building that had an old closed restaurant space that had been proving dficult to rent and we decided to give it a go. Our joint restaurant experience was I worked for a couple of months as a bartender in the railway workers social club in Dundee before I joined the police.\"He spent the next two months repurposing the space to resemble what he and his cousin thought a pub should be. It was all done on a shoestring budget, using the equipment from the closed restaurant, and antique furniture. Most of the antiques, it turns out, came from Loves Auctions in Perth.\"We finally opened the doors in July of  on a wing and a prayer. I stumbled along learning lessons every day and gradually turned the Duke of Perth into a thriving business. We concentrated on having the best Scottish beer and whisky we could get our hands on.\"Very few people had any knowledge of single malt at this time but we went out and procured every malt we could get our hands on starting with about a dozen which gradually grew to over . We also started selling McEwanrsquos export, which we were able to get in draught.\"At this time there were no micro-brews available and most beer sold in the States was American-style lagers. We found ourselves in a great situation with great products we were passionate about. Very quickly we became McEwanrsquos number one seller in the States ndash we might have been one of only a few places selling it, though.\"We also set out wanting to have good-quality, home-made comfort food. We decided to have a few traditional pub items like fish and chips and shepherdrsquos pie but also to have the American staples like first-class burgers that we gave names to, such as the Sean Connery burger ndash broiled, not shhhhtirrred.\"After a few months we decided to Americanise our fish and chips by making it All You Can Eat, which really started things moving for us. After a few years McEwanrsquos became unavailable in Chicago but Belhaven stepped in, filling the void.\"The Duke of Perth has just marked its th anniversary and is now one of the older establishments in the city.It has been a \"wonderful\" experience, reflects Cameron. \"Over the years Ive tried to do what feels right, putting the essence of the pub before short-term commercial gratication. The most obvious example of this is the absence of televisions: we lose considerable business when the sports teams are playing but our customers over the years love that you actually can have a conversation without your attention being constantly dragged away.\"Our customer base has been primarily neighbourhood with the occasional Scottish or UK visitor. The Scottish UK expats I know in the States all share a common trait in that they truly assimilate with the American culture. They donrsquot tend to flock together, trying to create a home from home.

The BBC had promised ldquonon-boringBrexitchat and the first televised version of the hit podcast tried its best to deliver. But did it The four presenters, Kuenssberg, Europe Editor Katya Adler, and correspondents Adam Fleming and Chris Mason, had been given shiny new headphones, branded ldquoBrexitcast microphone covers, and a table with the showrsquos name on it. Why they needed to wear headphones when they were all sitting in the one studio - rather than two being in London, one in Brussels and one in Strasbourg - was a mystery. But hey, this is a tv version of a podcast and it has to look the part, dahling.After five minutes of joshing everyone settled down to talking about the Court of Session ruling and the publication of the Governmentrsquos Yellowhammer report into Brexit preparedness.For a while, it was just like the podcast, burbling along easily, the kind of programme that sends one off to sleep happily. In radio, thatrsquos a good thing. On television, however, there was too much action going on at the same time as there was not enough. We were watching four people sitting in a row. Very dull. But they were gesticulating wildly, girning, and Kuenssbergrsquos phone was pinging and whirring like a Gremlin fed after midnight. ldquoHas your pizza arrived  quipped Mason. Very distracting.Apart from the unintentional comedy of Flemingrsquos foot coming into contact with a bucket of paint under the table - grey, just like the new set that had been built - and Masonrsquos hand hitting the microphone, you began to wonder what was the point of having a TV version.Being on TV allowed the team to show tweets rather than simply talk about them, and the programme had a certain novelty value in being the first BBC podcast to make the switch to the small screen. We also got to see Fleming, a former Hutchy pupil, beam bright red as a video was shown of Michel Barnier, the EUrsquos chief Brexit negotiator, wishing the team well for their first programme.But at the same time there was a loss of intimacy, and it is easier, and somehow more acceptable, to listen to people talking informally than to watch them. The whole enterprise seemed longer, and flabbier.There is a likeable mix of personalities around the Brexitcast table - Mason the cheeky, bespectacled younger brother, Kuenssberg the ferociously smart blonde , Fleming the swotand Adler the slightly older, wiser sister. It is how they interact that matters, not where they interact.The glitches can be ironed out, and when things get back to normal and the team is in dferent places the show might look livelier.

It has already secured some Scottish Government funding to convert some of its snow-clearers in to dual-fuel hydrogen power. Its aim  N t just to make its own services green but to seed a market so commercial operators can change too. In the long run electric vehicles have lower running costs, experts believe. But they are more expensive to buy than their diesel equivalents. At least for now.Such initiatives will take municipal leadership. And municipal cash.The council has set up a working group to trash out how it gets to zero net carbon. Its recommendations are still under consideration. One is for climate bonds. That means the up-front costs of things like new vehicles could be spread out over years.In its report, the group said it ldquoheard of action by other cities to develop municipal climate bonds in order to fund low carbon developments.ldquoWe commend this model and think the city should explore its potential application to Glasgow.ldquoWe recommend that the cityrsquos partners work together to develop business cases for low carbon energy and transport investments through examination of alternative financing models, including the use of municipal climate bonds.The city councilrsquos buildings, vehicles and services only account for around % of CO emissions. So its efforts to reduce carbon output are often designed as a laboratory of good practice.This includes efforts to improve its own premises. Here too there are capital costs that can lead to revenue savings. And that might justy borrowing, not necessarily through climate bonds.The working group highlighted the prospect of replacing old fluorescent, metal halide and sodium lamps with energy efficient LEDs.Its report said: ldquoSuch an investment scores well for both carbon savings, at an average reduction of over  tonnes of Co per annum for each system installed, and financial payback typically in six years.ldquoThe council does not currently have a plan to replace existing lights with LEDs other than on a re-active basis as lamps fail.The group also enthuses over retrofitting ldquobuilding management systems across premises.Its report added: ldquoInvestment in modern building management systems helps the council achieve savings on energy usage. On average, a greater level of carbon emissions can be saved for a smaller initial investment than the LED intervention, giving a typical financial payback of under four years.Companies and municipalities are expected to issue  billion worth of green bonds in .

In this rendering it would reach for a sturdy tool-kit: dferent spending priorities the sharp lurch to the right of the Tories the creation of hostile environments for minorities the one-sided austerity programme providing tax cuts for the wealthy even as it cut basic lelines to disadvantaged communities.The requirement to chivvy the Tories, however, has become redundant. Why attempt to land punches on the acolytes of the Union when they are making such a good job of self-immolation  Brexit and the manner in which the Tory right has approached it constitutes a much more eloquent White Paper on independence than the first one. Certainly, Unionist supporters might invite us to recoil at the prospect of further economic instability with newly-minted and untested independence on top of all the post-Brexit uncertainty. The issue here, though, isnrsquot about further instability itrsquos that the hard Brexiters who now control the UK economy seemed cheerfully insouciant about risking everything while seeming impervious to its social consequences.:Support for Welsh independence reaches lsquohistoric highrsquoLike the expected repercussions of the millennium bug in  some of the more apocalyptic presentiments of Brexit might yet prove to be fancul. This, though, doesnrsquot diminish the most sinister aspect of Brexit: that its most fervent disciples seemed not to care one way or the other. Worse they were prepared to lie and deceive to maintain any convenient fiction. All that mattered was this: that they would be handed a fragile, softened-up, punch-drunk version of Britain, one that could thus be moulded much more easily into that th century caricature of itself that exists in the scrambled dreams of Jacob and the European Research Group.Next Wednesday marks the fth anniversary of the independence referendum and the Yes movement is entitled to think that itrsquos in a good place. With each newly-revealed misdemeanour of the Brexiters support for independence grows among those who werenrsquot persuaded of it first time around. At the base of this, I think, are questions of trust and decency. The three Scottish judges who deemed the prorogation of Parliament to be illegal did so ultimately because they simply didnrsquot believe Boris Johnson. They virtually accused a sitting Prime Minister of lying to his Queen as a means of escaping the scrutiny of the sovereign parliament he is sworn to uphold and from whom he derives his power. This bore all the imprints of a political coup now we know it actually was one. If they can do thisthey can even contemplate doing this then all the other democratic institutions that underpin the way we reach decisions and make choices must be considered fair game too.When left-wing revolutions have occurred where in the world radicals try to justy them, even when they have withered under human corruption. ldquoAt least they were attempted for the benefit of the many, they say. But what lies in store when a revolution is staged by the few who also control our security services  There is a reason why social mobility is scarcer at the top of the UK military than in any other of the UKrsquos social and cultural jurisdictions.The conduct of Brexit, deal or no deal, has permitted the SNP to claim the social and cultural arguments. Their politicians at Westminster, led by the formidable duo of Joanna Cherry and Ian Blackford, have been the driving forces of the anti-Brexit alliance and have provided it with moral purpose. This is symbolic of another rather more perverse irony: that the hallowed institutions of UK identity and pride will be respected and upheld more in an independent Scotland than in a UK ruled by the Johnson Cummings Rees-Mogg axis. Evena deal of sorts is concluded in the next four weeks this remains the most likely outcome of the next General Election.:Paul Hutcheon: the Queen will see off independence, but will her son In Scotland, the ability of the Unionist parties to oppose independence has also diminished. Ruth Davidson, their most eloquent advocate has retired because she too couldnrsquot trust her boss. The Scots Tory MPs who arrived at Westminster on her coat-tails have since been exposed as indolent popinjays of a stamp much more reactionary and right-wing than their Holyrood counterparts, and thatrsquos saying something. Five years ago, too, it seemed that the Labour Party in Scotland had dredged the lowest depths after its leadership turned it into a footstool of the UK Conservatives. Somehow they have since found a lower place and have learned nothing.The sight this week of Anas Sarwar sharing a  with Gordon Brown was wretchedly appropriate. One of these men destroyed himself in an unhealthy obsession with being Prime Minister the other has lately become obsessive about leading Labour in Scotland. To proclaim a message of Hope Not Hate when attacking the Yes movement is cheap, nasty and unworthy of either. Itrsquos a sign of desperation and of itself proof that neither is ndash or ever was ndash cut out for mature leadership. They know and we know that you only need to worry about nationalist movements when they are being proclaimed in countries that are already independent.If independence is delivered, and we are closer to it right now than we ever were at any time during the first referendum, then it will have been gted by a British elite which was unable to camouflage its true nature. Thus, the biggest threat to independence may yet come from within the SNP itself. The cybernats who have been made convenient scapegoatsfor the ills of political discourse are nothing of the sort. Instead itrsquos a toxic troupe of silent assassins which have taken root inside the SNP, under the influence of the Scottish Greens, who could damage the Yes movement. They have previously tried to destroy the careers of Joanna Cherry and Joan McAlpine, two of the SNPrsquos most able operators.

Profits are enormous, with little apparent risk to the lenders involved, and resultant build quality is poor . The building contractors should obviously pay the penalty, but too often the contracts are poorly drafted, no bonds are posted and companies regularly go bust expunging liability. I recall some years ago it was revealed that construction companies were found to be acting in concert, with ldquofixed bids when contracts were being apportioned. Capitalism not being so much ldquored in tooth and claw, as cronyism and secret handshakes.GR Weir, Ochiltree.JEANE Freeman has now announced that there was a mistake in the tender documents, in particular with the ventilation of critical areas and that the mistake lies with NHS Lothian . Has this same scenario, or similar, been the cause of all of the problems at the Queen Elizabeth in Glasgow  Surely some of the blame must also lie with the Scottish Government, as high-cost, publicly-funded projects would surely have had their documentation checked by it too  This error goes beyond carelessness.George Dale, Beith.THIS week, the interim leader of the Tories in the Scottish Parliament got manna from Heaven in the shape of problems at new hospitals in Scotland, and used these to avoid any mention of the interim leader of the British Tories who had been publicly castigated by three of Scotlandrsquos most senior judges. At First Ministerrsquos Questions, Mr Jackson hectored on about faults in the new hospital but he would have been justly incandescentthe Health Secretary, Jeane Freeman had not stopped the opening of the new hospital.Incidentally the word ldquoegregious has been only vaguely known by me over the years, but its use by Lord Brodie in the prorogation case of the Westminster Parliament led me to check my dictionary the definition was ldquooutstandingly bad, flagrant.It was no wonder Mr Jackson was anxious to avoid any mention of Boris Johnson.Jim Lynch, Edinburgh EH.THE SNP never likes to be seen to fail. Disguising this all-too-resent aspect of its term in office, now approaching  years, has been achieved by kicking everything into the long grass by setting up committees or saying \"lessons will be learned\". The grass is now a wilderness.No excuses are adequate to describe the mistakes and delays in this flagship hospital over several years. These years have seen very ill children therefore being treated in less than satisfactory conditions simply due to the age of the building, not staff application. This is not on and now yet more taxpayers money is being used to fix what should have been excellent. There really can be no excuses now. Nicola Sturgeon has a favourite word to describe the opposition, it is \"shambles\". This shambles has simply joined the queue behind the economy, transport and education in her back court now.Dr Gerald Edwards, Glasgow G.BARONESS Kennedy, Labour member of the House of Lords, made a statement on the BBCwhich has major implications for Scotlandit represents a widely-held position. Baroness Kennedy, in the context of a Brexit discussion, asserted that since referendums were advisory, Parliament did not require to implement their outcomes. Also, she was completely opposed to having any referendums.Assuming she had given this some thought, this would mean thatthe Scottish people voted for independence in a referendum, there would be no obligation to act on it. Alsoreferendums are to be ruled out, what would constitute a legitimate route to achieve independencethis has majority support  Is she suggesting that it should be a majority of Scottish MPs that would trigger independence negotiations  Or have we to wait until a majority of the enlightened opinion at Westminster decide for us  One thing the Brexit issue has done is to flush out a lot of confused thinking on both sides.Isobel Lindsay, Biggar.I HAVE just been watching Question Time on BBC  . Once again I have heard the same fundamental error repeated by both pro- and anti- groups: that we must respect the democratic decision of the people in the  referendum. One speaker even said that Parliament is not sovereign, the people are sovereign. This is nonsense. We elect a Parliament which is sovereign and has not only the sole right but also the duty to govern.A referendum can only be consultative, a test of public opinion, not a policy-deciding process which the government has to obey. This lies at the heart of the dangerous situation which our country now faces. Where are the constitutional lawyers who must know that this the issue  Parliament decides on policy after debates, readings, consultation in both Houses by people who have a reasonable chance of understanding the issues and only Parliament can finally decide government policy.Kenneth Roberts, Lenzie.Read more: Sturgeon under pressure at FMQs over hospitals crisis"},{"url":null,"title":"nicola-sturgeon-scotland-force-good-world","story":"While the Scottish First Minister said the last  years had been defined by the Conservatives austerity agenda and the pursuit of Brexit, the next period should be about \"what Scotland can do for the world\".Ms Sturgeon, who was addressing business leaders in Glasgow, argued that in recent years the policies of \"the most reckless, self-interested UK government in living memory\" had hindered efforts to make Scotland a fairer and more prosperous nation.Speaking at the Business for Scotland dinner, she said: \"We are reaching the end of a decade which will be remembered for two Tory obsessions - austerity and Brexit.\"Both of these have been an unmitigated disaster - not just for Scotland, but for the whole of the UK.: Boris Johnson is a serial liar who doesnt recognise the truth anymore\"The ideologically driven cuts to Scotlands budget have choked off the economic recovery and put incredible pressure on our public services.\"And the Brexit referendum, which was cynically designed to heal isions in the Tory party, has instead brought the UK to its knees.\"She hit out at Prime Minister Boris Johnson over his decision to suspend Parliament in the run-up to the UKs exit from the European Union on October  - saying that he \"appears to have misled the Queen, misled Parliament and misled the country\".Noting that Scotland had voted to stay part of the EU in the  referendum, Ms Sturgeon said: \"We didnt vote for Brexit, we didnt vote for Boris Johnson, and we certainly didnt vote for the catastrophic no-deal Brexit which is now being imposed on us. \"The SNP leader added: \"As we reach the end of this decade, lets all resolve that the next one will not be defined by that which is done to Scotland.: Scotland is closer to independence than it ever was in , says Kevin McKenna\"Instead, lets resolve that the next decade should be defined by what Scotland can do for the world.\"Lets resolve to use Scotlands immense human and natural resources to build a fairer and more prosperous nation - an economic powerhouse which is a force for good both at home and abroad.\""},{"url":null,"title":"passenger-unable-check-ryanair-systems-outage","story":"Twitter users complained of ldquochaos at Stansted Airport on Saturday morning, with many struggling to find their booking details online.The budget airline confirmed that the outage resulted in disruption to airport check-ins and boarding.@Ryanair once again you have surpassed yourselves!

The report suggests problems in the ventilation system in other parts of the hospitals.A report by Health Protection Scotland was also passed to The Herald on Sunday, expressing concerns about plans to address problems with bone marrow transplant units, and minutes of a meeting with health chiefs about issues with the childrenrsquos bone marrow units just months after they opened.Today we can reveal the contents of the documents for the first time.WardsBoth the cancer ward in the RHC and the adult bone marrow transplant ward at the QEUH are described as having not been built for their purpose.Private contractor Innovated Design Solutions concluded in its investigation into ward A: ldquoWe anticipate the original accommodation design was not intended for use by patients with immune response impairment deficiency. On the contrary, the existing ventilation strategy would appear only likely to promote the risks associated with uncontrolled ingress of infectious aerosols into patient areas.On the adult bone marrow unit, Health Protection Scotland reports from October  state: ldquoThe decision to transfer the care of bone marrow transplant patients from the Beatson oncology unit to the QEUH was made in June . Construction of the QEUH was well established at this point and therefore the new unit was not purpose built.VentilationThe size of the device which takes air in and out of the hospital was selected incorrectly, according to the Innovated Design Solutions report. The document explains that the devices are only able to take in % of the air needed when filters inside the ventilation system are clean. As soon as filters start to get dirty, the amount of air the system can take in falls, reducing the number of times air can be circulated through the hospital. The report indicates the devices would need to be able to take in % of the air required to account for dirty filters.The report explains: ldquoAir handling units [AHUs] fans were not sized or selected to afford a spare % capacity, as suggested by record documentation.ldquoWhilst technical literature would suggest there is % capacity available in AHUs, the manufacturer has advised that fans motors were selected based on % duty with clean air filters .ldquoWe would emphasise the probability of these issues inadequacies being applicable to other air handling equipment installed within the AC [adult and childrenrsquos] hospital.The number of times air is circulated around wards is vital to patient safety. Patients with severely restricted immune systems should be in rooms with  air changes per hour, while people with more robust immune systems should have six air changes per hour. The ventilation report reveals that there were only three air changes per hour in the childrenrsquos cancer ward, describing this as ldquosignicantly lower than would normally be expected.The report states: ldquoIt should also be noted that current air change rates are not in accordance with recommendations defined within either [Scottish or UK guidelines on hospital ventilation].ldquoWhilst we were unable to locate documentation defining system design criteria, [UK guidelines on hospital ventilation] were available in . If there was an agreed deviation from recommendations defined within guidance documents, available at the time of design, we would expect this to be claried within the Health and Safety File documentation.Energy-saving devicesThermal wheels, which help to capture heat and save energy from ventilation systems, are common in large buildings but scientists have begun questioning their use in hospitals as they carry a risk of contamination. The devices are widely used in both the QEUH and RHC, as well as in the nearby Imaging Centre for Excellence and the learning and teaching facility on the campus.Investigators said they ldquoConsider this to identy a potential risk associated with cross-contamination and added: ldquoWe recommend this be further investigated and level of associated risk considered against the use of facilities. We anticipate the majority of AHUs installed within the building are also equipped with thermal wheels ie Critical Care, General Theatres, Theatre Recovery, Endoscopy, Ultra CT Suite, Nuclear Medicine. Again, we recommend this be further investigated.Record keepingSeveral anomalies were picked up by investigators at the private consultancy firm in terms of the records held for the RHC. During their investigations into ward A, they found ldquoevident anomalies with records such as those for the size of air handling units which did not match those installed.They said there was no record about why the number of air changes in the bedrooms was lower than the required amount and added: ldquoWe were unable to locate any detailshellip pertaining to an agreed deviation from recommended guidance.The device which supplies air into bedrooms was also noted as being incorrect in the records, with investigators finding the devices were ldquoincorrectly identied within record documentation, albeit ality is very similar. The sizes of pipes which carry air into the hospital were recorded dferently on two separate drawings ndash one stated they were xmm and another said they were xmm.Drawings of ventilation systems on other floors were also found to be inaccurate.Bone marrow unitsNHS Greater Glasgow and Clydemedical director Jenner Armstrong, Grant Archibald, the then-head of acute services, and Billy Hunter, head of facilities, as well as five other senior colleagues held a meeting in September  to discuss apparent problems with the childrenrsquos bone marrow transplant suites.The minutes of this meeting state they ldquoacknowledged clinical frustration about progress and the need to plan for patients currently waiting transplant.They also state that ldquotwo suites have been sealedto avoid air penetration from a source outwith the air handling unit and add ldquoBrookfield [contractor] could retrofit air handling unit modications hellip at an approximate cost of poundk per room.NHSGGC confirmed that upgrades were made to four of the suites, which had been used for bone marrow transplant patients, while four of the other suites were used to accommodate other children with cancer and were not upgraded.Health Protection Scotland documents raise concerns about plans to fix the adult bone marrow transplant suites in the QEUH, which had been emptied of patients several months after the hospital opened.The document states: ldquoThe decision to transfer the care of bone marrow transplant patients from the Beatson oncology unit to the QEUH was made in June . Construction of the QEUH was well established at this point and therefore the new unit was not purpose built.ldquoWhilst NHSGGC has continued to work towards recommendations, it is noted that the solution proposed does not meet guidance, nor does it seek to address all the recommendations hellip As a result, HFS cannot comment on the effectiveness of the measures intended to be put in place.Bone marrow transplant patients have now ed to the QEUH, following work undertaken in , according to NHSGGC.Experts opinionChristopher Shaw, director of the Medical Architecture design practice, said: ldquoThese are new buildings and there are errors. How it happened is a consequence of the complexity and unique nature of the projects and the mismatch of control systems to those projects.ldquoIn a building of this type there are hundreds of thousands of components. These are brought together by specication, design and construction through tens of thousands of controlling documents and databases. Itrsquos then assembled through thousands of contracts and warranties.ldquoItrsquos a one-off product. The complexity should be mitigated by guidance and standards. Those can be managed and maintained where there is a rolling programme of projects to recycle knowledge from mistakes and introduce evolutionary improvements.ldquoHowever, change in the procurement process has pushed lsquoriskrsquo to the contractor and since the banking crisis there has been a broken pipeline of work. Both of these have undermined that status and effectiveness of performance specication.Shaw added that while he was not an engineer, and had no in-depth knowledge of the Glasgow hospitals specically, he believed ldquothe issues identied are likely to be generic and occur where.He added: ldquoThey are undoubtedly serious and, in the case of an oncology unit, I would say critical. These faults will need to be corrected."},{"url":null,"title":"scottish-labour-leader-richard-leonard-quizzed-plan-help-dump-labour-msps","story":"Leonard was quizzed by colleagues last week over fears he wants to give thousands of trade unionists a vote in the selection of candidates for Holyrood, a move which would likely tilt his party to the Left.It is understood he was non committal when pushed, with one party source saying this change would create a ldquohuge rt.Leonard, a left wing ally of Jeremy Corbyn, has struggled to assert his authority on his MSPs, a majority of whom backed moderate Anas Sarwar in the  contest.Opinion polls also show that Labour stands to lose many of their MSPs at the next election, a prospect that will lead to a scramble for prized slots on the eight regional lists the party depends on.The internal election to decide who tops each list is crucial and Leonardrsquos allies are determined left wingers will get the best places.In past contests, Scottish Labour members have ranked the candidates, but two changes have been discussed internally by left-wingers.One is for the partyrsquos governing body, not members, to appoint candidates, a plan that is unlikely to pass as it deemed to be extreme.The second idea is to expand the franchise so that a tier of ldquoaffiliated supporters - trade unionists who back Labour - also get a vote.Supporters can vote in leadership contests, but not candidate selections, and their inclusion could be problematic for moderate MSPs who are sceptical of Leonard and Corbyn.At the last Scottish Labour leadership contest, .% of the , affiliated supporters who took part in the ballot supported Leonard. If the contest had been restricted to party members, the result would have been much tighter.It is understood that ldquolist selections were on the agenda for the MSP group meeting last week and Leonard was asked about extending the franchise to trade union supporters.Leonard is said to have ruled nothing in or out, which his critics have interpreted as him trying to buy time ahead of a final decision next year.Such a move would likely give Labourrsquos biggest affiliated trade union, Unite, a huge say in candidate selections.The bulk of supporters who were recruited during the  contest were from Unite and the , amounted to around % of all voters.Asked earlier this year about the idea of trade union supporters having a vote in List selections, Leonard told this newspaper:ldquoI donrsquot anticipate having US-style primaries for the selection of candidates for the Scottish Labour party.Scottish Tory chief whip Maurice Golden said: ldquoRichard Leonard has scared off voters and alienated party members.

But he was downbeat. I asked why and his response still lingers: ldquoThis is the beginning, not the end.And so it has proven. The indyref, negotiated between the UK and Scottish Governments after the SNP won a Holyrood landslide in , was another chapter in the countryrsquos constitutional journey, not the finale.\"Base camp isnt far off the summit now, Alex Salmond said, after Yes won nearly % of the vote.It has become almost a cliche to note that elements of the indyref campaign provided a foretaste of the Brexit referendum two years later, but all cliches contain an element of truth.In both referenda, a big chunk of the population ignored dire economic warnings and opted for the unknown. On both occasions, the same voters did not flinch from rejecting a political union and poking an old order in the eye.While the Yes campaign was in no way comparable to the malevolence of many elements of Vote Leave, the indyref also showcased the nastier side of politics ... on both sides. The media, particularly the BBC, was baited by an unsavoury minority, political opponents were intimidated on the street, and social media was often a cesspit.But the indyref was also a le-affirming experience for many Scots. An .% turnout ndash the highest of any referendum in UK history ndash was astonishing. Tens of thousands of people who had never shown an interest in politics were now switched on. Scotland has one of the most politically engaged citizenries in the world.Although independence and Brexit are fuelled by nationalism, one key dference separates both causes. Support for leaving the EU is disproportionately backed by the -plus age group, and opposed by the younger generation. Independence is hugely popular among the socially liberal --year-olds and resisted by older, wealthier voters. The demographics are not the same.A political realignment was the inevitable consequence of the referendum, with the SNP reaping the rewards. Independence used to be a niche interest for % of voters, but it became the main iding line in Scottish politics. Your view on the constitution now often determined your vote in elections.The SNP was on the losing side on September , but the Nationalists quickly became the main winner. Party membership shot up to , and they won an incredible  seats at the  general election. It was a sign of the SNPrsquos dominance that falling back to  seats two years later was portrayed as a failure.The indyref, paradoxically, was also good for the Scottish Tories, who over the previous two decades had secured the patent of irrelevant also-rans. Just as the plebiscite served as a political awakening for nationalists, so too did it lead to a revival in unionism. The threat of independence is the Scottish Toriesrsquo political meal ticket.Scottish Labour, already in decline prior to the indyref, were the main losers from the campaign. The conventional narrative is that Labourrsquos participation in Better Together, alongside the Tories, hurt them electorally, but this is a flimsy argument.If Labour had campaigned separately for a No vote, the Yes sidersquos lethal \"red Tory\" insult would simply have been adapted. The indyref was always going to be a disaster for Labour. Once a lion, the party is now a mouse.The main lesson from  was confirmation,it was needed, that a referendum does not resolve binary constitutional issues. The  vote on joining the European Communities fuelled a bitter, -year debate. The devolution referendum in  led to an endless debate on Holyroodrsquos powers. The same is true of the indyref and the Brexit melodrama.And therein lies a challenge for Nicola Sturgeon. A second independence referendum looks likely and the bookies are predicting a Yes vote, but the First Minister should be mindful of the state of Scotland after another referendum and the effect a Yes vote would have.The stakes are much higher for the Unionist side. A Yes vote would never be overturned there would be no re-run five years later. Hundreds of thousands of voters would feel like the UK had been broken up, and that their identity had been shattered.It would be the heartbreak of a letime for these people.

However, what makes this yearrsquos descent from the Arctic a little out of the ordinary, is that there is currently roughly seven times the number than would normally be expected for this time of year.The geese are on the move early and in signicantly greater numbers, the rowan trees are heaving with plump red berries, and therersquos a definite fading of colour from the ash, beech and oaks.All of this and yet it seems only moments since social media was packed with pictures of children ing to school, while that lsquoblink and yoursquove missed itrsquo weekend of August sun just three weeks ago is starting to feel like it never happened.Of course, we just have to check the calendar to know that winter is heading our way. But could all those geese be trying to tell us something about what may lie ahead And should we be paying more heed to nature and the folklore of the past to find out whether this winter will strike earlier, hit harder and be even more bitter In the lush green surroundings of the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh, botanist Dr Gregory Kenicer agrees there has been a slightly early change in the colour of the leaves on the trees and a vibrant burst of berries on some bushes, but that is likely to be more a sign of seasons past than those to come.ldquoThe colour of the trees may be turning just a tad early, but plants respond to changes in climate in dferent ways.ldquoAnd as far as I know, we donrsquot have any psychic plants, he adds.ldquoThe classic lsquoold wivesrsquo talersquo is the one about rowan berries ndashthe rowan berries are out in force early, then a hard winter is on the way.ldquoItrsquos true that there are a lot more berries around at the moment, but that is more to do with the year that has past rather than what is happening in the future.ldquoThe rowan tree needs a bit of sun to get fruits prepared, and this year there was some early sun that resulted in lots of flowers being produced.ldquoAs long as you donrsquot get big storms or a very dry spell over summer, the berries from the flowers will survive and grow.The rowan treersquos links with one of our most familiar winter predictions are rooted in druid and pagan ritual. Known as the witch tree or wicken tree, in some areas once forbade the use of its timber, leaves, bark or flower except for sacred purposes, while it has been associated with healing and as a protection against evil spirits.But perhaps a better indicator of the weather to come could lie by the seashore  Long ribbon-like fronds of sugar kelp were once hung outside to dry and used to predict the weather ndashit stayed dry, the weather would be fine,it softened and became limp, rain was on the way.It was so trusted, that it became known as Poor Manrsquos Weather Glass. However, Dr Kenicer suggests there is little science to back up the folklore.ldquoAny time we have looked at it not surprisingly wersquove found that when itrsquos raining itrsquos wet and when itrsquos dry, the weather is dry. Which is exactly what yoursquod expect.ldquoIt might predict slight changes in humidity, but yoursquod probably be better just looking at the sky and carrying an umbrella.He believes much of folklorersquos weather sayings linked to plants and trees are rooted in hopes and fears for crops and livestock, rather than serious scientic fact.ldquoWhether itrsquos dry or hot or wet within every plant there is a strategy to deal with the weather, he adds.Even the autumn glory of dazzling coloured leaves has been suggested as an indicator of a harsh winter ahead ndash the more vibrant the colour is said to be a sign to batten down the hatches.But rather than foretelling dramatic events Dr Kenicer says there is a less mystical reason for the colours.ldquoThe green pigment in leaves break down dferently depending on the tree, and the chemicals present in the leaf. The green is there to capture sunlight, but there are other chemicals that can act like anti freeze or to deter insects.ldquoItrsquos those colours that emerge, rather than it being linked to what might happen in the future.Meanwhile, in Montrose, around  pink-footed geese are settling in nicely, but even their arrival may be more to do with events where than what may be heading our way.A blast of bad weather in Iceland is thought to have pushed the birds further south earlier than normal, with the first flock making their descent as the calendar turned to September.That compares to three years ago when the first pink-footed geese delayed their arrival until mid-September, and even this time last year when there were just  in the basin.Eventually, they will continue their migration to Morecombe Bay and The Wash, with numbers falling to just a few thousands in December and January.Rory Syme, Scottish Wildle Trust, says: ldquoThere are currently about , pink-footed geese gathered at our Montrose Basin Wildle Reserve.ldquoDuring a full moon they can travel through the night so numbers could rise quickly over the next few days.ldquoWe would only expect to see a few hundred at this point in the season, but cold and wet weather in Iceland seems to have pushed some birds south sooner than usual.ldquoMost of the geese at Montrose are stopping to refuel for a few days before heading further south. Itrsquos too early to say what will happen with their numbers this year.ldquoHowever, a quick start to the season may mean we donrsquot see the big peaks of up to , birds that wersquove had in recent years.At the Met Office, where sensible science takes precedence over nut-hoarding squirrels or the number of spiders in our homes ndash even modern technology canrsquot predict the future terribly far in advance.ldquoThere is some truth in the lsquored sky at night, shepherdrsquos delightrsquo saying, admits meteorologist Greg Dewhurst, ldquoand a lot of these old sayings have some sort of method behind the madness.ldquoBut we generally only forecast general weather trends  days ahead.Tie pieceOld wivesrsquo tales, folklore or fact  Could nature be telling us something we need to know Flowering ivy in autumn is said to indicate the weather to come ndash lots of yellow-green flowers attracting dozens of insects has been linked to the onset of a cold snap.Late falling leaves and berry-laden holly and rowan trees are said to be another sign, along with thick shells on acorns, brighter autumn foliage and higher than usual activity among nut-gathering squirrels.Check the family pets for signs of a thickening of their fur ndash apparently another sign of falling temperatures, along with high numbers of spiders.Early bird migration is said to signy a particularly harsh season ahead, while a warmer than normal November could also be a warning sign for a bad winter."},{"url":null,"title":"fifty-years-ago-struck-first-north-sea-oil-now-time-turn-tap-off","story":"Itrsquos now half a century since that eureka moment and around  billion barrels of oil equivalent have been extracted from the North Sea. Though the Arbroath field was considered too small to warrant development at that time, it wouldnrsquot be long before a vast reservoir of crude oil was struck in , the Forties field, and our time as a signicant oil-producing nation had come.ldquoIts Scotlands oil soon became the slogan of the Scottish National Party. Oil and who we were, as well as how we lived, became entwined. We were still some way from learning that our black gold came with an atmospheric side-effect, though, as it happens, in , The Stanford Research Institute presented a report to the American Petroleum Institute that warned the release of carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuels could carry harmful consequences for the planet.There has been a lot of good news stories lately from the world of North Sea oil. Last year BP opened Clair Ridge, targeting, it said, ldquo million barrels of recoverable resource. In August, Equinor began extracting oil from the Mariner field,  miles east of Shetland, which is expected to yield  million barrels of heavy crude oil.Drilling activity is increasing following record-low levels in recent years. The Oil and Gas Authority has increased central production projection out to  so that it is ldquonow . billion barrels higher than it was in . There is talk that another  billion barrels could remain, to be exploited, in the UK Continental Shelf.Nevertheless a dark cloud ndash the climate crisis ndash threatens. Every one of these barrels comes with a carbon emissions price tag. The big issue is, in an era of climate emergency, should we even be extracting it at all  Its no longer simply a question of how much more we can find, but how much we may need to leave in the ground. Can we continue to extract from the North Sea and yet still hit our targets of net zero by  in Scotland, or  in the UK Some believe we canrsquot. One of the big ideas being discussed by environmentalists is the need for a ldquomanaged phase-out ndash a plan for how we turn off the taps while making sure not only that we provide enough green energy, but that those with industry jobs are not left behind.Greg Muttitt, research director at climate and energy think-tank Oil Change International, is author of a report called Sea Change: Climate Emergency, Jobs And Managing The Phase-out Of UK Oil And Gas Extraction. He believes it is time to put a stop on further exploration and begin a retreat from oil.At an event this week in Edinburgh, he and co-author Anna Markova argued that those who once had jobs in the oil sector could be retrained with skills for the renewables sectors or in retrofitting homes. As many as , new jobs, they estimated, could be createdwe went fully renewable.But there are still few signs that politicians have an appetite for a deliberate retreat from oil and gas. Just over a week ago Nicola Sturgeon, asked whether she planned to ldquoturn off the taps, replied: \"Irsquom not going to do that because these are complex issues. What would happen is that we would have to have substituted imports of oil and gas, perhaps from countries, with a higher carbon density because there are less rigid regulations.Sturgeon is right that it is a complex issue. The industry provides , jobs across the UK. Energy security is crucial. According to UK Committee on Climate Change modellings, demand for oil and gas, even in , looks likely to remain fairly high. If predictions are accurate, given our reserves, the native UK oil industry would be able to provide only % of our fossil fuels, by comparison with the % it is now.So its not surprising that the oil industry still sees itself as having a huge role in the future. Deirdre Michie, chief executive of Oil and Gas UK which recently published its Roadmap To : A Blueprint For Net Zero, says: ldquoOur projections are consistent with the Climate Change Committee projections which show a continued need for oil and gas out to  as part of a erse energy mix.\"Itrsquos important we meet as much of that demand from domestic production, providing security of energy supply while retaining the skills and expertise of the sector to support the development of low-carbon technologies.Roadmap  appears to be the oil and gas industryrsquos pitching of themselves as the solution to climate change, rather than the problem ndash its argument for why the oil industry is who we need to sort it out while continuing to provide us with the stuff that is the prime source of emissions . The roadmap report frequently mentions \"maximising economic recovery\", a strategy that chiefly involves maxing out the reserves. Among its plans are to reduce the emissions associated with production of oil and gas and support and develop mitigation technologies.But in the years leading up to now, the oil sector has clearly been the problem rather than the solution. A  report by CDP found that the worldrsquos oil companies were spending a tiny fraction of their investment budgets on low-carbon projects ndash on aggregate just .% of their total  capital expenditure.A study by the International Institute for Sustainable Development found that, globally, coal, oil and gas were getting . times the subsidies renewables were, and estimated that just -% of those fossil fuel subsidies would pay for a global transition to clean energy.Oil and gas have been deemed among our greatest national assets for so long that itrsquos hard to let go of the idea that it isnrsquot best for the oil industry to extract as much as it can and make the most of it. That, after all, is essentially what the government has asked the industry to do in its Maximise Economic Recovery strategy.Yet, according to a  study in the scientic journal Nature, an estimated third of oil reserves, half of gas reserves and more than % of known coal reserves should remain unused in order to meet global temperature targets under the Paris Agreement.Of course, the  billion barrels still left in the UK Continental Shelf is a small fraction of the wider global reserves, which according to a  estimate were about . trillion barrels. We could say, they are not so signicant. But at the same time, our extracting every barrel we can sends out a message to the world. We are not leaving our third in the ground.If all countries were to follow our approach of phasing out coal while maximising oil and gas extraction, the Sea Change report says, \"resulting warming would signicantly exceed degC\". According to a  report in Nature Climate Change,we were, globally, to burn all global fossil fuels, we could be on a journey to a degC global temperature rise.Scotland may be otherwise well placed to tell a story about itself as a forward-thinking pioneer towards net zero, but others are being more bold than the UK on this issue ndash for instance New Zealands Jacinda Ardern, who last year announced a ban on all new offshore oil exploration permits. As Muttitt puts it: \"The elephant in the room is Scotlands policy to Maximise Economic Recovery of oil and gas. When the global climate summit comes to Glasgow next year, this contradiction could become an embarrassment.\"No one is looking for us to turn off the oil and gas tap today. What groups like Friends of the Earth Scotland are calling for is the establishing of an \"end date\". There is no avoiding the fact that a dramatic transition is necessary ndash the question is who will define it, and what its timeline will be.Who creates the story of climate emergency Scotland  The oil industry  The renewables sector  Civil society The taps are set to turn off at some point, evenit is in the worst case scenario of a climate crisis stricken world, in which we finally have taken the last economically viable barrel of oil from the ground. Better to fully grapple with the transition now, campaigners say, to start creating a new Scotland in which our economic and political future is not dependent on how much oil we can find and extract.Andwe do embrance that fossil fuel-free future, we might want to think about a new slogan for our times. Not, \"Its Scotlands oil\", but \"Its Scotlands carbon budget.\"The environmentalist roadmapFor many climate change campaigners, the bottom line is that every barrel of crude oil or equivalent gas, adds more carbon dioxide into our atmosphere.According to Greg Muttitt, , globally, all countries were only to use their already developed reserves, in the absence of any properly effective negative emissions technologies, that would set us on a course towards degC rise ndash and that, as last yearrsquos ominous IPCC . degC report described, brings a strong risk of climate disaster.However, the current plan in the UK is not just to stop at the six billion barrels there already is in developed fields. Itrsquos to find still more oil and gas, to pursue the  billion barrels they think are out there. This summer, the UK issued  new licences for exploration and production rights.Echoing Murtittrsquos call for a phased taps-off is Professor Kevin Anderson of the Tyndall Institute.ldquoThe UK, he says, ldquoshould rapidly put in place a phased shutdown of all fossil fuel production, to be completed by around . This needs to begin now and broadly be cutting output at something approaching-% each year. This matches the mitigation rate of the UKrsquos Paris-compliant emission pathway and carbon budget .Andersonrsquos figures dfer from those of the UK Committee on Climate Change in that, unlike theirs, his do not rely ldquoon planetary-scale negative emission technologies, which he believes have shown insufficient promise. They also factor in a greater level of global fairness.Essentially the issue around how much oil we can afford to extract boils down to a number of dferent debates. Among them is the question of how much of the global pie of carbon budget that Scotland, an already developed country, should in all fairness get. Another is what proportion of emissions can be mitigated through carbon capture or negative emissions technologies ndash some say that we are putting too many hopes on this yet to be perfected technology given there are only  working carbon capture projects in the world.Our relationship to oil is indeed complex. Beyond our need for it in our cars, homes, aeroplanes and other aspects, we remain wedded to oil and gas because of what  it brings us, or we believe it brings us. Taxes for instance ndash though we might want to look what fiscal benefits the UK is really getting from oil. In the tax years - and -, the Treasury gave more money to oil companies than it took from them in taxes, although in that time BP and ExxonMobil made more than pound billion in profits.Then there are the jobs the oil industry has provided. Thinking about turning off the taps means also thinking about how we ensure employment for all in the sector.Mary Church, campaign director of Friends of the Earth Scotland, which published the Sea Change report, describes a so-called Just Transition as a process that would involve all the relevant stakeholders, particularly the workers and communities. If we dont commit to this, she says, we \"face a deeply damaging deferred collapse of the oil and gas sector, that will hurt workers and communities the most, as the reality of the climate crisis hits home and forces a shutdown.Jobs on tapComment by Anna Markova, Sea Change report author:We know that tackling the climate emergency means quickly scaling back the amount of oil, gas and coal that we take out of the ground and burn. This means oil-extracting countries have a choice:bull Option A: start scaling back the drilling now, in a gradual way, with time to build up alternative industries and take care of the communities that depend on oil now.bull Option B: wait until later and face a much quicker, chaotic shutdown. I know which option Irsquod choose, but what does it look like Scotlandrsquos potential for concentrating clean energy industries is huge: an estimated  gigawatts viable fixed offshore wind resource , and even bigger potential for floating offshore windfarms , not to mention pioneering centres for tidal and wave energy.And offshore renewable energy is a viable pathway for firms and workers in the oil and gas supply chains. Many Scottish specialist scaffolding and construction firms as well as marine crews already work interchangeably on oil rigs and offshore windfarms.Other oil and gas supply companies will find applications in advanced water and waste treatment and innovative heat networks, according to research by Arup. Undoubtedly, workers and supply chain firms need support and guarantees to make the leap from old industries to new securely.Two big questions remain. First, can there be enough jobs in the clean energy economy We modelled how many jobs could be created over time in some of the most compatible clean energy industries ndash wind, wave, tidal and energy efficiency retrofits ndash in three possible futures.In the first future, neither the Scottish nor UK governments do anything  to help the industries grow. In this case, the number of jobs in wind energy is similar to the number of oil and gas workers potentially affected by the transition, but nowhere near enough to actually replace oil and gas employment.But in the second future,Scotland and the rest of the UK build as many new windfarms and tidal and wave energy generators as industry and politicians currently say is feasible, and retrofit their housing stock to boot, over three new clean energy jobs can be created per oil worker affected.And in the third, \"fully renewable\" future , job creation over time is even greater.So itrsquos perfectly possible to fully replace the economic contribution of the oil and gas industry by betting on renewable energy ndashgovernment does its job right."},{"url":null,"title":"friends-25th-anniversary-25-fact-much-loved-sitcom","story":" Initially Friends was going to be called Insomnia Cafe. It was inspired by the real-le friendship of creators Marta Kauffman and David Crane. The pair met as drama students and were part of a group of university friends they saw as a surrogate family. The pitch for the show was simple: ldquoItrsquos about friendship, because when yoursquore young and single in the city, your friends are your family. Crane and Kaufmann also wrote the theme song Irsquoll Be There For You. David Schwimmer was the only cast member to have a part written for him ndash but he turned it down. Schwimmerrsquos first love was theatre, and hersquod had a bad taste of Hollywood when he ended up waiting tables while trying to get a break on screen. Schwimmer was happily back in theatre when he was offered the role of Ross. Crane and Kauffman had met him in LA and been impressed. He refused. They persisted. Eventually he relented. Matthew Perry knew he had to play Chandler when actor friends started asking him to coach them to audition for the part. Perry had been to primary school with Justin Trudeau, and beat up the Canadian premier because he was jealous of his sporting talent. He was broke when he got the role ndash his hopes of becoming a professional tennis player dashed. Lisa Kudrow was on her way to becoming a successful scientist when the acting bug bit. Her TV career seemed to be taking off when she was cast as Roz in the series Frasier ndash but she was fired after four days, and left fearing her career was over. When she auditioned for Phoebe, Kudrow had to read for James Burrows ndash whorsquod directed Frasier. She thought shersquod no chance ndash but he thought she was perfect. Courtney Cox had an eclectic career before becoming Monica. Shersquod studied architecture, but with Stewart Copeland of The Police as a relative she ended up cast in Bruce Springsteenrsquos Dancing in the Dark video. In , she caused a stir when she said \"period\" for the first time on US TV in a Tampax advert. She later starred in Ace Venture Pet Detective, and a doomed sitcom called The Trouble with Larry ndash about a man captured by baboons on honeymoon. Matt LeBlanc auditioned for the role of Joey with a bloody nose and killer hangover. The night before, hersquod got drunk. Groggy in the morning, he tripped and smashed his face against a toilet. As Ky Miller, author of a new book about Friends called Irsquoll Be There for You, says: \"LeBlanc Joeyrsquod his way into stardom.\" The creators wanted Jenner Aniston to play Monica ndash but even though she was eventually cast as Rachel, the future of her role was in jeopardy. Shersquod already shot another sitcom called Muddling Through, and there was a risk Aniston would have to honour commitments, meaning another Rachel would have to be cast. Muddling Through was finally canned, freeing Aniston up. When filming started in  nobody liked LeBlanc. In reality, softly-spoken LeBlanc worried Joey was too boorish, but the actor was initially perceived as a swaggering macho man. Schwimmer said: ldquoI thought, lsquooh great, herersquos this guy Irsquom going to have to work with for maybe five years, and hersquos f**king Joe Cool Studrsquo. They all quickly became firm friends, however ndash just like the show. The cast hated working with Marcel ndash Rossrsquos pet monkey in the first two series. Played by a Capuchin called Katie, Marcel was retired and drted into TV obscurity. Oprah Winfrey was the first to raise the lack of black actors on Friends. In , in the first big interview with the cast, she said: ldquoIrsquod like for you all to get a black friend. The debate about the lack of ersity on the show continues ndash as do concerns about misogyny and fat-shaming. Homophobia also haunts Friends today. One campaigner edited together every \"gay joke\" in the show and it ran for  minutes. Many are offended by the writersrsquo treatment of Carol and Susan ndash Rossrsquos lesbian we and her partner. However, in an era when homophobia was endemic, others say that at least there were gay characters in the show ndash in most other series everyone was straight. Crane, whorsquos gay, and Kauffman based Carol and Susan on close friends. Friends had a huge cultural impact. It sparked a boom in coffee shops like Central Perk. But its biggest spin-off was The Rachel hairstyle. In Britain alone, some  million women got The Rachel cut at one time or another. Ky Miller says: ldquoGenerational theorists claimed it as the definitive series of Generation X. The show suffered a backlash when it began to cash in on success. In , Friends paired with Diet Coke in a m ad campaign. The ads became ubiquitous ndash and the cast pocketed cheques for up to ,. Over exposure saw ratings decline. One newspaper described it as \"The One Where the Show Crosses the Line from Promiscuity to Prostitution\". Friends had an incredible roll-call of guest stars. At least  big names appeared including George Clooney, Bruce Willis, Robin Williams, Brad Pitt, Winona Ryder, Reese Witherspoon, Sean Penn, Elle Macpherson, Sarah Ferguson, and Richard Branson. Although Ross and Rachelrsquos off-again-on-again love affair is remembered as the central storyline, in reality the pair were only a couple in % of the showrsquos  episodes across ten seasons. Friends was performed in front of a live studio audience anda joke didnrsquot work writers would rewrite on set. Producers even asked for a show of hands from the audience to seecertain jokes worked. This meant recordings took hours ndash often running until am, with sleepy audiences switched out mid-way. Producers initially wanted Liza Minnelli to play Chandlerrsquos transgender father ndash Helena Handbasket. Eventually, they hired Kathleen Turner ndash and played it for laughs, much to the disgust of trans campaigners today. The best that can be said is that in the Friends era, the rest of society was just as ignorant. September  helped Friends bounce back from a ratings slump. When Season Eight began on September , , it became the leading show on television. Season Eight also won Friends its first Emmy. Ky Miller says the quintessentially New York show ldquowas revived by the tens of millions who turned to it for comfort, distraction, escape, hope. Although Friends is set in Manhattan, writers decided not to mention September . Instead, the atrocity was only referenced visually ndash with US flags in Central Perk, or stars wearing sweatshirts commemorating New York firefighters. Producers had to reshoot an episode where Chandler jokes about bombs at an airport. By the final season, the cast were earning  million per episode making them among the highest-paid stars on TV. Theyrsquod started out on pound,. The cast had been able to make such sums not just because of the popularity of the show, but because ndash as friends ndash they negotiated together, never allowing executives to ide and conquer. Friends helped get Donald Trump elected. Friends was essential to NBC viewing figures. When channel boss Jeff Zucker realised the show was coming to an end he needed a replacement hit. Zucker went for a show called The Apprentice ndash credited with helping Trumprsquos rise to power. The final episode ndash The Last One ndash ended with the entire cast weeping. As filming began on January  , the stars were sitting on the famous orange couch in Central Perk. LeBlanc said: \"Do you realise this is the last coffee shop scene \" They all began crying and filming had to stop until theyrsquod calmed down. Amaani Lyle, who worked for Friends, claimed the writersrsquo room was a hotbed of racism and misogyny. She said writers fantasised about Joey raping Rachel, and referred to Kauffman as a \"c**t\". Lyle, whorsquos black, was fired but took out a harassment suit. She lost when a court found the writersrsquo behaviour reflected a ldquocreative workplace in a show dealing with sexual themes. Itrsquos unlikely but there might be reunion. Although Schwimmer says he doesnrsquot want to see the castldquowith crutches and walkers, therersquos been a spate of classic sitcom remakes, including Roseanne and Will  Grace, which has fuelled speculation that Friends may one day . As Jenner Aniston, who \"fantasises\" about a comeback, says: ldquoAnything is possible. I mean George Clooney got married. Friends is bigger today than it was in the s. Itrsquos the most-watched show on Netflix UK, beating The Crown and Stranger Things. Comedy Central UK paid a \"colossal\" figure to rerun the series. Back-to-back episodes go out daily, and ratings never falter. Friends continues to air in  countries. Therersquos been many homegrown rip-offs from Indiarsquos Hello Friends, to Spainrsquos  Vidas ndash the nationrsquos longest-running sitcom.

It also means Scottish people, even those lucky enough to have front and back doors and a bit of space, do not have enough room to grow some fruit and vegetables.The climate emergency might just change the old rules. And, with them, the very look of our towns and suburbs and the green belts which surround them.That is because scientists believe that,we are serious about slashing greenhouse gases, we need to grow more of our food locally. And in towns and cities the only way iniduals and communities can plant more fruit and vegetables iscouncils make space for them to do so.Gardens. Allotments. Orchards. This is one of the front lines in the battle to mitigate against destructive global heating. It is where council planning rules meet a world imperative.Glasgow has ambitious plans to become the first city in the UK to get to zero-net carbon, when it takes out as much of the greenhouse gas from the atmosphere as it puts in.It has set up a working group to figure out how. One of the proposals, quietly published last month, is an overhaul of planning.New developments, said members of the working group, should always have local food at their heart. Housebuilders, in short, will have to show where their future customers will plant their greens. That  metres between windows, neatly ided by a fence or a hedge, just will not cut it.The working group report concluded: \"Emissions from livestock farming are a signicant element of greenhouse gas production.\"The global food production system also contributes to carbon emissions through transport and is itself highly vulnerable to future changes in climate. A healthier diet involves less consumption of processed foods and meat. A more resilient food system involves more locally sourced produce and a recognition of seasonality in that production. An approach which is informed by Fairtrade principles can also reflect our local responsibility to the development of a more sustainable and just global food system.\"The working group surveyed Glaswegians. They found more and more people want to grow their own food.According to an ancient rule of thumb, it takes \" poles\", in old Anglo-Saxon measures a plot of  meters by  metres, to feed a family of four. That is still the gold standard for a British allotment, evenmany do not reach such expanses. Less would still cut bills ndash and emissions ndash in season.The working group reported: \"There is clearly an opportunity to do better here and many of our survey respondents talked of the need to promote a plant-based diet as well as to provide more opportunities for local food growing.\"We recommend that the council and its partners publish a sustainable food strategy for the city within the next year and that the council considers making space for food growing a requirement of new housing developments.\"The councils ruling SNP administration is understood to be giving this recommendation serious thought. This will not just encourage bigger gardens in the lower-density areas. It will spur, insiders say, growing developments on gap and \"stalled sites\". And roof garden and aquaponic growing opportunities even in the most densely developed areas of the city centre.Last week The Herald revealed council officials were being urged to reforest golf courses whose future is in doubt. Such green spaces may also find they become community assets.Existing new rules mean local authorities across Scotland have to ask communities about places where they would like more gardens or allotments.The now semi-derelict Cowlairs Park ndash essentially disused football pitches in the north of the city ndash is one.Anna Richardson, Glasgows Convener for Sustainability and Carbon Reduction, said: ldquoOur food growing strategy is starting to take shape and council-owned sites where therersquos potential for food growing are beginning to be identied.ldquoFrom our engagement with communities so far, there appears to be a strong appetite for people to be able to grow their own food.ldquoAs part of the community empowerment process, it is the councilrsquos role to find ways to harness and facilitate the considerable ambition for growing food that already exists across the city.ldquoEnsuring Glasgow becomes a sustainable food city will help the city tackle the challenges of climate change, but also address issues of food poverty and general well-being.ldquoInitiatives such as the overall master plan for the largely disused Cowlairs Park in the north of the city point towards food growing being incorporated in major developments from the start.ldquoThe vision for Cowlairs is that gardens attached to homes are large enough for families to grow their own food while a communal garden would have facilities such as a shared tool shed for the community.ldquoThese plans are at very early stage and will the subject of detailed work by the community and developers but show we are already heading in the right direction.\"Local groups of councillors are already looking at potential gap sites for good across the city. There are already some community gardens, such as that run for the last decade by the Woodside Community Development Trust on West Prince Street. It can feed  families.Read more: How green is Scotland  Climate change map for YOUR area revealedNobody, however, is suggesting a new \"Good Le\" Glasgow of self-sufficient families like in the s sitcom. Realistically, getting to zero-net carbon will involve developing a market for more local food from farmers.Here again there is a huge role for councils and the rest of the public sector ndash using their procurement might to build up capacity.These, again, are policies that could change our suburban and green-belt landscapes as more land is turned to food.Ms Richardson explained: ldquoIt is also essential the council does whatever it can to ensure the food we provide is sourced as locally as possible.ldquoAnd at least % of food provided in our museums and art galleries comes from local or Scottish providers and that gives us a very solid base to build on.ldquoIrsquom very hopeful our food growing strategy will capture the imagination of the cityrsquos growing communities and show the huge potential there is growing food in Glasgow.The Scottish Government is looking at changing rules to make it easier to procure local foodThe working group concluded: \"Procurement has always been a dficult area in which to incorporate social and environmental objectives because it is highly constrained by a narrow legal focus on budgetary value. Good progress has been made by the Scottish Government and the Council in broadening this focus to embrace sustainability considerations.\"We think more can be done to bring climate issues to the fore and especially to look at how local food production can be encouraged through public sector purchasing power. \"Other big public-sector food buyers are keen too. But they have un in to problems. The Scottish Prison Service, for example, sources all its milk north of the border. and is talking to its suppliers about other produce.A spokesman said: \"These conversations have, however, revealed that there is presently a signicant premium attached to sourcing some local food products.\"This can make it cost prohibitive, particularly in an environment where prisoner numbers have been increasing and budgets are decreasing.\"It is against this backdrop that the SPS regularly discusses opportunities to buy Scottish produce with all its food suppliers. Feedback from our suppliers is that they too are keen to look to source locally where possible but, for some areasthis has proven extremely dficult.\"Glasgow knows that partners like the SPS need to get on board with local foodthe whole city will get to zero-net carbon.NHS Greater Glasgow spends poundm a year with suppliers. A spokesman said: \"As Scotlandrsquos largest health board we are determined to use our high-profile as a buyer of goods and services to make a positive impact on our local area while reducing our impact on the environment.\"Local small and medium sized businesses and third sector organisations are being helped to bid for contracts with the board. A dedicated group has also been set with a focus on sustainability being a signicant factor in contracts.\"These aspirations please Scottish farmers. Vice President of the National Farmers Union, Martin Kennedy, welcomed procurement reform: ldquoThe proposed statutory framework must be the catalyst for Scottish Government to work with local authorities to ensure they do the right thing when it comes to feeding a locally-sourced, healthy, balanced diet to those who use our public services.ldquoIt would genuinely help. Yes, it may add one or two pence to a meal ndash but I would challenge governments and public procurement buyers to consider what the real cost is of bringing products in from other parts of the world  These products certainly donrsquot meet our standards ndash not to mention the impact on climate change when food miles are taken into consideration.\"Itrsquos only a couple of years since the kids in our schools were getting their chicken from Thailand. Things are improving, but itrsquos still not Scottish chicken.ldquoSuch an approach does work. Tayside contracts worked with NFU Scotland last year to get Scottish lamb back on the school menu after a very successful pilot in Perth and Kinross.

She added: “Christmas and New Year is a time which should be spent with family, and there are few days in the year when families are off at the same time. “The results of Usdaw’s survey show that the overwhelming majority of respondents want to spend more time with their families during Christmas and New Year.“I hope all of my MSP colleagues will recognise that everyone deserves a day off for New Year and will support the motion that I have tabled in the Scottish Parliament.”"},{"url":null,"title":"garioch sports centre serves up an ace with new tennis plans","story":"With the nation currently hooked on Wimbledon, it#s a fitting time for Garioch Sports Centre to unveil its new tennis-focused proposals.Inverurie Community Council has submitted fresh expansion plans to Aberdeenshire Council on behalf of Garioch Sports Holdings.Full planning permission was secured last year for a major extension of the Inverurie facility, but changes in the community’s requirements and pressures on funding have prompted a reduced development.Initially the plans would have seen the Burghmuir Drive centre expanding into one of the largest amenities of its kind in Scotland, incorporating tennis courts, a multi-sports arena, fitness suites and an all-weather G pitch for Inverurie Loco Works FC which has now been dropped.But while the scale of the expansion might not be as ambitious, the new plans do reveal tennis courts and improvements for fitness along with an Early Learning Centre for younger children.Thanks to signicant input from Judy Murray – mother of tennis stars Andy and Jamie – the plans feature three dedicated tennis courts and the centre has committed to a three-year partnership with the JM Foundation, highlighting the commitment of the centre to develop the sport across Garioch.The centre and JM Foundation will work in partnership in upskilling their workforce and identying potential coaches while funding coach education.In a supporting statement the centre writes: “The matter of securing the appropriate funding for the ious options which have been considered over the last couple of years has impacted upon how the plans have altered with the focus very much now being on the new tennis provision.“The most recent plans reflect the discussions with the Lawn Tennis Association and also Tennis Scotland.“The advice and guidance of Judy Murray has also been pivotal in how the plans particularly for the tennis courts have progressed.”The applicants also believe that despite the downturn in oil and gas and other industries, there is still a demand for its facilities.It reports: “As many of the activities and programmes now carry waiting lists, there is proof that despite a downturn in many industries the timing is now right to expand in tandem with the growth in participation and the increase in the town and rural residency.“An expansion of the present facility and delivery of its sporting, health and wellbeing activities has many positive additions as the market town itself strives to increase its provision to its residents.”data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..!

Last year, , Scottish volunteers took part, removing an incredible , inidual items of litter at  beach cleans along , metres of Scottish coastline.Data collected by volunteers from over  years of MCS-led Great British Beach Cleans has been instrumental in the introduction of Scotland’s p single-use carrier bag charge, commitments to implement a ban on plastic stemmed cotton buds and to introduce a depositscheme for bottles and cans.Mr McArthur will be joining the citizen science project to help clear and survey the litter found on Echna Loch Bay, Burray on Monday, September .“Orkney has a fine tradition when it comes to ‘bag the bruck’,# says Mr McArthur.#I have been involved in such clean up efforts since I was at school in Sanday.“Of course, these days there is a greater public awareness of marine litter, and concern about the problems caused by plastic pollution in our seas.“I’m looking forward to joining volunteers of all ages at Echna Loch Bay to support the Great British Beach Clean campaign. This will be just one of many such clean ups taking place across the country. As well as helping tidy up our beaches and coastlines, I hope the initiative helps highlight the importance of reducing waste and protecting our precious marine environment”.Lizzie Prior, MCS Beachwatch Officer said: “It’s fantastic to see that local MSP, Liam McArthur, will be joining us at Echna Loch Bay to support our Great British Beach Clean it’s really important for decision-makers to see how much litter, especially plastic, makes its way on to our beaches. We hope that Liam’s attendance at the Great British Beach Clean will encourage local constituents to join us for an eye-opening day on the beaches of Orkney.

This would be completed over the next two or three months, he said.On the issue of smell, the two sources are from the -metre chimney and from the hatches of the fish meal boats.

But this week the #Peatbogs# will be back on home turf to showcase their energetic brand of traditional-inspired electronica as part of this year#s Skye Live Festival.The rare Skye gig will mark the start of another autumn tour for the six-piece group, for whom constant re-invention has proved key to longevity spanning almost three decades.The sound that#ll boom out in the tent high above Portree Harbour this Saturday will be far removed from the group#s roots as a folk band playing in local pubs. But the Peatbogs, like more recent successors such as Niteworks, are a reminder that a grounding in traditional music is no barrier to a letime of instrumental experimentation.Le for the Peatbog Faeries began with a gig in Edinbane Lodge in the spring of . Peter Morrison and bass player Innes Hutton from Braes # the two constants in the line-up # were joined by Davie Tait, Ali Pentland and Alan Edmunds.Pubs and village hall dances became their early staple, but gradually more adventurous elements crept into their set and the audiences lapped it up.Morrison recalled: #We#d bring in a blues or a reggae sound, and we found it was these things that started to go down best with audiences.#We moved to more of a world music sound around about , but we never expected much to come of it. We were just out to play at pubs and parties and have a bit of fun#.Their first tape # the #Great Ceilidh Swindle# # sold well locally and paid for a demo in Edinburgh, which in turn caught the ear of Greentrax Records, the specialist label in Scottish traditional music.With bands like Shooglenty and Martyn Bennett also arriving on the scene it proved a perfect time to be breaking new ground and the Peatbog Faeries# debut album #Mellowsity# would stay in Greentrax#s top ten for the next decade-and-a-half.Morrison remembers: #Because of our size and sound, bands like us and Shooglenty cost a lot more to record than other folk bands at the time. So there was a worry at the start.#But as soon as we signed to Greentrax, we quite quickly got an agent and we got sought-after slots at Glastonbury, Nomad and Celtic Connections.#We didn#t really notice what was happening, in a way # it felt like one day we were playing in the pub, the next day playing in front of thousands.#There weren#t that many precedents for bands like ours. Most folk bands just played in pubs. There were some accordion bands that were full-time or groups like #Silly Wizard#, but for us coming out of Skye we never thought it would turn into a full-time occupation.#We just went with the flow and luckily for us it proved a lot more popular than we thought it would be.#The band#s line-up has changed several times, and in turn, each addition helped explore new sounds # the most dramatic sht coming when Rick Taylor and Nigel Hitchcock arrived on Skye in the s to add a three-piece brass section.Taylor # who passed away earlier this year # was a revered musician who had toured with Elton John, while in recent years the Peatbog#s fiddler Peter Tickell left the group to take to the road with Sting.The current scaled-back line-up has seen Morrison and Hutton joined by Edinburgh-based Tom Salter on guitar keyboard player Graeme Stafford from Ardnamurchan drummer Stu Haikney and Shetlander Ross Couper on fiddle.For Peter Morrison, the global tours, the record deals and the Glastonbury stage all owe their origins to the chance he got to learn the chanter in the long-since closed Vatten Bridge primary school.He explains: #Every year Norman MacLeod # the teacher#s husband # and John Laing used to pipe us all in to the Christmas Party, so that was where I first heard the pipes.#Every pupil got the chance of learning the chanter at school, and I think nine of us started playing. It was either that or an hour of maths.#I think I was the only one who carried on into secondary school, but I got the bug. I didn#t like the competing part, but I enjoyed listening to the pipes and learning to play them.#My pal Donnie MacAskill from Roag also played the accordion, so I learned to play drums along with him and from about the age of  I was always in bands.#Morrison#s early piping tutor was Cameron MacFadyen, and he received additional help from Nicol Campbell # another well-known local piper and character from Dunvegan, whose memory has been honoured across the globe.Morrison added: #When he passed away Nicol left me his kilt, which has since been worn on stages in Japan, Africa and America.#A joiner to trade, who also worked for aperiod as a hotelier in Dunvegan, Peter Morrison has seen attitudes to traditional music change over the years, and with it opportunities flourish.He still lives in Roag with we Johan and grown-up kids Jenny and Calum, and it#s no surprise to hear him promote the virtues of free access to music tuition in local schools.He continues to be #amazed# at some of the local talent learning traditional instruments, some of whom he can be heard playing alongside at regular music sessions laid on in the Edinbane Inn and the Old Inn in Carbost.#It#s changed a lot since when I was a youngster whenyou wanted to learn music the only real opportunity was the pipes,# he recalled.#Things like the fis movement have been really helpful in creating opportunities. There now seems to be a constant stream of really good young musicians coming out of Skye.#When I started you would never have thought of making a career out of it, but now with some of these youngsters, it seems to be the only thing they think about. #A lot of these kids are now at a standard that in previous years only a handful of people in Scotland were achieving.#In Skye you have the likes of Daimh, Niteworks, Bridghe Campbell # the list goes on and on. #At these regular sessions there are some great young local players going along like Anna Scott, Dugald McKiggan, Archie and Isobel Maclean and Malin Lewis.#Morrison continued: #Recently over in LorientI saw a great act. It was a Sikh beatboxer, accompanied by step-dancer Sophie Stevenson along with Catherine Tinney from Portree singing puirt-a-beul.#This was another Skye person on the international stage, singing to an incredible standard, but she was someone I#d never heard sing before. #In the past, going somewhere like Lorient,there was a person from Skye on stage you would know exactly who it was # they would be an established name. Now you can go somewhere like that and get a surprise.#It shows the strength in depth there is now.#Some of that west-coast musical talent will be showcased at Skye Live this weekend among a ied line-up that will also include some of the country#s top nightclub DJs.Morrison urged the local community to rally behind the festival weekend, which this year starts with a Thursday-night concert to the Waterboys.He added: #We played at the very first Skye Live five years ago and are looking forward to getting on stage at the Lump in Portree again.#It#s an iconic setting, but organisers have kept the festival to a level that is comfortable for the place.#A capacity of , people is about a fth of the population of Skye and is manageable. When you start to go into the tens of thousands it brings pressures, and it#s a risk to go too big without the infrastructure to support it.#Whenever anyone organises a festival there will always be people who might want to pick holes in it or knock it in some way.#But people need to remember that these guys are putting on a  for so many types of music.#It#s something people of all ages can go to and hear some of the best music in Scotland in Portree.

In truth, the margin of defeat flattered St John’s who, for the second game running, failed to fire.They got out of jail at the weekend when an injury-time Pearse Donnelly goal almost plundered an unlikely victory before Conal Delargy kicked the equaliser. The general consensus was that Casements had missed the boat and that the Johnnies would win the replay, but Portglenone boss Barry Dillon said he knew his players could better Sunday’s performance. “We sat back too deep on Sunday, it was our own fault,” said Dillon. “Maybe the fear of winning made them a bit apprehensive, but we knew we had more in us. “In the first half of the drawn game, we showed we are the better team and we had that belief coming into this game that we could go and finish it.” While Portglenone fielded an unchanged team from Sunday’s drawn game, St John’s started Domhnall Nugent, Brian ‘Bam’ Neeson and Sunday’s goal-scorer Donnelly. Yet, as was the case on Sunday, it was Casements who made the brighter start with a hat-trick of frees from Conal Delargy and Ronan Kellyhelping them establish a - to no score lead after a cagey opening  minutes. It took the Johnnies  minutes to open their account following a well-worked move finished by Matthew Fitzpatrick, but Paddy Kelly responded in kind for Portglenone minutes later. Peter McCallin got his side’s second score on  minutes with St John’s struggling to break down a well-organised Portglenone defence. The Whiterock Road men then lost Donnelly to a black card and Delargy converted another free to move his side - to - ahead. When Kieron McKenna added another from play, Portglenone looked in a strong position approaching half-time and a Paddy McBride free with the last kick of the half was badly needed by the under-par West Belfast outfit. The second half was just four minutes old when Portglenone cut a dash through the heart of the St John’s defence to score a brilliant goal with full-forward Michael Donnelly firing past Padraig Nugent. Less than a minute later, St John’s hit back with a goal of their own. Having been off-target with a few efforts from frees,Neeson’s fortunes changed when an attempt at a point dipped under the crossbar and beyond the reach of Portglenone goalkeeper Ryan O’Neill. That should have been the catalyst for St John’s to kick on, but instead it was Portglenone who regained control of proceedings as another Delargy score moved them four clear once more. St John’s continued to squander chances at the other end with Neesonand Fitzpatrick firing wide of the posts. McBride converted a free before Dermot McAleese broke forward to score for Casements. Ryan McNulty landed a stunning point from play with  minutes of normal time remaining, yet their hopes of another rousing comeback were dented when they lost centre-forward Conal Kelly to a second booking. McBride briefly reduced the gap to two points while Nugent was forced to make a great save to deny Niall McKeever at the other end. Michael Kelly scored an excellent point moments after his introduction for Portglenone and a Ronan Kelly free gave them a four-point cushion approaching full-time. Rather than sit back and defend their lead as they did last Sunday, Dillon’s men went for the jugular and further points from McKeever and midfielder Fergal O’Kane put them six clear. There was one last surge from St John’s with Michael Bradley’s sideline being fisted into the net by Fitzpatrick deep into stoppage time and the Antrim star had a second goal-bound shot blocked with the final play of the game. Yet Portglenone were the better team over the two games and they progress to a semi-final meeting with Lámh Dhearg on Saturday, September  at Creggan.

For Martin Moreland, Principal of Mercy College, it was very dferent indeed.Born on the Ormeau Road in South Belfast, Martin was the youngest of six children. Having left school with no exams, Martin’s road to the classroom and education sector began as an engineer.“I never really thought I would be a teacher because I never had the confidence to be one,” he explained.“It was a dream in a sense but I never really thought it would be a reality.“I left secondary school with no exams. I went out into the world of work – it gives you a lot of le experiences or the real world as I call it.“I went into engineering and had several jobs. My we has a job in education and she told me about a course up in Derry that gave you access into university. I went and got a GCSE in English and Maths and spent three years up in Derry doing the course.Martin was accepted into St Mary’s University College and after his first teaching job in West Belfast, has moved to the North of the city.“With my engineering background, my first job was a Technology and Design teacher in St Colm’s in Twinbrook and I spent  years there. I loved it there, it was a great community and a school that was thriving.“I moved on to Mercy where there was just  kids. I started off as a teacher before becoming Principal and I’ve been in the role for ten years.”Martin then reflected on the many changes in education over the years, not least the challenges and successes of Mercy College.“When I came in, it was about building up confidence and profile of the school, given our location in North Belfast.“Pupil numbers now are  but our challenges now is very much to do with space and classrooms.“We have been co-educational for a few years now which is fantastic. We have a   ratio girls and boys in Year . Our LLS programme is still really successful and we were the first school to start that.“The standards are amazing – % of girls are getting three A-Levels from A* to C which is very unique. % of our GCSE students got five GCSE’s at the top grades and there are not many other schools in the North that can boast such results.“Finances remain a huge challenge for us. There is no room for any extra money in the system. It is not easy at all.”Away from school, Martin is kept a busy man being a father of ten children.“I am a family man. I am a father-of-ten so at home it is a very busy household, with the kids ranging from  to .“I am very much an outdoor person. I like nature and sunshine. I am also big into running and gardening. With my technology background, I like a project such as a pond or a patio to keep me entertained.”As for the future, Martin is content at Mercy College but would love no more than see a new building for the school in his working le.“I am  now and I suppose you start to think about how many more years I can give in education.“I probably have another ten years in me. I am happy at Mercy College – there are so many challenges every year.“I really want to see our newbuild come for the school which is in the pipeline – just need Stormont up and running to approve it.“The future of the school is very bright. There is a lot of work still to be done to maintain our standards and results and improve facilities for the kids.“"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"meabh set to sing the anthem at croke park","story":"AN Under- Lámh Dhearg footballer will perform Amhrán na bhFiann in front of thousands of GAA fans on Sunday ahead of the Dublin -Galway All-Ireland Senior Ladies Football Final. -year-old Méabh McNeill told Daily Belfast that she is “super excited” to be singing in front of up , fans at Croke Park ahead of the finale to the ladies football season. “When I was seven myself and my brother went to Scéim Samhraidh at our club, Lámh Dhearg,” she said. “One of the events was learning and singing the national anthem.

Boris Johnson has assured us that there is no deviation in his stance on the backstop. Thats not to say discussions are not ongoing, but we are still very clear in our views.\"Sinn Fein claimed the report shows the DUP are feeling the heat at Westminster. Foyle MP Elisha McCallion said: \"The DUP are clearly under pressure from the agri-food industry and farmers about the devastation a no-deal Brexit will bring.\"Other sectors such as our manufacturers, business and small to medium enterprises, our community and voluntary sectors need to increase the pressure on the DUP to end their support for the Tory Brexiteers hell-bent on dragging us out of the EU and driving our economy over a clf.\"The backstop is the only insurance policy for the people of the north against a Tory Brexit.

We have a very simple saying, Happy pupils, high expectation, high achievement and thats it in a nutshell.\"The school is well led by a supportive board of governors.\"Principal of Loreto Grammar, Omagh, Grainne OHanlon, said she was \"delighted\" at its joint top ranking, the first time it has topped the league table.\"It is the result of the professional relationship and trust which the teachers establish with the pupils,\" she said. \"Theres a strong, supportive pastoral Special Educational Needs and safe environment surrounding the pupils and thats fully endorsed by the parents.\"Its the overriding belief that our young girls are creative, talented and able, and with a lot of self belief and hard work they can achieve.\"Lumen Christi College principal Siobhan McCauley said her schools academic success is largely due to \"the excellent relationships that exist between students and staff\".She added: \"The strong support of parents coupled with the hard work and dedication of the staff enables our students, who are well-motivated and enthusiastic, to perform at the highest level and thus achieve outstanding exam results.\"Principal of Rainey Endowed Mark McCullough said the results were enabled by a \"three-way partnership between the school, parents and pupils\".\"Its a great accolade - we just work and do the best for them that we can,\" he said.\"Im absolutely delighted and would like to thank everybody for all their hard work.\"Principal of St Dominics in Belfast Carol McCann said that % of all GCSE grades achieved in her school were A* A.\"Our performance at GCSE is the highest it has ever been in the A* A grades,\" she said. \"We are very proud of the achievement, which is down to the hard work of the pupils, staff and parents, who have worked together.\"Our Lady and St Patricks College principal Deborah McLaughlin said her schools joint sixth position was \"testament to the positive attitude of our students, who are supported by our committed staff and our parent body\".\"Were very much a team,\" she said. \"It is a balance between academic and extracurricular activities for students.\"Principal of St Louis Grammar School in Ballymena Sean Rafferty paid tribute to the work of pupils, staff and teachers.\"I would like to congratulate the pupils, teachers and parents for their magnicent effort.

councillors in Glasgow, supported by Police Scotland, effectively weaponised these protests by sending out a message that they would use the threat of protests to ban Protestant parades.\"This action led to the chaotic scenes in the streets of Glasgow as a hardcore element from both sides of the argument used this weaponised protest action against each other.\"Drawing parallels to the banning of parades in Northern Ireland, a spokesman for the Grand Orange Lodge of Ireland said: \"We can fully appreciate the frustration and sadness being experienced by our Scottish brethren.\"For many years, the Orange Institution in Northern Ireland has been the victim of similar, politically motivated decisions.\"The rights of peaceful assembly and religious expression should be cherished by all and protected by those elected to represent all strands of civic society.\"The spokesman said it appeared that the threat of violence by those opposed to peaceful parades had again triumphed.He added: \"Too often, law abiding citizens have witnessed their rights and cultural identity being eroded in order to placate those who hate all that our institution represents.\"It is ironic the very freedoms delivered by the Glorious Revolution in  are now being withheld from those who seek to cherish and commemorate it.\"In solidarity with our Orange brothers and sisters, we therefore fully support Saturdays planned peaceful protest in Glasgow organised by Scottish Protestants Against Discrimination.\"We trust that the event will cause the relevant authorities to listen to and appreciate the

There are other guys in Derry who are on the edge of that, the problem with this is and Declan Morgan was right, there is a human cost, a psychological cost, a physical cost.“People are getting their hopes built up thinking something is going to happen and then they’re deflated again, you can only pull yourself up so many times.“I’m having dficulty pulling myself up week by week, to continue fighting this, and it would be a hell of a lot more dficult for people who aren’t aware of the detail and the argument that goes into getting this far.”For victims it is about much more than monetary compensation, that comes secondary to an apology from the state and institutions responsible and a package that enables them to move on with their lives in a better way – which includes appropriate healthcare and support.Last Friday, Lord Chief Justice of Northern Ireland Sir Declan Morgan said it was \"shocking\" that victims are still awaiting action.He revealed that before Sir Anthony Harte, who chaired the Historical Institutional Abuse Inquiry, died, he had expressed \"profound disappointment\" at the lack of progress.Sir Declan said it \"epitomises how the lack of an assembly impacts negatively on the lives of Northern Irelands citizens\".‘Absolute disgrace’The Historical Institutional Abuse Redress Bill was listed amongst parliament business on Monday but was not dealt with because of prorogation.Mr McCourt believes the suspension of parliament by Prime Minister Boris Johnson has essentially “killed off” the Redress Bill.“To all intents and purposes the Redress Bill is killed off. If the legislation is not passed and hasn’t gone through the House of Lords and received the royal seal of approval then it is killed off.“The fact that it hasn’t been dealt with at this stage is an absolute disgrace, Declan Morgan is right to bring it back up again.“Even at this point they are still talking about it being a devolved matter, the hope of having this dealt with through the NI Assembly does not exist, the only avenue for this to go forward is through Westminster.\"Speaking at Westminster on Tuesday, Independent Unionist Lady Sylvia Hermon said she was \"extremely annoyed and disgusted\" that the motion to discuss historical abuse in NI wasnt even moved because of prorogation.\"By proroguing parliament tonight, the Prime Minister has wilfully and deliberately deprived victims of a -minute debate. He has sent out a clear signal that those victims to not even merit a debate.“It’s appalling, I ask the Secretary of State to demand that the Prime Minister comes to NI, sits at the meeting and looks the victims of HIA in the face and explains to them why he is so disrespectful and discourteous of the hurt and the suffering that they have had to endure.”Unexpected and emergency debates were to blame, Julian Smith explained, and he apologised for the change in business which he said “in no way diminishes how seriously I’m progressing the issues or affected the commitments I have made.”Mr Smith said officials have prepared the policy and lawyers the draft law and he has asked that it be included in the Queen’s speech as a matter of urgent priority.He was however challenged about why legislation hasn’t been brought forward and was told that the state is failing victims yet again.Scotland’s progressIn Scotland their inquiry is ongoing, the report is not written, but the Scottish First Minister has instructed the civil service to initiate an advanced payment scheme. Anyone over  years of age or with a terminal illness can now apply for an award of £, – which is not their full and final settlement.Some child migrants who were taken from homes in Northern Ireland and shipped off to Australia have also received payments.Mr McCourt believes the same could have been done for victims in Northern Irelandthere had been the political will to do it.The HIA inquiry studied allegations of abuse in  homes and other residential institutions between  to .These were run by the state, local authorities, the Catholic Church, the Church of Ireland and the children’s charity Barnardo’s. The largest number of complaints related to four Catholic-run homes.A report in  recommended that victims should receive compensation, however, the process of securing compensation stalled when devolution collapsed in the same week.After a four-year Inquiry and over two and a half years since the publication of the report, the government has still failed to deliver a promised apology and financial redress.In recent weeks Secretary of State for NI, Julian Smith, gave assurances to victims that a Redress Bill would be fast-tracked through Westminster. But Brexit, and the suspension of parliament, has placed yet another roadblock in front of victims.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshPhoto: Termonbacca where historical institutional abuse took place.  Campaigner Jon McCourt has highlighted that another HIA victim has passed away before receiving compensation."},{"url":null,"title":"derry homeowners left shaken burglary waterside area city","story":"Detectives are appealing for witnesses and information following the report of a burglary at a house in the Grovemount Court area of Altnagelvin, Derry, on Thursday  September.Detective Sergeant Boyd said: “It was reported that entry was gained to the property between am and pm on Thursday.

Members were told that a key element of this innovation project was the provision of mechanism to support the transfer of skills and expertise to company staff and university students.Personalised MedicineIn relation to the prioritisation of the Future Fund of £m and the further anticipated match funding from NI Government and other partners, the emphasis is on advancing with projects such as the Graduate Medical School as a key catalyst for the much-needed expansion of the Ulster University Magee Campus. The delivery of a Personalised Medicine Centre of Excellenceat Ulster University and Altnagelvin is also a priority for this fund as is the provision of an integrated, Council-wide, multi-skills employment pathways intervention support programme.The report advised that work on these innovation projects as well as the proposed SMART and digital city projects were advancing in close collaboration with local industry and partners and relevant government departments, while the strategic outline cases for major regeneration projects for Derry City and Strabane Town Centre are at an advanced stage of progress.The Personalised Medicine Centre of Excellence intends on harnessing the power of Genomics to predict and diagnose inherited and acquired disease, and to personalise treatments and interventions.The Ulster University representatives said it will expand its partnership with Genomics Ireland and other commercial enterprises to sequence the genomes of % of NI’s population contributing to a research database that can be interrogated to develop personalised medicine solutions with worldwide application and valuable I.P. and how it will also contribute to health improvement locally through a unique ‘community buy-in’ approach.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh"},{"url":"https://img.resized.co/derrynow/eyJkYXRhIjoie1widXJsXCI6XCJodHRwczpcXFwvXFxcL3MzLWV1LXdlc3QtMS5hbWF6b25hd3MuY29tXFxcL3N0b3JhZ2UucHVibGlzaGVycGx1cy5pZVxcXC9tZWRpYS5yaXZlcm1lZGlhLmllXFxcL3VwbG9hZHNcXFwvMjAxOVxcXC8wOVxcXC8wOTEyMTkwNlxcXC9TVFJBQkFORS1ERVZJQ0UtLnBuZ1wiLFwid2lkdGhcIjo2NDcsXCJoZWlnaHRcIjozNDAsXCJkZWZhdWx0XCI6XCJodHRwczpcXFwvXFxcL2NhY2hlLnJlc2l6ZWQuY29cXFwvbm8taW1hZ2UucG5nXCIsXCJvcHRpb25zXCI6W119IiwiaGFzaCI6IjhlOTFmNGZjY2ExNDE2YjZiOGFkN2MwMzExOGY0ZWQ0NThmOWJlMmIifQ==/strabane-device.png","title":"security operation creggan area derry following discovery mortar device strabane","story":"District Commander Superintendent Gordon McCalmont said: \"It is our assessment that the New IRA is responsible for the mortar device that was discovered outside homes in Church View Close in Strabane on Saturday morning th September. The people who left this device had every intention of killing my colleagues serving the Strabane community. They showed no regard for the families, elderly and vulnerable people who were forced to leave their homes and whose lives were put at risk.   As a parent myself it was terrying to hear local mother Aileen Mullan recount how close her children were to this deadly device.\"The New IRA members behind this attack are living in the community. They are building bombs and storing weapons and placing the community at risk. To further highlight the recklessness and total disregard shown by the New IRA,  a public safety operation is taking place in Creggan this morning th September involving approximately  officers and explosive detection dogs. Our assessment is that this group is concealing bomb making materials. We have a number of areas of focus but there is nothing definitive and no guarantees.

For example, can lessons be learned from other towns which experienced similar problems or what about changing the sequencing of traffic lights in the town centre  he asked.ldquoIt has been said many times that there is no quick fix solution to Downpatrickrsquos congestion problem and while the layout of the town may pose problems for engineers, surely it is time for some innovative thinking Cllr Curran said he believes that all the key players need to get together, suggesting years of inaction has exacerbated the congestion nightmare faced by residents, businesses and visitors to the town.He added: ldquoIt is time to forensically examine the problem and come up with ideas on the way forward.

It was also an effective way to promote the work that we do and raise awareness among the regular customers to Asda. ldquoThe foodbank has noticed an increase in donations to our permanent collection point in the store since the campaign ands partnerships like this make our work so much more effective.Downpatrick store manager, Roger Croskery, said Asda has always always been proud to support the communities it serves.ldquoOur community champions work tirelessly to support charities, projects and initiatives that make a real dference to the people living around their Asda shop, he said.ldquoBut we want to do even more to help local communities across the UK to save money so they can live better. Wersquoll do this is by doing our part to tackle the growing issue of poverty in the UK and our Fight Hunger campaign is part of this work.Roger and Linda, along withy other staff members from the Downpatrick store, recently visited the Fountain Foodbank to see the impact the donations have made, to meet volunteers and find out more about how the foodbank works.The foodbank provides emergency food parcels to those who find themselves in dficult circumstances and has distributed over three thousand food parcels in the local area since opening in March .It also receives weekly donations of fresh food from Asda as part of an ongoing scheme with FareShare which has  yearsrsquo experience working with the food industry to safely ert edible surplus through a UK-wide network of frontline charities fighting food poverty.FareShare works with businesses and charities to get food to good causes in a way thatrsquos cost effective and makes sense for the business and the charities, with the Fountain Foodbank registered to receive some of this food.The volunteers say this particular initiative is an effective way to cut down on waste and help those who find themselves in dficult circumstances.Asda says that by the end of the Fight Hunger campaign, it aims to provide an additional  million meals every year by investing in the charitiesrsquo infrastructure and services so they can collect, store and transport more food.In addition, the store aims to provide , vulnerable people access to fresh food every year and make fresh food the norm in food banks and not the exception.Asda also wants to tackle the root causes of poverty, helping one million people with the food and support they need to help them out of the situation they are in and expand the companyrsquos existing food donation activities so every one of its stores has the ability to donate edible surplus food to local food banks and community groups..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/4th September 2019 C Diary.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C September 4%2C 1979  ","story":"WARRENPOINT mdash A plea by Official Unionists to adjourn this weekrsquos meeting of Down Council because of the murders at Warrenpoint and Mullaghmore was rejected the SDLP and Alliance members.The motion to adjourn was defeated by ten votes to six and immediately the Unionists walked out mdash not in protest but as a gesture of sympathy to those bereaved by the murders.The motion was introduced by Saintfield councillor, Mr William Finlay, who said he looked back with horror at the murders, the victims including  soldiers at Warrenpoint, Lord Mountbatten, his grandson, Nicholas , the Dowager Lady Brabourne, and a  year-old boy, Paul Maxwell.Acting chairman, Mr Paddy OrsquoDonoghuesaid he would be impartial in the matter and was quite sure they all shared the revulsion, horror and disgust and would like to show their sympathy with those were bereaved ldquoin such a dreadful way.He pointed out that there had been two committee meetings of the council since the murders occurred, but since Mr Finlayrsquos motion was a procedural matter councillors must decide without any debate whether or not they wanted to adjourn the meeting.He added: ldquoHowever, whether or not the council decides to adjourn should not be interpreted as to whether or not councillors approve of the vile deeds which have been perpetrated.After the vote, in which the SDLP and Alliance members voted against the Unionists, Mr Finlay said he was sorry about the decision which the majority had made.NEWCASTLE mdash The fireworks display organised as the climax of the Newcastle summer season did not go down with a bang, but instead fizzled out.Torrential rain minutes before the fireworks bonanza was due to begin washed the show out and it now seems likely that the display will be held at Halloween at Downpatrick racecourse instead.Drumgath Accordion Band and Ballykeel Pipe Band were about to march into the arena to put on a marching exhibition when the rain came down.More than pound had been spent on the fireworks, but the rockets, roman candles, catherine wheels, shells, mortars and numerous other favourites were saved from the rain.

It is already a couple of months behind schedule because of a host of supply dficulties, the cement strike among them.Once it is handed over it will have to be equipped and sterilised before it can be commissioned. That could take a couple of months.BALLYNAHINCH mdash The September Flower Show organised by the Presbyterian Womenrsquos Association connected to st Ballynahinch Presbyterian Church proved to be a huge success.The Huston Hall was crammed full of baking, handiwork, flowers and vegetables.

The proposed new school will also be in the trusteeship of the De La Salle Congregation.St Patrickrsquos Grammar has maintained its opposition to the merger proposal since it was muted in , while both De La Salle and St Maryrsquos support the merger.Mr Joe McCann, St Patrickrsquos Grammar principal, said he is ldquodisappointed that an apparent EA source had broken the news of the merger plan locally before his and the other schools were formally notied.St Patrickrsquos parent body mdash The Parents and Friends Associationmdash said that it will ldquovehemently fight these proposals with every means necessary, through the courts and, unfortunately, in the media.PFA spokesperson, Cormac Artt, criticised the EA on how the news was leaked ahead of the schools being notied last Thursday and the argument that local children will be educated together and the likelihood of capital funding for a single-site school build.Mr Artt continued: ldquoThis proposal cites an enrolment of  pupils and alleges that this yearly intake will be made up of up to % who will be admitted by academic selection.ldquoHowever, the census figures suggest thatall those who live within a three-mile radius and those for whom the school is the nearest Catholic grammar are admitted automatically without sitting the GL entrance assessment, there will be very few,any, places for those applicants seeking admission via academic selection.Mr Artt suggested that the outworking of this means that the rural communities and primary schools who have been an integral part of the grammar schoolrsquos -year history, will no longer have a place in this proposed super school, including those in Teconnaught, Loughinisland, Strangford, Kilclief, Dundrum, the Ards peninsula, Castlewellan and Newcastle.ldquoThe choice for boys in these areas who wish an academically selective education will therefore be travel to Newry or Belfast to try to secure a selective grammar school place in Catholic schools that are already heavily oversubscribed, he said.ldquoThe alternative for those who wish to keep the tradition and connection with Downpatrick will be to attend the state academically selective, Down High School. Aside from the injustice of this on the rural communities, is the impact this will have on families.While the EA said that the proposals have ldquoalready been subject to formal stakeholder consultation with parents, staff, governors and pupils, Mr Artt disputed that.ldquoParents of students from St Patrickrsquos Grammar requested a meeting with the De La Salle Trustees in April to discuss the Trusteesrsquo vision going forward. They finally responded in June by refusing to meet the parents citing rsquoit is not clear what,anything, will be gained by a meeting,rsquo which clearly makes the parents think that they do not care about the pupils of the school where they are Trustees.ldquoThe Board of Governors, staff and parents are overwhelmingly opposed to this proposal and for the De La Salle Trustees, who are the only stakeholder supporting this vision, to refuse to speak to the current parents is a disgrace.De La Salle principal, Ciaran Maguire, said he was ldquodelighted to see the proposal going to full public consultation.He told the Recorder: ldquoItrsquos been a long time coming. I am reassured now that the families of the greater Downpatrick area will have an opportunity to finally get behind the vision to secure the town as a model of good practice, where childrenrsquos education is a priority.ldquoThe De La Salle Congregation have been working on bringing post primary education in Downpatrick into the st century. In , they first proposed that St Patrickrsquos Grammar should become a co-educational school.ldquoThe Department of Education at the time wanted to see a proposal that was reflective and inclusive of all schools in the Downpatrick area. That advice was taken by the De La Salle congregation and they have been working, in partnership, on a solution to ensure that all children in the greater Downpatrick area have an education system that they can be proud of.Mr Maguire said the origin of the transfer test ldquowas a solution to a problem back then, suggesting the problem is dferent now and a new solution is needed.He added: ldquoWhat we need now for our children is something radical and exciting for all those involved. If we are the child-centred schools we say we are, then this is undeniably the right thing to do, not just for my pupils, but for the St Maryrsquos girls and St Patrickrsquos boys.Mr Maguire contended that while some may see the proposal as ldquoas an attempt to wipe out a schoolrsquos history and tradition, itrsquos an opportunity for them to continue their great work in preparing our children for le.He said that it will cater for all children from the local feeder schools, without the fear of having to sit and possibly fail a test.Mr Maguire added: ldquoWe are removing barriers those same barriers that our children currently struggle with, the fear and anxiety of not fitting in, not being good enough. I urge all parents to get behind this proposal, your opinion matters and should count.Welcoming the proposed merger, St Maryrsquos High School principal, Ms Rosemary McLaughlin, said ldquoit has the ability to deliver.She added: ldquoWe are very proud of our school as a centre of excellence and we look forward to this new opportunity of proposed change to serve all young people..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/11th September 2019 Migle.jpg","title":"Migle thanks foster parents for help in education success  ","story":"A BALLYNAHINCH woman has thanked her foster carers for the key role they played in her educational success.Miglehas revealed how growing up in foster care helped shape her future career as the Regional Adoption and Fostering Service launches a new campaign encouraging more people to become foster carers across the Provincersquos health trusts.Migle was fostered by South Eastern Trust foster carers Michael and Martha eight years ago and is currently studying Computer Science at Queenrsquos University Belfast.She moved in her with foster parents when she was  and admits she would not be where she is today without their support.ldquoBefore I went to live with Michael and Martha I never even thought about going to university, said Migle who moved to Northern Ireland in  from Lithuania.ldquoThey were able to help me choose what I wanted to do with my le.

Over the past three years Irish Lights has proactively engaged with the local community and relevant state agencies to establish the best approach to the site. he continued.ldquoWe have now developed and tested new technology to achieve a sustainable solution that will enable retention of the historic lens and sweeping beam at St. Johnrsquos Point. I look forward to meeting with the community to discuss these plans in more detail.The Lecale Lightkeepers say that while they accept there is some concession on CILrsquos part in proposing to keep the sweeping beam at the lighthouse, they have been informed by the Commissioner that the range of the beam will be reduced by up to nine miles. They also claim that the beamrsquos iconic ldquoloom will be lost, robbing the lighthouse of what they describe as its ldquointangible heritage.A spokesperson for campaigners said that through their freedom of information requests for communication between CIL and others, they have found a ldquolack of appreciation for the intangible heritage of lighthouses and a disregard of the views of coastal communities.ldquoWe have seen examples of modernised lights and none have retained their original characteristics. The new light source proposed for St Johnrsquos Point would be an LED which, in itself is suspect, as according to the Royal Society Publication April , LEDs have detrimental effects on Epaunal Marine Communities.Campaigners say Newry Mourne and Down Council has already voted unanimously to protect the sweeping beamrsquos current mechanism and trustsrsquos that CIL will not be given planning permission to proceed with its proposal.ldquoThe lighthouse is a listed building and its character, the light, must be protected, declared the campaignersrsquo spokesperson.ldquoWith the loss of the historic lights at Fastnet, Mew and Tory it is even more vital that St Johnrsquos Point should be kept for heritage purposes. Moreover, it is a beautul feature of our nocturnal landscape, much loved by the local communities.Turning to concerns about the mercury in the current lighthouse mechanism, the spokesperson said mercury vapour is a known toxic substance, arguing that vaporisation only occurs in certain circumstances, notably in very warm conditions where there is poor ventilation.ldquoThe St Johnrsquos Point lighthouse is fully automated and the lantern room is well ventilated.ldquoAccording to the late attendant Henry Henvey, the mercury had not needed any attention in at least  years nor were there ever any concerns about its safety.Next Wednesday eveningrsquos meeting in Ardglass starts at pm..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/11th September 2019 Red.jpg","title":"Red High 25 group in fundraising drive  ","story":"NEARLY  years on, the loss of Ballynahinch teenager Mark Quinn is still keenly felt today mdash by his grieving family, schoolmates and his fellow soccer players.The  year-old took his own le on December , , with his funeral service one of the biggest his home town has ever seen.Earlier this year, Markrsquos former classmates at St Patrickrsquos Grammar School in Downpatrick joined together to fundraise in support of community mental health initiatives in his memory coming up to his anniversary.The former students, now grown men, many with sons of their own, all found that Markrsquos death hit them in dferent ways then and throughout the following years.The group, known as Red High , decided that they wanted to raise money to help support other young men who may feel in despair.Markrsquos family is fully behind the initiative and other planned events which will go to support Ballynahinch Counselling Services and The Edge Youth and Community Centre.The gesture comes with the knowledge that Ballynahinch has one of the highest suicide rates in the district.World Suicide Prevention Day was marked yesterday and Department of Health officials announced plans to reduce suicide rates in Northern Ireland by % over the next five years.Speaking of behalf of her parents, Peg, and the late Hugh Quinn, and siblings Lynda, Michael, John, Patrick, Jarlath, David and Jemma, Markrsquos sister Katie Cassidy said they were ldquooverwhelmed to have been contacted during the summer holidays by Markrsquos school friends from the Red High.Katie said: ldquoTheir effort to keep Markrsquos memory alive while also raising awareness about mental health issues is more relevant now than ever.

Talking can make all the dference, we wish we knew then what we know now.ldquoThe pain and devastating reality of living without your son, brother, nephew or uncle truly causes physical pain. But there is also help in dealing with the loss of someone to suicide. In the early days after Markrsquos death when our faith was extremely tested, we received tremendous support from our parish community.Katie also asked for support for the upcoming football tournament at St Patrickrsquos Grammar next Saturday, September  and for Ballynahinch Olympicrsquos annual fundraising effort.She said: ldquoWe hope everyone will come along to the Red High next weekend to enjoy the football tournament. Itrsquos sure to be good day and all money raised will go to Ballynahinch counselling services and The Edge, as we feel that the Edge contributes enormously to the youth of our town.

He said: ldquoSo far the lads have raised over pound, with great support from past pupils, ex-teachers and of course Quinnyrsquos family.ldquoThese are dferent times now compared to . Mental health awareness is something that people are much more open about these days. It has a high profile in the media too which makes it easier for people to hold up their hands and admit that they are struggling with their own mental health.ldquoIn particular, young people feel a lot of pressure from unhealthy relationships with social media.ldquoBut still, suicide is still very high in Ballynahinch, Downpatrick and other parts of the county.

Although UK citizenship law, in the form of the British Nationality Act , is abundantly clear that persons born in the United Kingdomare automatically British citizens.Letter to the editorDe Souza – who, despite being born in the UK, claims she is not a UK citizen – has been attempting to argue that this is superseded by the Belfast Agreement. As a legal argument, this fails at the first hurdle, since international treaties require legislation to be given direct effect in law. .ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p #jp .main-content .ev-widget#sticky-footer .sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner p @media@media#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_text,#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_button #sticky-footer .fluid-container #sticky-footer .mobile-sticky-footer_button The Belfast Agreement was given legal effect by the Northern Ireland Act , which did not amend the  Act. The Home Office, therefore, had no option but to appeal a bizarre tribunal ruling that had previously found in favour of De Souza. On strictly legal grounds, therefore, De Souza is bound to fail, but we can be sure that her campaign, supported by Sinn Féin, will move beyond the courts and into the political arena. They will seek to have the  Act amended so as to remove automatic UK citizenship from people born in Northern Ireland. In doing this, it will be argued that the Belfast Agreement, which provides a ‘right’ to identy as Irish, British or both, requires UK citizenship to become merely an option. This is despite the very same provision of the Agreement referring also to a right to hold ‘both British and Irish citizenship’. The agreement, therefore, rightly distinguishes between identity and citizenship, affirming a right to acquire Irish citizenship in addition to British citizenship, but separate to how we might choose to identy. The De Souza case is based on the misunderstanding that identity and citizenship are the same, and that being a UK citizen prevents somebody from identying as ‘Irish only’. The implications of this are signicant: to accept such an interpretation would be to equate Irish identity to citizenship of the Republic of Ireland, implying that the many unionists who identy as Irish are not really Irish at all, unless they choose to become Irish citizens and to envisage a ided society in which one section of the community is encouraged to opt out of citizenship of the state in which they live.This campaign exposes an unspoken truth about nationalism: it has never honestly or genuinely accepted the implications of the agreement’s affirmation of Northern Ireland’s membership of the United Kingdom. They do not, therefore, accept that this means that UK citizenship is the default, or that the appropriate use of UK symbols is legitimate, but seek to change, restrict or undermine such basic manestations of sovereignty. Ben Lowry: DUP has put its faith in Boris Johnson, but he is losing control of events Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"As well as not understanding the terms of the agreement, neither do they understand its nature as, literally, an agreement with unionists. Unionists did not agree that UK citizenship law should be changed, and that is why the agreement does not say that it should be, and why the law was not changed. The Belfast Agreement is not a  for nationalists to undermine Northern Ireland’s place within the United Kingdom, but the ongoing failure of unionists to defend it in the face of the De Souza campaign , means they are currently pushing against an open door.J.

However, there has been no confirmation from the inquiry of when it expects the report to be complete and unofficial suggestions of ious publication dates have consistently proved to be incorrect.Ms Bradley said she was “satisfied that the response was swt and thorough.” She added: “Given the volume of evidence gathered it was always envisaged a reasonable amount of time would be required to produce a considered final report.“I trust that when launched the depth of content will justy the time and resource directed to this critical process.”DUP’s Brexit Backstop alternative: Sinn Fein

We canrsquot afford to push action further down the road all the time or expect others to be the ones to sort out this mess.ldquoWe want to see the Wales Pension Partnership, the Welsh Assembly, the Welsh Government and all other public body pension funds ditch fossil fuel investments and we will be keeping the pressure up until they do the right thing, both for the planet and for future generations here in Wales and around the world.Previous research by Friends of the Earth found that the eight local authority pension funds in Wales invested over poundbn between them in fossil fuel companies.Last year Monmouthshire Council was the first in Wales to vote to est its pension fund from fossil fuel companies. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Ms Parker and Mr Glover met several years ago when he trained her at their local gym. They then ended up unexpectedly working together later in le when Mr Glover changed jobs.Mr Glover said: ldquoIt was very tough for Julie before the transplant as she suffered with a genetic lung disease and her lungs slowly stopped working over a few years.\"It got to the point where she required an oxygen tank to be strapped to her back so that she could breathe. She never gave up and still worked and tried to do as much as she could and always kept a smile on her face.Ms Parker has a rare condition called Alpha--antitrypsin deficiency which means she lacks a protective enzyme inhibitor which makes her more vulnerable to smoke, dust and other toxic materials and increases the risk of lung disease. Because of the deficiency, Ms Parker was required to have a double lung transplant. Shortly after the transplant Ms Parker went to lunch with Mr Glover and he was amazed at how well she looked.He said: ldquoBecause I was seeing her every day, I knew her health was declining as a result of the lung disease. But I donrsquot think I was so aware of the extent until I saw her after the operation, and how healthy she looked.This isnrsquot the first challenge Mr Glover has taken on.In the past he has carried lbs up and down the highest mountain in Southern Britain, completed car dead lts and successfully performed  pull ups.The pair now plan to walk Pen-Y-Fan, the highest mountain in South Wales, together to raise money in the future once Ms Parker is well enough.Mr Glover set out to raise pound, and has now raised pound.Officially, Mr Glover had only  days to train for this challenge, enlisting friends to help him by sitting in the car and steering as he tows.ldquoI was getting up at :am to run around car parks towing the car with a harness before work,\" he said. \"I love setting myself challenges but donrsquot tend to do what everyone  does. So I will look for something a bit far out or invent my own and usually try and document them on video.All the proceeds from the day will go towards the charityrsquos Harefield Transplant Appeal, to raise funds for organ care systems to allow more patients to receive le-saving transplants.If yoursquod like to support Mr Glover in his marathon challenge his Justgiving page is: https:www.justgiving fundraising muscleworld article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Two-year-old Matilda Philpott who has Stickler Syndrome was joined by her two brothers, Oliva and Alfie, four-year-old Alice Haswell who has Goldenhar Syndrome camped out with her sister Scarlet, and -year-old Daisy Stacey who has Vacterl Association attended with her sister Molly.The weekend saw the families take part in a range of activities from archery, crafts and pop rockets to laser shooting, fire lighting, bush craft and raft making.The camp was the first time the referred children have been on a Scout Camp, something leaders have been hoping to achieve since the start of the group.Ruth Weltch, Group Scout Leader said: ldquoThe opportunity to regularly set up camp in the great outdoors is one of the main reasons young people enjoy Scouting so much and we wanted to give our children, who would not normally have the opportunity, the chance to take part in a weekend of outdoor activities and to sleep under canvas with their families.ldquoWe have been overwhelmed and humbled by the amount of help offered by leaders, not just from Cardf and Vale Scouts but from other scouting areas in Wales.This reflects the scope of the hospice itself which is open to all children with le limiting illnesses throughout Wales.ldquoWe have been able to give these children the opportunity to take part in activities not usually accessible to them and that we take for granted. It was an absolute joy to see them and their families take part in the weekendrsquos activities, seeing them smile and forget about their worries for a while was heart-warming.Lynne Phelps, from Ty Hafan, said: ldquoThe hard work, time and effort put in by the Scout Group since its inception has been truly amazing. The group has brought so much happiness to the hospice and given the children referred to us an opportunity to take part in activities with their families that they wouldnrsquot have had access toit wasnrsquot for Scouts.ldquoThe group has had a really positive impact not just on the children in our care, but also their families and our staff. We really canrsquot thank the Ty Hafan Scout Group enough.The Ty Hafan Scout Group was set up on the Scouting Centenary in  for any child referred to the hospice along with their siblings, parents and family, to spend time together having fun and making memories.A growing need for sibling involvement was soon recognised and so the group began to run regular sibling camps.The sibling camps have given the young people who have brothers and sisters in the care of the hospice the opportunity to attend events such as Scarefest and the Jurassic International Jamboree, as well as the chance to spend quality family time with their loved ones.ScoutsCymru gives over , young people in Wales the opportunity to enjoy fun and adventure while developing the skills they need to succeed, now and in the future.Open to all young people in Wales regardless of faith, gender, sexual orientation, race or social background, the movement encourages its members to do more, learn more and be more. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

I gave her a shot of adrenaline and it didn’t really do anything.“Then I gave her a second adrenaline pen and it seemed to work until the ambulance arrived.“She required two more in the ambulance but from what I’ve heard she seems to be good now, thank God.“I’m also trained as a doctor so I think that certainly helped.”He added: “It’s not the sort of thing you expect to see and I’m glad I was able to help.”Emmett, whose long term ambition is to work in anaesthesia, has been in touch with the lady’s family who expressed their gratitude for his lesaving actions: “Her daughter contacted me and said she couldn’t thank me enough.”Emmett’s family back in Lurgan have expressed their pride in the young doctor’s heroic actions.His aunt Margaret McManus said: “We are very proud of him. He lost his twin brother, Finbar, three years ago and he has worked so hard. His mum dad and granny Eilish and sister Emma are so proud of him.”Emmett said: “My family has been through a tough time, I lost my brother when I was studying for my medical degree, I couldn’t focus on my exams. I know mum and dad were glad to see me get through it.”\"  \"  Malcolm McKeown Murder: Police release C.C.T.V. footage of car used by gunmanTop teacher warns on mental health time bomb over autism

Several motorists were warned about their speed but the sad thing was that two motorists received Fixed Penalty Notices for speeding.“On top of this one motorist obviously didn’t see us driving behind him when he decided to lt his mobile and start chatting to a friend instead of concentrating on the road. As a result this motorist also received a Fixed Penalty Notice for his misjudged action.“I would prefer to inform you that we had a successful day and caught nobody as it truly saddens me to issue these fixed penalty notices but some people just will not learn.“What I also noticed today was that not one person waved to us.

We speak to founder Daniel Crawford and his team about the journey so far A spark in the mind of Daniel Crawford as he studied for his masters degree in Glasgow just a few years ago has grown into a business at the sharp end of technology. axialD is tasked with turning the complicated and laborious process of converting D medical scans into D models – and producing them for use by surgeons and medical professionals. It’s an ever-growing business, spun out of Ulster University, which is expanding its reach across the UK, Ireland and now into the US where it’s targeting a burgeoning fresh marketplace. The company has been involved with Catalyst since , been directly involved with a host of its programmes, and is participating in the EU INTERREG funded North West Centre for Advanced Manufacturing , managed by the Special European Union Programmes Body . Catalyst is Northern Ireland’s leading technology hub, home to  companies and around , staff. Daniel has a strong team around him – growing to  staff based in Belfast city centre, including Niall Haslam, chief technology officer, Katie McKinley, head of new business and strategic partnerships and Cathy Coomber as operations manager. While studying medical visualisation and human anatomy in Glasgow, Daniel was exposed to the raft of imaging available – including CT, MRI and ultrasound, and began examining how the crucial data could be better used. The biomedical physics undergraduate grew the idea into his thesis – looking at converting D data sets and converting them into fully D printable files. “That allows us to turn images into D models to allow surgeons or registrars, to understand digital pathologies, before going in to theatre,” he said. “But we discovered it wasn’t just good for that and surgeons also wanted to get their hands on the D models.” That gave Daniel greater scope for developing the concept. In one early case, a surgeon was able to use one of the D prints to identy small fractures in a patient who had suffered a motorcycle crash, that weren’t initially apparent using more traditional methods. The company was thrust into Catalyst’s Springboard programme in  – a  week scheme which allowed a would-be entrepreneur, fresh out of university, access to business training and development, which included working with PathXL’s Stuart Harvey. From there, it was into the Halo programme – bringing axialD together with angel investors in order to get the start-up off the ground. It landed £, through Techstart and private investors, which allowed the company to get the ball rolling. Through Catalyst, Daniel also got the opportunity to visit MIT and the entrepreneurial development programme, Way to Scale, bringing axialD to Massachusetts and the Boston area – the global heart of the health technology sector. Niall Haslam is axialD’s chief technical officer. He said a Belfast and Boston partnership has helped strengthen the links between the cities, bringing firms from Northern Ireland to the US for both networking and scoping out the potential for setting up shop across the Atlantic. “The Way to Scale program brings entrepreneurs together. It’s a great networking opportunity,” Niall says. axialD is now a partner in the EU INTERREG-funded NW CAM, which brings together a network of research institutes, universities and enterprises to carry out research in advanced manufacturing. It is working with Ulster University on a number of projects, including looking at developing custom designed jigs for hospitals to produce D models. Cathy Coomber has been with axialD for three years. “What we have done in that time is looking at standardising the processes,” she says. “Biomedical engineers from Ulster University and those across the UK are producing data, manually segmenting thousands of medical images in order to help them develop an algorithm. “That allows us to massively improve our standardised process and reduce the time involved in producing those files.” That could mean reducing the time down from up to five hours, to as little as an hour. “When the company started, Daniel was able to get those early users excited in Glasgow, and then setting up in Belfast there were key surgeons which helped set the pace,” Katie McKinley, head of new business and strategic partnerships said. The company has since been involved with NHS frameworks as a means to help remove as many bottlenecks as possible. This involves developing and marketing the products to the NHS and HSC in the Republic – helping them to learn about the product, the process and what area of specialism it can be used in. “In the last  months with the development of the algorithms, we are moving in to the US,” Katie said. “We’re seeing a lot of growth in the US.” And the axialD team is also growing fast. “We have  staff at the moment but are looking to expand in  months,” Daniel said. “That includes new staff in the US to help grow and manage that market as we further expand our software team back home.” The success of axialD mirrors the overall success of Catalyst, since its inception  years ago. It’s an independent not-for-profit organisation across its four sites – including its largest base at the Titanic Quarter in Belfast, alongside its Londonderry hub, Ballymena, along with the Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub at Danske Bank in Belfast city centre.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/jm_1.jpg","title":"how do you retain staff and keep them enjoying their job","story":"Posted on Wednesday September  by Ulster Business With such intense competition for talent, the challenge for employers isn’t just finding prospective candidates, it’s also keeping them, writes John Moore, managing director of Hays NI Astonishingly, almost half of professionals surveyed in the Hays What Workers Want Report said that they left at least one new job within the first  months because it didn’t match expectations formed during the application process. A signicant number of our employees at Hays have been with us for , ,  and even  years, and we pride ourselves on growing our own talent and promoting from within. Although there are times when employees leave due to circumstances employers can’t control, organisations can create the right conditions to retain their staff for as long as possible. We believe there are three key areas. A sense of purpose Across ages, cultures and sectors, professionals need to get up in the morning knowing that they can make a dference. No matter how big or small, recognising a clear and meaningful purpose in your role is a huge driver for staff. Communication is key for employers. By prioritising employee progression, offering regular feedback and communicating the wider objectives of the business, employers can ensure their staff come to work each day with a strong purpose. Variety each day While not every task can be exciting, and some parts of a job will inevitably be more stimulating than others,the mundane becomes the usual, employees will think about moving on. Injecting iety into each week and staying interested at work partly falls on employees themselves, who can proactively seize opportunities. But a good employer should also push their staff and encourage them to work outside of their comfort zones. This ensures professionals can keep growing and developing within an organisation rather than move where. A strong network The people we work with have a huge bearing on our happiness levels at work. You simply can’t stay in a role long-termyou don’t enjoy working with those around you, so the importance and impact of these relationships are not to be underrated. Employers can help their staff develop a network of inspiring and admirable colleagues from their first day by making sure they receive proper introductions and support contacts. Workers who have these strong bonds feel a greater sense of belonging which keeps them wanting to work in their organisation. With these three points in mind, it’s important to consider how someone’s organisation and role makes them feel, rather than just how impactful their salary or bonus might be. After all, this is what can’t easily be replicated across organisations and can keep an employee with an organisation throughout their career.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"new  bedroom boutique hotel planned for belfast","story":"Posted on Wednesday September  by John Mulgrew A listed Belfast building could become a new hotel and restaurant as part of wider plans for a £m revamp of the city centre. Tribeca Belfast, formerly Royal Exchange, will see UK developer Castlebrooke redevelop much of the north side of the city centre. It’s made a number of amendments and changes to the development, most notably revising back from a formerly retail-led scheme to one with fewer shops. As part of the revised plans it wants to turn the listed former Assembly Rooms building at the corner of North Street and Waring Street into a new -bedroom hotel, with a restaurant and bars. That would involve knocking down part of the newer extension to the building, including the rear part of the former Northern Bank and the adjacent - North Street to “accommodate the new extension to form the proposed boutique hotel”. “The proposals for the existing building are similar in scope to that which was included as part of the extant approval. It is proposed to conservatively repair the existing historic fabric of the former Northern Bank,” a design statement says. “A key feature of the proposed extension is that the interface with the rearelevation of the existing listed bank building will be improved by setting back the footprint of the proposed extension so that the north west corner of the original building is readable.” The scheme includes the re-use and adaptation of the existing building as well as an extension on the footprint of the existing s extension on North Street. The extension will be set over five floors, with a rooftop bar, while upper floors are set back with metal cladding to the facades to “reduce the overall massing of the building and reflect the roofing materials or upper story treatment of surrounding buildings”. Tribeca Belfast includes development around Royal Avenue, Donegall Street, North Street, Garfield Street and High Street. Castlebrooke Investments says it is now committed to bringing North Street Arcade back into use in a new format, with space designed for independent retailers. This summer the developer ran a fresh public consultation amid revised plans for the scheme, which included signicantly reducing a huge -storey building to around , retaining additional facades and dropping plans for an underground car park.

Before starting as a trainee solicitor in a City of London firm, I initially worked as a paralegal for three months in a law firm in Perth, enjoying the lestyle and dferent culture of le in Australia, and then spent a further three months travelling in Australia, New Zealand and Asia. After ing to London, I qualied as a solicitor and then spent eight years working in the real estate department of a London law firm. With two young children, we decided to move back to Northern Ireland in  when I joined Cleaver Fulton Rankin as an assistant solicitor. I have been here ever since and was made a director in . What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far  As we will all be aware, the real estate market can be a bit of a rollercoaster. Having been involved in some fantastic deals here in Northern Ireland, largely courtesy of the peace idend, this all came crashing to a halt in . For real estate lawyers in particular, this presented a fresh challenge in terms of expanding client base and ensuring that our teams were kept busy. For a number of years I spent more time advising clients on restructuring, acting for administrators or receivers in selling off assets and working on refinancing transactions. This proved to be a huge contrast to the positive and very visible growth in the economy seen in the previous years. Thankfully, the real estate sector again currently seems to be enjoying good growth with high rates offor investors. However, it has to be said that the lack of political leadership here does still give cause for concern. How would you describe your management style  The most important resource that we have is our young people, so I hopefully lead by example and seek to encourage them. In my view the carrot is always better than the stick. What would you changeyou could go back and do it all again  I have spent over  years now practising law, butI could go back to university again, rather than doing a law degree, I would have studied history. It would have meant an extra year spent in training, but I think it may have kept my interest slightly more than lectures on tort and equity. Have you done it all on your own  No, absolutely not. One of the main reasons for coming back to Northern Ireland was, with a young family, we had the benefit here of family support. My parents in particular, played a key role in helping with child care at a time when I was trying to establish my career. I never underestimate the dficulties facing working parents with young children who deserve all the credit and support that they can get. A strong support network is also very important in the office and I am lucky to have the benefit of some great lawyers around me to whom I can turn to for help when needed. How would you like your business to be remembered  As a leading commercial law firm in Northern Ireland that is independent and innovative provides high quality legal advice to its clients conducts business in a socially responsible and ethical matter has a strong commercial awareness and specialist legal professionals.

Founder and managing director David Whelan speaks to Ulster Business about a business which boasts the right tools for the job David Whelan’s vision and mantra for what is now one of the leading telecoms businesses is clear – telecommunications services are only as good as the foundations on which they are built, with engineering front and centre. He’s the entrepreneur behind Clarity Telecom – a successful Belfast-based full-service telecommunications solutions company with almost  years under its belt, helping develop top-end connectivity – including lines, calls, mobile, broadband and cloud software – for businesses across Ireland and the UK. And for David, telecoms is all about engineering at the core of finding the best comprehensive solution to its customers, having the right tools for the job, and having world class people. For Clarity Telecom, it’s about developing a bespoke system for companies, focusing on engineering from day one. Since its inception in , Clarity Telecom has grown to have a greater engineering capability than any other independent telecommunications company in Northern Ireland, and is now rolling out its leading byphone VoIPsystem throughout the UK and Ireland. David also says through Clarity Telecom and its burgeoning byphone technology, the company could double revenues in the next three years as well as growing its workforce. “The phone network stops at a plug in the wall and from that point on, you have to provide the infrastructure and management,” David says. “What we do is focus on the engineering. It’s all about how well it works and adapts to your business. “By focusing on that we are looking at the way things are being built, and we can then get insights on how we can change and improve things.” Led by engineering, the Clarity team is driving change within the telecoms industry ensuring client infrastructure is fit for purpose and for the future. That starts with assessing a business’s needs, making sure the network is suitable, reviewing the workforce needs and bandwidth requirements. From there, Clarity Telecom can develop a bespoke solution – from cabling, to switching, cloud services, routing and phone systems. Clarity Telecom now has a team of  staff – a third of whom work directly within the engineering side of the business. But that number could grow further still, as the company expands its business across Northern Ireland, and develops its byphone technology. The company developed its subsidiary, Voxbit, in  – specically to design engineering solutions. And through that has come one of its most successful products, byphone. A simple to use VoIP , byphone is a drag and drop system that allows users to configure their own phone set up suited to the exact needs of the organisation and enables a range of analysis tools that can help business owners drive up efficiencies. “In  as VoIP started coming along, I realised that was a signicant opportunity,” David says. “Where the communications industry is going is into the cloud. It’s going from traditional storage within buildings, into something in the cloud. The traditional telephone systems are evolving. “We started making a series of innovations surrounding cloud technology. We realised you can make it simpler – we were asking ourselves, can you make it work without a manual, for example. “If you can, in the same way as Apple’s iPhone made things easier for users, people will start using the services. It’s about making everyone’s le easier. “The end user wants to be able to use the system easily, from managing their telephone number, to having access to voicemail. It’s about the ‘power of simple’. “We now have around  resellers for the byphone system in the UK, and we are looking at trebling or quadrupling those sales,” he said. One of Clarity Telecom’s customers is Mid  East Antrim Borough Council. The firm was tasked with bringing together the complex communication needs of the new ‘super council’ following the amalgamation in . “With bringing three councils together, one of the main problems was having a single phone number that people could call. If you have numerous sites, spread across three council areas, that would involve a lot of rip and replace,” David says. “But we gave them one telephone number and then managed the routing to all those bits of equipment across the council areas.” Hotel giant Andras House – which operates seven hotels and , rooms in Belfast including the Crowne Plaza at Shaw’s Bridge and the new Hampton Hilton – is also another major customer. “Businesses trust us to be able to provide the engineering solutions in order for them to run their companies,” David says. So, why should a business consider Clarity Telecom for its crucial and comprehensive connectivity needs  David says Clarity is all about improving how companies interact with their customers – making it easier, and thus, improving revenue and sales. “As you manage your telephone connections you become better at dealing with your customers – you become more efficient at dealing with them, and they will have a better experience. It’s about improving customer contact. “As a business you are able to do a lot more, such as listening to call recordings, access to statistics and using data which will help manage that contact, as well as saving on costs and making your business more efficient. “What solution depends on your business. That is where we come along. We never put a system in without doing a full engineering visit.” Some of the connectivity includes the ability to connect landline with mobile phones, call forwarding and being able to access voicemails as digital recordings, by phone or computer. “When companies deal with us, they can come along and say ‘this is what we are trying to do’, and we are able to work the engineering and infrastructure, before then providing the services,” David says. “It’s also about fighting against the view that it’s all about price. Yes, you have to be competitive, but you need the right infrastructure. For example,a shop loses connectivity for two days, then they lose two days of sales, simply because they don’t have the back-up for the credit card payment system. “It’s about getting businesses to think about the infrastructure and all of the issues. It’s not just about how cheap you can make a call. It’s about how customers can engage with your business – and we are at the heart of making that happen.” For further information, contact Clarity Telecom on    or visit www.clarityteleView all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/greggssss.jpg","title":"greggs to open new belfast city centre store","story":"Posted on Tuesday  September  by John Mulgrew Greggs looks set to open a new store in the heart of Belfast city centre, it can be revealed.

We want a reboot of the economic policy of Northern Ireland, in order to benefit our economy and safeguard our growing business community.” “We need to be bold and ambitious about creating % or even % growth over the next few years, but that requires decision makers to be pressed into action and a series of policy and legislative decisions to be taken and driven through. Our local economy and businesses have taken a back seat and we simply cannot afford that situation any longer.” “Our Vision  document sets out a bold new ten-year plan for creating , new jobs and creating a high growth economy.
