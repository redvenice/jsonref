[{"url":null,"title":"Elderly Britons REFUSING Pfizers vaccine theyd wait English one","story":"Share this article   (I should acknowledge that yesterday the EU did approve another vaccine, manufactured by Moderna, on which Britain has yet to sign off.)Though the EU has now signed contracts to buy six different vaccines, its regulators have approved just two.This terrible stasis will prove fatal — in every sense — for the EU’s population: time is running out for its healthcare systems as new and more infectious variants of the virus take hold.Amid this chaos, it’s perhaps no surprise that some European lawmakers are desperately trying to shift the blame. Disgracefully, Belgium’s deputy prime minister, Petra De Sutter, accused other countries of using sub-standard vaccines.‘The UK and Israel, as well as Russia and China, are vaccinating people with vaccines that are not of the same standard as the ones we use,’ she said this week.Yes, the U.S. and the UK gained a head start by invoking emergency powers that mean drug manufacturers are less exposed should problems with a vaccine later surface.But that is the kind of rapid, vital and timely decision a sovereign country can make in a crisis.It is impossible to make the same decision when you have 27 countries arguing with one another, all overseen by a remote and unaccountable bureaucracy in Brussels.So what conclusions can we draw? First, nation states are far more effective in a crisis than unwieldy groupings of different countries.But the most bitter irony for Europe is that the one foreign politician our liberal commentariat have most mocked for years — Boris Johnson — is also the one who acted swiftly and decisively when it came to securing the vaccines. The number of doses you have speaks for itself.And it was the ‘sensible’ federalist Europeans who have failed so miserably.Anyone who still doubts the wisdom of Brexit needs only to look at the vaccine chaos unfolding across the Channel — and think again.Council leader \u0027appalled\u0027 at Covid vaccine appointments being missed in Notts - Nottinghamshire LiveNottinghamshire Live - Latest local news, sport \u0026amp business from Nottingham"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/20/12/4D71320D00000578-5865013-image-a-11_1529494434938.jpg","title":"Democrats demand know rioters easily able storm Capitol","story":"Share this articleOne Capitol Police officer – his badge clearly visible – posed for a selfie with a rioter who smiled broadly as he took the image.

How it happened, I can’t figure that out’.Security experts said that the police had completely underestimated the size of the crowd and their intentions. Many of the officers who were guarding the Capitol were not even dressed in riot gear and were wearing street clothes.The treatment was a stark contrast to the thousands of officers deployed to Washington last June for a protest over the death of George Floyd.A photograph from the Lincoln Memorial shows armed law enforcement agents standing 6ft apart for what was an overwhelmingly peaceful protest.

I do not think this is a cynical view, it is already happening.”He warned that farmers must continue to be paid for producing food, as well as protecting the countryside. “We do not believe that food production can simply be left to the market. We are very concerned that cheap imported food may threaten British farming and argued for legal protections against that – protections which were refused by the UK government.”Farming is a devolved issue, so the administrations are in charge of large areas of farming policy, but the subsidies under the EU’s common agricultural policy were handled by central government, which is also responsible for replacing that support after Brexit.George Eustice, the secretary of state for environment, food and rural affairs, insisted that farmers would benefit from Brexit, including through plans to allow the gene editing of crops and livestock. “If we are to deliver the ambitions we have for the environment and make space for nature, then we must rebalance the incentives in our future agriculture policy to encourage sustainability,” he said.Ewing said Scotland needed a different solution – more people. “We have no plans whatsoever to introduce new species such as the wolverine. I want to see repeopling of rural Scotland – we want to bring people back into the equation. Most of Scotland is rural and sparsely populated,” he said.There was a mixed reception for Eustice’s plans for gene editing. While many farmers welcome the steps, there were concerns over how it could affect trade with the EU. Ewing pointed out that the EU was itself re-evaluating the potential of gene editing, and could change its stance within the next few months to allow such techniques.Eustice responded: “We do not have to be hanging on the coat tails of Brussels, and see what they do first. Once we remove EU politics, we can run the system better.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0047fe01ae857eb2e3a9e45f36cb6a15398fb45d/0_0_6016_4016/master/6016.jpg?width=720\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=63c025bd2cd0a3a589d0bc10a1f5b5de 1440w","title":"west ham sell sebastien haller to ajax at 25m loss","story":"Sébastien Haller has completed his move to Ajax from West Ham, who have accepted £20m for a striker who cost them a record £45m in 2019.The funds from the 26-year-old’s sale will be made available to strengthen David Moyes’s squad.

But these are unusual times.Naomi Russell has transformed her multimillion-pound home overlooking Hampstead Heath, north London, into a food bank distribution centre, helping hundreds of people struggling to feed their families during the coronavirus pandemic.A pink gazebo dominates Russell’s driveway and acts as a drop-off point for donations. Her car and her husband’s have been shunted out of the double garage to make way for hundreds of boxes storing everything from pasta and fresh fruit to chocolate and exotic spices. And, most importantly, Russell says, box upon box of toiletries, loo roll, nappies and baby milk formula.“It’s not what people expect to encounter around here, that’s true,” Russell said of her makeshift food warehouse on Millfield Lane that winds its way from Highgate West Hill towards the wild swimming ponds on the heath.“Because of where we are right by the heath, we sometimes have 100-200 people a day spotting us and coming in here to see what’s going on. No one expects to find a food bank distribution centre here.”Russell said she decided to do something to help people struggling with the fallout of the pandemic early on in the crisis. “It was terrible to see what was happening, and the lack of government support. We had to do something,” she said.“Hundreds of people were suddenly out of work, and literally couldn’t put food on the table. People who would have had a salary, now have nothing, and have to wait six weeks to get into the benefit system.”The heavy footfall of walkers passing Russell’s home has been ideal for recruiting volunteers to help with collecting, organising and delivering supplies to 15 nearby food banks.“I’ve met all my neighbours now, right up down and round the street. Many of them are helping out,” Russell said. “And then there are all the walkers and joggers out on the heath. People will see us working, and wonder – like you did – what’s going on here? They come over and have chat, they are very surprised that this a food bank donation spot. They don’t think of that sort of thing happening here.“They will see me working and ask about the house. They are often very shocked. I don’t think they expect the person who owns this house to be working in a food bank.”Russell said during the first lockdown she would see a jogger at precisely 07:30 every day, and sometimes again at 19:30 when he would head out on a then-rule-breaking second jog. “After a few weeks he stopped and asked, ‘What are you doing out here all day?’. I told him, and now he is one of most dedicated volunteers.”Russell is not alone in turning her home into a food bank collection point. She formed Food Bank Aid, which supplies food and essential items to food banks across north London, with Jo Rosenblatt. A dozen other homes in the area also act as drop-off points.Similar grassroots charitable ventures have formed across the country. But Russell’s stands out as unique because of its position on a street where homes change hands for more than £6m.Emma Revie, the chief executive of the trust, said: “Throughout 2020, communities across the country have stepped in to provide vital support to people left without enough money.“Volunteers in food banks have been working hard under extremely difficult circumstances to make sure support is there for people struggling to afford essentials. But it’s not right that any of us are forced to a charity for food, at any time of year.Russell and Rosenblatt said they had at times been overwhelmed by the generosity of people donating supplies, particularly during the October half-term when the government had refused to provide free holiday lunches despite a high-profile campaign by the England footballer Marcus Rashford.“During the Marcus Rashford period it went absolutely insane,” Russell said. “We got more than double we usually did. In fact there was a day when I actually had to say to people can you keep it and bring stuff in the next few weeks instead. We had queues of cars waiting to drop stuff off.”They said many people would do two weekly shops at the supermarket – one for their own household and one to donate to the food bank. Others order groceries online to be delivered directly to Russell’s home. “One Ocado man said it was the biggest order he had ever delivered,” Russell said. “It was half of his entire truck.”The Ocado driver was so struck by Russell’s work that he also volunteers doing deliveries for the food bank in his spare time.One of the centres supplied by Russell and Rosenblatt is Finchley food bank, three miles to the north. Anna Maughan, who runs it, said the service was supplying more than double the number of households it was catering to before the pandemic.“We’ve never been so busy,” Maughan said. “We started with a handful of households, but it just grew and grew and now we regularly support 50 households.” During the summer, 110 households queued for supplies.“There has been a huge rise in people who are desperate for support. It is people on zero-contract-type hours, the people who were just getting by prior to the pandemic and are no longer getting by not getting by at all,” she said.“It’s anyone that didn’t have a buffer. Some of them are people that would never have expected to come to a food bank, but now have no choice. We have also seen big rise in people seeking support who have entered a refuge.”The food banks said they had received enough items to support families over Christmas, the time of year when people were most generous in providing donations. But they fear supplies could now run low, when donations dwindle as many people discover the size of their Christmas credit card bill."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fc2e19c3e5c27d2fc3fbe72dd0b8dabc97c88c4c/0_268_4032_2419/master/4032.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=e043d9351b54de0a496af5c4338db624","title":"steve smith century cant keep india down as third test hangs in balance","story":"Steve Smith’s first Test century on home soil in three years has the third Test hanging in the balance, with India 96-2 after day two in reply to Australia’s 338.With the four-match series tied at 1-1, Smith watched wickets tumble around him as he broke his century drought with an almost chanceless 131 at the SCG.Pat Cummins then bowled superbly late to finish with 1-19, regularly beating the outside edge in his 12 overs as Cheteshwar Pujara and Ajinkya Rahane battled to stumps. The Australia quick removed Shubman Gill at gully for 50, just as the classy young opener looked set to put India in the box seat as he pounced on anything short.Josh Hazlewood (1-23) claimed the other scalp of the afternoon, taking a low caught and-bowled chance to remove Rohit Sharma for 26. Pujara was lucky to survive an lbw review on three when he padded up to Nathan Lyon, as India scored just 12 runs from the final 15 overs of the day.But Friday belonged to Smith, whose century marked his first Test ton in Australia since the ball-tampering scandal and his first anywhere in 16 months. The former captain celebrated his 27th hundred in passionate style, twice thrusting his bat in the air in a mix of relief and jubilation.Smith made a point of playing more positively after being dismissed cheaply in the first two Tests, driving gloriously down the ground throughout his knock. The 31-year-old then took that to extremes late, with his last 27 runs coming from 14 balls before a superb Ravindra Jadeja direct hit ran him out and ended Australia’s innings.Smith’s century went some way toward fixing Australia’s batting woes against the tourists. In his absence two summers ago, not one Australian passed 100 in the historic 2-1 home series loss to India.His triple figures on Friday helped them to their biggest score of the summer so far, as the hosts went past 200 for the first time this series. But coach Justin Langer will still feel frustrated as no batsmen below him could stick around long as Jadeja claimed 4-62 and Jasprit Bumrah 2-66.Australia were at one stage 2-206 off the back of debutant Will Pucovski’s 62 when Marnus Labuschagne was caught at first slip on 91. Labuschagne barely looked troubled before Jadeja got his edge, bringing to an end a 100-run stand with Smith.It kickstarted a collapse of five wickets for 72 runs, which included a loose shot from Matt Wade on 13 when he jumped down the deck to Jadeja and got a leading edge. Cameron Green (0) and Tim Paine (1) both fell to Bumrah inswingers, before Cummins was also bowled for Jadeja for a duck.A win for India in Sydney would be enough for them to retain the Border-Gavaskar Trophy."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fa51442b3d66d06fa88e0e7d0496e50dd7938be0/0_300_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=b0e9810638ac2f5b4bfd5aae95355b26","title":"cake decorating quizzes and remote lunches keeping staff connected in the remote work era","story":"We can’t meet for a chat by the coffee machine right now, so how are firms keeping spirits high? With creative and fun virtual activities, it seemsNurturing a sense of shared purpose with work colleagues is challenging in these days of remote work and video meetings. Gone are post-work pints, sandwich-queue chats, tasting your colleague’s “cake-off” creation, and anything else resembling physical proximity and connection to your team. But with a little ingenuity – and a tolerance for 2D socialising – it’s still possible to keep spirits high and have fun.From virtual magicians and online games to judging cakes purely on how delicious they look on Zoom, employees are finding new ways to bond with colleagues – remotely. Events such as quizzes and lunchtime yoga may even have become more popular now that people can log on from home rather than having to stay late at the office or endure a lunch-hour sweat.Jade Emmons, a London-based communications manager for Degreed, a US education technology company, spent part of Halloween in fancy dress, running around her home seeking random items of clothing and a pumpkin as part of a competitive scavenger hunt. That was one of several online games held during her company’s virtual party.Other companies have been equally imaginative. One media organisation replaced its summer party with a global rendition of A Midsummer Night’s Dream, in which correspondents from around the world took on some of Shakespeare’s most popular roles.Meanwhile, at Kindred, a PR firm, winning the 2020 baking competition hinges on how well you can pipe icing rather than perfect the best rise, as in previous years. Each participant received a Betty Crocker cake mix, so the real challenge was the decoration. A Chris Whitty cake – very 2020 – dreamed up by associate director Beccie Stevenson, made it to the final round. “You can’t taste it so it’s all down to the aesthetic,” she says.Stevenson is also a fan of a monthly initiative called Change Maker that gets people to nominate a colleague of the month. Her last pick was Emma Parrish, who won in October for the effort she put into suggesting books, podcasts and music to celebrate Black History Month. “She tackled quite difficult conversations, head on,” says Stevenson. Each winner gets to virtually spin a wheel to win a prize, which ranges from an alarm clock to a pair of sheepskin slippers.Nick Winham, whose job is overseeing a programme to recruit and train the next generation of talent for the software provider ServiceNow, is one of the California-based company’s culture champions, helping to run initiatives to keep its dispersed workforce feeling connected. He says the shift to remote working has resulted in many more people taking part in events such as quizzes. “When we did them at the office, we’d only get 15 people at most,” he says. “Doing them virtually, we’re getting 40 to 50. Other colleagues join in with their families.” Virtual yoga and meditation sessions are also proving to be much more popular than the real-life versions ever were.For companies keen to introduce their own programmes, Winham’s tips include blocking off time during the working day for non-work sessions. His quizzes, for instance, are at 4pm on Thursdays, with a takeaway pizza prize for the winner. “It gets very competitive,” he says.A “step-up” challenge earlier this summer, where ServiceNow colleagues formed teams to record their daily step counts, proved popular thanks to a novel twist that saw two executive directors volunteer to do something different with their hair depending on how much money was raised during the week-long challenge. “That created engagement,” Winham says. “Step-up September” developed as a result, with teams from across Europe.Other activities encourage people to chat openly about the challenges of working from home, with some offering coping tips. “The main advice has been to take a break,” Winham says, adding that he went for a walk before talking to me.London-based LocalGlobe, which invests in startup tech companies, hosts virtual “lunch and learn sessions” with guests as erse as the founder of the small business supporter Funding Circle and a representative of the anti-poverty group Camden Giving. Emma Phillips, a partner at LocalGlobe, says she wants to do all she can to keep employees engaged and connected. “At the moment people are feeling more cut off and isolated than ever, and there is concern that once we’ve defeated Covid-19, we’ll have an even worse mental health pandemic on our hands.”Often the simplest ideas can help compensate for the lack of in-person interaction. Online channels dedicated to different interests, from cats to physical fitness, work well at Degreed, says Emmons, although she steers clear of the HIIT workout and body-building chat. “Our London office manager has a virtual running club that she’s tried to convince me to join, but I’ve managed to dodge it so far!”ServiceNow gives you the power to make work, work better – no matter the circumstances.

You are not the president or the vice-president’s lawyer,” Biden said in remarks from Wilmington, Delaware, that started by denouncing the violence that marked “one of the darkest days in the history of our nation”.“Your loyalty is not to me. It’s to the law, to the constitution to the people of this nation.”The president-elect called Garland, a judge on the US court of appeals for the District of Columbia circuit, “one of the most respected jurists of our time”. He would be, Biden continued, an impartial administrator of justice and not the “personal attorney to the president” and, alongside his other nominees to lead the department, would restore Americans’ faith in the rule of law and seek to build a more equitable system of justice.In his remarks, Garland cited the founding ethos of the department – equal justice under the law – and stressed his commitment to restoring integrity and morale after a tumultuous four years of intense politicization under the Trump administration.“As everyone who watched yesterday’s events in Washington now understands, if they did not understand before, the rule of law is not just some lawyer’s turn of phrase,” Garland said. “It is the very foundation of our democracy. The essence of the rule of law is that like cases are treated alike.”Choosing a judge to fill the role of attorney general is unusual, and perhaps reflects Biden’s shifting political fortunes in recent days. On Tuesday, Democrats won a pair of runoffs in Georgia, giving Democrats control of the Senate, with Kamala Harris serving as the tie-breaking vote. With their slim majority, Democratic senators could overcome any potential opposition by Republicans to his nominee to replace Garland on the DC circuit court.Garland was nominated by Barack Obama to fill the supreme court vacancy left by the death of Antonin Scalia in February 2016. In an unprecedented move, the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, refused to consider Garland’s nomination, pointing to the proximity of the November presidential election to argue that voters should decide who fills the seat.Nearly five years later, Senate Republicans will have to consider his nomination, albeit for a remarkably different role. Like Obama, Biden is depending on Garland’s reputation as a moderate and affable appellate judge to ensure his confirmation. In his remarks, Biden predicted Garland would be confirmed with bipartisan support based on his conversations with senators.As attorney general, Garland would face weighty decisions over whether to pursue investigations into Trump, former and current members of his administration and his associates that some Democrats are demanding. Biden has made clear he is reluctant to prosecute a former president.In the aftermath of Wednesday’s riots, the US attorney in Washington, Michael Sherwin, said on Thursday that the justice department would not rule out pursuing charges against Trump for his possible role in inciting violence by telling his supporters they could never “take back our country with weakness” and encouraging them to march on the Capitol just before they stormed the building.The justice department has a decades-old policy that a sitting president cannot be indicted, though Trump’s term ends on 20 January. Trump has reportedly discussed the possibility of pardoning himself in the final days of his presidency, according to a report in the New York Times.During his appearance, Biden refused to comment on growing calls for Trump to be removed from office after the occupation of the US Capitol by rioters loyal to the president. “Our president is not above the law,” Biden, who will be sworn in as president in less than two weeks, said during his remarks on Thursday.Garland may also face questions about how he will handle the tax investigation of Biden’s son Hunter being conducted by the US attorney in Delaware. Republicans, still furious over the department’s special counsel investigation into ties between Trump’s 2016 campaign and Russia, have demanded the appointment of a special prosecutor to investigate the matter.Democrats roundly praised the nomination of Garland. But Biden, who vowed to assemble the most erse cabinet in American history, had faced calls from advocates to name a Black or Latino attorney general with a background in civil rights. Biden on Thursday also named his picks for a slate of other top justice department officials: Lisa Monaco, a former homeland security adviser to Obama, as deputy attorney general Vanita Gupta, the head of department’s civil rights ision under Obama, as the associate attorney general and Kristen Clarke, a civil rights lawyer, as assistant attorney general for civil rights at the department."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a69d20a920b0b059c1bcc86af9a51cc05025c12b/0_0_7068_4241/master/7068.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=d21a1d63bc79ae02c3e0aff7fac33ea2","title":"hancock hails oxford covid vaccine london surgery yet receive any doses","story":"Health secretary’s visit to London GP practice highlights early problems with rollout of jabs by manufacturersProblems with the coronavirus vaccine rollout to GPs were laid bare after it emerged that a surgery visited by Matt Hancock to promote the OxfordAstraZeneca jab had not yet received any supplies when the health secretary was there.On Thursday morning Hancock said doses of the vaccine were being supplied to GP practices across the country as he visited the Bloomsbury surgery in central London. However, he conceded the “rate-limiting” factor in efforts to get people vaccinated was supply from the manufacturers.Standing in front of Dr Ammara Hughes’s surgery, the health secretary said: “It’s great news this morning that the OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine is from right now being rolled out to GP surgeries across the country.“For the first three days with the Oxford vaccine, we did it in hospitals to check that it was working well, and it’s working well so now we can make sure that it gets to all those GP surgeries that like this one can do all the vaccinations that are needed.“The rate-limiting step is the supply of vaccine. We’re working with the companies – both Pfizer and AstraZeneca – to increase the supply.”It was confirmed on Thursday evening that the surgery he visited later took delivery of the OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine.The shadow health secretary, Jonathan Ashworth, said Hancock’s visit to the surgery was akin to a scene from political satire The Thick of It, but added: “Sadly, it’s no laughing matter.”Dr Hughes said Hancock was “quite surprised actually to learn that we don’t know when all of our deliveries are coming, they’re very ad hoc”. The surgery has been administering the Pfizer vaccine since the middle of December and has so far received three deliveries.Dr Hughes added: “So we’ve continued to vaccinate with Pfizer in the surgery, and what we’re hoping to do with the AstraZeneca when it arrives is to go out to the most clinically vulnerable and housebound. So that’s what we’ll be doing.“We won’t start vaccinating within the surgery with our AstraZeneca doses until we’ve finished our Pfizer vaccines.”Both AstraZeneca and Pfizer have said they are on track to deliver vaccines as agreed with the government.The government announced nearly 1.5 million people had now been inoculated against Covid-19.PA Media contributed to this report"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4452753.1610058400!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"government u turn on partial reopening of schools amid mounting opposition from teachers","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMinister for Education Norma Foley: ‘Nphet and public health continue to hold the clear view that schools are safe places.’ Photograph: MaxwellsThe Government has abandoned plans to bring Leaving Certificate students into class for three days a week from next week amid mounting opposition from teachers and principals.Plans to reopen special schools or classes for children with special needs have also been scrapped pending “further engagement with all education stakeholders”, the Minister for Education, Norma Foley, said.The U-turn came less than 24 hours after the plan to bring up to 60,000 Leaving Cert students and an estimated 18,000 pupils in special schools and special classes back to school next week was announced at a Government briefing on new lockdown measures in a bid to stop the spread of Covid-19. It said the plan was for all other children to be taught remotely.In a statement on Thursday night, Ms Foley confirmed all schools would now remain closed from Monday January 11th.From this date, all students, including children with special needs, “will resort to a programme of remote learning in line with the rest of the Government restrictions”.Ms Foley’s statement came after confirmation by the two main secondary school teachers’ unions that they would not be co-operating with the initial plan to reopen schools on Monday.The Teachers’ Union of Ireland has welcomed the decision “now taken, somewhat belatedly, by Government to finally do the right thing”.It said its members would not be attending their workplaces for in-school teaching next Monday, “or on subsequent days, but will be available to provide emergency remote teaching and to support their students including, in particular, students with special educational needs”.‘Significant concerns’The Association of Secondary Teachers, Ireland (ASTI) said it had instructed its members not to co-operate with Monday’s planned reopening. “The decision is based on significant concerns about the health and safety of students, teachers and other staff,” it said.One Dublin secondary school had earlier announced it would defy the Government plan. Alexandra College in Milltown, south Dublin, told parents and students that a partial reopening would pose unacceptable health risks.A number of other schools, including special schools, had also signalled they would not reopen on Monday.“It is with regret that I announce that, despite the confirmation by public health that schools remain safe, that children in special schools and special classes and Leaving Certificate students will not be extended in-person learning.”Labour leader Alan Kelly said earlier he expected the Government to “come around” and reverse its decision to continue school classes for Leaving Certificate students during January.Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald had said there was real and growing concern about the plan to bring Leaving Cert students into schools next week.Relative safetyMeanwhile, public health officials on Thursday night restated their views about the relative safety of schools in the pandemic, while expressing concerns about the overall level of transmission of the virus in society.“Schools are not dangerous, they are safe places in relative terms,” chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan said.Because of the level of infection in the community, issues associated with schools such as parents meeting up and transport had to be considered by the National Public Health Emergency Team (Nphet) when it came to children returning to school, and not just education itself within the classroom, he pointed out.He said the “quantum of activity” involved in allowing Leaving Cert students to attend school three days per week was “totally different” to allowing all schoolchildren back to school full-time.A further 10 deaths of Covid-19 patients were reported by Nphet on Thursday along with 6,521 new confirmed cases of the disease.The reproduction number for Covid-19, a key measure of how fast the disease is spreading, now stands at between 2.4 and 3, higher than at any time since the start of the pandemic.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4449859.1609924993!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"how to choose the right secondary school for your child","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe then taoiseach  Leo Varadkar with principal Dr Áine Moran, deputy Leona Harrington and Archbishop Diarmuid Martin at the opening of Le Chéile Secondary School in Tyrrelstown in 2018.

A former headmaster of St Andrew’s College in Dublin, Arthur Godsil is founder of Godsil Education, an education consultancy company that provides services to industry, educational institutions, students and their parents.There are six key elements that make schools successful:Firstly, school culture: nothing is more powerful in setting standards and values than the continuous attention to maintaining an inclusive and energetic school climate it assists with the prevention of bullying, cultivates respect and assists learning.Second, modelling behaviours that we wish to transmit to our young people. It is important that we have a variety of iniduals as role models in positions of school leadership showing students that the school does not discriminate against ersity, whether that be gender, race, religion or any other form of differentiation.Fourth, formative learning means that learning should be a process and not an end point. Every assessment of a child’s work should be seen as the beginning and an opportunity for the child to reach greater heights.Fifth, we are unsure of what this changing world will bring we don’t know how machine learning and artificial intelligence will affect traditional employment but we know that skills development and expanding the ability of our students to be agile and flexible, to be able to think creatively and find innovative solutions to difficult problems will, in the end, serve our new generations far better than an unquestioning adherence to a set curriculum. Developing the skill needed to differentiate between what is truthful and accurate and that which is false and imperfect will become a necessary requirement in the repertoire of learners.Finally, schools that have a well-developed understanding of the value of being self-aware and actively incorporate policies and procedures that align with best practice in promoting self-esteem among our young people will significantly contribute to the collective mental health of our society.Dr Áine Moran. Currently the ethos and leadership officer at Le Chéile Schools Trust, Dr Áine Moran was the founding principal of Le Chéile Secondary School in Tyrellstown, Dublin 15.In November 1976 Christina Murphy, the then education correspondent for The , wrote an article about my primary school.I’ve always had a sense that I was fortunate to have attended “good” primary and secondary schools, so when I was asked to write a few words on what makes a good school I went back to find the article about Breaffy National School in Co Mayo to try to understand why a six-year-old might have thought her school was such a thing. Even in the photo that accompanies the article, it is easy to see that I feel at home, I’m confident even though I’m being challenged and that I’m having fun. Maybe that’s all there is to a good school.I’ve spent much time as the principal of Le Chéile Secondary School trying to ensure it is a place of excellence where all can reach their potential, a place where there are deep links to the local community and engagement with parents, a familial feeling among staff and students, an environment that inspires, a creative curriculum.At both St John’s National School in Breaffy and later at St. Joseph’s Secondary School in Castlebar, I knew I was known and I was loved. I experienced this love as empowering, something that drew the best out of me. A good school does that. It creates a sense of possibility for both staff and students. There is a “try it” attitude that builds confidence and resilience.Saoirse Exton (15).

Our voices should be heard and there should be mechanisms to translate our voice into school policy.* Leadership: A principal that listens to students and works with their teachers to lead and be imaginative.* Extracurricular: Sports are important, but not for everyone, so it’s great if schools also have options like chess, debate or quiz team.* Voter registration: As soon as you start secondary, they should encourage civic engagement and get all their 18-year-old students registered to vote.Seán Sweeney (19).

Photograph: GettyDeis-designated schools saw an increase in student progression to third-level education in 2020, but social class remains a significant factor in determining the level of educational attainment achieved by students in Ireland, according to figures compiled by The .In 2020, 6,662 or 63.5 per cent of Deis students progressed to third-level, an increase of 746 students who secured a place in 2019, when 57 per cent of Deis students progressed.Despite this improvement and the controversy surrounding the Leaving Cert and the introduction of the calculated grades system last year, the rate of student progression to third-level in 2020 was broadly in line with preceding trends.Nine of the 20 schools which sent the highest proportion of their students to third-level education in 2020 are fee-paying, as are the majority of schools listed as having sent the highest rate of students to high-points courses.A large proportion of students from Ireland’s 51 fee-paying schools, which are predominantly based in south Co Dublin, progressed on to courses in UCD and Trinity College, where they make up over 25 per cent of first-year undergraduate students, even though they represent just 7 per cent of sixth-year students nationwide.Of the 10 schools sending the highest rate of students to high-points courses (courses at State universities, teacher training colleges and other colleges such as the Royal College of Surgeons), six were fee-paying, and four were non-fee paying.Two of the non-fee paying schools are Irish-medium and two are English-medium schools.Interestingly, this year’s progression charts indicate that there may have been a slight fall-off in third-level registrations of fee-paying students, with 3,252 of them securing places in high-points colleges.This still represents an 85.5 per cent progression rate of the 3,803 fee-paying students who received calculated Grades in 2020. The corresponding overall progression figure for 2019 from graduates of those schools was 3,287, or 35 more than in 2020.Some of this minor fall-off in numbers of fee-paying schools’ progression numbers may be attributed to students who opted to sit the Leaving Cert in November, rather than progress to college to undertake a course that was not their preferred choice.Whereas the calculated grades process received a lot of criticism from schools and institutions who perceived themselves to have been disadvantaged by the algorithm used, the process saw a marked improvement in the progression rates of current and previous sixth-year students at Deis schools on to CAO colleges in 2020.Some 63.5 per cent (6,662) of 10,486 Deis students secured a CAO place in 2020. Of that number 3,433 – or 32.7 per cent – secured a place in a high-points college.Out of a total of 43,705 college places analysed in this supplement, 12.3 per cent went to students who attended Deis schools and 11.7 per cent went to those from fee-paying schools.That achievement is not as dramatic as it may first appear, given that Deis students made up 19.3 per cent of this year’s sixth-year class group and the percentage attending fee-paying schools represented 7 per cent of the overall numbers.The outcome of the calculated grades process has been a significant advance in progression from Deis schools. Over the past six years, Deis schools secured places at high-points colleges and courses for on average for 25-26 per cent of their students .In 2019 that proportion broke through the 30 per cent barrier, and in 2020 increased again to 32.7 per cent.The 6,662 Deis students who secured places through the CAO process represent almost two-thirds of the entire sixth-year Deis cohort.Despite the improvement, more work clearly needs to be done to attract students from disadvantaged areas to high-points colleges.UCD registered 8.1 per cent of incoming first-year students in 2020 as having attended Deis schools. Maynooth University registered 16.5 per cent while Dundalk IT recorded 24.5 per cent registrations and IT Letterkenny allocated 46.8 per cent of its first-year undergraduate places to Deis students.The school which has seen the most dramatic increase in the rate of progression over a six-year period is Christian Brothers, Westland Row, Dublin 2. In 2014, two of its 12 students who sat the Leaving Cert progressed while in 2020, 15 (71 per cent) of its 21 students who sat the Leaving Cert accepted a third-level place.Schools where subjects are taught through Irish perform strongly again this year and take three of the top 10 places in the main progression table.Top of the list is Coláiste Chroí Mhuire gan Smál, which is located in an Spidéal, in the Connemara Gaeltacht, while the other two schools – Coláiste Iosagáin and Coláiste Eoin – are both located in Dublin."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4452666.1610049472!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"record number from deis schools progress to third level","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe latest data shows a record 64 per cent of students from disadvantaged or Deis schools went to third level last year, up from 57 per cent in 2019.

There was a “sense of devastation” that this much needed support was being “stripped away”, he said. Mr Harris called for therapeutic supports for the families of children with autism for whom remote learning does not work.Mr Harris told RTÉ radio’s Morning Ireland that the decision on Thursday night was a missed opportunity for children with special needs.He pointed out that 61 per cent of children with autism lost key skills during the last lockdown. Remote learning does not work and “they need in-school support,” he said.There was a need to “move past the blame game” and when the unions and the Government meet on Friday “they need to be the adults in the room”.Mr Harris said the National Public Health Emergency Team (Nphet) had said it believed such services could continue. “These children must be prioritised for a return to school. In the meantime support must be put in place,” said Mr Harris.The Government also abandoned plans to bring Leaving Certificate students into class for three days a week from next week amid mounting opposition from teachers and principals. The move is pending “further engagement with all education stakeholders”, said Minister for Education Norma Foley. The U-turn came less than 24 hours after the plan to bring up to 60,000 Leaving Cert students and an estimated 18,000 pupils in special schools and special classes back to school next week was announced at a Government briefing on new lockdown measures. The Government said the plan was for all other children to be taught remotely.Remain closedIn a statement on Thursday night, Ms Foley confirmed all schools would now remain closed from Monday January 11th.From this date, all students, including children with special needs, “will resort to a programme of remote learning in line with the rest of the Government restrictions”.Ms Foley’s statement came after confirmation by the two main secondary school teachers’ unions that they would not be co-operating with the initial plan to reopen schools on Monday.On Friday, Labour’s education spokesperson Aodhán Ó Ríordáin called on the Government to make a decision on Leaving Cert 2021. Mr Ó Ríordáin pointed out that every part of the UK had made a call on state exams. “The call has to be made in February,” he told Newstalk Breakfast.“Are we doing all of this (school closures) in favour of a written exam in the summer?”Leaving Cert students had missed 11 weeks of school last year and there was no guarantee that they were going to be back in school by mid term or by St Patrick’s Day, said Mr Ó Ríordáin.He said students teachers and parents did not want to be this situation “but the numbers have exploded”.Mr O Ríordáin said parents had been prepared “to vote with their feet” and their children would not have returned to school next week. He went on to criticise the Government for not consulting fully with unions prior to making the initial decision to keep schools open three days a week for Leaving Cert students and for not getting “a specific sign off” from Nphet. The president of the Association of Secondary Teachers in Ireland (ASTI), Ann Piggott, told the same programme that she thought people were relieved at the Government’s “U-turn” on the return to school. It would be better for schools to remain closed for two weeks and then to look at the situation again if the number of Covid cases had begun to reduce, she said."},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"Company delivered 14m parcels in December, double the level of same period in 2019About 335,600 people will receive the benefit this week"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4452709.1610053892!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"long covid can affect people even with mild initial symptoms study","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDr Liam Townsend said the results highlighted how there is no simple diagnostic test to predict which patients with Covid-19 will suffer long-term effects such as fatigue. Photograph: iStockPersistent ill-health can result from contracting Covid-19 regardless of the severity of the initial infection, according to the findings of a new study by a team of Irish researchers.In what was the first global study of its kind, researchers from Trinity College Dublin assessed lung function and respiratory symptoms among 153 patients infected with Covid-19, including those who self-isolated at home and others who required ICU care in hospital.The study’s lead author, Liam Townsend, research fellow at TCD’s Department of Clinical Medicine and specialist registrar at St James’s Hospital, said little had previously been known about lung health following infection with the virus that causes Covid-19 and whether there were links between respiratory problems, fatigue and ill-health and the initial severity of the disease.While fatigue, ill-health and breathlessness were all common symptoms as a result of Covid-19 infection, Dr Townsend said they appeared to be unrelated to the severity of the initial infection.Chest X-rayAll patients who participated in the study were given a chest X-ray and six-minute walk test.Dr Townsend admitted that researchers were surprised at the findings of the study, which is published in the latest edition of the Annals of the American Thoracic Society.“We expected a greater number of abnormal chest X-rays. We also expected the measures of ongoing ill-health and abnormal findings to be related to the severity of initial infection, which was not the case,” Dr Townsend said.Researchers examined a number of measures of recovery for the patients who attended an outpatient clinic, with a median of 75 days after they had been diagnosed with Covid-19.The findings of the study suggest that Covid-19 does not cause significant fibrosis as only 4 per cent of patients showed signs of lung scarring on CT scans.‘Full health’It found that 62 per cent of patients felt they had not returned to full health, while 47 per cent were classified as having fatigue.“Patients who felt they had to exert themselves during moderate exercise also reported they felt fatigue and poor health,” Dr Townsend said.He said the findings showed patients experienced significant symptoms, but there was a relatively low rate of people with abnormal X-rays.Dr Townsend said the results highlighted how there is no simple diagnostic test to predict which patients with Covid-19 will suffer long-term effects such as fatigue.Dr Townsend said it was important that all patients diagnosed with Covid-19 received follow-up treatment, irrespective of whether they suffered mild or severe infection.The study suggested the highest-risk group for suffering post-Covid symptoms appeared to be females under 60 years, which Dr Townsend said indicated genetic factors might be a factor."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4452645.1610048143!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"north s chief vet gives assurance on assistance dogs post brexit","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tNew arrangements for bringing pets and assistance dogs to Northern Ireland from Great Britain are in effect following the end of the Brexit transition period on January 1st. The North’s Chief Veterinary Officer has pledged that assistance dogs will not be prevented from entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain despite new rules covering the travel of pets across the Irish Sea border. “No genuine assistance dog will be turned back,” Robert Huey said. “We will find a way of doing it. “I don’t want to say much more because I’d be admitting to breaking the law so I’m not going to go there.”While he warned that he would not “buy everything being an assistance dog”, genuine assistance dogs will not be turned back.Mr Huey appeared before the Stormont Agriculture Committee on Thursday, and was questioned by MLAs about new arrangements for bringing pets and assistance dogs to Northern Ireland from Great Britain following the end of the Brexit transition period on January 1st. The UK has Part 2 listed status under the EU Pet Travel Scheme, which means that pet dogs and assistance dogs, as well as cats and ferrets, ravelling from Great Britain to Northern Ireland must have an Animal Health Certificate (AHC) from a vet and arrive through an official point of entry. They must also be vaccinated against rabies and dogs must be treated for tapeworm. Neither disease is present on the island of Ireland. There is no such requirement for pets or assistance dogs travelling from Northern Ireland to Great Britain. ‘Common sense’ Minister for Agriculture and the Environment, the DUP MLA Edwin Poots, wrote to the UK’s Secretary for Agriculture and to the European Commission on Thursday asking for a Common Travel Area for pets to be applied between Great Britain and the island of Ireland.This, he said, was “common sense” and would “alleviate the real and serious concerns of pet travelers across all jurisdictions.” He said the difficulties caused to assistance dog owners and assistance training puppies meant “some of the most vulnerable in our society are being directly affected. This cannot and must not be the case,” he said. The Chief Veterinary Officer said officials in Northern Ireland would not enforce the new rules until February 1st “to give people a chance to get ready.” The new requirements, he said, were “onerous and it is expensive and in my view it’s unnecessary.” His officials, Mr Huey said, had been working with colleagues in London and Dublin to try to find a resolution, and while he was hopeful it would be solved, he did not believe it would be soon. “I was hopeful that at an operational level I would be able to find some room for pragmatism but the legislation is written in a very black and white way, I can find no wiggle at all, so I have no alternative but to enforce this legislation,” he said. “We’ll be doing it sensitively, pragmatically and sensibly as far as we can, but I am not happy with the situation we find ourselves in, my minister isn’t happy with the situation we find ourselves in, and we’ll be doing all we can to try and mitigate this problem.” In a statement on its website, the UK government said it recognised the changes would take time to adjust to and it was working with the authorities in the North “on an enforcement approach that takes this challenge into account. “This approach will be implemented in a way which supports pet owners and assistance dog users while the Government pursues a permanent solution,” it said.

Photograph:   Brian LawlessPA Watched by a wearied and fearful country, the Government slumped into the third national lockdown on Wednesday, warning that the third wave of the pandemic now threatens to overwhelm the health service as numbers of infections climb to previously unimaginable heights.Barely an hour after the Taoiseach and his fellow Coalition leaders announced the new lockdown measures, public health chiefs released the latest daily number of new cases – just shy of 8,000. Unless these numbers begin to abate soon, they will crash through even the surge capacity in the health service that will surely be called into operation in the coming days. The leaders of the Government now fear that the health service will simply be unable to deal with the number of cases seeking admission to hospital wards and to intensive care units in the coming days and weeks.The important numbers over the coming days are not so much the case numbers, says one senior figure, it is the hospital numbers and the intensive care unit numbers. The nightmare scenario of last March is back: the wolf is at the door.The lockdown is – for everyone with the exception of the Leaving Cert students – as stringent as last March. Few sources who spoke privately on Wednesday night expected it to finish in three weeks. Social problemsAll the social problems that are exacerbated by these conditions – educational disadvantage, domestic violence, economic damage, and the rest of that grim procession – will return. Ireland is not alone for sure, but it is a hell of a price to pay for a meaningful Christmas. The truth is that the price is vastly more than anyone envisaged.The search for someone to blame is understandable, and will continue, even if there are more pressing matters for everyone to deal with right now. Internally within the Government, there is a cacophony of finger-pointing and dissent. But ultimately the Government as a whole makes the decisions and ultimately it is accountable for them. But such judgments will be more wisely made in the fullness of time, allowing for their consequences to play out, for better or for worse.However the blame game goes, the future of the Government’s authority – and therefore its ability to enforce its will, on Covid and other matters – rests on two issues. One is within its own control, the other is not.Fate of the country’s hospitalsThe first is the fate of the country’s hospitals over the coming fortnight. If the hospitals are overrun it will be a hammer blow to the Government’s authority and credibility. The claim the Coalition could reasonably make before Christmas – when it had the lowest infection rate and limited excess deaths – that it had managed the crisis well would no longer be tenable. The second issue is more – though not entirely – within the Government’s control. The roll-out of the vaccine has been slow to start. Unless it accelerates, the Government will look woefully inadequate, especially as vaccinations continue at an apparently rapid pace in the UK and elsewhere. Teething problems are understandable and there are constraints on supply. But if the Government is not vaccinating as quickly as it is receiving supplies very soon – and is able to demonstrate that it is – people will draw their own conclusions about its competence and credibility.

Photograph: AP PhotoMartin MeissnerSigns that a relatively high number of healthcare workers are unwilling to receive the coronavirus vaccine in some parts of Europe and the US have alarmed politicians and health experts, as countries struggle to contain a surge in infections and carry out mass vaccination.A poll released in mid-December caused surprise in Germany – the country that has been at the forefront of the race for a vaccine with biotech company BioNTech – by showing that half of surveyed nurses did not want to be vaccinated, along with a quarter of doctors. Those worries came back to the fore this week when the head of one German state said only a third of healthcare workers in his state were willing to get the jab.A high degree of reluctance among medical staff has also been observed in other parts of Europe and in the US. In France 76 per cent of senior care home staff said they did not want to get vaccinated, according to a poll of 2,000 such workers carried out last month.In Austria only half of the staff of care facilities in the region of Vorarlberg said they were willing to be inoculated, according to Austria’s public broadcaster. The Italian Federation of Medical Professional Associations said about 100 doctors were unwilling to receive the immunisation across the country.In the US a survey released last month by the Kaiser Family Foundation health think-tank found that 29 per cent of US healthcare workers would probably or definitely not get a vaccine, a slightly higher proportion than in the overall population (27 per cent). HesitantAnecdotal evidence from the first weeks of rollout in the US suggests staff at care homes are particularly hesitant to be vaccinated.Mike DeWine, the governor of Ohio, said recently he was “troubled” by the relatively low numbers of nursing home workers taking the vaccine, with around 60 per cent of nursing home staff having declined the shot.Asked about vaccine hesitancy among health workers on Wednesday, Germany’s health minister Jens Spahn said his ministry had only anecdotal data, with starkly ergent results. In some nursing homes, he said, only 20 per cent of medics received a jab, while in others it was as high as 80 per cent. But he said data showed regular flu vaccines among medics was “unfortunately very, very below average”.“Promoting vaccination of healthcare workers is very important. We work in an environment full of vulnerable people, it is our responsibility to get it,” said Uwe Janssens, the author of the German survey released last month. “If people see healthcare workers are unconvinced, how will that affect our society?”Dr Janssens, general secretary of the German Society for Internal Intensive Care and Emergency Medicine, decided to conduct his survey after being shocked to hear several nurses express concerns over the new mRNA technology, used by the two EU-approved vaccines BioNTech-Pfizer and Moderna. Among the 2,305 survey respondents, many feared long-term side effects, while female nursing staff expressed concerns over their ability to get pregnant. Many interviewed, he said, appeared to have seen anti-vaccination videos spread online.Vaccine scepticism may already be affecting healthcare in parts of Germany. On Tuesday, Bodo Ramelow, head of the state of Thuringia, cited one clinic in the city of Eisenach that stopped taking Covid-19 patients – not because it was short on hospital beds, but because 100 employees were themselves sick or in quarantine.“This leads to a real problem because we want to make sure that these people, who work so very close to the virus, have the highest protection,” Mr Ramelow told MDR television. “I plead to everyone to go get it.” Health riskGermany, which is struggling to contain a second surge in Covid-19 infections, has imposed no legal requirement to take the vaccine, though some lawyers specialising in labour rights say medics could potentially face dismissal should their employers argue they were posing a health risk to patients.In Italy authorities are investigating 13 doctors accused of anti-vaccine propaganda or playing down the severity of the virus.“I am perplexed when I hear of fellow doctors or nurses reluctant to get the vaccine,” said Pierpaolo Sileri, Italy’s deputy health minister. “I can understand it regarding a member of the public who perhaps does not have the scientific understanding, but frankly, I think that those doctors and nurses, if they still have doubts after seeing everything that’s happened, are probably in the wrong job.”Markus Söder, head of Germany’s state of Bavaria, said on Tuesday that a public campaign was needed “to drum up support, not only for more vaccines, but also willingness to accept this vaccine. This will be a subject of tense debate.”The latest polls on vaccine acceptance, however, suggest that the public is not growing more confident. In the spring, 79 per cent of respondents to Germany’s University of Erfurt survey were willing to be vaccinated, while in September that number had dropped to 56 per cent. Last month, a YouGov poll suggested 32 per cent of Germans were immediately willing to be inoculated, while another 33 per cent wanted to see how the first round of vaccination went.In France, amid a slow rollout of the vaccination campaign, only 40 per cent of French people polled by Ipsos last week said they planned to be vaccinated, down from 54 per cent in October and 59 per cent in August.Despite the wariness, Dr Janssens said he believed the tide would turn among medics after the first round. “I am hopeful then others will follow. But it’s a very important signal that we need to give these people information now.” – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2021Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4452725.1610055109!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"riots and the us capitol overrun the day that shook america","story":"More views from inside the mayhem, confusion and chaos at the Capitol as Trump supporters entered and disrupted certification of the Electoral College results.

Major road closures have been in place from the previous day when the first demonstrators began arriving in the city. \u0026nbsp9am: Thousands of Trump supporters have already gathered on the Mall, ahead of Donald Trump’s speech. Carrie McPherson, a manager in a dental office, says she made the trip from Richmond, Virginia for the event.“I’m here because America is in disarray,” she tells The . “We have won the election. It is quite clear that a lot went on with this election that is just not right. The Democrats are trying to steal the election, we’re not going to let it happen, come hell or high water. Donald Trump has done everything for the American people for the last four years – he’s getting four more years.”\u0026nbsp10am:  Donald Trump’s sons Eric and Donald Trump jnr warm up the crowd, followed by former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani. Donald jnr throws down the gauntlet to Republicans preparing to gather on Capitol Hill later in the day to certify the election results. “To those Republicans, many of which may be voting on things in the coming hours: You have an opportunity today. You can be a hero, or you can be a zero. And the choice is yours. But we are all watching. The whole world is watching, folks. Choose wisely.”12 noon: The president makes the short journey from the White House to the make-shift stage, an hour later that advertised. He speaks for 75 minutes, reprising his unsubstantiated claims about election fraud, and criticising “weak Republicans”. “If Mike Pence does the right thing, we will win the election,” he declares.12.50pm:  Pence issues a statement minutes before he attends the joint session of Congress, stating that he will not object to the election result after “a careful study of the constitution”.“Our Founders were deeply skeptical of concentrations of power and created a Republic based on separation of powers and checks and balances,” he writes. “Vesting the VP with unilateral authority to decide presidential contests would be entirely antithetical to that design.”1pm: The joint session of Congress to count the electoral college votes from each state and declare Joe Biden the winner of the election begins. Pence, in his capacity as president of the Senate, takes to the floor beside Nancy Pelosi as the session begins. As the tellers read out the results from each state, a House member announces an objection to the results from Arizona, seconded by a member of the senate, Ted Cruz.1.30pm: As set out in the rules, the two houses split, senators return to the chamber, and both houses begin debating the objection to the state of Arizona. The rules limit debate to two hours. Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell urges his fellow Republicans to accept the result. “The voters, the courts and the states have all spoken. If we overrule them, it would damage our republic forever,” he says.1.50pm:  Senator Ted Cruz defends his decision to challenge the result, arguing that 39 per cent of Americans believe the election was rigged. “It is a reality for half the country,” he says.2pm:  Protesters who have moved from the Save America rally a mile west of the US Capitol are now beginning to breach the barricades around the building at the foot of Capitol Hill near where the inauguration stand for Biden’s swearing-in ceremony has been erected.2.20pm: House and Senate suspend proceedings and staffers in neighbouring buildings in the wider complex are told to shelter in place.2.45-5pm: The Capitol is put in lockdown. Thousands of Trump supporters enter the building, smashing windows and ransacking offices. Tear-gas is deployed in the rotunda. Members of the House are told to lie on the ground and put on gas masks as security personnel draw weapons, trying to stop rioters entering the chamber. They later enter through the second and third floor galleries, after members have been evacuated.4pm: President-elect Joe Biden delivers a speech from Delaware, denouncing the “assault on the citadel of liberty, the Capitol itself”. He demands that Donald Trump address the nation in a televised address “to fulfil his oath and defend the constitution and demand an end to this siege”.4.15pm:  Trump releases a video asking his supporters to go home, but repeating his allegations of election fraud. Twitter later removes the tweet and bans the president from the platform for 12 hours.5.45pm: Officials announce that the Capitol building is secured, after police from the neighbouring states of Maryland and Virginia and DC’s entire national guard were mobilised, along with the FBI and other law enforcement officials.6pm: Washington DC curfew begins. Hundreds of Trump supporters remain outside on the west side of the Capitol, defying the city-wide order while a row of heavily armed law enforcement officers protects the Capitol complex. The crowd finally disperses, and some arrests for curfew-violation are made.7.50pm: Former president Barack Obama issues a statement, accusing the sitting president of inciting the violence at the Capitol. He calls it “a moment of great dishonour and shame for our nation”.8pm: Members of Congress return to the two chambers, with the Senate resuming debate on the Arizona objection, and the House convening an hour later. “The United States Senate will not be intimated,” said Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell. “We will not be kept out of this chamber by thugs, mobs or threats. We will not bow to lawlessness or intimidation . . . We will certify the winner of the 2020 presidential election.”11pm: Both chambers finish debating and vote on the Arizona objection and reconvene in joint session. As expected, the objection is rejected. Though fewer senators objected than had been expected, 121 Republicans in the House still vote to reject Arizona’s results.Thursday, January 7th\u0026nbsp12.15am: An objection is raised to the results from Pennsylvania – chambers once again split, though only the House holds a lengthy debate.12.30am: Authorities confirm that four people have died in connection with the riots. One woman was fatally shot by a Capitol police officer three others died from unspecific “medical emergencies”.3.15am: After debate in the House, a joint session dismisses the objection to Pennsylvania’s results, though seven Republican senators and 138 Republican House Republicans vote to throw out the state’s electoral college vote.3.40am: Mike Pence announces Joe Biden’s victory as the challenges to the electoral votes in two states fail. He confirms that Biden and vice-president-elect Kamala Harris have received 306 electoral votes, and will be the next president and vice-president.3.49am: Donald Trump issues a statement through his aide Dan Scavino because his own Twitter account has been suspended: “Even though I totally disagree with the outcome of the election, and the facts bear me out, nevertheless there will be an orderly transition on January 20th. I have always said we would continue our fight to ensure that only legal votes were counted. While this represents the end of the greatest first term in presidential history, it’s only the beginning of our fight to Make America Great Again!”6am:  Washington DC’s overnight curfew lifted, but DC’s mayor Muriel Bowser extends the public emergency until January 21st, the day after the inauguration.8am: Northern Ireland envoy and former White House chief of staff and Trump ally Mick Mulvaney announces his resignation from the part-time position. “I can’t stay,” he says, confirming he phoned secretary of state Mike Pompeo and resigned on Wednesday night.10.30am: Military personnel erect black, non-scalable fences around the perimeter of the Capitol.11.30am: Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer calls on Mike Pence to invoke the 25th amendment – the provision in the constitution that allows a sitting president to be removed. “This president must not hold office one day longer,” he says.12 noon: The chief of the Capitol police, the force charged with protecting Congress, defends his handling of the protests, describes his officers as “heroic”.1.30pm:  Elaine Chao, transportation secretary and wife of Mitch McConnell announces her resignation – the first member of cabinet to do so.1.50pm: Joe Biden speaks in Delaware. In a blistering speech, he lays the blame for Wednesday’s attack on the Capitol at Donald Trump’s feet. “For the past four years we’ve had a president who has made his contempt for our democracy, our constitution, and the rule of law clear in everything he has done.”2pm: Nancy Pelosi calls for Trump to be removed through 25th amendment or the House may begin impeachment proceedings. She also calls on the head of the Capitol police to resignFour people have died after supporters of outgoing US president Donald Trump invaded the US Capitol in an extraordinary attack on the heart of American democracy on Wednesday.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons january 2021","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlTo order The 2020 limited-edition Matt Christmas jigsaw, go to telegraphcartoonjigsawsOrder The Best of Matt 2019 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514. To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178Travel latest news: Arrivals to UK will need to show a negative Covid test before entryCoronavirus latest news: Pfizer vaccine could be effective against UK and South Africa strains, study saysPolitics latest news: Brexit border problems stop deliveries as M\u0026ampS warns of disruption for expatsUS Capitol riots: Senior Democrats push for impeachment as use of 25th Amendment \u0026#39ruled out\u0026#39 – latest news Joe Biden and the special relationship: What his inauguration means for the UK and BrexitPolice hunt fraudster who injected woman, 92, with fake vaccine in LondonPolice officer dies from injuries suffered during Capitol stormingScotland lockdown: what are the new Covid rules and Tier 4 restrictions?Gyms closed again under new national lockdown rulesCan I meet my friends outside?

Two-thirds of those assets are held in managed portfolios that belong to the bank\u0027s 15,000 clients, most of them religious orders, Vatican employees, Holy See offices and embassies around the world.The official said its bank had sent less than £725,000 to Australia since 2014, mostly for payment of salaries and expenses for the Vatican embassy, as well as pensions and travel costs.“The Holy See’s entire yearly budget is about 330 million euros. The (Austrac) figures are about four times that,” the official said. “It seems like science fiction.”Australian Catholic Bishops Conference spokesman Gavin Abraham also said it had no knowledge of the transfers and that none of the money was received by dioceses, charities or other Catholic entities.Cardinal Pell, who was Pope Francis\u0027 former finance minister, had clashed with the Vatican\u0027s old guard over his financial reform efforts. He had to abandon his work in 2017 to face trial.Cardinal Pell himself has suggested that his prosecution was related to his work trying to clean up the Vatican\u0027s murky finances and the resistance he faced, but also acknowledged he has no evidence.Pope Francis welcomed Cardinal Pell back into the fold in October, granting the 79-year-old an audience when he returned to Rome after spending a year prison for his sex abuse conviction, which was ultimately overturned.Australia\u0027s police previously said they weren\u0027t investigating the money flows Cardinal Pell\u0027s accuser has denied receiving any payment for his testimony.    More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"beloved republican party lies tatters must bear share blame","story":"Politics can create a strong sense of identity. I should know: growing up, a description of myself always included being Republican. The GOP was a party I learned about as a child, campaigned for after university and defended – abroad, no less – when it wasn’t often popular to do so. It was painful indeed to distance myself in 2016, when the values of the Republican nominee clashed too much with my own.But politics isn’t everything. Every election cycle, after the political wars subside, our American identity kicks into gear, and we remember that for all our differences, we are united in our commitment to freedom and democracy above all else. At least, that is what is supposed to happen.Wednesday’s violent scenes were an accumulation of the doubt and distrust the 45th president has been sewing into the fabric of American society since he took office four years ago – the undermining of American identity. This is Donald Trump’s America, where toxic party politics matter more than respect for fellow citizens.When Joe Biden addressed the nation after the Capitol was attacked, he called for unity in the nation, for the “true America” to shine through. He rightly pointed the finger of blame directly at those who caused havoc: the President and the mob. But let me, less charitably, add some culprits to the list: senior Republican party figures of late. The party has surrendered its most fervent commitment to the Constitution and rule of law in the space of one presidential term.It wasn’t long ago that Texas Senator Ted Cruz was labelling Trump a “pathological liar” and “utterly amoral”, when he was running against him in the Republican primaries in 2016. On Wednesday Cruz led the charge in Congress to cast doubt on the election, encouraging his colleagues not to certify certain results. The Missouri Senator Josh Hawley, who has built his brand fast as a “constitutional conservative” (and spent a gap year teaching at St Paul’s school in London), sided with Trump’s version of election events over a Conservative-heavy Supreme Court. These men have contorted their constitutional positions to fit the President’s radical narrative, using every tool they can to usurp the power of the states, in direct contravention of the philosophy of limited government they otherwise preach. Meanwhile soon-to-be Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell has always known the President “doesn’t know a lot about the issues”, as he put it in summer 2016, yet supported his refusal to concede in November, pandering to Trump\u0027s delusions about the election outcome for weeks.What changed? Four years ago Trump pulled off a spectacular win, bringing with him Republican control of Congress. Politicians and senior figures who had dedicated their working lives to the Republican party couldn’t resist this shiny new powerhouse, regardless of how shaky its foundation was, and so bowed down to a man who has shown himself to have little respect for the GOP or its history. The party of Abraham Lincoln and Ronald Reagan openly embraced a man who demonised immigrants, attacked Muslims and Mexicans, demeaned women and mocked the disabled – all before he even entered the White House.In exchange for this temporary gain in power, far too many Republican politicians gave him everything: free passes for his dangerous remarks a promise to defend the indefensible. Most recently, they gifted the president free rein to spread conspiracy theories about voter fraud to his supporters. The consequences of this were laid bare this week.Not all Republicans gave in to the President’s tantrums and demands. Those traitorous “never-Trumpers” had the foresight to see the car crash coming. The list of dissenting elected officials has grown thin, but a few remain in office. Mitt Romney reportedly yelled at Cruz “this is what you’ve gotten” after the Capitol was stormed. When you spread hate among your supporters, hate is what they eventually give back.Where have these lies got us? That power, which Trump and the conquered Republicans sacrificed so much for, is in the hands of the Democrat party now. What remains is a Grand Old Party in tatters. It is a tragic sight – but responsibility cannot be shifted. It is a mess that must be fixed.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"pictures day capitol invasion kim jong un frozen fish","story":" People enjoy the snow  in Castilla-La Mancha, Spain, where the whole contry is on alert for Storm Filomena.

We expect schools to work with families to ensure all critical worker children are given access to a place if this is required.If critical workers can work from home and look after their children at the same time then they should do so, but otherwise this provision is in place to enable them to provide vital services.The DfE also said that schools were expected to strongly encourage vulnerable children to attend class.Vulnerable children could include pupils who may have difficulty engaging with remote education at home due to a lack of devices or a quiet space to study, according to the advice.The new lockdown measures mean the entire country will be subject to the same tougher measures, including the closure of all schools. This means the tier system is not currently in place.Every school had been instructed to draw up plans to ensure children continue to receive an education even if they have to stay at home.Mr Johnson said on the announcement of closing schools: I want to stress that the problem is not that schools are unsafe to children. The problem is that schools may nonetheless act as vectors for transmission, causing the virus to spread between households.Read more on the previous tier system: All schools will remain closed until mid-February, with the possibility that these measures could be extended further.This means most secondary school pupils will stay at home until at least February half term. Gavin Williamson, the Education Secretary, announced on January 6 that GCSE, A-Level and AS exams will not take place this summer. Exams will be replaced by teacher assessments, with Mr Williamson saying that the government will put our trust in teachers, rather than algorithms. The Education Secretary has also stated that the Department for Education and Ofqual had already worked up a range of options. Details are currently being fine tuned, but it will be a form of teacher-assessed grades, with training and support provided to ensure these are awarded fairly and consistently across the country.When schools reopened in September the Government published 25,000 words of guidance explaining how school children and staff should be kept safe.Older children will be encouraged to avoid close contact with one another, in part because risks increase with age. Teachers are not restricted to a single bubble, but are urged to stay at the front of any classroom to reduce contact. In class, pupils must sit spaced out side-by-side and facing forward.The use of the staff room by teachers is also meant to be “minimised”. Schools must contact local health protection teams immediately so those in close contact with the child can be traced. Currently, pupils in a bubble, year groups and very rarely, the entire school, could be asked to self-isolate. A mobile testing unit could also be sent to a campus. Schools will be offered serial testing of close contacts of staff and pupils who test positive to negate the need for entire year groups to self-isolate at home.Teachers who help a child with symptoms do not have to self-isolate unless they develop symptoms themselves. However, they should thoroughly wash their hands and wear PPE while with the child. The area where someone suspected of having Covid-19 has been must then be intensively cleaned.If a parent insists a child with symptoms should attend school, the headteacher can refuse to take the pupil if they believe there is a threat to others.Staff will also supply and promote the use of tissues as part of the “catch it, bin it, kill it” technique to control germs.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"telegraph weekly news quiz radio show did queen congratulate","story":"In the week that Prime Minister Boris Johnson plunged England into a third national lockdown, the \u0027s weekly news quiz is here to find out how closely you have been paying attention to this week\u0027s headlines. Ryanair is under investigation for a controversial advertising campaign, it was revealed this week.

Already we\u0027re seeing some airports closing.”He said Heathrow had been calling for business rates relief for airports as has been provided to the retail sector.John Holland-Kaye argued the UK government could take the lead in the development of a “common international standard for testing”.Asked on BBC Radio 4\u0027s Today programme if there was a country doing well at handling travel and testing rules, he said: “It\u0027s not clear that any one country has it right.”Mr Holland-Kaye added: “Actually one of the concerns that passengers have is that it\u0027s very confusing as to what the rules are in different countries.”So at the moment, this doesn\u0027t apply in Wales because nobody is coming into Wales in the way that people are still coming into England and Scotland, but I strongly support what is being done.The pharmaceutical giant and researchers from the University of Texas carried out lab tests on the variants, one of which was found in the UK while the other originated in South Africa.Each contains mutations including N501Y, an alteration in spike protein of the virus, which is a target for vaccines.In the new study, which has not yet been peer-reviewed, blood samples were taken from 20 people who received the Pfizer vaccine."},{"url":null,"title":"army help covid vaccine rollout","story":"NewsArmy to help give Covid vaccine to , a day in biggest logistical op since WWThe Prime Minister told a press conference the Army will use “battle preparation techniques” to protect the UK’s most vulnerable, with hundreds of vaccination centres opening over the next weekmirrorShareCommentsByPippa CrerarDaily Mirror Political Editor:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror incoming video brigadier-phil-prosser-outlines-scale-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : #

The PM told a press conference the Army will use “battle preparation techniques” to protect the UK’s most vulnerable by mid February. He introduced Brigadier Phil Prosser, the commander of military support for the vaccine, who said: “It is my role to deliver combat supplies to UK forces in time of war. “My team are used to building supply chains at speed in the most arduous and challenging conditions.” The rollout is the UK’s biggest logistical operation since the Second World War. Brigadier Prosser said the military used three steps in such complex operations. “First, we analyse the situation and the mission, we then identy choices to select the best plan, and then we execute that plan at pace,” he said. Hundreds of vaccination centres will open over the next week so there is one within  miles of every home. The aim is that every elderly care home resident will be offered their first dose by the end of the month. Operations are due to begin next week at the Etihad Tennis Centre in Manchester, Epsom Downs racecourse in Surrey, Robertson House in Stevenage, Ashton Gate Stadium in Bristol, Millennium Point in Birmingham and London ExCel. It is understood some care home workers are already receiving jabs at Newcastle’s Centre for Le. Mr Johnson said there will be “lumpiness and bumpiness” in the rollout, adding: “It will require an unprecedented national effort.” The Mirror, Labour and the TUC have launched a Let’s Vaccinate Britain campaign to encourage thousands to sign up as NHS volunteers.We also want them to get the jab and challenge anti-vax fake news. Almost .m people have had a jab but more than , need one every day to hit the target. Brig Prosser, Commander of the  Logistics Brigade, said: “I’ve found this operation unparalleled in scale and complexity, and I say this having served around the world. “In the  days this programme has been in operation we have delivered . million doses of vaccine, hundreds of millions of consumable items and established  sites.  “That’s the equivalent to setting up a major supermarket chain in less than a month, and next week we will further increase our footprint by another %.” Hospitals face bleak weeks ahead with , people admitted with Covid since Christmas. NHS England chief Simon Stevens said most were infected between Christmas and New Year when rules were relaxed. He said: “We’ve made a strong start on the vaccination programme but we need a huge acceleration over the next five weeks.” He slammed Covid deniers standing around outside hospitals.

Speaking to MPs, Mr Hancock talked about the four criteria that the government will look at before deciding on when they can end the lockdown.Ministers have said that they plan to end the lockdown in late February - but others, including Michael Gove,have suggested it could drag on into March.Mr Hancock told MPs: Weaposve set out the conditions that weaposll look at for the relaxation of the restrictions. Those are, that there isnapost another major, new iant that is causing dficulties. The vaccination program is working, and the number of hospitalisations and deaths is coming down.The Health Secretary said there were no fixed thresholds for any of the key criteria - but stressed ministers were always looking at the direction deaths and hospitalisations are travelling. The warning came as he insisted - despite the governmentaposs catalogue of errors - that this will be the last national lockdown.It came as Mr Hancock said people may need to be revaccinated every six months in order to contain the spread of the coronavirus.Mr Hancock said: “I anticipate we will probably need to revaccinate because we don’t know the longevity of the protection from these vaccines. “We don’t know how frequently it will be, but it might need to be every six months, it might need to be every year.” Askedhe thought this would be the “last of the lockdowns” because of the vaccines, Mr Hancock said: “I do, yes.” Mr Hancock also said that Covid- vaccines that require adjustments to fight new iants of the virus may not need to go through the usual full trials process. It came as Public Health England confirmed that case rates in England are rising among all age groups. The Health Secretary also warned that the number of people in hospitals may not fall as quickly as death rates once the vaccine is rolled out as a result of the number of younger adults with the virus. He said Hospitalisation levels I would also expect to fall, but ironically not as quickly as deaths in the first instance. “The reason is that people that are slightly younger spend longer in hospital, often because they survive when somebody who is very old and frail might not survive for as long.”"},{"url":null,"title":"scientists not sure covid vaccine","story":"NewsScientists not sureCovid vaccine will beat South African strain, top Tory saysDespite positive news on the Pfizer jab, Grant Shapps warned the Y.V iant was the reason for him finally introducing pre-flight tests - and itll be a tragedyit gets to the UKmirrorShareCommentsByDan BloomOnline Political Editor:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news politics video grant-shapps-vaccine-might-not-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : #

People arriving in England and Scotland, and probably the whole UK, will need a negative Covid result from next week or face a £ fine. A debate has been ongoing in recent days about how the ‘Y.V’ iant, thought to have originated in South Africa, will respond. New research today said the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine does protect against the iant - as well as the second more transmissable iant rampant in the UK. The pharmaceutical giant carried out lab tests on the strains alongside researchers from the University of Texas. But Mr Shapps said there were still fears a vaccine could be rendered “less useful”other strains make it into the UK. Explaining the new travel policy, he told BBC Breakfast: “The reason we are very keen to do it now is there’s this new iant which you may have heard about called the South African iant, which is causing great concern with the scientists. “They’re not sure whether for example the vaccine will be able to deal with it in the first place. “And we’re very very keen to try to keep that out.” Speaking to LBC he added: “It may be that the vaccine doesn’t respond in the same way, or doesn’t work in quite the same way. Andthat were the case, of course, it would be a tragedy to allow that into the country.”The new requirement for a negative test comes on top of the existing need for travellers to quarantine for  days after arriving in the UK. The UK has already banned almost all travel from South Africa and last night extended the ban to Namibia, Zimbabwe, Botswana, Eswatini, Zambia, Malawi, Lesotho, Mozambique and Angola as well as Seychelles and Mauritius. There are the concerns about the South African one in particular about how effective the vaccine would be against it so we simply cannot take chances,” Mr Shapps said. So today because of that iant it has become much more urgent. The new iant has emerged just as the UK ramps up its bid to give million vulnerable people their first vaccine dose by February .

A poll of , adults found they fantasised about getaways, or started a conversation about them,  times over the last  months. And while  per cent simply shared their thoughts with their partner, a third talked about holidays with anyone who would listen.All manner of holiday-related topics are usually explored, including the weather , what they would eatand even what they would pack .It also emerged that while going away on holiday is normally the highlight of the year for  per cent of adults, just  per cent have their next getaway booked. A spokesperson for Jetholidays, which commissioned the research, said: With many of us stuck at home, weaposve been thinking about holidays more than usual - whether thataposs reminiscing about past adventures or thinking about the next one. Thereaposs no better feeling than having that all-important holiday booked, as it gives us a real boost and gives us something to look forward to. The study also found that in addition to chatting about holidays past, present and future, those polled will also enjoy watching  travel TV shows a year. And theyaposll share holiday-related content on social media  times during that sameperiod of time, while  per cent follow travel bloggers on the likes of Twitter and Instagram.Aside from getting inspiration from social media and television programmes,  per cent get holiday ideas from their friends, while  per cent like to scan through travel guides. Further to this,  per cent love planning getaways so much itaposs one of the aspects of holidays they enjoy the most.  The Jetholidays study, carried out via OnePoll, also found  per cent aposliveapos for going on holiday. But the average adult last went away for a aposproperapos getaway  months ago - and ordinarily they would go on two holidays during a typical year. Therefore, thereaposs no surprise that  per cent said they need a getaway now more than ever before.

This week the mum of a young baby has warned other parents to be on the lookout for symptoms which can be mistaken for ailments of a common sickness bug or teething in tots. Myer Rudelhoff said her four-month-old son George spent three nights in Basildon Hospital in Essex after suffering from vomiting, patchy skin, swelling lips and a high temperature. The poorly tot also struggled to keep fluids down. Myer said: He got so poorly so quickly when we arrived and was really lethargic. They took a swab and, when they said he was positive, I burst into tears. It was such a shock. Nurses treating George said nurses told her they had treated multiple children with the same mottled skin and sickness before encouraging her to share her story to warn other parents.  Lucy Fisher, from Hertford, also shared photos of her -month-old son Albie with mottled skin after he tested positive for the virus. Images of Albie show the youngsteraposs mottled skin, with his neck flushed and covered in a rash. Another photograph shows a teary-looking Lucy with Albie cuddled into her chest sleeping.The -year-old listed her sonaposs symptoms in a Facebook post on Monday [ Jan] as a warning to other parents, saying: “This is without a doubt the hardest week I’ve faced being a mum. Last month, Tim Spector, lead scientist on the ZOE Covid Symptom Study app and Professor of Genetic Epidemiology at King’s College London, said as a new strain of the virus causes a spike in infections across the country people should not just focus on the three main symptoms and look for other signs.He said: Testing alone is not going to stop the spread, just as it didn’t with the previous waves. People need to know all the symptoms and not just focus on the three “official” symptoms that miss over  per cent of cases . If anyone is suffering from any of theseover the coming weeks, stay at home, self isolate and get a test. Stomach ache The American Journal of Gastroenterology published a study suggesting the virus could cause digestive problems such as diarrhoea. It analysed data from  patients in China, discovering that . per cent of them had tummy issues such as vomiting, abdominal pain or diarrhoea when they were first hospitalised. Teenager Daraposyana Dyson, from Maryland, Baltimore, US, died from a coronavirus-related inflammatory condition after suffering an upset stomach alongside other symptoms.The -year-oldaposs mum Kandace Knight told WBAL-TV : It happened so fast. I never thought that taking my daughter to the hospital for a stomach pain that I wouldnapost be walking out of there with her. She was so beautul, she was too good for this world. Eye infections Health officials think conjunctivitis develops in around % to % of patients, according to the American Academy of Ophthalmology. Chy Earnest, a nurse at the Le Care Centre in Washington, said that red eyes are the ‘single most important’ sign that patients have COVID-. Speaking to CNN she explained: “They have, like...allergy eyes. The white part of the eye is not red. Itaposs more like they have red eye shadow on the outside of their eyes.” However, the American Academy of Ophthalmology said this does not mean you should panicyou see someone with apospink eyeapos. FatigueA WHO study looking at common signs found that the third most common symptom of coronavirus was a aposflatliningapos feeling of fatigue. Some . per cent of patients reported the symptom in the study, which was based on , laboratory confirmed cases.Researchers previously described fatigue as one of the aposdark horses of Covid symptomsapos, alongside headaches.Using data from the COVID Symptom Study app, the researchers created a list of the most common symptoms reported by patients in the first seven days after onset.  Brain fog aposBrain fogapos is usually a symptom associated with aposlong Covidapos but some patients also experience it before being diagnosed with the disease.Thea Jourdan told The Daily Mail that she first thought she may have been infected when she got a tickle in her throat and a headache.The mum-of-three said: I also had brain fog. I was unable even to fill out forms from the children’s schools. I just wanted to sleep, while trying to keep the kids safe and away from my quarantine area — my bedroom. Dr Hilary Jones said those who do experience the side-effect will be faced with a crippling inability to think clearly. Confusion Dr Halim Fadil, a neurologist at Texas Health Arlington Memorial Hospital, told Healthline : “Many COVID- patients have been reported to have neurological symptoms, such as headache, confusion, seizures, and even strokes.”Delirium usually affects patients who require ventilator support, and is caused by a build-up of carbon dioxide in the body. Neurologist Dr Kevin Conner explained: “Patients with delirium may have auditory hallucinations, visual hallucinations, disorientation of time and space, agitation, aggression, fluctuating level of consciousness, and impairment of sleep-wake cycle.” Worryingly, delirium can lead to long-term brain damage, while patients who experience it are also less likely to survive, according to the experts.  Skipping mealsProfessor Spector said data from the Covid Symptom Tracker App has revealed that the top five symptoms in children aged under  who tested positive for the virus are headaches, fatigue, fever, sore throat and skipping meals.Speaking on BBC Inside Science, Prof Spector said: These are dferent from the top five we see in adults which includes generally the cough and the shortness of breath and the loss of smell. That’s really important to realise - skipping meals and fatigue are really important, as are headaches.s. Prof Spector has encouraged parents to sign up to the app on behalf of their children.  Muscle pain New York University researchers found a link between sore muscles and serious coronavirus cases during an analysis of  patients in Wenzhou, China. Professor Megan Coffee, the infectious-disease expert who led the study, said deep muscle soreness, known as myalgia, were often exhibited by patients. The World Health Organization said aches or joint pain came up in around  per cent of coronavirus patients. The soreness is caused by chemicals called cytokines being released into the body in response to the infection, according to The Sun.

I wonderedit might be possible to take carbon out of the atmosphere and turn it into diamonds. I loved the idea, and not just as an environmentalist it’s radical and evocative – it’s modern day alchemy. So we pursued it. It took few years but we’ve done it.

The Witham mum was told by doctors her lung cancer had spread to her liver and bones, giving her a matter of just months.With England now in lockdown, many of Avaaposs children and grandchildren are unable to be with her and hold her hand during what little time she has left, reports Essex Live.Are you separated from someone you love due to the coronavirus crisis  Share your experience in the comments below...Three of Avaaposs six children have been able to self-isolate to spend time with their mum. But the others, who work in the community, are only able to see their mum through the window. The whole family and little ones are desperate to be able to cuddle Ava and give her the best few months they possibly can. It was just six weeks before Christmas when Ava was rushed into Broomfield Hospital. A series of scans revealed that Ava had cancer in the lungs, which had spread to her liver and bones, making it incurable. The news devastated the entire family, one of Avaaposs daughters, Katy Richardson, said. She was in hospital over Christmas and we have been told at the moment that itaposs a case of months but whether that is three, six or nine months we still donapost know, Katy, , said. Itaposs the symptoms of the bone cancer that has been causing the most problems. She had to have a hip replacement because the cancer was crumbling at the bone.  They rushed her in for the operation and that gave us hope because they hadnapost written her off. Ava is due to start radiotherapy next week and will be going into hospital every day for treatment. Thankfully, Katy was able to self-isolate to go and live with her mum during her treatment, while her other siblings do what they can to support their mum from afar. Katy said: We were heartbroken when we found out. She is the matriarch of the family, I am one of six children.  And you think of all our friends too - she has been a second mum to a lot of people. To see her on this journey now, we donapost want to see her go through this. Sheaposs done nothing but help other people. Sheaposs kind, sheaposs caring, it is limitless what she will do for other people. The family has now set up a fundraiser to try and give Ava the opportunity to make as many amazing memories as she can once restrictions lt. Seeing the amazing comments and donations have meant the world to Ava - finally putting her first for a change. Katy added: Thataposs the reason we set up the GoFundMe because so many people have asked what can they do to help and this way we can give people the opportunity to do that. Sheaposs never been in that position where she has had extra money to enjoy herself. She lives alone and we just thoughtpeople want to help this is the way I feel. We can take away the financial burden and she can go make memories and allow her that freedom once restrictions go.  For the three of Avaaposs children, Sam, , Ella, , and Callum, , as well as her ten grandchildren, it is incredibly dficult to not be able to be close to her during this time. Those who canapost isolate because they are working in the community are the ones are doing the shopping and the other three of us are isolating to be with her, she said. Without a pandemic, we wouldnapost have to worry about any of this, Katy said. My sister has a new baby coming on the way too and my mum is so desperate she wants to be there for the baby. Itaposs awful to be so close but so far all you want to do is hold her hand and have a cuddle. She added: The grandkids absolutely love her, they get really sad looking at the window through to her because they have to stay at the window. She is desperate for a cuddle but when we are allowed to do things it will give her the fire in her belly. Ava is also due to turn -years-old in May with the hope that they can plan a big party to celebrate together. Lucy, one of her daughters, is also due to get married in August this year, which her family pray Ava will be able to be a part of. While Katy said her mum is starting to come to terms with the diagnosis, the comments and donations from people whose lives she has touched mean so much. This has put her in higher spirits seeing the amazing comments and that means the world to her, she said. Even just buying the babies an ice cream, silly little things like that are lovely for her to do. We want a huge family holiday too - five years ago we had one and paid for her and it would be a dream for us to do that again, she loves Greece. My mum has always been the provider, when we went on picnics before lockdown, there would be  of us and she would have so much joy in doing the food and buying it all for everyone. She loves giving. Itaposs all the little things in le that mean something to her. Katy said they have already exceeded fundraising more than they would ever think, with nearly £, donated. They are so grateful to anyone who is able to donate or share words of support for Ava and hope she can make as new and wonderful memories soon.

Geoff, who caught the virus last year, said he has been honest with his children about the current coronavirus situation and each day they sit and watch the news so they can understand what is going on.Afterwards, they ask him questions about what they donapost understand and he answers as honestly as he can. Do you think schools should be open or closed  Let us know in the comments below However, he decided to record the emotional moment on Monday as Jeffie reacted strongly to the news of schools being closed again. Geoff said: “There’s probably a lot of other kids feeling the same way, she’s over it now but you know my daughters are a bit cheesed off, for nearly a year and thereaposs been no school. “It’s absolute madness, it’s like living in a movie, it’s absolutely crazy and itaposs slowly getting worse. There’s no one to blame for it or even point fingers, there’s still even people thinking it’s fake. “It’s just a mess.”  Joking about homeschooling, he added: “We’re having to be their teachers but we’re a little under-qualied in actual fact some of the school work I’ve got no idea they’re probably better at it than me. I’ve got no idea how to do some of it, it’s beyond what I was taught but now the kids just want to play out and see their friends at school. It’s not even anyone’s fault.”On Wednesday Boris Johnson said schools will be the very first things to reopen after lockdown.But the Prime Minister admitted he would have to be very cautious about reopening classrooms despite saying he hopes theyaposll be back from February .  He said: “That moment may come after the February half term - although we should remain extremely cautious about the timetable ahead. As was the case case last Spring, our emergence from the lockdown cocoon will not be a big bang but a gradual unwrapping.” A law passed by the government this week will allow lockdown to continue until as late as March . The PM defended his dithering and U-turn on closing schools - which he did only after primaries reopened for one day, and two weeks after SAGE warned the R number could not be brought below  with them open.

City of London Police have issued a CCTV image of a man detectives would like to speak to following the incident. Detectives labelled it a aposdisgusting assaultapos as the Government ramps up its vaccine rollout for the UKaposs most at-risk people. Elderly and clinically vulnerable are at the front of the queue for the Covid- jab as authorities race to vaccinate nearly million people by mid-February. The force said the woman reported a man had door-knocked her at her Kingsmead Avenue home in Surbiton, in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames, on Wednesday. December  at around -pm. She told police he said he was from the NHS and there to vaccinate her. The victim allowed the man inside her home and was jabbed in the arm with what she described as a ‘dart-like implement,’ she told officers. It is not yet known what substance was injected, but she was checked over at her local hospital and has suffered no ill effects following this encounter, police said. The man then asked for £, which the victim paid - as he told her it would be reimbursed by the NHS, before leaving the premises.On Monday, January , the same man attended the victim’s address again and asked for a further £, she told police.  The man was described as white, with a London accent, aged in his early thirties, measuring about ft in, with a medium build, and light brown hair that is combed back.On his second visit to the victim’s address, he was wearing a navy blue tracksuit with white stripes down the side. Detective Inspector Kevin Ives from the City of London Police’s Police Intellectual Property Crime Unit said: “This is a disgusting and totally unacceptable assault on a member of the public which won’t be tolerated.

In the weeks that followed, the Duke and Duchess worked with their furious family as well as staff and charities to work out the logistics of the progressive new role within the institution they were determined to take. It wasnapost until March  that they officially turned their back on their senior duties when they joined the royal family for one final engagement - the Commonwealth Day Service at Westminster Abbey. They also carried out several goodbye engagements behind the scenes, and Meghan gave a tearful final speech as she prepared to head back to Canada. Omid Scobie was one of a small group of journalists invited to the private meeting with Association of Commonwealth Universities scholars - during which Meghan spoke to students about their work on subjects including climate change. He writes about the emotional day in his bombshell autobiography, Finding Freedom, which hit the shelves last year. He claims that after the speech, she chatted to people inidually and hugged him, uttering the heartbreaking words: It didnapost have to be this way. Recalling the day, Omid writes: “Staff who had been with the couple from day one were mourning the end of what was supposed to be a happy story: two people fall in love, get married, have a baby, serve the Queen, the end. Instead, they were leaving the country.  “As Meghan gave me a final hug goodbye, she said, ‘It didn’t have to be this way’.” Meghan also said emotional goodbyes ahead of the Commonwealth Day service, but still found humour as she made a last joke about her hat. In Finding Freedom, Omid and his co-author Carolyn Durand describe what happened on that historical day. They write: Harry quietly slipped through the door of the  Room to say hello, and the reality - and the emotions - finally set in. Do you think Meghan and Harry were right to quit their senior royal roles  Have your say in the comments section below.  Meghan turned around to hug goodbye the last remaining people in the room, including an author of this book. With the state room almost empty except for a few familiar faces, the tears the duchess has been holding back were free to flow. She embraced some of the dedicated team members whose tireless efforts - to promote the coupleaposs work, launch landmark projects, and deal with the near-daily crisis brought on by the tabloids - had come to an abrupt end. aposI canapost believe thisapos, she said, hugging one of the young female aides she had become close with. Though Team Sussex was a much smaller operation than the more sophisticated offices at Clarence House and Kensington Palace, in the short space of a year since setting up, they had become like family. Meghan then went to change into the stunning green outfit she chose for the historical event, joking with staff that it was her last hat for a while. After their final engagements, Meghan and Harry ed to Canada, however they decided to make another move shortly before the world was thrown into lockdown due to the pandemic.  They have now bought a beautul -bedroom family home in Montecito, Santa Barbara, which set them back £.m. They moved in July after taking out a £.m mortgage and getting some financial help from Prince Charles. While the price tag might look huge, it seems Meghan and Harry may have actually picked up a bargain as itaposs said to actually be worth closer to £m, reports the Sun. One of the downsides of their new home will be living a -minute drive from Meghanaposs mum Doria, who they are very close to, but the mansion has its own two-bed guest house so Archieaposs nan will always have somewhere to stay.

Katy Toft, , from Newton-le-Willows on Merseyside, tipped the scales at st lbs at her heaviest. The mum gorged McDonaldaposs meals on the school run and snacks of crisps, chocolate and biscuits.But determined to lose weight in time for her wedding following the birth of her fourth child, Katy signed up to a diet plan, reports the Liverpool Echo.Do you have an incredible weight loss success story with before and after pictures  Email webnews@mirror After starting the : Diet by Cambridge Weight Plan, she lost an incredible three stone within just three months of starting it back in October , and went on to lose another stone during lockdown in time for her birthday in June. This takes her weight loss to four stone in total after she slimmed down to st lb and went from a size   to a size  . Katy said she now feels healthy, happy and content and she was able to enjoy her big day in October  with husband Martyn at St Peters Church. Katy said: Iaposd just had my fourth baby and I was dreading the thought of walking down the aisle feeling uncomfortable about myself in front of all my friends and family. I felt really unhealthy, I couldnapost walk upstairs without getting out of breath.  I couldnapost keep up with my children and I didnapost want to be a bad example for them. Because it went on through Covid crisis it was massively for health reasons, because when your BMI is really high you are at risk of all types of illnesses like type two diabetes and heart problems. Katy said she had previously lost some weight after giving birth to her third child but after splitting up from her partner and getting into a new relationship, everything snow balled. Katy said: It was convenience - I was eating fast food and portions that were too big. I wouldnapost just have two slices of toast I would have four slices of toast. We live really close to a McDonaldaposs and we would nip into that on the school run. If someone asked for a biscuit I would have a biscuit. Iaposve got four children and two step children. If six children are coming up to me saying aposI want a biscuitapos I had six biscuits. Eight months after the birth of her fourth child after she had stopped breast feeding, Katy signed up to the : Diet by Cambridge Weight Plan. She started the diet on an intake of  calories a day, swapping three meals with meal replacements provided by the plan. Katy said: The lowest calorie intake is  calories depending on your BMI. I started on  calories. It was full meal replacements that are nutritionally balanced with every single thing you need in a day. You have shakes, soups, for breakfast you have porridge and you have other meal replacements. Itaposs massively motivating when you see the results coming quickly as well.

Katy said the thing sheaposs enjoyed most about the plan is the one to one support she has received from consultants and she has since signed up to become a consultant herself to inspire others with their weight loss. I wanted to feel like the best version of myself. I donapost feel self conscious when I go clothes shopping anymore and I donapost struggle to tie my shoe laces. I used to get out of breath tying my shoe laces - things as ridiculous as that, Katy added. I donapost feel like that now - Iaposm healthy, happy and content. We had to bring our wedding day forward because of the next lockdown. When I took back on pictures I know the smiles are genuine - I just couldnapost believe it was me.  Everything had was such a whirlwind any way but everything was worth it in that moment, when I put on my wedding dress and walked down the stairs and saw my familyaposs faces. The national lockdown in England is expected to last until mid-February at the earliest and Katy said the next six weeks are the perfect time for people to lose weightthey want to.

The bombshell blindsided the Queen and threatened to destabilise the very fabric of the monarchy. In the days that followed, the Queen and her heirs, Princes Charles and William, ordered a series of crisis talks to deal with the wantaway couple, forcing Harry to a Sandringham Summit at the royals’ Norfolk estate. What is your view on Harry and Meghan, one year on  Have your say in the comment section The emergency meeting ended with the Queen reluctantly granting her grandson and his we permission to step down as senior royals. Agreements were put in place alongside a -month review of the thrashed-out agreement, in which they promised to “continue to uphold the values of Her Majesty” while getting their independence. Here we look at what has happened to the couple and -month-old son Archie in the  months since, and what lies ahead... Three moves  Three house moves between three countries – from Frogmore Cottage in Windsor to the Canadian wilderness and on to the paparazzi capital of the world a stone’s throw from Hollywood.Harry and Meghan plotted their escape from The Firm from a remote estate on Vancouver Island in British Columbia, Canada – a far cry from where they would end up putting down roots in the millionaire’s playground of Montecito, Calornia.As coronavirus lockdowns were enforced around the world, the couple fled the Commonwealth country to stay rent free at movie producer Tyler Perry’s £million mansion in the US. They soon bought a £million home near celebrity pals Oprah Winfrey and Ellen DeGeneres. Making millionsWith a reported £million from Netflix and £m from Spoty, the couple have more than achieved the financial independence they sought.But courtiers are privately concerned by the rate at which they are signing deals, and whether they will be able to “uphold the values of Her Majesty” and the institution as they vowed last year. Meghan’s personal investments have also “raised eyebrows” in royal circles. The vegan coffee Meghan invested in was advertised by Oprah Winfrey to her  million Instagram followers, with a cryptic caption including a crown emoji.A royal source said: “It’s hard to see how any of this fits in with the promises and there’s a lot up for discussion.” Charity work After months of largely operating away from the spotlight, Harry and Meghan announced the launch of their new charitable foundation Archewell.  Described as “an impact-driven non-profit” whose “core purpose is to uplt and unite communities”, it has an arm connected to their Spoty deal, Archewell Audio, understood to have netted them £million. The couple were also seen in Los Angeles last year handing out food parcels during several public outings with a privately hired photographer. Relations with the royals Harry and Meghan’s dealings with the royals they left behind have been limited to phone and video calls amid the pandemic.  The couple have kept in touch with the family and exchanged gts between William and Kate’s three children and their son Archie. Prince Charles has also worked hard to keep in touch with his son, although royal sources have suggested it was “noted” how he was not mentioned on the couple’s new Archewell website. The home page features a picture of a young Harry on the shoulders of his mother Princess Diana, alongside an image of Meghan and her mum Doria with the text: “I am my mother’s son. And I am our son’s mother.”  Harry was due toto the UK before the -month review deadline on March , but his plans have been dashed with the new coronavirus lockdown. The prince still plans toin the spring for several major events, including the unveiling of a commemorative statue at Kensington Palace of Princess Diana on July . He has worked on it with William since . Meghanaposs miscarriage bravery  In November the -year-old duchess bravely opened up about losing her second child while pregnant in July. In a heart-wrenching letter in The New York Times she described how she was changing Archie’s nappy at the family home in Los Angeles when she “dropped to the floor” in pain. She wrote: “I knew, as I clutched my first-born child, that I was losing my second.” She told how she watched “my husband’s heart break as he tried to hold the shattered pieces of mine”.  The article was widely praised for its searing honesty and ability to connect to millions of women and men around the world who have experienced baby loss. The tragedy reportedly helped bring Harry and William closer, as the Duke of Cambridge reached out to his brother following the news. Baby loss charity Tommy’s praised Meghan’s “honesty and openness”, saying that it had sent a “powerful message to anyone who loses a baby: this may feel incredibly lonely, but you are not alone”. Legal cases Meghan’s legal costs have soared to nearly £million as she sues Associated Newspapers, publisher of the Mail on Sunday and MailOnline, over a series of articles connected to a letter she wrote to her estranged father Thomas Markle. She is awaiting a decision on January  at the High Court where her lawyers will argue for a summary judgment. The ex-actress has also recently won a privacy case against a news agency that photographed her and Archie.

The first sample was discovered in a person who lived near Canterbury, Kent, in September, according to scientists. The new iant has ripped through the UK ever since - prompting Boris Johnson to cancel Christmas rule relaxation plans and plunge England into a third national lockdown. Countries shut their borders to the UK after the discovery of the new strain prompted fears it would spread further abroad. The strain has since spread overseas, and is believed to be signicantly more virulent than the original iant.Its  dferent mutations is thought to make it up to  per cent more infectious as well as more transmittable by children. It originally began being detected in the south east and London, where infection rates began ramping up rapidly, before spreading everywhere  in the UK. Experts and vaccine developers have insisted the new strain is unlikely to be resistant to Covid- jabs. The UK is in a race against time to vaccinate million of the most vulnerable in the population by February .  Boris Johnson put the country on a war footing on Thursday as he promised the British Army would help speed up the vaccine programme, delivering aposhundreds of thousandsapos of doses a day. NHS Chief Sir Simon Stevens told the Downing Street press conference speed was essential as patient admissions increased at the rate of a full hospital a day. And earlier in the week, the governmentaposs chief science advisor Sir Patrick Vallance warned that it was essential the vaccine march continued apace.  Sir Patrick explained the longer the virus was in circulation, the more opportunity it had to mutate further. The World Health Organisation has since confirmed the origins of the iant now being described abroad as the aposUK strainapos - revealing the first sample of the new mutant strain was discovered in Kent on September . Data from the Covid- Genomics UK Consortium shows a key sample was found in a location near Canterbury. Kent Live has confirmed this location relates to information provided by public health agencies about where the patient lived rather than the location of a hospital or lab.  Experts also believe the new strain may have been created by mutating inside an immuno-suppressed person over a long period of time. This means they had a reduced ability to fight off infections and other diseases, normally because of their own condition or illness, such as AIDS or cancer. Dr Jeffrey Barrett, Director of the SARS-CoV- Genomics Initiative at the Wellcome Sanger Institute, said: There’s another case in London from September, so B...was present in both places early.  We don’t know exactly how many cases there were in each place in the early days.  He added: “There have been a number of reports of inidual patients who have prolonged illness, and in whom a similar pattern of mutations to B...arose. So there is a hypothesis that an event like this might have been the origin. Some, but not all, of these patients are immunosuppressed. It does seem like B... is the first example of a new iant arising in this way that went on to circulate widely.  Experts believe the first signicant outbreak was in Kent, followed by Medway. It is then thought to have spread through the London boroughs of Bexley, Greenwich and Havering, before hitting other parts of London and Essex. The speed of increase in cases caused by the new Covid- iant is a key reason touted for tougher restrictions introduced in recent weeks.  Public Health England has said the Government only realised the scale of the problem when cases continued to rise in Kent and Medway in November, despite the national lockdown in place at the time. Speaking on December , the epidemiologist Susan Hopkins said: Towards the end of November it was clear that the Kent and Medway region of the country in particular was going against the tide of the national restrictions and was seeing increases, whereas by November  almost all other parts of the country started to decline.” Ms Hopkins explained an initial review looked at whether this increase in Kent was linked to any particular group in the population or workplace outbreaks.  When this proved not to be the case, Public Health England reviewed the genomic epidemiology to look for changes. Ms Hopkins said: “On December  they found that there was a particular iant that had some mutations in the spike protein that had emerged quite rapidly and was spreading not only in the south east but also in parts of London. “So over the following  hours they rapidly undertook an investigation looking at the phylogenetic tree and the clinical details of the patients in which the cases had arisen.

Aware of the signicance of her symptoms, she arranged to have a Covid- test at the local testing station, which duly ed positive. A few days later, her fiancé Alan James started to get similar symptoms, and he too then tested positive. “I thought we were quite lucky at the time because when Bonnie was ill, I was able to look after Jack, who is only seven months old, and then when I became ill, she was on the mend so she was able to be with him,” said Mr James, a lecturer at Coleg Sir Gâr in Carmarthenshire. “We both had the same symptoms - cough, temperature, flu-like symptoms - but the kids were all OK. They didn’t show any symptoms so we thought it would all pass without a problem. “But then, on January , Jack fell ill.” Mr James, who lives in Carmarthen, thought everything would be fine and that baby Jack would not contract the virus, or at leasthe did, he would be able to bounce back from it quickly, like children often do with a range of illnesses. “It was obvious before he was tested that it was the virus,” said Mr James. “His temperature was raging and he had a cough, and obviously he had been around the both of us who had tested positive. We arranged for him to be tested and it came back positive.  “The usual painkiller medicines were doing the trick in terms of keeping his temperature OK and his behaviour and general mood was quite normal so we kept him at home. But then on Monday night he started to wheeze heavily and he was really struggling to breathe. He was gasping for air. “We rung the ambulance and they came out and took him to hospital. We don’t live that far from the hospital but because all three of us had Covid, and because of the seriousness of Jack’s situation, we phoned . “I had never rung  before, and it’s not a nice experience because you’re dealing with a real emergency - I found that it’s really dficult to concentrate when you’re panicking.” Jack was put in the ambulance and his mother Bonnie was allowed to go with him to hospital, where he was treated with steroids and given oxygen to help him breathe. He was kept in all day and allowed home when his condition improved on Tuesday night. Mr James said his son was now “on the mend” but his recovery might take some time, along with his own. His partneraposs recuperation has been quicker, perhaps owing to the fact that she has already received the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine. “Bonnie, as part of her job, was given the first dose of the Covid- vaccine a few weeks ago, and she is due to have the second dose in due course. “So, obviously, she caught coronavirus after being vaccinated but her symptoms were far milder than mine and Jack’s. Whether that’s the reason, I don’t know. “He’s on the mend but it’s quite slow. It’s not like he has a cold as such, and he’s not snfling, he’s just very lethargic and not himself, and he has a throaty cough. As for me, it’s been a week since I became ill and I’m still rough now. I consider myself to be reasonably fit and I don’t get ill often, but this has really knocked me back. I remember having the flu a few years ago but this is dferent.

But how much do you really know about it  New book Very British Weather - Over  Hidden Wonders from the World’s Greatest Forecasters, The Met Office - will make you a weather whizz in no time... Can it be too cold to snow  You sometimes hear people say that it is too cold to snow, but can that actually ever be the case  Strictly speaking, the answer is no, but it can be too dry to snow, and the colder air is, the drier it tends to be because cold air holds less water vapour than warmer air. At -°C, air’s capacity to hold moisture is only % that of air at freezing point. But even the coldest air observed near the Earth’s surface can hold some moisture. So, in theory it can’t be too cold to snow, but the colder the air is, the less likely it is that ice crystals will precipitate out and form into flakes to fall to Earth as snow. Shepherd’s delight Clouds are an invaluable source of information when it comes to forecasting the weather, and not just for trained meteorologists. People throughout history have used cloud formations in particular to predict the weather.One of the most famous examples from folklore is the saying ‘Red sky at night, shepherd’s delight. Red sky in the morning, shepherd’s warning’, which dates to biblical times. But is there any scientic basis to it  The saying is most reliable when weather systems predominantly come from the west, as they do in the UK.  A red sky appears when dust and small particles are trapped in the atmosphere by high pressure. This scatters blue light, leaving only red light to give the sky its notable appearance. Because high pressure moving in from the west is generally an indicator of good weather approaching, a red sky at night means that the next day will usually be dry and pleasant. A red sky in the morning tends to indicate that the high-pressure weather system has already moved east and the good weather has passed, most likely making way for a wet and windy low-pressure system later in the day.So, a red sky at night, or in the morning, can be helpful in working out what weather is to come, but it’s still worth checking the Met Office forecast before you head out without a brolly .The longest-lasting rainbow The longest-lasting rainbow in the UK was observed in Sheffield on  March  – it was visible for approximately  hours, from am to pm. This stood as the global record until it was surpassed by a rainbow in Taiwan that persisted for  hours and  minutes on  November .  Who Needs a Thermometer When You’ve Got a Cricket  Did you know that the sound of crickets chirping on a warm summer evening can tell you what temperature it is  The frequency of a cricket’s chirps is affected by air temperature, soyou count the number of chirps you hear over a period of  seconds then ide by  and add , you will arrive at an approximate temperature in Celsius. Britain’s biggest soaking The wettest day recorded in Britain was  December  when Honister Pass in Cumbria recorded . millimetres of rain in a single day, the result of Storm Desmond, which brought widespread heavy rain and storm-force winds to areas of Scotland and northern England. The same rainfall event also saw the highest accumulations ever recorded in Britain for a two-day period , recorded nearby in Thirlmere. The volume of rain that falls across Scotland in an average year is enough to fill Loch Ness, the largest lake by volume in the UK, more than  times over.  The volume of rain that falls across Northern Ireland in an average year is enough to fill Lough Neagh, the largest lake by area in the UK, around four and a half times. And the volume of rain that falls across England on an average day is enough to fill the Royal Albert Hall almost , times. Britain’s longest icicle Although the s of icicles are not officially recorded, one discovered on a bridge over the River Spey in Grantown, Inverness-shire, must have a good claim to being Britain’s longest ever. It was thought that water from a leaking pipe in the bridge was the source of the mammoth icicles, the longest of which grew to approximately . metres.  Raining Fish Despite the well-known saying, it has never actually rained cats and dogs in the UK, but it has, believe it or not, rained fish before. In , a shower of fish was recorded in Cranstead, Kent. And this was not a one-off event: in , fresh herring fell on fields on Islay in the Hebrides, and in February , dozens of fish fell in Mountain Ash, South Wales. The likely explanation is that waterspouts or tornadoes crossing bodies of water picked up the fish before depositing them again on the ground, much to the confusion of any onlookers.  Does lightning strike twice  Contrary to the popular saying, lightning does often strike more than once. The Empire State Building in New York is struck by lightning on average  times each year and was once struck eight times in  minutes. Closer to home, The Shard in London, the tallest building in Europe, was struck multiple times during a particularly ferocious storm on  May . How much does a cloud weigh  While there are many factors that will determine the exact amount of water a cloud can hold – including temperature, altitude and pressure – we can work with an estimate of about . grams of water per cubic metre in an average cumulus cloud. This means an average-sized cumulus would weigh about , kilograms, roughly the same as an Airbus A.  How extreme do we get in the UK  The highest temperature on record in the UK is .C, recorded in Cambridge in , and the lowest is -.C, recorded in Braemar in Scotland on  February  and  January , as well as at Altnaharra, also in Scotland, on  December . This is the equivalent of .C between the two extremes. Unusual rainbows . Moonbows form at night using light from the moon instead of the sun. The physics are the same as rainbows but, since the moon is less bright and since our eyes are less sensitive to colour at night, moonbows tend to be much less colourful.They are relatively rare, since they need a bright moon and also because showers are less common at night. . Monochrome rainbows occur at sunset or sunrise, the sunbeam has to travel through a larger slice of atmosphere at these times of day.The blue and green components of the sun’s white light are dispersed by the thicker atmosphere and the rainbow is instead dominated by reds and oranges. . Double rainbows occur when sunlight bounces around a raindrop not once but twice. The colours that make up the outer rainbow will be reversed compared to the colours of the inner rainbow.It’s even possible to see a triple rainbow, but each additional rainbow will appear fainter than the last.  . Fire rainbows form when sunlight is refracted through ice crystals in high cirrus clouds also known as upside-down rainbows, or circumhorizontal arcs – their technical name. They often appear high in the sky as quarter-circle rainbows, which is why they are sometimes referred to as ‘smiles in the sky’.How to build the best snowman So, wet snow is best for building a snowman, but surely all snow is made of water, so how can it be wetter or drier  One way to classy how wet snow is is not by how much water would be producedit melted but instead by how much free water it contains relative to the number of ice crystals – the less free water, the drier the snow: Water content in snow Dry: % water Moist: less than % water Wet:  to % water Very wet:  to % water Slush: more than % water Dry snow doesn’t stick together as well, and slush doesn’t hold its shape, so moist to wet snow is best for snowman building.  When it is colder, more water vapour freezes into ice crystals and produces drier snow, meaning that temperatures around or just above °C at ground level are ideal. When actually constructing your snowman, it is also helpful to pack the snow as tightly as possible, as this causes it to melt slightly and then refreeze into ice crystals, binding it together.

Not because something awkward happened during the meal but because of an incident with the waitress which put a massive dampener on the evening out. It was meant to be a pleasant meal at a restaurant, and all was going straightforwardly, until it came to payment. I dined in at a local Chinese restaurant with a friend, the anonymous man explained on Reddit.

I didnapost appreciate that we were even approached at all, and I was shocked and confused that an interaction as such even happened, as I recall it being the very first time I was confronted for not tipping enough, as my usual % tip suffices in past restaurant experiences, he added.  In an act of frustration, I took back the  I left as a tip from the bill and walked out of the restaurant with my friend without saying a word, despite the waitress trying to get our attention as we walked away. In the moment, we both agreed that it was an insane thing for the waitress to do, acting aswe didnapost tip at all. The waitress that had confronted us had been someone we had close to almost no contact with the entire time, as she had only been to our table once to give our food, as I had stated above. But reflecting on it, we were wondering what shouldaposve been done in that situation.

The vaccine appeared to work against a key mutation in the highly transmissible new iants of the coronavirus discovered in the UK and South Africa, according to a laboratory study conducted by the US drugmaker. The encouraging news will be a relief to many in Britain with soaring cases and deaths from Covid fuelled by the highly infectious new iant.Scientists had cast doubt over whether vaccines would protect against new iants, particularly the one re in South Africa.The not-yet peer reviewed study by Pfizer and scientists from the University of Texas Medical Branch indicated the vaccine was effective in neutralising virus with the so-called NY mutation of the spike protein. The mutation could be responsible for greater transmissibility and there had been concern it could also make the virus escape antibody neutralisation elicited by thevaccine, said Phil Dormitzer, one of Pfizeraposs top viral vaccine scientists. The study was conducted on blood taken from people who had been given the vaccine.Its findings are limited, because it does not look at the full set of mutations found in either of the new iants of the rapidly spreading virus. Dormitzer said it was encouraging that the vaccine appears effective against the mutation, as well as  other mutations the company has previously tested against.  So weaposve now tested  dferent mutations, and none of them have really had any signicant impact. Thataposs the good news, he said.That doesnapost mean that the th wonapost. Dormitzer noted another mutation found in the South African iant, called the EK mutation, is also concerning. The researchers plan to run similar tests to seethe vaccine is effective against other mutations found in the UK and South African iants and hope to have more data within weeks. Scientists have expressed concern that vaccines being rolled out may not be able to protect against the new iants, particularly the one that emerged in South Africa. Simon Clarke, an associate professor in cellular microbiology at the University of Reading, said this week that while both iants had some new features in common, the one found in South Africa has a number additional mutations that included more extensive alterations to the spike protein. The Pfizer BioNTech vaccine and the one from Moderna Inc, which use synthetic messenger RNA technology, can be quickly tweaked to address new mutations of a virusnecessary.Scientists have suggested the changes could be made in as little as six weeks.  It comes as NHS England chief executive Sir Simon Stevens warned there were just  days left to meet the target set by Boris Johnson to vaccinate the countryaposs most vulnerable. Speaking at a Downing Street press conference on Thursday, he said there will be a huge acceleration in the vaccination programme over the coming weeks in order to reach targets. We need a huge accelerationwe are, over the next five weeks, going to vaccinate more people than we typically vaccinate over five months during a winter flu programme, he said.  He added that the bulk of the vaccinations would be carried out at GP surgeries and pharmacies, but that the number of hospital hubs and large-scale vaccination centres were also being increased. Earlier this week it was reported millions more jabs would be reaching vaccination centres in days, including two million Pfizer jabs originally held back for second doses. The under pressure Prime Minister has assured the nation that every aspect of the programme - from the Governmentaposs side - is working flat out, with a quarter of over-s having already had a jab.

I know where I was at when I lost my dad.“For him to churn out performance after performance consistently the way he has I genuinely can’t speak more highly of him as a person, never mind a footballer.“He’s been dferent class for our football club on and off the pitch.“I’m genuinely just glad to have the chance to work with him.”The former Rangers and Liverpool man was a major doubt for the big weekend clash with Hearts and is still recovering from a problem with his thigh ahead of Saturday’s Scottish Cup match with Bonnyrigg Rose.However, McPake says he won’t be surprised to have Adam fit and available this weekend.With the Dark Blues big favourites to see off their Lowland League opponent at Dens Park and a crucial league match at Raith Rovers the following Tuesday, Saturday’s match could be the ideal time to rest Adam.McPake, though, insists that sort of decision isn’t so straightforward when it is Charlie Adam and Dundee being talked out.Asked whether he’ll rest Adam this week, McPake added: “Potentially but it will be dictated by the injury.“He has missed a fair bit of training for dferent reasons so it might be important that he does play.➡️ https:t.co tkIwnm pic uaThDbjLmdash Dundee Football ClubDecember , “He has had a tough day this week so we’ll see.“He is experienced enough to know how he is.“The problem I have is that he loves this club so much he wants to play in every single game – he wants to play in bounce games and development games.“I’ve never seen anything like it.”There were a couple of injury issues to emerge after Saturday’s - win over Hearts with right-back Christie Elliott and defender-cum-midfielder Jordan McGhee picking up knocks.Those two may still be fit for the weekend, however.“Christie Elliott needed an injection in his ankle,” said McPake.“It’s an old injury and he just needs something to take the inflammation away. We’ve held off on it but we had to do it this week. At a push he can play Saturdayneeded.“McGhee’s ankle is getting better. It’s credit to him he played through that on Saturday but there was no way he was coming off.”Meanwhile, striker Alex Jakubiak successfully underwent surgery to sort a thigh tendon problem on Tuesday.He is expected to be out for two to three months.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/syndicatenews/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/12/Gjen-Jim-McLean-fans-tannadice_37361934-558x372.jpg ","title":"jim mclean dundee united tributes st johnstone","story":"Dundee United have announced a series of tributes to Jim McLean ahead of their first home match since the death of the club’s greatest ever manager.McLean – who guided the Tangerines to the league title and made them a force in Europe – passed away on Boxing Day at the age of  following a battle with dementia.United opened an online book of condolences as a mark of respect, with Micky Mellon and his first-team players observing a minute’s silence and wearing black armbands at games against Celtic and Aberdeen.And for Saturday’s visit of St Johnstone, the Tannadice side have produced a special -page limited edition match-day programme in memory of McLean, with proceeds going to Alzheimer Scotland.A share of the pay-per-view revenue from the match will also go towards the charity after United’s partners Stream Digital waived their fees for the fixture.Tangerines stars will wear tribute t-shirts during the warm-up while there will be a minute’s applause before the game and during it – the second one in the rd minute, a nod to the club’s  title triumph under the legendary boss.United said: “Our first home game of  has us ing to our home stadium to celebrate the le and Tannadice career of Jim McLean.“With the permission and wishes of the McLean family we will honour and celebrate Jim’s impact on Dundee United in a number of ways and will donate revenues from these projects towards Alzheimer Scotland.”The Scottish Premiership outfit have also set a Just Giving page in McLean’s name to fundraise for Alzheimer Scotland.Jim Pearson, the charity’s director of policy and research, said: “Alzheimer Scotland are deeply saddened by the passing of football legend, Jim McLean and send our sincerest sympathies to his family and all who knew him.“We are honoured to be a beneficiary of a fund being set up in Jim’s name.“Alzheimer Scotland’s mission is to make sure nobody faces dementia alone.“This has never been so important as during the coronavirus pandemic, which has had such a signicant impact on our dementia community.“The support from this fund will help us continue to be there for people with dementia and their families and carers across Scotland.#We are proud of our much-valued ongoing relationship with Dundee United Football Club, through the Football Memories Project and continued fundraising initiatives.“This work is making a real and direct impact to the lives of so many people in Scotland living with dementia, as well as their families and friends.“We must say thank you to the McLean family, as well as the Dundee United Football Club and Community Trust.“If you, or anyone you know, would like information or emotional support our -hour Freephone Dementia Helpline is here for you.

She has travelled and trekked throughout the world but now lives in Argyll amongst the scenery she loves. www.heatheryheightsDuring wintry weather and shorter days it can be tricky fitting in longer walks and time for exploring the outdoors.What is fantastic about Knapdale and Kintyre is that we only have to go a short distance to gain truly spectacular views. The three walks in this edition y from relatively short, using tracks and paths to the lovely viewpoint of Castle Dounie, to challenging, where the terrain is tough underfoot and good route finding skills are required. All three start at Crinan harbour before climbing up through oak and birch woods to gain open vistas with views to Jura, Scarba and Mull. The convoluted ridge walks are rugged and wild, the steep sides sweeping down to the Sound of Jura where tides race and swirl. If you are lucky you may see pods of dolphins or even whales.. At the car park a signboard shows the Crinan Trail. This is the shorter of the routes but all three start and finish together. Leave the car park and turn left. Keeping to the road by the shore you will see a trail marker post ahead leading you briefly along the shore before the path heads into oak woods. After m the path bends sharply left. To the right a faint trail heads west towards the Sailor’s Grave but your route starts its steep muddy ascent to the forestry road above.. On reaching the road turn right, after m you will reach a bench and the first junction to your left. Here you have a choice either come back from the track ahead or to your left. All routes can be undertaken in either direction. I suggest for the longer routes you go straight on and for the Crinan Trail you go left.. For the Crinan Trail follow the waymark posts and arrows. After .km the route turns right onto a path and winds up and down with glimpses of views to come. Turn left at a sign for a viewpoint. This will take you up to the knoll atop which the remains of Castle Dounie, a prehistoric dun, command spectacular views over the sound towards the Gulf of Corryvreckan. There it is said the Cailleach Bheur, a giant witch, once washed her plaid in its whirlpools. Enjoy the vista before ing down to the junction and turn left. The path now meanders down to the forestry road. Turn right and head north round the coast above Adnoe Point and back to your path down to Crinan harbour.. For the longer walks, go straight ahead at the bench . Follow the track for nearly km, which leads you round a couple of hairpin bends and above Adnoe Point, before turning south. Keep your eyes open for the waymark posts and turn left onto a path. Head uphill for m. At the viewpoint sign turn right up to Castle Dounie and enjoy. To your south is the ridge that leads to Creag Mhor.. Immediately after dropping from Castle Dounie you will see a broken down wall on your right. Follow this for a short distance until you can start to work your way up onto the ridge to your right, by a couple of birch trees with coners on the skyline above. The ridge walk is convoluted, airy, rough and summits numerous lumps and bumps with fantastic views. Keep to the crest or east side as the drop-offs to the west are impressive but not to be dallied with. The highest rocky bump of Creag Mhor is parallel to the north end of the rocks offshore.. After  minutes of knobbly and exposed ridge walking #you do not fancy tackling navigation along walls in woods # this is now the time to keep an eye out for an obvious wide firebreakin the trees, below to your left. This leads you at a ° angle straight to a forestry track in the valley below. To check you have the right point look across from the firebreak and you should see a wall continue the line on the other side. Head down the firebreak to the track and turn left. This will take you back to the junction by the bench where you can turn right on the forest road then left todown the path to Crinan harbour.. If you wish to adventure on* and are confident with your route finding then continue south on the ridge # crossing over an old wall not on the map # to where it suddenly drops to a tiny col with forest directly ahead. Ahead is a steep little rise with walls on it. One drops to the right but it is the one going southwest into the forest you need to follow, for the next m. Keeping the wall directly on your right, circumnavigating the odd boulder and ducking the odd branch, you will see that the deer have created quite a path and that the way is often clear. Eventually it drops you very steeply down to a stream with another wall directly ahead. Turn left, southeast, up the stream with the wall on your right # it is boggy # until you reach a quaint waterfall on your left. A small break in the wall to your right allows you to escape the trees that have fallen across the wall higher up. Continue with it on your left across a tree harvested area and up the bump ahead. You will pop out onto a track end.. Follow this short track down to the forest road below. Turn right and almost immediately turn left onto a grassy track that crosses a stream and heads east up into the forest. After m you will come to a sharp left-hand bend. Directly in front of you a wall goes steeply up into the trees. This is your route up to Bealach na Moine. It leads up slippery, mossy rock for m, over a barbed wired fence , up a very rough and eroded track for nearly m, past a spring hidden with fallen trees, then over more pleasant grass and moss to the col. This last section makes you realise why it is worth the effort as views open up east and west. Turn right over a couple of steep little hillocks on the ridge. Suddenly ahead you will see your goal, the trig point and the summit of Cnoc Reamhar, also known as Gallachoille Hill and a Marilyn to boot. It really is a fantastic view.. Toeither descend the way you came or drop down from one of the breaks in the ridge to the north end of the small lochan on the west side of the summit, and follow the faint Landover track north to the spring. Re-join your ascent route, taking care on the way down. Turn rightat the forest road it is now an easy km back to the junction with the bench. Turn right then left after m, following the path back to Crinan harbour.*You can also drop down the firebreak and turn right on the track to join the route up to Cnoc Reamhar,continuing along the ridge does not appeal.The described routes and accompanying information are there to be used as a guide and do not replace the use of map and compass and the skills required to use them. Whilst every effort is made to ensure the route is accurate at the time of going to print please be aware that track and path closures can happen at any time.

The sector in Scotland accounts for around  per cent of UK production and is worth about £ million annually.One fth of these exports go to the EU, amounting to more than , tonnes a year.This is clearly a disastrous Brexit outcome for Scottish farmers and like all other aspects of Brexit, foisted on Scotland against its will.A terrible negotiating failure on the part of the Tory government, and a devastating blow to an extremely valuable part of Scotland’s farming industry, I am sure it will not be the first damaging impact to be highlighted once the deal is fully analysed.Alex Orr, EdinburghSir,The report on the Piers and Harbours Asset Management Plan and Fees and Charges –  , submitted to the Argyll and Bute Council Harbour Board meeting of December ,  makes interesting reading.At a time when budgets are tight and councils have had to make hard decisions about where to cut services, it is dficult to understand why the council budget should be used to supplement the funding of dedicated ferry infrastructure for which CMAL should be responsible.The asset management plan allocates £,, for planned marine infrastructure works for the year  , of which only £, , is devoted to multi-use facilities. The remainder, £,,, is mostly allocated to single-use ferry facilities, and a huge proportion of that is to provide overnight parking for CalMac ferriesreaders will have to make up their own minds about the merits of spending £,, for an overnight berth at Fionnphort, and £, on a feasibility study for a breakwater at Lismore.CMAL pay back around half of the £,, to the council through harbour dues for the use of council-owned piers, however, that still leaves a whopping £ million gap in the required funding.If past experience of other CMAL projects is anything to go by, the planned eight per cent increase in council harbour fees and charges up to   is not going to cover it.Fergus Gillanders, KilmelfordSir,Last year, , was challenging and, although many people like to give generously to charity at Christmas time, it may have been dficult to make a donation this festive season.It#s not too late # you can still help support the Royal National Institute of Blind Peopleby collecting and donating used stamps from cards and parcels you may have received.Your stamps will be recycled and turned into vital funds that will help RNIB support children with vision impairment.

These additional consumers will need more food while Scotland’s multial land can also meet, at the same time, the growing demand for a range of goods and services that hits targets on climate change, the environment, renewable energy, bioersity, and the wider and hugely important rural economy.#To move forward urgently, let us identy all the means and mechanisms we can put in place.  Let us have credibility for farmers by investing in bioeconomy, bioenergy, agro-forestry, precision farming, and shorter food chains – support for which is within the Government’s gt.#NFUS has been promoting our industry as one that can change to meet public goods for public money requirements, with an upbeat forward-looking mindset. This outlook will empower our farmers and crofters and drive us forward to the holy grail of sustainable profit with all the environmental, welfare and standards the public expect as thefor their investment and support for our industry.#In , the black cloud of COVID- needs swept away, a process driven by the vaccines that our scientists have developed, and lessons learned on the things we should do better but also how we have adapted and adopted new methods for good.#People should be more accepting of others’ views with ambition to work collaboratively for mutual benefit. There is a belief binary tribalism is ‘the norm’ and the use of social media to promulgate the “yer either for us or agin us” culture is acceptable. It is not hard being considerate and kind.#Agriculture also urgently needs delivery of an ambitious coherent policy delivering a sustainable profitable industry that addresses climate change, bioersity and an increasing demand for nutritious high standard and welfare food. Procrastination has a price.#Brexit will go by, like foot and mouth, the oil crisis, and the great depression, but we need enough freedom and flexibility to be able to innovate and chose our own paths through it as well.#We need to throw open our doors to the public and build trust on what we do and how we do it. There is huge potential from selling our story both on farm and in the food chain. We also need to encourage more ersity in our industry across the piece it can and will add value both financially and culturally.#To quote Shihab Kazi: #The moment you need to get started is called #now#.##I wish everyone health wealth and happiness for the coming year.#"},{"url":null,"title":"golf club responds to covid restrictions","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

And it includes nursery schools, as well as primary and secondary schools.Ms Sturgeon said: \"I want to be clear that it remains our priority to get school buildings open again for all pupils as quickly as possible and then keep them open.\"However, right now, two factors mean that it is not consistent with a safety-first approach for all children to attend school in person.\"First, the overall level of community transmission is too high. We need to get transmission down before schools can safely reopen. A period of online learning will also, in turn, help us do that.\"The second reason is that there is still signicant uncertainty about the impact of the new iant on transmission amongst young people.\"We, therefore, have to adopt a cautious approach.\"So most pupils will be learning online for at least the rest of the month.\"This decision will be reviewed on January  whether they canto school on February .Meeting people outdoorsFrom tomorrow,the rule on outdoor gatherings will change.Previously, up to six people from two households are able to meet outdoors. Given the greater transmissibility of this new iant, the Scottish Government willconsider it necessary to restrict that further.From tomorrow, a maximum of two people from up to two households will be able to meet outdoors.Children aged  and under will not be counted in that limit, and they will also be able to play outdoors in larger groups, including in organized gatherings.However, for everyone  ndash including  to -year-olds - outdoor exercise should only take place in a way which is consistent with the twopeople from twohouseholds rule.Working from homeAnyone who is able to work from home must do so.It will only be a reasonable excuse to leave your home to go to workthat work cannot be done from home.The Scottish Government are asking people and businesses to take this \"really seriously\" because the situation is at least as serious now as it was then.The law already requires many businesses in certain sectors to close in Level .Every business is being asked to look again at their operations and to make sure that every singlethat can be done by people working at home, is being done in that way.Shielding advice changesIf you were shielding and you cannot work from home, our clear advice now is that you should not go into work at all.Hospitals near capacityNicola Sturgeon confirmed that thetotal number of Covid- patients in hospital is close to its April peak.In terms of hospital beds, NHS Ayrshire and Arran is currently at % of its Covid- capacity, and three other health boards - Borders, GreaterGlasgow  Clyde and Lanarkshire - are above % of their capacity.The total number of patients in intensive care in Scotland is already above normal winter levels. Indeed, all mainland health boards have now exceeded their normal intensive care unit capacity.And it is important to be clear that people who are in hospital and ICU now are likely to have been infected  days to twoweeks ago.Other restrictions will also come into effect includingplaces of worship closing,no wakes, two-metre distancing in canteens and further premises closing.The fortnightly review will not simply be a choice between opening and closing schools - we will always seek to maximise the number of pupils we can safely get back to classrooms and nurseries.What help will be provided Grants areavailable for businesses required to close as a result of restrictions.

Failure to comply will lead to an immediate pound fine.There will be a limited number of exemptions, including hauliers, children under , crews, arrivals from the Common Travel Area with Ireland and for those travelling from countries without the infrastructure available to deliver tests.The move follows the decision to suspend all direct travel from South Africa following the emergence there of a new strain of coronavirus thought potentially to be even more virulent than the mutant iant which has led cases to surge in the UK.Mr Shapps said: ldquoWe already have signicant measures in place to prevent imported cases of Covid-, but with new strains of the virus developing internationally, we must take further precautions.ldquoTaken together with the existing mandatory self-isolation period for passengers ing from high-risk countries, pre-departure tests will provide a further line of defence ndash helping us control the virus as we roll out the vaccine at pace over the coming weeks.The announcement comes at a time when the latest lockdown restrictions across the four nations of the UK mean there is very little international travel.The airline industry ndash which has been devastated by the pandemic ndash acknowledged the need for the restrictions but urged ministers to lt them as quickly as possible.Tim Alderslade, the chief executive of the industry body Airlines UK, said: ldquoThis should be a short-term, emergency measure only and once the rollout of the vaccine accelerates, the focus must be on ing travel to normal as quickly as possible in order to support the UKrsquos economic recovery.Under the new rules, passengers will need to present proof of a negative test result to their carrier on boarding while the UK Border Force will conduct spot checks on arrivals.All passengers arriving from countries not on the Governmentrsquos travel corridor list will still be required to self-isolate for  days, regardless of their test result.Hauliers crossing the Channel to France will also still need a negative test before departure following a decision by the French government on Thursday.Meanwhile, First Minister Mark Drakeford has announced lockdown restrictions in Wales will be strengthened in ldquokey areas to try to halt the spread of the new iant.He warned that unless there was a ldquosignicant drop in cases before January  ndash when the next three-week review of the regulations is carried out ndash school and college students will continue to learn online until the February half-term.In Scotland places of worship across the mainland will close from Friday as the latest set of coronavirus restrictions continue across the country.On Thursday, Boris Johnson pledged an ldquounprecedented national effort to rollout the vaccine to nearly  million of the most vulnerable people by mid-February.At a No  news conference, he acknowledged there would be some ldquolumpiness and bumpiness but pledged that all elderly care residents will have been offered the jab by the end of January.The pressures on the health service were laid bare by NHS England chief executive Sir Simon Stevens who said there were % more patients in hospital with Covid than there were at the peak of the first wave in April, and , admissions since Christmas Day.vw,vw,px, px\"In Northern Ireland, hospitals have been cancelling planned operations due to a surge of patients with coronavirus.There was however a ray of light with the news critically ill Covid- patients admitted to intensive care units will be able to receive new drugs that can ldquosignicantly reduce the risk of death as well as time spent in hospital by up to  days.NHS patients will have access to tocilizumab and sarilumab ndash which are typically used to treat rheumatoid arthritis ndash under updated guidance due to be issued by the Government and the NHS to trusts across the UK..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Travellers must test negative for Covid to enter England and Scotland"},{"url":null,"title":"down memory lane january 01 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Thorne Security says it could have a system in operation for £,, less than half the amount the  previously thought it would cost.The system would include four cameras to cover Main Street, Longrow, Burnside Square and the area around Hall Street and the cross.Four special television screens at Campbeltown Police Station would allow the police to watch the pictures from the cameras. The images would be recorded on an industrial-quality video recorder at the station. The pictures could alert the police to trouble or help them trace offenders.The team from Thorne Security will be visiting Campbeltown at the end of January to demonstrate the equipment.The secretary of the , Sergeant Douglas Reid of Campbeltown police, has already contacted the Scottish Office for more details about the funding package. Sergeant Reid said: ‘The  is fully committed, following the tremendous public response, to go in as far as possible along this road.’The  is already planning to apply to other local and national bodies for contributions towards the cost of the system.The Scottish Office’s challenge competition will make funds available for groups representing local communities to bid for money to fund CCTV systems.Applicants from dferent areas will bid in competition with each other for a share of the government cash.The first town centre security camera system in Scotland was set up in Airdrie three years ago. New research shows that in the first two years after the system was set up, the crime rate plunged by  per cent.The Scottish Office says there is no evidence that crime was simply being shted to areas outwith the reach of the cameras. Instead the total amount of recorded crime actually fell.FIFTY YEARS AGOMcCartney again!Mr Paul McCartney, ex-bass guitarist with the Beatles, has recently purchased from Mr A Revie, Loch Ranachan Farm, which comprises  acres and adjoins his other farm, High Park.Mr McCartney has been spending a few days on the farm with his we and family over the festive season.One happy Rangers fanMr Crawford Morans of  Albyn Avenue, who is employed with the Ministry of Social Security, has had a good ending to the old year.

In the Clyde, however, the Board of Trade did not insist on this in respect of vessels trading exclusively within what is known as the smooth water area.This area was within an imaginary line drawn from Skipness Point to Fairlie. On the date in question, the accused conveyed a cargo from Glasgow to Tobermory via the Crinan Canal.As soon as he had left Crinan, he was in contravention of the regulations, having entered the more hazardous waters off the west coast.On behalf of the accused, an agent stated that he had traded with the Bloodhound for nearly  years. During the war, the ship had been requisitioned by the Ministry of Shipping, and under the orders of that department had been sent outside the limits of the smooth water area.The accused had naturally thought that what he had been doing during the war, when he traded to ports on Islay and the Ayrshire coast, he was free to do now.Sherf Macmaster Campbell imposed a penalty of £."},{"url":null,"title":"leader january 1 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

It is unrealistic to think these slots can be cancelled and re-booked with just a few days’ notice and there is a very real risk that thousands of these vaccination slots will be wasted.#This flies in the face of the Scottish Government’s plans to get as many people vaccinated as quickly as possible.#The Scottish Government needs to honour the agreed dates for the second dose vaccinations to prevent wastage and any undue stress on already under-pressure health and social care staff.#Willie Duffy, UNISON Scotland#s head of health, said: #There was no consultation with trade unions on this policy change and it is not supported by clear evidence from Pfizer which will seriously diminish the trust and confidence of staff who had consented to the two doses.#There is also widespread confusion, inconvenience of rescheduling and, more importantly, a serious risk that doses of the vaccine may need to be destroyed due to lack of time to make new appointments for first doses for other staff.#It is vital the Scottish Government sees sense and commits to the scheduled second dose vaccination dates.#"},{"url":null,"title":"argyll residents incredible efforts recognised in new years honours","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

More than £ million of this we have been grateful to receive at Sightsavers.Money raised by players has been indispensable in helping Sightsavers to fund, in  alone, eye services for more than , people and more than  sight-saving cataract surgeries.In , funding also helped us to support the Covid- response. Children with disabilities kept learning throughout the pandemic, thanks to distance learning equipment and teacher training, PPE and hygiene kits.Children like Marie in Sierra Leone, who is blind and was in danger of being left behind when schools closed, until she was given a typewriter, a radio and assistance so that she could keep studying.So, once again, a big thank you to all the players in Scotland for your generosity.To find out about some of the lives being turned around by players# support, please head on over to www.sightsavers.org ppl or give Sightsavers a call on   .Dr Caroline Harper CBE, Sightsavers CEO.Scots have taken to online technology like never before to keep in touch during this dficult time.When we first went into lockdown, there were concerns on whether our networks would cope with this big increase in online traffic. But, although customers’ usage of data more than doubled during the period, our networks were able to stand up to the demands.I’m immensely proud of the role my colleagues have played in keeping the country connected during this crisis. From the engineers who keep our broadband and mobile networks connected, to the vital contact centre staff in Glasgow, Dundee, Greenock, Edinburgh and Thurso, helping people when they need it most.I’m proud also of the role our people played in supporting the NHS in Scotland during the crisis, including working with Scottish Government to quickly provide communications to the temporary hospitals.The pandemic has shown the vital role digital technology and internet connectivity now plays in all our lives. If all homes and businesses are going to stay ahead, we know that fast and reliable broadband and good mobile coverage is going to be essential for the post-Covid recovery.While BT Group continues to invest billions in these networks, we know that we can’t do this alone. We’ll continue to work with governments and local authorities to make sure that no areas are left behind.Jane Wood, BT Group Scotland director.The  Covid crisis has prompted a greater sense of social cohesion and solidarity but it also exposed and exacerbated some of the barriers that blind and partially sighted people still face.Access to online shopping slots, a lack of essential health information in formats such as audio and braille, and confusion over whether social distancing allowed for blind and partially sighted people to still be guided added to the distress many felt.The first lockdown came out of the blue when we had little real-le experience of managing a national emergency, but it is now more essential than ever that we learn the lessons and ensure no one falls through the safety-net. Another period of enforced confinement during the winter months could hit some particularly hard.During the first lockdown, RNIB Scotland and other charities worked extremely hard to ensure the needs of the most vulnerable were met # at a time when even the most able in society were thrown by the suddenness and uncertainty the crisis had created.We negotiated set online shopping slots for people with sight loss, worked with public bodies to ensure the often vital information they put out was available in formats accessible to everyone, and claried the rules on guiding people with a visual impairment.These gains must be reinforced  we are ing to another nationwide lockdown.Currently, around , people are living in Scotland with signicant sight loss. Although most are over the age of , around , children and young people also have a visual impairment.The RNIB Helpline remains available on    and information continues to be broadcast on RNIB#s Connect Radio station. The RNIB Talking Book library posts and downloads thousands of titles in audio and other formats.Find out more at www.rnib.org.uk scotlandJames Adams, director, RNIB Scotland.As always in such matters, the UK-EU Brexit deal will iniably throw up more than a few surprises aside from the usual headlines heralding a British #victory# in negotiations.The fact that, for example, seed potatoes are not to be included in the deal will be deeply damaging to our rural economy. Scottish seed potato farmers are one of the biggest exporters of potatoes, used in the production of chips and crisps, in the world.The sector in Scotland accounts for around  per cent of UK production and is worth about £ million annually.One fth of these exports go to the EU, amounting to more than , tonnes a year.This is clearly a disastrous Brexit outcome for Scottish farmers and like all other aspects of Brexit, foisted on Scotland against its will.A terrible negotiating failure on the part of the Tory government, and a devastating blow to an extremely valuable part of Scotland’s farming industry, I am sure it will not be the first damaging impact to be highlighted once the deal is fully analysed.Alex Orr, Edinburgh."},{"url":null,"title":"meet kintyres heroic davids","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Following enforced shut-down in March , CPH was able to re-open from September to December, one of very few cinemas in the UK to do so.At CGS, Mr Fyfe had to consider the iety of needs of the school#s children and their parents, his own needs and those of his family as he supported the entire network of staff, which includes several more Davids # music teacher David Cosgrove and maths teachers David Hamilton and David MacDonald.The heroic work of all the school#s staff through lockdown ranges from supervising vulnerable and key workers# children in the HUB and the challenges of online learning, to packing and distributing food parcels and delivering hot lunches in the community.As leboat coxswain, Mr Cox leads a crew which includes several heroic Davids # David Mullen, David Ward, David Campbell, David Colville and David Reid.Despite still having to attend all call-outs, in full kit and PPE, the team#s training came to a halt soon into the first lockdown, but they were eventually able toto training on a two-week rotation, one week on land, the other offshore.Having to physically distance proved incredibly hard for the crew, with multiple people required to safely carry out some tasks.Even small rescues using the Y-Boat # the vessel on top of the Severn-class leboat, not to be confused with the inshore rescue boat which is towed on a trailer # presented challenges given the amount of space on the boat.Masks were, and continue to be, worn inside the wheelhouse at all times and when working closely together outside on the deck.These Davids # and, of course, so many other people in the community # helped navigate the community through unprecedented and challenging circumstances in many dferent ways.If you know of a heroic David who deserves a shout-out, please let us know by emailing editor@campbeltowncourier or telephoning  .CAPTIONS:David Cox.

There was heavy traffic and, needless to say, Irsquod never driven a bus before and hadnrsquot expected to at this moment either.ldquoYou mean drive the bus  I foolishly asked.ldquoThatrsquos why you are here, isnrsquot it  he replied.I was on the bus with two other learners, as well as the instructor. We had been given some rudimentary instructions by him as hersquod driven the bus into the busy city centre, but I hadnrsquot realised we would actually have to drive the bus through busy streets.That was the first time I had driven a bus. It was, of course, an assessment of my capabilities. I negotiated as best I could and quickly learned what a tail swing was, as I nearly shaved off the nose of a woman who was standing on the edge of a pavement waiting to cross the road!The gearstick felt like it had been cemented to the vehicle, making changing gears a Herculean effort, with the engine roaring as I struggled to crunch it into gear. I drove slowly and cars began honking their horns in frustration.There was a big L on the rear of the bus, but I think when people see a bus in the city centre they assume the person driving actually knows how to drive a bus!It was a stressful  minutes and, when I finally pulled over, the instructor looked at his notes shaking his head. I cannot repeat what he said, but it was a generally negative assessment with lots of adjectives.Yet I wasnrsquot written off and was told I needed six full days of lessons as a minimum before sitting my test. Against everyonersquos expectations, including mine, I passed first time.I had done it and realised one of my lersquos dreams.There was a specic reason I needed a bus driving licence: I wanted to be a driver guide and take people around Scotland on tour. My le had undergone some dramatic changes and my le ambitions had changed as a result.It wasnrsquot, of course, about money or climbing a career ladder, but about the hopeful expectation it would make me rich in experiences and give me a new angle on le.My head and heart were full of Scotlandrsquos stories, and this seemed a perfect way to use my love of history and folklore, and share my passion for the landscape that held so many personal memories for me. I felt my le was about to be transformed and indeed it was.So that day I passed my bus driving test was a day of utter joy. Although over  years ago now, I can still feel the elation.I worked for dferent tour companies at dferent times in my le over the following  years. It was something I couldto whenever I needed it. During the last period of my time as a driver guide, a transport manager called Ronnie worked miracles as he juggled my rota to fit round my very complicated childcare arrangements. I will be forever grateful to him for his understanding.Were my expectations of the job realised or did I have an over-romanticised image of it  Irsquod say a bit of both. I tried my best to showcase Scotland, but I quickly understood people travel for dferent reasons with dferent interests.But it opened a window on the world for me. I met so many people from dferent walks of le and dferent countries and cultures. It taught me so much about the way humans behave towards each other and how we handle and respond to experiences in dfering ways.We were all on mini le journeys together, usually three days, sometimes five. In this brief fleck of time, a small group of people would be together amidst the splendour, and sometimes challenging conditions, of Scotland. When connections were made, it was because of shared values, regardless of cultural dferences.I began to see the tours as a metaphor for the way we live our lives, not just in observing others but myself as well. I had never thought the job would be a lesson on the philosophy of le, but that is partly what it became for me.It revealed to me that happiness, enjoyment and appreciation is a default within us, not something to be found, bought or acquired, or even weather dependent!That now seems so obvious but it took years for me to truly understand how we can become so easily trapped in the hedonic treadmill. I know thatrsquos a fancy term, but its meaning is simple: that as we go through le, we quickly take things for granted and so seek new and higher levels of satisfaction which we believe will give us happiness. While we can get a rush of pleasure and satisfaction in new things or experiences, we soon then take those for granted as well. So the cycle continues. We become like dogs chasing our tails in pursuit of what we think will make us happy or give us a more fulfilled le.The tours taught me that appreciation is the key to this. You donrsquot have to be a tour guide to learn this lesson, of course, as we all have our lersquos experiences that teach us. But that treadmill is so easy to fall into, even when you know it offers a  dawn. It can take a conscious effort to climb out of it.That is when we need what is called a hedonic reset: another fancy term for stopping that chase of our tail and taking time to appreciate what we have. This can be done by temporarily depriving ourselves of things we take for granted and so regaining our appreciation of them.A simple example could be when we go camping. I love it, but when I get home I appreciate my bed, my shower and central heating in ways I didnrsquot before we left on our camping trip!The virus has forced a reset on all of us it has taken away many things we took for granted: travel, staying with friends, family meals, a coffee and blether with a friend, hugging loved ones, being with loved ones, browsing in a bookshop. We will all have our list.It has been heartbreaking, with devastating consequences for so many peoplersquos livelihoods and emotional wellbeing, as well as a tragic loss of le.Itrsquos an unwanted, brutal and forced reset, but the le lesson I learnt on the tours has helped me understand that appreciation is the key to resilience and getting through this as best as we can.When times relax, as they hopefully will soon, I know how much I will appreciate hugging my daughter I havenrsquot been able to hug for  months, being able to tell stories to a live audience and have a coffee with a friend in a real cafe. And travel to the places I love within my own country.Perhapsthere is any positive out of this, I hope it will be that I will never again fall into that treadmill of taking things I have for granted.So I say Happy New Year to you, and I mean it in a heartfelt way I never meant before."},{"url":null,"title":"vet-column-consider-welcoming-new-pet","story":"ONCE your new puppy or kitten has settled into your household, there are several things to consider, ensuring your new pet is kept fit and healthy.Register with your veterinary surgeon. This gives immediate reassurancea problem does arise with your pet.At Dunedin Vets, we offer free puppy and kitten checks and for all new pets as soon as you acquire them this may be carried out by telephone during these Covid- times. Lots of advice is given by vets, qualied veterinary nurses and reception staff.Everyone is thinking about vaccination against coronavirus for humans just now. Vaccination has been the major controller of lethal diseases since the process was developed by Edward Jenner centuries ago.We must vaccinate our pets to prevent several fatal conditions. Pups can be vaccinated from six weeks of age. However, vaccinating at  and  weeks of age is the new normal during this Covid- pandemic, when most vaccinations are given.Pups should be kept isolated until two weeks after the first vaccination, then limited contact with other dogs until after the second vaccine. Boosters are given annually against parvovirus, distemper, hepatitis leptospirosis and kennel cough.It is advisable to vaccinate your kitten against cat flu, feline enteritis and feline leukaemia. Two vaccines are usually given three weeks apart from nine weeks of age. Kittens should be kept isolated until one week after the second vaccine. Boosters are given annually against cat flu, feline enteritis and feline leukaemia.Rabbits can be vaccinated against myxomatosis and rabbit haemorrhagic disease , of which there are two strains. One vaccine against the two agents can be given from six weeks of age. Boosters are given annually.Everyone loves a new puppy or kitten, but please be aware of unscrupulous dealers who take advantage of the kind and loving nature of the majority of people.Recently, Kimberly Mackie visited Dunedin Vetsrsquo Tranent surgery with her new puppy Poppy. Poppy is a Jack Russell cross Chihuahua, so is a very small pup. However, Poppy arrived with diarrhoea and very dehydrated, weighing only a few hundred grams.Poppy was examined by vet Chris Monk, who immediately saw how ill little Poppy was.Mum had bought her in all good faith from a family home. It was soon discovered that Poppy had been microchipped and had a vaccination in Eire. Poppy was an import from Eire, a victim of the illegal puppy farming trade.It is so dficult for new owners to know the origin of their pup, especially when the sellers can seem so plausible. Ask to see the parents or at least the mother and other pups in the litter, although they find many ways to circumvent these questions. It is also so dficult toa puppy or kitten once you have cuddled them and instantly fallen in love.The good news is that Poppy, after fluid therapy and medications, and lots of loving care from Dunedin Vets staff and, of course, his forever mum, has made a full recovery and is developing her own special character.We must also consider other preventable conditions which our pets may be susceptible to.Most puppies and kittens are born with a roundworm infestation. Worms are passed to them before birth by their mothers and through motherrsquos milk. This is obviously not very pleasant and potentially these worms pose a risk for humans, especially children.Tapeworms are rarely a problem in puppies and kittens, although one type is actually transmitted by fleas.We recommend worming puppies and kittens at eight,  and  weeks of age with a quality wormer in tablet or liquid form, which will kill most worms.Remember, there may be no obvious signs of worm infestation.Worming should be carried out every three months for the rest of your petrsquos le.Many puppies and kittens arrive at their new home with a population of external parasites. These include fleas and mites.Fleas are passed from one animal to another. Although there are dferent types of dog and cat fleas, they donrsquot mind what they jump onto to feed!Fleas are two to three millimetres long and move quickly through the coat. Flea droppings are black and gritty, and turn reddamp cotton wool is applied to them.Fleas can transmit several diseases, cause allergies and general irritation. Fleas live on your pet, and in the house.You must use a suitable insecticide spray to destroy flea larvae, which can survive for months in the environment. Your veterinary staff can advise what is best for your pet and your home.The rabbit flea is unusual in that it doesnrsquot move very fast. They are often found along the edge of catsrsquo ears and are dficult to remove, so are called lsquostick tightrsquo fleas. Cats pick them up when hunting wild rabbits.Walking dandruff mitesare very common in puppies, kittens and bunnies. They are too small to see but occasionally skin scurf appears to move, which is actually the mites, hence the name.Mange mitesare minute parasites which bury into the skin. Some are passed from mother to young and some spread from pet to pet. Some cause intense scratching, some cause hair loss. Some can be very dficult to treat, requiring specialised anti-parasitic washes or spot on treatment.Ear mites live in the ear canals, causing irritation, lots of wax production and a smell.At Dunedin Vets, we strongly recommend taking out insurance for your pet at a young age. Many breeders will provide initial insurance cover, and many vets will offer free insurance with certain companies for a few weeks. This gives peace of mind whilst you are considering which insurance to purchase. We suggest you look for a lsquolelong coverrsquo policy so your pet will always be covered.Consider a pet health club for your new arrival. Many veterinary practices, including Dunedin Vets, offer this type of scheme. Basically, you spread the cost of your petrsquos preventative healthcare over the year rather than being faced with large bills at booster time, so allowing you to budget monthly for this.Dunedin Vetsrsquo pet health club offers many other benefits and discounts. During these dficult times, many people are finding this a great way to ensure the best care for their pets without burdening themselves financially.Puppies, kittens and bunnies bring so much love to a family and help so much in your wellbeing ndash choose wisely, and look after them well, and you will have a friend and companion for le."},{"url":null,"title":"east-lothian-peeps-past-december-29-31-1995-1970-1920","story":"lsquoPLEASE drink up... the pub is on firersquo was a headline in the East Lothian Courier on December , .Time was called early at the Auld Hoose pub in North Berwick last Wednesday after a fire broke out in the public bar.Customers spotted smoke coming from the floor near a fireplace about pm and the local fire brigade was alerted.The premises were evacuated ndash including an upstairs flat occupied by Jean Borthwick and her Labrador dog, Freeway ndash as landlord Ian McMinn tried to tackle the blaze with a fire extinguisher containing powder.But help was soon at hand in the shape of his brother Hugh, a local fireman, and the rest of the retained crew who began fighting the dense smoke and flames.Sub-officer McMinn explained that cracks in the old hearth at the pubrsquos real fire had caused joists and beams on the floor to burn.AN EAST Lothian pupil became the first from his high school to be accepted to study at the University of Cambridge, reported The Haddingtonshire Courier of December , .Ian Graham, son of Sergeant and Mrs Graham, Tranent, has been accepted for entry into Emmanuel College, Cambridge, in October .Ian is at present in his sixth year at the Ross High School.He was Dux of the School in his fth year and is at present Head Boy.He is a young man of high intellectual ability but at the same time he is an accomplished games player, playing in the School XV and also in the Badminton Club.He is an office-bearer in the Literary and Debating Society and last summer was a gold medallist in athletics at the Scottish Schools Athletics Championships.A MAN was fined pound after being caught stealing a bird from a train station, as reported in The Haddingtonshire Courier of December , .In the Burgh Court, on Friday, before Bailie Main, James Kelly, railway porter, Church Street, Haddington, pleaded guilty to having, on Tuesday, st, stolen a cockerel from a hamper lying in the booking-hall of the station.The Fiscal stated that, about eight orsquoclock on the night in question, a booking-clerk heard a person entering the booking-hall on tip-toe.On going out, he found Kelly alongside the hamper.He made the excuse that the label had been torn off the hamper, and that he was putting it on.The label was afterwards found lying on the floor, but it was discovered that the hamper had been opened and the cockerel removed."},{"url":null,"title":"7am-wait-worth-mum-bonnie-babies-champion-2020-harris-tait","story":"Harris Tait, who celebrated his first birthday on December , was announced as the winner in last weekrsquos Courier.He lives on East Lintonrsquos Longstone Avenue with mum Kirsty, , and dad Andrew, , a maintenance team leader at Torness Power Station.Kirsty described Harris as a ldquofunny and cheeky little boy with ldquosuch a little personality.She added: ldquoHe knows what he wants and is a determined little guy, which I think he takes from me and Andrew.Kirsty, who has been on maternity leave this year but is ing to work on Monday as a customer trade manager at Asda in Livingston, said Harrisrsquo win had been a boost to the family after what has been a tumultuous year.She said: ldquoItrsquos not really been the greatest year and hersquos not been able to interact with other kids and I thought, lsquoWhat have we got to lose rsquo so decided to enter him.ldquoYou never think that you are going to win competitions like these.When the results were announced in last weekrsquos Courier, Kirsty said she was ldquobuzzing and ldquoa bit emotional.

I will set out our decisions shortly.However, I can confirm now, in summary, that we decided to introduce from midnight tonight for the duration of January, a legal requirement to stay at home except for essential purposes. This is similar to the lockdown of March last year.However, before I set out Cabinetrsquos decisions in more detail, I want to explain in some detail why they are so necessary.In the last few weeks, there have been two signicant game changers in our fight against this virus.One, the approval of vaccines, is hugely positive and offers us the way out of this pandemic.But the other - the new faster spreading iant of the virus - is a massive blow.Possibly the most simple way of explaining the challenge we face right now is to compare it to a race.In one lane we have vaccines - our job is to make sure they can run as fast as possible.Thatrsquos why the government will be doing everything we can to vaccinate people as quickly as possible. I will say more about that later.But in the other lane is the virus which - as a result of this new iant - has just learned to run much faster and has most definitely picked up pace in the last couple of weeks.To ensure that the vaccine wins the race, it is essential to speed up vaccination as far as possible.But to give it the time it needs to get ahead, we must also slow the virus down.And because it is now spreading faster, that means even tougher restrictions are necessary.The evidence is now compelling that the new iant is up to % more transmissible than previously circulating strains, and that it may add as much as . to the R number.And according to recent analysis of PCR test samples, it appears that the new iant already accounts for almost half of all new cases in Scotland.That increased and faster spread is undoubtedly driving the very serious situation we now face.Todayrsquos case numbers ndash , new cases, with % of tests being positive - illustrate the severity and urgency of the situation.No new deaths were reported today ndash because yesterday was a Sunday and registration offices were largely closed ndash but since I updated Parliament before Christmas,  deaths have been recorded in the daily figures. That again reminds us of the continuing grief this pandemic is causing.But this is not just about one dayrsquos numbers.We are now seeing a steeply rising trend of infections.Indeed, it is no exaggeration to say that I am more concerned about the situation we face now than I have been at any time since March last year.In the week from  to  December, the seven day incidence of cases per , of the population increased by % - from  per , to  per ,.Test positivity has risen sharply too.The next update on the numbers of Covid patients in hospital and intensive care will be published tomorrow.I would expect these to show that, nationally, the total number of Covid patients in hospital is close to its April peak. And in some boards, the pressure is already very real.For example, in terms of hospital beds, NHS Ayrshire and Arran is currently at % of its Covid capacity, and three other health boards - Borders, Greater Glasgow  Clyde and Lanarkshire - are above % of their capacity.The number of people in intensive care is still signicantly lower than the April peak ndash which partly reflects the fact that treatment of Covid has improved signicantly since last spring.But even so, the total number of patients in intensive care in Scotland is already above normal winter levels. Indeed, all mainland health boards have now exceeded their normal intensive care unit capacity.And it is important to be clear that people who are in hospital and ICU now are likely to have been infected  days to  weeks ago.That means that these numbers reflect what the level of new cases was around  weeks ago.Given that the number of cases has increased signicantly since then, we can expect to see signicantly increased pressure on the NHS over the course of this month.Contingency plans remain in place to double and then treble ICU capacitynecessary.And the NHS Louisa Jordan continues to be available to help meet demand - as indeed it has been doing in recent months. , patients have attended there for scans and outpatient appointments nearly , NHS staff and students have been trained there and it is currently being used for Covid vaccinations.In short, NHS services are coping at present ndash although the pressure on frontline staff is considerable - but already in some areas the position is fragile, and getting more challenging.Andthe rate of increase in case numbers that we have seen in past two weeks was to continue unchecked, there would be a real risk of our NHS being overwhelmed - even with contingency plans in place.In fact, our modelling suggests that without further intervention, we could breach inpatient Covid capacity within  or  weeks.And, of course, a sharply increasing number of cases, in human terms, means many more people becoming ill and dying.All of that explains why we have to act quickly and decisively.The situation in some other parts of the UK - where case numbers are already much higher than here, and where the contribution of the new iant is already greater - shows what may lie aheadwe donrsquot.As things stand, we estimate that we are possibly about four weeks behind the position in London and the south east.The rapid acceleration in London began when it was at about  new cases a week, for every hundred thousand people. Thatrsquos the level Scotland was at a week ago.London is now seeing  new cases a week per ,. Test positivity is around %. And pressure on NHS services is acute.We have an opportunity in Scotland to avert the situation here deteriorating to that extent.But we must act quickly.The advice of our clinical advisers is clear that the increased transmissibility of the new iant means that the current level  measures may not be sufficient to bring the R number back below .It is essential that we further limit interaction between dferent households to stem the spread and bring the situation back under control, while we vaccinate more people.In short, we mustfor a period to a situation much closer to the lockdown of last March.Let me therefore set out in more detail the decisions Cabinet has reached.It is important to stress that these are not decisions taken lightly. I am acutely aware of the impact they will have and I know they will not be welcome.But they are in our judgment essential.As government, our clear and overriding duty right now is to act quickly to save lives and protect the NHS.We know that delay or preication in the face of this virus almost always makes things worse not better - evenit stems from an understandable desire that we all share to wait for more data or evidence.To turn to the decisions in detail. The decisions I will speak about a bit later on schools, let me be clear at this stage, they will apply to all parts of Scotland. However other decisions that I will outline will apply to those parts of Scotland currently at level , which of course is all of mainland Scotland, and they are effectively an enhancement to level .The island areas currently in level  will remain there for now, although we will continue to monitor them very carefully.These additional level  restrictions - essentially ing us to a position similar to the lockdown of last March - will be in place for the whole of January. We will keep them closely under review.However, I cannot at this stage rule out keeping them in place longer, nor making further changes. Nothing about this is easy.The first measure is that our fundamental advice, for everyone, is to stay at home.That is the single best way of staying safe.We consider that this stay at home message and advice is now so important that, from tomorrow, it will become law, just as it was in the lockdown last year.This means it will only be permissible to leave home for an essential purpose.This will include, for example, caring responsibilities, essential shopping, exercise and being part of an extended household.In addition, anyone who is able to work from home, must do so. It will only be a reasonable excuse to leave your home to go to work,that work cannot be done from home.We are asking people and businesses to take this really seriously ndash as we all did in March, during the first lockdown, - because the situation is at least as serious now as it was then.The law already requires many businesses in certain sectors to close in Level . We now need every business to look again at their operations, and to make sure that every singlethat can be done by people working at home, is being done in that way.Businesses have already shown a tremendous capacity to adapt during this pandemic and Irsquom very grateful to them for that - and we need them to consider their operations again, as we all work together to reduce transmissions.The Economy Secretary will be speaking to business organisations about this, including this afternoon. We will also engage with unions on these issues. And we will continue to considermore regulatory action is required.We are also providing new guidance for people who are in the shielding category.If you were shielding and you cannot work from home, our clear advice now is that you should not go into work at all.The Chief Medical Officer is writing to everyone who falls into this category, and his letter will count as a Fit Note for those who need it.Unlike the lockdown last year, the frequency of outdoor exercise is not being limited.It is important for physical and mental health that we can get outdoors for fresh air and exercise as much as possible.However, from tomorrow, the rule on outdoor gatherings will change.As of now, up to six people from two households are able to meet outdoors. Given the greater transmissibility of this new iant, we consider it necessary to restrict that further.From tomorrow, a maximum of two people from up to two households will be able to meet outdoors.Children aged  and under will not be counted in that limit, and they will also be able to play outdoors in larger groups, including in organized gatherings.However, for everyone  ndash including  to  year olds - outdoor exercise should only take place in a way which is consistent with the  people from  households rule.In addition, strict travel restrictions remain in place across Scotland. From tomorrow,you live in a level  area - as the majority of us do - you cannot leave your home except for an essential purpose. When you do go out, stay as close to home as possible and stay away from crowded places.And it remains the case ndash and let me stress this point - that no-one is allowed to travel into or out of Scotland unless it is for an essential purpose.Presiding OfficerA number of other measures will come into effect on Friday of this week.It is with real regret that we consider it necessary for places of worship to close during this period for all purposes except broadcasting a service, or conducting a funeral, wedding or civil partnership.I am well aware of how important communal worship is to people.But we believe that this restriction is necessary to reduce the risk of transmission.While up to  people will still be able to attend funeral services, wakes will not be possible during January. And a maximum of  people will be able to attend wedding and civil partnership services.Presiding OfficerI know how devastating restrictions like these are and I give an assurance that we will not keep them in place for longer than is absolutely necessary.There will also be additional measures in relation to businesses, in addition to the tightening of the essential retail definition that took effect from Boxing Day.The current  metre exemption for workplace canteens will end ndash so canteens will have to ensure that employees sit  metres or more apart, rather than  metre.The number of non-essential services which remain open will be further restricted.Premises which will need to close as a result of these changes will include, for example ski centres, showrooms of larger retailers, and clinics offering cosmetic and aesthetic procedures.I know that many businesses have already been hit by the restrictions which were put in place on Boxing Day.And of course I know that the vast majority of businesses have taken their responsibilities seriously, and have invested in Covid safety measures.In addition, the move to home working has brought challenges for workers and employers. I am hugely grateful for the way in which businesses and their staff have responded to those challenges.Grants are of course available for businesses required to close as a result of restrictions. That support is in addition to support through the UK wide furlough scheme.The Scottish Governmentrsquos financial support for businesses during the pandemic currently totals more than pound. billion.However, we will continue to assess what more the Scottish government can do ndash either in closure grants or other forms of support - to help businesses and those who work for them.We will also work with councils to ensure community and social support for those who need it, including for parents balancing work and online learning.We will confirm additional resources later this week.Presiding Officer,The final substantive issue I want to address - before giving an update on vaccination - relates to schools.We announced before Christmas that most school pupils would learn remotely ndash rather than in school ndash until Monday  January.I can confirm that we have now decided to extend that date and keep schools closed to the majority of pupils until  February. We will review this again in mid-January.The change will apply to all pupils - except vulnerable children, and children of key workers. And it includes nursery schools, as well as primary and secondary schools.There is no doubt that of all the dficult decisions we have had to take today, this was the most dficult of all and its impact is of course the most severe.The evidence to date makes clear that thanks to the hard work of school staff and pupils, schools in Scotland have been low-risk environments for Covid. We will work with our partners to ensure that remains the case.That will include ongoing work on testing in schools and discussions about when, in the context of the overall programme, it will be possible to vaccinate school staff.And I want to be clear that it remains our priority to get school buildings open again for all pupils as quickly as possible and then keep them open.However, right now, two factors mean that it is not consistent with a safety-first approach for all children to attend school in person.First, the overall level of community transmission is simply too high. We need to get transmission down before schools can safely reopen. A period of online learning will also, in turn, help us do that.The second reason is that there is still signicant uncertainty about the impact of the new iant on transmission amongst young people.We therefore have to adopt a cautious approach at this stage.So most pupils will be learning online for at least the rest of the month.We will review on  January whether they can - as we hope -to school on the  February.I know that remote learning presents signicant challenges for teachers, schools, parents and young people, and we will work to support children and parents throughout this.The Scottish Government, Education Scotland and local authorities are working together to further improve the remote learning options which are available for schools.And it is also worth highlighting that since schools ed after the summer, more than , devices ndash such as laptops ndash have been distributed to children and young people to help with remote learning. More devices are being distributed by councils on a weekly basis, and in total we expect our investment ndashwhich builds on existing local authority action - to benefit around , disadvantaged children and young people across Scotland.I also want to stress one final point.Just as the last places we ever want to close are schools and nurseries - so it is the case that schools and nurseries will be the first places we want to reopen as we re-emerge from this latest lockdown.They remain our priority.That is why we are considering whether and to what extent - consistent with our overall duty to vaccinate the most vulnerable first in line with JCVI recommendations - we can achieve vaccination of school and childcare staff as a priority. Many teachers will of course be vaccinated over coming weeks as part of the JCVI priority list.The fortnightly review will not simply be a choice between opening and closing schools - we will always seek to maximise the number of pupils we can safely get back to classrooms and nurseries.Sothe evidence tells us we can get some pupils back safely, we will do that.However ultimately, the best way of enabling more pupils tomore quickly is by reducing community transmission of the virus as much as possible.And all of us ndash by accepting and abiding by the wider restrictions I have set out today - have a part to play in achieving that.Before I leave the issue of education, let me remind the chamber that we already had plans in place for the staggeredof universities and colleges. We will be considering this week whether any further change is necessary.Presiding OfficerBefore I close today, I want to give a brief update on our current expectations around vaccine supply.The Health Secretary will give a more detailed update on vaccination in a statement the chamber next week.However, I can confirm today that well over , people have now received their first dose of the vaccine.The first doses of the Astra Zeneca vaccine are being administered today.In total, over the period to the end of January - including the more than , already administered - we expect to have access to just over , doses of vaccine. Obviously, we hope that increases.These will be split roughly equally between the Pfizer and Astra Zeneca vaccines.However, we anticipate that some of the Astra Zeneca portion will be available only in the last week of January.We do not yet have certainty on supply schedules beyond January but will keep Parliament updated as these become firmer.However, our current expectation, based on assumptions about supply and the new advice on doses being administered up to  weeks apart, rather than , is that by early May everyone over , and people under  with specic underlying conditions, will have received at least the first dose of vaccine.That is everyone who is on the JCVI priority list, and comprises more than . million people.Once everyone on the priority list has been vaccinated, we will start vaccinating the rest of the population, and will do this in parallel with completing second doses for those on the priority list.Those timetables are of course heavily dependent on vaccine supply. And for that reason, they are at this stage cautious.However, I have tasked our vaccination team with exploring and keeping under ongoing review all options to speed up the rate of vaccination and bring these timescales forward as far as possible.I am grateful for the many offers of assistance we have received and while many of them may not prove possible or practical to take up, they will be consideredThe Health Secretary will say more about all of this in her statement next week.Presiding OfficerTo conclude, this is most certainly not the new year statement I wanted to give.And I know it is a statement no one wanted to hear.But as I said at the beginning, we are now in a race between the vaccine and the virus.The Scottish government will do everything we can to speed up distribution of the vaccine.But all of us must do everything we can to slow down the spread of the virus.We can already see ndash by looking at infection rates where ndash some of what could happen here in Scotlandwe donrsquot act.To prevent that, we need to act immediately and firmly.For government, that means introducing tough measures ndash as we have done so today.And for all of us, it means sticking to the rulesIt means continuing to follow the FACTS guidanceAnd it means ndash above all ndash staying at home.That is again our central message.Stay Home. Save lives. Protect the NHS.If we do this, we give the vaccine the time it needs to get ahead and ultimately win the race.I know that the next few weeks will be incredibly dficult.Irsquom sorry to ask for further sacrices, after nine long months of them. But these sacrices are necessary.And the dference between now and last March is that with the help of vaccines, we now have confidence that these sacrices will pave the way to brighter days ahead.So ndash for everyonersquos sake and safety - please stick with it and stay at home."},{"url":null,"title":"new-lockdown-rules-scotland-covid-restrictions-explained","story":"First Minister Nicola Sturgeon announced the new rules on Monday afternoon, asthe latest restrictions came into effect from midnight today in all Level  areas of the country andwill continue throughout the month.Speaking at Holyrood, Ms Sturgeon said: \"I can confirm now, in summary, that we decided to introduce from tomorrow, for the duration of January, a legal requirement to stay at home except for essential purposes.

A raised bed can be an ideal solution for this.\"Get them involved from the beginning by adding personalised signs and finding out what they would like to grow.

It was also commended for including a system that brakes the car following a crash. The only real negative was that it could cause higher damage to other vehicles in a crash.Seat LeonThe Leon shares a  with the A and therefore scores similarly. However, it did marginally better in adult occupant protection, despite near-identical comments on injury protection. It also received a small penalty for the damage it could cause other vehicles, but otherwise received good marks for protecting passengers from injury.Volkswagen ID.Volkswagens new electric vehicle also underwent testing this year, getting full marks. It performed well in preventing injuries to its passengers, but was also noted for not causing excessive damage to the crash barrier, indicating its also quite friendly to other vehicles in a crash. The main negative was the fact that the dummy moved too far across the vehicle in the side impact test.Toyota YarisThe Yaris might be small but it scored well across the board, receiving maximum points for protecting critical body parts in the side impact test. It also gained praise for having clear information on the front airbag system, which can be disabled for rear-facing child restraints. However, an unclear manual meant it failed on the installation check for some child restraints.Honda JazzAnother small car that performed well is the Jazz, which demonstrated a stable passenger compartment in the offset frontal test. Protection of the passengers was generally good, but was rated as weak for the drivers chest. It was noted that the centre airbag protected passengers colliding with each other in a side impact.Mazda MX-Another electric car, Mazdas new MX received top marks, doing particularly well in adult occupant protection, where it scored %. The report notes that protection of passengers was strong, scoring top marks in both the side barrier test and more severe side pole impact. It was knocked for not having an advanced emergency call system or post-collision braking.Land Rover DefenderLand Rover will be pleased to learn that one of the most highly anticipated new cars of the year scored top marks in testing, despite not being outstanding in any department. Euro NCAP noted that the femur protection score was penalised, as was chest protection of the rear passenger in the full-width rigid wall test. It was also considered an aggressive partner to other vehicles in the event of a crash.Kia SorentoAnother large SUV and another five stars, the Sorento was another that didnt stand out in any particular area but did well overall. Its central airbag, whiplash protection and driver assistance were all rated highly. However, its protection of the drivers chest and right femur was rated weak, with occupant protection rated marginal in this test because structures in the dashboard could cause a risk to occupants of dferent sizes.Isuzu D-MaxThe surprise of the year was the Isuzu D-Max pick-up, which scored top marks despite competing in a segment that is not famous for highlighting safety. It received similar occupant safety comments as the Sorento in the offset frontal test, and was also penalised for how it interacts with other vehicles in a crash. However, it typically scored highly for occupant protection in a iety of crash scenarios, as well as for having an emergency call system."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/12198206.jpg?type=article-full","title":"graphic-content-michel-rabagliati-drawing-life","story":"And yet, downbeat as its subject matter is, Paul at Home is also full of sweetness, good humour and gorgeous cartooning.Here, Rabagliati talks about fictionalising le, dealing with the pandemic and his love of typography :Can we start by asking how much of yourself, Michel, is in Paul  Do you dfer in any way at all Paul is very close to me, I would say % me in terms of his personality, and % me in terms of the things that happen to him ndash the le events.

I was too caught up in my own small le to pay attention to her when I was young, which is a shame.At the same time is there a consolation in putting these events down on the page To be honest, I was sort of looking for redemption or healing to come out of writing this book. But I just never felt that! This book was dficult to make ndash it caused me a lot of sorrow. It was a trap for all my emotions.

Many will often view Scotland as nicely wrapped within a lovely box, tied with a charming tartan bow. Of course, such a positive view is not harmful, in fact, it can be beneficial.What is lacking in America is a depth of understanding about Scotland as an innovative, entrepreneurial, and progressive nation. The Biden Administration is listening and seems to understand the gt Scotland offers the world is so much more profound than to simply view it and the Scottish people as merely delightful.First Minister Sturgeon, numerous Scottish ministers and MPs representing Scotland have made important connections with U.S. leaders over the years and reinforced this message.One excellent connection the FM Sturgeon made was with then Deputy Secretary of State Blinken. It is valuable that Scotland and the United States have an existing relationship between the FM and the future Secretary of State on which to build.The U.S. Government would be wise to expand its presence in Scotland for strategic and economic reasons. Currently, the U.S. has one Foreign Service Officer based in Edinburgh who serves effectively in the U.S. Consulate as Principal Officer.A new U.S. Ambassador to the U.K. should make a tactical stroke to relocate a handful of commercial, political, and economic officer positions from London to cover regions across Scotland. Doing so will signicantly enrich the ambassadorrsquos knowledge as an advisor to President Biden and Secretary Blinken.The ambassador would better comprehend the political and economic dynamics in the U.K. and Europe, position the U.S. for the COP in Glasgow, improve the grasp of understanding of the U.S. Scottish trading relationship, and aid in forging more partnerships between U.S. and Scottish entities across sectors.Further, with a wider tactical presence, U.S. leaders will see how Scotland is leveraging sectors and offering a policy blueprint for other nations, businesses, and communities when it comes to hydrogen and net-zero policy, tech innovation, inclusion, wind-power, healthcare, human rights, le sciences, and caring for vulnerable populations.While these are dficult budget times in Scotland with an historic need to prioritize caring for those impacted by the pandemic, a fundamental international question is on the table. Should Scotland commit more resources to widen strategic relationships throughout the United States  The Scottish Office within the British Embassy in Washington, DC continues to do outstanding work.

Scotland must find a way to build on a strong existing foundation and invest more into scaling up in the U.S. Doing so will secure tangible benefits for Scottish enterprise, culture, trade, tourism, research, and academia at a key moment.A fresh foreign policy vision by President Biden, Vice President Harris, and the incoming team for Europe and beyond offers an opportunity for the United States and Scotland to forge modern links. Scotland can build on its own lsquospecial relationshiprsquo with the United States by launching a more assertive, strategic, and creative plan backed with more capacity building resources. And as the United States develops a renewed global approach, it can enlarge its footprint in Scotland while fully respecting and expanding its key connection with the U.K. A deeper partnership between Scotland and the U.S. is not only mutually beneficial, but valuable for the U.K., Europe, and the larger global community.Ian Houston has spent his career in Washington, DC as an international non-profit leader, a policy advocate for diplomatic engagement and global poverty alleviation, and intercultural dialogue.

Irsquove had a fondness for brussels sprouts since we had to boil a saucepan of them in my first domestic science class. It was the only lesson in this subject where I excelled. Back then, I seasoned with pepper.Today, a drizzle of olive oil turns them into the food of the gods. Thus, as I reach for a mid-morning biscuit, eyeing up the snow clouds outside and thinking of the energy required to get me through to lunch, I refuse to feel guilty. Others, however, seem hell-bent on pricking the nationrsquos conscience and turning an innocent cooked breakfast or buttered scone into a source of shame.There are many reasons to dread the start of the new year, not least the dark and cold. One unfailing, ill-timed and unnecessary scourge is the avalanche of advice doled out around January  by nutritionists and dieticians. Even worse than the tips of health professionals is the enthusiasm of former junk food addicts who, after a Damascene conversion that usually involves a near-death experience, are messianic about their new habits.My idea of weight control is whether or not I can tuck a T-shirt into my jeans after theyrsquove been in a -degree wash. The battery on my bathroom scales died years ago, since when theyrsquove been gathering dust under the bed. This is not something to boast about , but while I can face up to many things in le ndash a leaking roof, mice under the eaves, a looming taxdeadline ndash knowing how many kilos Irsquove gained is not one of them.There seems something sadistic about exhorting people to give up comfort food at precisely the time of year it was designed for. It might be fine to start January with a health kickyou live in Alice Springs or Calornia. In Achiltibuie or Crail, however, it feels cruel. When sleet is whistling around the windows, and the streets are coated in ice, the idea of following a meagre, challenging or carefully calibrated diet does not appeal.All of us know, by now, that Covid does not just love a crowd, it is also drawn to love handles. Being clinically obese is thought to raise the risk of coronavirus complications. The unfailing appearance of New Year diets, however, seems more a lestyle adjunct than a serious medical intervention. They fall into the same category as making resolutions to give up fags or booze, or to pound the pavement, clocking up steps like a hamster on a wheel. This year, however, therersquos not even the incentive of needing to be beach-ready by summer. I doubt many of us will be mentally prepared to launch ourselves into a warmer climate and inviting sea in July, evenwe are enviably lithe and toned.Obviously,I felt I was getting too heavy, Irsquod feel obliged to knuckle down and deal with it, whatever the date. It is true also that the majority of us could probably benefit from tweaking our menus around the margins. But the longest, blackest and dreariest month of the year is not the time to begin. It is counterintuitive, and possibly even self-defeating, to ask us to turn ourselves into a new and better version of ourselves, ldquothe best me I can be, when our internal clock is on perpetual snooze, coming alive only at the smell of roasted potatoes. When night descends by mid afternoon, and we have barely enough oomph to empty the dishwasher, let alone turn the kitchen into a MasterChef set, our willpower is posted missing.Perhaps I ought simply to bypass the magazine features that show vegetable slurries greener than a David Hockney landscape, or chargrilled chicken served with an acre of al dente field. Yet it is not the promise of slimness that lures me in but the ever-changing science of food. That, and the thought of the guinea pigs who allow themselves to become living laboratories. One such group is the cohort of older women cited in the German science writer Bas Kastrsquos new book, called The Diet Compass.These grandmothers were each given a muffin a day for seven weeks. One lot was baked with sunflower oil, the other with palm oil. Unsurprisingly, everyone gained weight, but those in the second category grew fattest.

Although the population of the UAEs cosmopolitan city is largely expatriate, foreigners were still subject to strict laws.

An independent Scotlandrsquos relationship with the European Union would be the most consequential decision of its future foreign policy. Small states such as Finland, Denmark, or Ireland all put the EU centre stage in their international policies. And, as the UK will find, leaving the gravitational pull of the EU is challenging indeed.It could be argued that the Scottish Government goal of independence in the EU should be Scotlandrsquos longer term aim. For now, Scotland might benefit from letting the new EU-UK relationship, however problematic, settle in. Setting up a new state will take time, not least the challenges of currency and managing the fiscal deficit in the aftermath of the Covid crisis. And a dferent UK government might move back closer to the EU, changing the implications for independence.Some argue that Europe is not so important in independence debates, or suggest a transition over time via the European Economic Arealike Norway, or even favour a more Brexit-like Scexit where an independent Scotland is in neither the EU nor EEA.Yet such hesitancy may mean missing the EU boat. Awareness of Scotlandrsquos pro-remain vote is currently high across the EU. But interest in Scotlandrsquos independence debate ies: itrsquos followed more in Berlin or the Hague than in Prague or Budapest. The EU has many other more important priorities to contend with.Still, the upcoming Holyrood elections, alongside the new EU-UK deal, are also prompting substantial interest from EU media as to the prospects for Scottish independence. And EU political figures are fully aware that a fragmentation of the UK is possible.The political challenge for the pro-independence side is how to build on and dynamise these current levels of awareness and sympathy. EU member state governments will stay neutral on the constitutional question. But there are plenty of politicians, not least in the European parliament , who insist that an independent Scotland would be welcome back in the EU. Even where governments, such as in France, Spain or the Netherlands, are concerned at the prospect of a disintegrating UK, there are opportunities to engage positively with their publics ndash as the UKrsquos baffling and self-harming lsquoglobal Britainrsquo sets sail.But European politics moves on. A Scottish rejection of the UKrsquos new post-Brexit trajectory is likely to have more salience, impact and support in the coming period thanit waits a decade. By , the new EU-UK relationship will probably have settled down. Upsetting and recasting it might look more problematic then, whereas an independence referendum in , for instance, would look like another unfolding, and eminently understandable, consequence of Brexit.This is where those who caution against speed may be mistaken. Itrsquos conceivable thatScotland chose independence in , it could re-join the EU ahead of the western Balkan candidates. Certainly, dferent EU opinion-formers see Scottish accession as much more straightforward, technically and politically. While the Scottish debate obsesses around currency and deficits, many EU observers see in Scotland a country that spent  years in the EU, is still aligned to EU rules, and is a stable, ing democracy .But the independence debate needs to be alert to how it looks from the EU. And those who want a Scexit outside both the EU and EEA should explain the very dficult economics of that isolationist position. Nor does the simplistic dismissal of the EUrsquos single market as neoliberal, unfettered capitalism match the reality of the tough social and environmental level-playing field conditions that are in the EU-UK deal.Those who prefer the Norway approach need to ask themselves why no other country since  has chosen to join the EEA rather than the EU. It creates a major democratic deficit ndash a strange choice for a newly independent state, and in the case of Norway only happened after its public rejected the negotiated EU accession terms.Nor is the EEA a transitional route to the EU rather it might be taken as a signal of lack of interest. If Scotland wanted to re-join the EU that would need to be clear upfront after an independence vote. A candidate country usually agrees a specic association agreement with the EU, with the added plus of also unleashing both political support and financial assistance.Independence in the EU will certainly mean a hard border between England  Wales and Scotland . But the UKrsquos brave new world on the edge of the EU will give much insight into the implications of that border and likely costs and benefits for Scotland.All of this assumes, of course, that there is a legal, constitutionally valid referendum, including clear political agreement between London and Edinburgh. The rather inward-looking debate around lsquoplan Brsquo tends to ignore the fact that some plan Bs may be a hard sell in the EU. It might also be wise, in terms of future EU understanding, to put more emphasis on why Boris Johnson should allow a referendumthe SNP win a majority in May, rather than already weakening the impact of his potential lsquonorsquo by saying itrsquos expected.The EU choice is not a side issue in the independence debate. It would determine the type of independent state Scotland would be: one that works with others, at the table, to influence EU choices, or one that sits it out on the sidelines. Striking while the iron is hot might provoke a more positive and welcoming European dynamic than a debate that is overly inward-looking and cautious.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

Speaking after fresh lockdowns were brought into place in Scotland and England, Mr Carmichael said that this should be an opportunity for support measures to be brought in for those who have been unable to access furlough, self-employment or other financial help introduced by the Government over the past year.The isles MP has joined a letter from Liberal Democrat MPs calling on the Chancellor to extend furlough to June along with other business support schemes, and giving support to the three million excluded.Mr Carmichael said: “The Chancellor may not have been willing in the past months to consider measures to help those left out from financial support to date, but with another long lockdown ahead of us it is time for fresh thinking. The three million workers who have been excluded from support – including many in the isles – have not simply disappeared. If anything their need has only increased as we approach a full year since restrictions started.“Even in the best-case scenarios we are looking at months before weto anything approaching normal business conditions.

Loganair has recruited and trained engineers locally to take over from retiring long-serving members of its team and is committed to continuing this policy of local investment in Orkney wherever it possibly can. During the new contract, Loganair has said it fully expects to convert the aircraft to use low-carbon propulsion to replace the same type of conventional piston engine which has powered the services for over  years. Loganair is a key participant in several projects to bring low or zero-carbon technology to commercial air transport, and will be supporting flight trials of two separate programmes # hydrogen-powered and electrically-powered aircraft # at its base in the Orkney Islands in the first half of .It is the only UK regional airline invited to participate in the UK Government’s Jet Zero Council initiatives to de-carbonise future air travel.Loganair chief executive Jonathan Hinkles said: “We’re delighted and privileged to have been chosen to deliver Orkney’s essential Inter-Island air services for a further four years.   It’s a vital service for the prosperity of the North Isles, and our ability to retain this contract is entirely due to the experience and hard work of our dedicated team in Kirkwall.“The four-year contract award provides us with certainty on which to plan for the future – whether that be the transition to new low or zero-carbon technology or in the recruitment and training of staff in Orkney to work on the Inter-Isles operation.   The North Isles services are a key part of Loganair’s DNA, and despite our expansion as an airline, we remain today as committed as ever to serving the communities of Orkney.”OIC chairman of development and infrastructure, Councillor Graham Sinclair said: “Communities in our North Isles have been served by Loganair for more than half a century and now, following a competitive tendering process, the airline has been awarded the four-year contract once again.“In these ever-challenging times with uncertainty around every corner, I am sure the continuity of service will be welcomed by residents.“I also welcome Loganair’s future plans which include conversion to use of low-carbon propulsion which can only but assist with our attempts to reduce our carbon footprint.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Failure to comply will lead to an immediate pound fine.There will be a limited number of exemptions, including hauliers, children under , crews, arrivals from the Common Travel Area with Ireland and for those travelling from countries without the infrastructure available to deliver tests.The move follows the decision to suspend all direct travel from South Africa following the emergence there of a new strain of coronavirus thought potentially to be even more virulent than the mutant iant which has led cases to surge in the UK.Mr Shapps said: ldquoWe already have signicant measures in place to prevent imported cases of Covid-, but with new strains of the virus developing internationally, we must take further precautions.ldquoTaken together with the existing mandatory self-isolation period for passengers ing from high-risk countries, pre-departure tests will provide a further line of defence ndash helping us control the virus as we roll out the vaccine at pace over the coming weeks.The announcement comes at a time when the latest lockdown restrictions across the four nations of the UK mean there is very little international travel.The airline industry ndash which has been devastated by the pandemic ndash acknowledged the need for the restrictions but urged ministers to lt them as quickly as possible.Tim Alderslade, the chief executive of the industry body Airlines UK, said: ldquoThis should be a short-term, emergency measure only and once the rollout of the vaccine accelerates, the focus must be on ing travel to normal as quickly as possible in order to support the UKrsquos economic recovery.Under the new rules, passengers will need to present proof of a negative test result to their carrier on boarding while the UK Border Force will conduct spot checks on arrivals.All passengers arriving from countries not on the Governmentrsquos travel corridor list will still be required to self-isolate for  days, regardless of their test result.Hauliers crossing the Channel to France will also still need a negative test before departure following a decision by the French government on Thursday.Meanwhile, First Minister Mark Drakeford has announced lockdown restrictions in Wales will be strengthened in ldquokey areas to try to halt the spread of the new iant.He warned that unless there was a ldquosignicant drop in cases before January  ndash when the next three-week review of the regulations is carried out ndash school and college students will continue to learn online until the February half-term.In Scotland places of worship across the mainland will close from Friday as the latest set of coronavirus restrictions continue across the country.On Thursday, Boris Johnson pledged an ldquounprecedented national effort to rollout the vaccine to nearly  million of the most vulnerable people by mid-February.At a No  news conference, he acknowledged there would be some ldquolumpiness and bumpiness but pledged that all elderly care residents will have been offered the jab by the end of January.The pressures on the health service were laid bare by NHS England chief executive Sir Simon Stevens who said there were % more patients in hospital with Covid than there were at the peak of the first wave in April, and , admissions since Christmas Day. vw,vw,px, px\"In Northern Ireland, hospitals have been cancelling planned operations due to a surge of patients with coronavirus.There was however a ray of light with the news critically ill Covid- patients admitted to intensive care units will be able to receive new drugs that can ldquosignicantly reduce the risk of death as well as time spent in hospital by up to  days.NHS patients will have access to tocilizumab and sarilumab ndash which are typically used to treat rheumatoid arthritis ndash under updated guidance due to be issued by the Government and the NHS to trusts across the UK.copy -.

Those who will be aged - by  March  can avail of the jab from over  community pharmacies or through their local GP practice.Health Minister Robin Swann said: “We have seen an increased uptake in the flu vaccine programme this year and whilst this is very encouraging it remains extremely important that we take all necessary measures to help reduce the spread of flu.“This is especially true given the very high levels of Covid- transmission in our communities. Reducing the pressure caused by seasonal flu will help protect our health service and save lives.”Minister Swann continued: “This week has also seen GP practices begin the first phase in the Covid- population vaccination programme. Given the scale of the vaccination programme and the delivery schedule of the vaccines it will take time to vaccinate a substantial proportion of the population. I would ask people to remain patient, wait to be called and appreciate that GP practices will be delivering the signicant Covid- programme alongside their normal service. Bearing this in mind, people in this group can also avail of the flu jab, through participating community pharmacies.”Acknowledging the hard work of GP practices and pharmacies in delivering the flu programme to date, Minister Swann said: “I want to pay tribute to GP practice teams and community pharmacies who have worked throughout the pandemic to vaccinate those most vulnerable in our community. I also want to acknowledge the increased role pharmacy teams will play in vaccinating this additional group which will allow GP practices to concentrate on rolling out the Covid- vaccination programme.”The current groups eligible for a free flu vaccination from their GP are now everyone aged  and over, pregnant women, those aged under  years of age in clinical “at risk” groups, all children aged  to , primary school pupils and school children in year  who missed the school vaccination, household contacts of those who received shielding letters and frontline health and social care workers. Free flu vaccination from pharmacies are for everyone aged  to , and frontline health and social care workers.

This includes the requirements that animals must get tapeworm treatment and a rabies vaccination, previously unnecessary given the tapeworm and rabies-free status of NI and the Republic of Ireland .Speaking about the issue, the Minister said: “As a result of the NI Protocol, Northern Ireland’s pet owners are now facing onerous and unnecessary documentary checks as well as unjustied veterinary treatments, for diseases that we do not have.“I have written to the Secretary of State George Eustice and the European Commission to ask for common sense and more specically, a Common Travel Area to be applied between GB and NI and ROI – this is not unreasonable and would alleviate the real and serious concerns of pet travellers across all jurisdictions.”The Minister continued: “A worrying outworking of these new requirements is that no thought has been given to the dficulties caused for assistance dog users and assistance training puppies. This means that some of the most vulnerable in our society are being directly affected – this cannot and must not be the case.“I trust that the Defra Secretary of State and the European Commission will consider and recognise the impact of the concerns I have raised and will work with me to find a pragmatic and sensible solution to these issues.”  "},{"url":null,"title":"continue sending your goods to ni government tells companies","story":"Lorries carrying food into Northern Ireland from Great Britain will be subject to new checks PA FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueLorries carrying food into Northern Ireland from Great Britain will be subject to new checks Margaret CanningTwitterEmailJanuary   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailThe UK Government has said businesses in Great Britain should still be sending parcels to Northern Ireland amid concerns over cancelled orders and delayed deliveries.Customers of firms like John Lewis, Next and Dunelm have all been told their deliveries are delayed, while orders with TK Maxx are cancelled. Under the NI Protocol, companies sending parcels here have to complete customs declarations. While a three-month grace period is in force, it was not announced until shortly before the protocol began to apply at pm last Thursday.But freight boss Seamus Leheny of Logistics UK dismissed a call by North Antrim DUP MP Ian Paisley that the protocol should be dropped.Other problems including snarl-ups at ports in Great Britain for lorries carrying food to Northern Ireland were discussed at a hearing of the NI Affairs Committee yesterday.Mr Leheny told the committee that one company had  loads of food bound for here which could not be lted by the hauliers because there was no accompanying paperwork. He said a breakdown in communications between government agencies and the industry in Great Britain has helped create delays.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseDUP MP Ian Paisley FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueDUP MP Ian PaisleyMany companies there had wrongly believed the grace periods to help the flow of supermarket goods into NI meant no documentation at all was required. However, pre-notications to the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairsare still required.There is a yawning gap in the knowledge of those in Great Britain exporting to NI, said Mr Leheny.Mr Paisley said that the complications seen in the first few days of the protocol meant that it should be scrapped.A blind man on a galloping horse could have told you this would be a nightmare, he said.But Mr Leheny said there was no realistic alternative. You can#t just walk away and think something  will be better.He added: Industry here did support the backstop but the protocol is where we ended up because every alternative was rejected. The view of our industry is, let#s make it work.But despite reports of delays, a spokesman for the UK Government told the Belfastthe grace periods for supermarkets and their suppliers are working well. Lorries are travelling through NI ports and we continue to work closely with traders as they adapt to these changes.The overwhelming majority of parcels continue to move smoothly, and there is no reason for businesses not to continue to send such goods to NI.The Government is understood to see the three-month grace period from official certication for parcels as a sensible phased solution.However, operators are being urged to carry out movements in compliance with full requirements as soon as they can.The flow of goods is being monitored by HMRC. A Government source said the priority is to have a pragmatic approach that allows us to comply with the protocol without causing undue disruption to businesses and citizens. Crona Clohisey, public policy lead at Chartered Accountants Ireland, urged traders to ensure they have correct documentation, and use the Government#s Trader Support Service for help with the system for moving goods from Great Britain to NI.The reality is that while the UK and EU have concluded a free trade agreement, the NI Protocol brings a whole host of new trading rules to crucially enable frictionless trading on the island of Ireland, she said. Customs declarations are now required when goods are moved from Great Britain to Northern Ireland because NI must comply with EU customs and VAT rules at its ports.Belfast Most ReadCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Further  deaths and , new cases reportedDUP#s Paisley defends Donald Trump in wake of US Capitol riotsMeet Belfast family of seven who can#t all gather in their own garden according to Stormont coronavirus guidelinesSnowed under Kilkeel man builds his own igloo in Mourne MountainsEx-Northern Ireland star Cassidy has Alzheimer#s: We of World Cup ace opens up about battle with diseaseLatest BrexitBrandon Lewis: Stormont#s faults are obvious, but it is still a good thing it is backBrexit delivery issues: How Amazon, John Lewis, Dunelm and other companies have been affected by Irish Sea border Ian Paisley and Claire Hanna in name calling row over ditching NI Protocol Post-Brexit premises in Larne ready by autumnLatest from Belfast Marston’s chief calls for rates extension and VAT cut to save pubsMcFarland boost, but Stockdale blowCullen confident Leinster won#t freeze on the night as Sexton warms to battleIrish League faces fresh shutdown calls as referees threaten withdrawal following positive testsUlster keen on own bit of history: Burns,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

And children aged  and under are not counted in this total.Speaking to the Belfastdad of five Pol Gallagher said his family has been left bemused.It#s a total mess, making decisions changing decisions, he said. Stormont needs to get these things right. It#s undermining efforts of people trying to abide by what the lockdown restrictions actually are.On Wednesday in the Assembly First Minister Arlene Foster gave an overview of the new restrictions and when referencing the number of people who can gather in a garden Mrs Foster said that the Department of Health was working through the details and there would be clarity to come on the matter.On Wednesday night the NI Direct website was updated with the latest restrictions which remain in place until February  and will be reviewed on January .It also said that everyone must now stay at home unless they had a reasonable excuse.Earlier the head of the police federation Mark Lindsay questioned the practicality of the PSNI being able to enforce the new regulations and whether officers had the power to cross the threshold of a residence.He told the BBC#s Stephen Nolan show: We have been quite disappointed over the past year in some of the legislation that we think has been rushed, hasn#t been properly thought through, and police are left to pick up the pieces.Mr Lindsay said it would be easiertravel restrictions were in place in that officers could tell from someone#s driving licensethey were in breach of regulations.He questioned how is it practical to enforce gatherings in gardens of hundreds of thousands of homes - many of which are inaccessible. However Justice Minister Naomi Long told MLAs yesterday that officers did have the power of entry.The health protection regulations as laid by the department of health gave those tasked with enforcement the power to take any actions necessary to enforce any legal restrictions and it is the view of the Executive that that includes the right of power of entry, she told MLAs.Belfast Related Content\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland  .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_eadee-c-d-d-edbd_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland  .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_eadee-c-d-d-edbd_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland  .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_eadee-c-d-d-edbd_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland  .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_eadee-c-d-d-edbd_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland  .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_eadee-c-d-d-edbd_embedded w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Coronavirus PremiumFlouting coronavirus rules like #slapping a nurse in the face,# rages Health Minister SwannHealth Minister Robin Swann has fired a warning at those who continue to flout health regulations, saying that they might as well be slapping a nurse in the face.Most ReadCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Further  deaths and , new cases reportedDUP#s Paisley defends Donald Trump in wake of US Capitol riotsMeet Belfast family of seven who can#t all gather in their own garden according to Stormont coronavirus guidelinesIan Paisley and Claire Hanna in name calling row over ditching NI Protocol Snowed under Kilkeel man builds his own igloo in Mourne MountainsLatest CoronavirusPSNI traffic checkpoints at north coast tourist trap ahead of new Covid lawsHealth Minister Swann under fire as elderly in #supported living# losing out on vaccineCoronavirus: NI may neverto normality despite success of vaccine, warns Professor YoungBrandon Lewis: Stormont#s faults are obvious, but it is still a good thing it is backTributes to Ballymena man Alan Henry who died days after we shared emotional plea to take Covid- seriouslyLatest from Belfast Marston’s chief calls for rates extension and VAT cut to save pubsMcFarland boost, but Stockdale blowCullen confident Leinster won#t freeze on the night as Sexton warms to battleIrish League faces fresh shutdown calls as referees threaten withdrawal following positive testsUlster keen on own bit of history: Burns,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchSocialsFacebookTwitterEmailThe Belfastis a member of IPSO and subscribes to its Editors Code of PracticeIpsoSitemapContact UsTerms  ConditionsPrivacy StatementCookie PolicyPaid-for content PolicyGroup WebsitesAdvertise with UsBelfastPension SchemeAn INM Websitecopy Belfastdocument.documentElement.style.setPropertydocument.documentElement.style.setProperty Didomi.preferences\" href\"#\" style\"cursor: pointer position: fixed background:padding: px px color: #ffffff display: flex align-items: center max-height: px z-index:  bottom: px right: px border-top-left-radius: px border-top-right-radius: px\" Privacy"},{"url":null,"title":"ni centenary bordering on the absurd how partition took place against a backdrop of complete unreality","story":"Enter your code here\" required\"\"The access code entered is not valid.

This most consequential of acts resulted in the partition of Ireland. The genesis of the Government of Ireland Act  came in . Home Rule had been on the statute book since  and could no longer be postponed. It was scheduled to come into operation automatically when hostilities were formally concluded with the signature of the last of the peace treaties after the First World War.To prevent this, the Prime Minister, David Lloyd George, set up a committee, chaired by Cabinet member Walter Long, to draft the Government of Ireland Bill. The make-up of Long#s committee was unionist in outlook. There was no nationalist representation whatsoever, nor was the advice of any nationalists sought. Leading Ulster unionist James Craig and his associates were the only Irishmen consulted.Long#s committee proposed to create two distinct legislatures for Ulster and the southern provinces, linked by a common council, comprising representatives from both. This was the first time a British government proposed a separate parliament for Ulster.Before the end of the war, the exclusion of Ulster, or at least some of Ulster, was the only option being considered in terms of special treatment for the province. Ulster unionists desired for direct rule to remain from Westminster.The common council proposed in the Government of Ireland Bill was a Council of Ireland to be composed of  members from each parliament, which the British stated could lead to the peaceful evolution of a single parliament for all Ireland.Initially, there were many objections from Ulster unionists. The main problem was with the area to be included in the Ulster parliament: Ulster unionists sought the six counties of Antrim, Armagh, Derry, Down, Fermanagh and Tyrone, and not the nine counties of Ulster proposed by Long#s committee, as this was the maximum area they felt they could dominate without being outbred by Catholics.This decision of the Ulster Unionist Council was deeply unpopular among the , Protestants of counties Donegal, Cavan and Monaghan, who were sacriced to the southern administration.Belfast unionist MP Thomas Moles explained that the three counties had to be abandoned in order to save the Six Counties: In a sinking ship, with leboats sufficient for only two-thirds of the ship#s company, were all to condemn themselves to death because all could not be saved Even though the Ulster Unionist Council endorsed the Government of Ireland Bill reluctantly, many Ulster unionists eventually concluded that the scheme proposed in the Government of Ireland Act would cause the least diminution of their Britishness. Some, such as James Craig#s brother, Charles, began to see the great benefits Ulster unionists would garner from having their own parliament: The Bill practically gives us everything that we fought for, everything we armed ourselves for.It has often been cited that the Government of Ireland Bill was allowed to pass relatively unchallenged due to the vacuum in nationalist representation at Westminster. With Sinn Fein abstaining, there were just seven Irish nationalist MPs remaining in Westminsterafter the  general election, instead of .It could be argued that even  nationalist MPs would have made little dference, considering the make-up of the House of Commons after the election. The Conservative Party, Lloyd George#s Coalition Liberal Party and Irish unionists won over  seats, an overwhelming majority. It is doubtful that Sinn Fein#s presence would have made a dference.What little voice the seven nationalist MPs had was further diminished by the Catholic Church#s belief that they should not participate in the committee stages, nor suggest amendments to the Government of Ireland Bill.The Catholic Church was virulently opposed to partition and believed that participating in the framing of the Partition Bill would be seen as a sign of its acceptance. The Bishop of Derry, Charles McHugh, claimed Catholic Ulster would never submit to become hewers of wood and drawers of water for Sir Edward Carson.The leading nationalist MP left in Westminster, Joseph Devlin, condemned the Bill as conceived in Bedlam, ridiculous and fantastic. He voted against it, but did not contribute to its final shape. With Sinn Fein#s policy on partition almost non-existent, it chose to ignore the Government of Ireland Bill. As the Bill was making its way through parliament, the British government was waging a war with Sinn Fein and its military wing, the IRA.Sinn Fein leaders stuck steadfastly - and naively - to the view that Ulster would readily come into an all-Ireland parliament once Britain was removed from the island.That the Government of Ireland Act came into law as Britain was at open war with Sinn Fein, supported by a considerable majority on the island, shows the total air of unreality that surrounded the Act.In granting the royal assent to the Government of Ireland Act , King George V expressed the hope that it, the fruit of more than  years of ceaseless controversy, will finally bring about unity and friendship between all the peoples of my kingdom.This was a wildly optimistic reading of the environment in Ireland in  and of the likely fallout from its impending partition.Cormac Moore is the author of Birth of the Border: The Impact of Partition in Ireland Belfast Most ReadCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Further  deaths and , new cases reportedDUP#s Paisley defends Donald Trump in wake of US Capitol riotsMeet Belfast family of seven who can#t all gather in their own garden according to Stormont coronavirus guidelinesIan Paisley and Claire Hanna in name calling row over ditching NI Protocol Snowed under Kilkeel man builds his own igloo in Mourne MountainsLatest Northern IrelandNI#s new Covid lockdown explained: More cops on the streets, the #reasonable excuses# needed for being out and what shops are open Number of children in care in NI hits record highDUP anger after Belfast council vote on Irish street signsPeloton delays deliveries to NI as it comes to terms with Brexit changes Latest from Belfast Police Academy star Marion Ramsey dies aged NI#s new Covid lockdown explained: More cops on the streets, the #reasonable excuses# needed for being out and what shops are open Average UK house price ended  at record high of £,, says HalaxSebastien Haller swaps West Ham for AjaxMarston’s chief calls for rates extension and VAT cut to save pubs,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Retailers like John Lewis, AO, Madee and Dunelm have all said they have put their deliveries on hold.One reader also reported a problem with deliveries from online homewares retailer Wayfair but it has not replied to a request for comment. But TK Maxx, which last week cancelled orders from customers here, said orders from here and delivery here had been restored. In an interview with the Belfasttoday, Secretary of State Brandon Lewis said there was no reason for companies shipping from Great Britain to put orders from customers here on hold.Read MoreBrandon Lewis: Stormont#s faults are obvious, but it is still a good thing it is backBrexit delivery issues: How Amazon, John Lewis, Dunelm and other companies have been affected by Irish Sea border He said he would contact Peloton as there#s no reason for them in terms of parcels deliveries to have any issue. Companies sending goods to Northern Ireland are required to complete new customs paperwork under the NI Protocol, which came into force as the transition period came to an end last week.While guidance from HMRC published on New Year#s Eve introduced a three-month grace period for parcels being sent to consumers, many companies had already decided to put Northern Ireland deliveries on hold before that point. A Belfastreader said they had tried to order a Peloton bike to be told by a worldwide company they cannot fulfil orders to Northern Ireland due to the Brexit situation.I tried to explain we are part of the UK but with no luck, they added.The hi-tech exercise bike, which costs around £, for the original model, has become a sought-after item for exercise at home - tapping into the surge in popularity of cycling and the closure of gyms during lockdown.The company, which was founded in the US, enables users to tune into intense spin classes or other forms of exercise online using a touchscreen integrated into the equipment.A spokeswoman for Peloton said: We have temporarily paused new sales of the Peloton Bike and Peloton Bike+ whilst we update our systems and processes in response to Brexit. Customers who placed an order on or before December ,  will still have their Peloton Bike or Peloton Bike+ delivered. We are working to resume full service and sales in Northern Ireland as soon as possible.She added: Our existing members in Northern Ireland are not affected by this pause to new sales and still have full access to our service, as well as the ability to arrange a service appointment or a refund for their Peloton Bike or Bike+. A spokeswoman for white goods and electricals retailer AO confirmed that its deliveries here were on hold.They added: Like some other online retailers, changes to customs arrangements for deliveries to Northern Ireland mean it will take a few weeks for us and our delivery partner to make the necessary adjustments. We expect that this will only affect the first few weeks of .Electricals retailer Currys also said it was business as usual for customers and deliveries.Belfast Most ReadCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Further  deaths and , new cases reportedDUP#s Paisley defends Donald Trump in wake of US Capitol riotsMeet Belfast family of seven who can#t all gather in their own garden according to Stormont coronavirus guidelinesSnowed under Kilkeel man builds his own igloo in Mourne MountainsEx-Northern Ireland star Cassidy has Alzheimer#s: We of World Cup ace opens up about battle with diseaseLatest Northern IrelandNI centenary: Bordering on the absurd... how partition took place against a backdrop of complete unrealityNumber of children in care in NI hits record highDUP anger after Belfast council vote on Irish street signsDeath throes of migrants aired as NI trafficking kingpin listens onLatest from Belfast Marston’s chief calls for rates extension and VAT cut to save pubsMcFarland boost, but Stockdale blowCullen confident Leinster won#t freeze on the night as Sexton warms to battleIrish League faces fresh shutdown calls as referees threaten withdrawal following positive testsUlster keen on own bit of history: Burns,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Photo by Piaras Ó Mídheach Sportsfile FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueDown GAA chairman John Devaney. Photo by Piaras Ó Mídheach SportsfileFrank RocheJanuary   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailDown GAA chairman John Devaney has launched a staunch defence of his county#s track record of adherence to Covid- restrictions after controversy erupted over a gathering of senior football squad members on Tuesday night.But the Mourne County chief appeared to accept that the assembly of around  players - in two separate groups, to receive inidual training programmes for the coming weeks – may have been ill-advised.Okay, they probably shouldn’t have come together like that, Devaney told Independent.ie.But it was brief, it was light, they were responsible in terms of doing it, and they#re away again and won#t be back now until the beginning of February. Andhave not been together for the last seven weeks.The story of how PSNI officers arrived at Abbey CBS following a report from the public of people playing on the pitches was broken today by The Irish News, which reported that officers left having established that “no breaches of regulations had taken place as it was an elite team.”This is a reference to government-imposed regulations, not sporting ones, and there has been a predictable flood of criticism directed at Paddy Tally#s team. Earlier that same day, Croke Park had issued a fresh directive forbidding any indoor or outdoor gatherings of inter-county squads until the end of January at least.When contacted, however, Devaney was keen to stress several points, namely …It was not an actual training session.Iniduals were not being fitness-tested.It was the first collective gathering of Down players since they lost an Ulster semi-final to Cavan on November , and there won’t be any repeat while current restrictions persist.They have already initiated contact with Croke Park to discuss the matter once it became public news.The issue really seems to have arisen by the fact that the PSNI officer or officers arrived at the Abbey School, the Longford native said.When they arrived, they spoke with our management team they were happy enough that there was nothing untoward and they left.With the original January  date pencilled in for ato county training scrapped, he explained that Down#s management wanted particularly to bring some of the newer guys together to give them their programme … because we’ve had a change in our backroom team, we had a strength and conditioning coach and we had a physio, and now it’s the one person.So, he wanted just to outline for them what he needed them to do over the next couple of weeks, because it looks like we’re not going to be back until early February. And that was it.I have to say now, and I’ve been adamant about this, we have not ed to collective training. Again, I can’t speak for others. If there are others who are out there and have been regularly training, it certainly hasn’t been us, he said.When pressed about the GAA direction for no collective gatherings, and that any training instructions should have been conveyed remotely, Devaney replied: We have been doing some stuff remotely – with great dficulty.I mean, from a point of view of wanting to outline to players what is expected or needed of them over the next couple of weeks, that is why they came together. It was rather brief, and then they were away again and won’t be back now together until the GAA decide as to when counties are able to train again.Askedthere be no repeat of such gatherings, he said: Absolutely. And again, I want to re-emphasise, we have not been together since the Cavan game.There#s been quite a little bit of talk about, be it clubs or counties, coming together for training sessions. We haven#t - and there won’t be. That was the whole point, we will not be back together now until.Devaney expanded: We#ve already spoken to Croke Park about this, because obviously it has been highlighted as an issue so there’s no point in us deciding to sit there and wait on any communications. We have taken that decision ourselves.He did not anticipate punishment from the GAA, which issued a fresh reminder on Tuesday that breaches of any Covid- provisions would be dealt with under Rule .- Misconduct considered to have discredited the Association.I don’t think so, he said. Again, that’s not really up to us. I mean, we’re regularly in communication with Croke Park and with Ulster Council. I wouldn’t anticipate that.Again, from our point of view, not to say that we’re being held up as an example at this particular point because everybody has to take on their own responsibilities.I think we have a very sound record in being responsible in that regard. Again, as I stated earlier,others are out there and have been regularly training, I can’t answer for anybody . But I can certainly answer for Down.Independent.ieMost ReadCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Further  deaths and , new cases reportedDUP#s Paisley defends Donald Trump in wake of US Capitol riotsMeet Belfast family of seven who can#t all gather in their own garden according to Stormont coronavirus guidelinesIan Paisley and Claire Hanna in name calling row over ditching NI Protocol Snowed under Kilkeel man builds his own igloo in Mourne MountainsLatest NewsMarston’s chief calls for rates extension and VAT cut to save pubsUS Capitol siege raises security concerns for Biden inauguration ceremonyMS hit by Covid- restrictions and EU paperworkNI centenary: Bordering on the absurd... how partition took place against a backdrop of complete unrealityNumber of children in care in NI hits record highLatest from Belfast Marston’s chief calls for rates extension and VAT cut to save pubsMcFarland boost, but Stockdale blowCullen confident Leinster won#t freeze on the night as Sexton warms to battleIrish League faces fresh shutdown calls as referees threaten withdrawal following positive testsUlster keen on own bit of history: Burns,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchSocialsFacebookTwitterEmailThe Belfastis a member of IPSO and subscribes to its Editors Code of PracticeIpsoSitemapContact UsTerms  ConditionsPrivacy StatementCookie PolicyPaid-for content PolicyGroup WebsitesAdvertise with UsBelfastPension SchemeAn INM Websitecopy Belfastdocument.documentElement.style.setPropertydocument.documentElement.style.setProperty Didomi.preferences\" href\"#\" style\"cursor: pointer position: fixed background:padding: px px color: #ffffff display: flex align-items: center max-height: px z-index:  bottom: px right: px border-top-left-radius: px border-top-right-radius: px\" Privacy"},{"url":null,"title":"594337","story":"The owner of a Derry cafe will be delivering free turkey dinners with all the trimmings to the needy on Christmas Day.Paula Monk has been running Peggy’s Kitchenin The Old Library Trustin Creggans Central Drive for over a year.Last Christmas she and her business partner Adam Nabaz delivered over  free Christmas dinners and this year they will be doing it all over again.The need in the community this year is greater than ever because of the coronavirus, said Ms Monk.

Joe Cassidy and captain Ciaran McNally took Michael McMullan on an wander into the past... Twelve years before helping Cathal Scullion to strike gold in an Ulster Club final, Joe Cassidy was setting up goals. This time, in the colours of Ballynease PS. A week after losing the  Castle Cup final, by virtue of a last minute goal, to a Johnny McBride and Bosco ONeill inspired Moneymore, the sides met again. googletag.cmd.push The shoe was on the other foot this time. Only a goal would save Bellaghy, thought Cassidy as he stood over the late free. With the benefit of hindsight, only Ronaldo would have found the net from the environs of right wing. Ciaran McNally began his run from full-back. He took a complete gamble. “I just swung at er with an auld scuffed box, and she fell into the net,” laughs McNally, who was the teams goalkeeper  months earlier.  Joe Cassidy and Ciaran McNally celebrate success with Ballynease PS This was the start of McNally and Cassidys winning run. They were on Bellaghys Ulster minor winning team six years later. Under McBrides captaincy, the Bellaghy duo played for Derry in the  All-Ireland minor final defeat to Westmeath. googletag.cmd.push By that time, Cassidy had secured the first of six senior medals as a list for the  win, which ended Bellaghys eight year absence from the pinnacle of Derry football. McNally had to wait until his debut year of  for senior glory and he would pick up four more championships and captain them to Ulster glory. “The best team, more often than not, always wins the championship,” Cassidy begins. “We had two dferent Ulster minor winning teams– two complete new sets of players.” Sam Maguire winners Karl Diamond, Danny Quinn and Joes older brother Damian were also to the fore.     “There was the likes of Gerry McPeake, Seamus Birt, Damian Brown and Benny Lee, boys that had a bit of experience.” The pieces of the puzzle were slotting into place to rule the Derry club scene. ---- Kilmacud Crokes goalkeeper Mick Penders late penalty save, from Damian Cassidy, denied the Tones a second All-Ireland on St Patricks Day , but after going on to dominate the race for the John McLaughlin Cup, Crossmaglen became their nemesis in Ulster. “They beat us in and . Both times, there wasnt the kick of a ball between the two teams,” McNally outlines. The  All-Ireland final, between Dublin and Galway, was the video of choice on the Bellaghy bus as they headed to their  Ulster semi-final date with Enniskillen. The irony wasnt lost on Joe Cassidy. Dublin had three men sent off, including then Derry senior boss Brian Mullins. Later that afternoon, Bellaghy also finished with  men as they bowed out of Ulster. “In those first four of five years, we got to Ulster finals and semi-finals regularly,” McNally adds. Without an Ulster title, Bellaghy were going to underachieve, he remembers thinking at the time. Joe Cassidys thoughts also flash back to the  final and having it won until John McEntees late equaliser. In the replay, Bellaghy were also a point up going into injury time. Cassidy remembers Damians free dropping in around the Crossmaglen square. If they even had kicked the ball dead the title was theirs, he laments. “The ball got played out to the wing to Oisin McConville and he ran about  yards,” Joe adds. “With hindsight, the best thing wouldve been to do a Sean Cavanagh and pull him down....wed have been Ulster champions.” Three passes later, Cathal Short – who played on the same UUJ Freshers team as Cassidy and Gareth Doherty months earlier– slid the ball past Kevin ONeill and Cross were on their way to their first All-Ireland. Lavey knocked Bellaghy out of the  championship, before Seamus Birt and Colm McElwee took charge at the start of a three year stint that brought three league and championship doubles. For, Joe Cassidy,  was their best chance of winning an All-Ireland. By , Paul Diamond – who Cassidy rates as one of the best he played with – was out of favour. Gone was the experience of Danny Quinn and Damian Cassidy. “For us, hewas a leader. He was one of those boys I loved playing with, he could hit you with a pass from about  yards away and not all midfielders had the ability to do that. Damian was the same. You just needed to make a half a step and Damian had the ball popped in your hand.” After a comfortable win over Lavey in the  county final, Bellaghy were back knocking on Crossmaglens door in the Ulster final, but super-sub Michael Moley scored the winner. Ballinderry qualied for the final the following year, after beating Lavey out the gate at Bellaghy. Joe Cassidy, who was stewarding at the game, remembers Conleith Gilligans fist pump towards a vocerous Shamrocks support after being replaced late in the game – as a bring on Bellaghy type salute. “That county final was one of my favourite ones. It was at Ballinascreen and it was on a Sunday night. There was an unreal atmosphere and a young group ofboys brought flares. “I remember walking behind the band...McNally and dferent boys were giving Gilligan a few welcome messages, so they were. Louis McPeake scored Bellaghys goal but they needed points from man of the match Damian Cassidy and Gavin Diamond to seal victory. That season ended with that defeat by Enniskillen. Without the elusive Ulster title, Bellaghys dinner dance in Arbys the following February was like a ghost town, Cassidy remembers. “Even though we had won the league and championship double...because you had done so bad in Ulster, it nearly looked like a bad year. There was a real dead atmosphere. “Youre expectations were to win an Ulster and, after seeing what Crossmaglen had done, the ultimate was to win an All-Ireland.” Despite a winning start to the  season, Bellaghy werent firing on all cylinders. Danny Quinn was player coach and was taking  percent of the training.  Ulster Club Champions  “Mammawas manager. You would land at training and everything was organsied, so he had those traits,” stated Cassidy. “Before that era , training was pretty pre-historic. My first innovator with training was Henry Downey at school. In around the club scene, Dannybegan to innovate things, he was coming off the back of county level. Mickey Moran came on board as Bellaghys trainer later in the summer, following Sligos exit out west. “That sortve gave us the kick up the backside that we needed, with someone of Mickeys level coming in. His training was top drawer.” One of Ciaran McNallys recollections of their Ulster winning campaign was how damn lucky they were to even get to Clones. The wheels almost coming off the wagon against Lavey in Greenlough. “It was a one or two point game, with a few minutes to go,” McNally remembers, when a loose ball pinged around in the Bellaghy penalty area. “I think it even hit the post and was heading across the line. All anybody had to do was get a toe to it and we were gone, then we ended up winning Ulster.”Joe Cassidy goes past Martin Calf in the  Ulster Club final. A six point win over Loup didnt satisfy the Bellaghy fans who now had lofty expectations. “People around the town were taking it for granted that wed beat the Loup and we, as players, could feel that, McNally continues, knowing it was going to be a battle. “I remember getting slated after it and people were saying youse were terrible and I remember saying....we won.” There was a draw with Slaughtneil in semi-final before Fergal Doherty, in his second senior season, hammered over a point in the early stages of the replay. “He would have been nervous in around the changing room, he was young at the time,” his captain outlines. “I remember the roar and relief from himand it was great from our respective.” The final was another showdown with their rivals Ballinderry again. It was a damp squib. Both McNally and Cassidy acknowledge almost falling over the line in a - to - victory. “Somebody needs to just stop that man,” McNally remembers thinking as the Shamrocks defensive rock Niall McCusker ferried the ball from corner back, up the wing before his diagonal ball went out for a . “The ball then came in, dropped short and we cleared it. Then came the relief with the final whistle.” ---- With three-in-a-row now secure, Bellaghy needed a win over Castledawson to keep their league hopes intact but an ankle ligament injury sustained in that game put Joe Cassidys Ulster club hopes in doubt. Bellaghy received a bye in the first round of Ulster, following Cargins suspension dished out after their final with arch-rivals St Pauls. Cassidy came on as a sub late in their semi-final victory over Cavan champions Gowna, who Bellaghy also met on their way to the  title. On the other side of the draw, Castleblayney disposed of Crossmaglen in the quarter-final before falling to Errigal Ciaran. “I had an idea ...you dont break up a winning team and we had played well in the semi-final,” Cassidy admits. Bellaghy won the toss and elected to play against the breeze. Bellaghy owned the ball in the first half but a litany of wides saw them trail - to - at the break. Peter Canavan had fired over the bar for the games first score, but never got a kick off David ONeill who dominated the Tyrone legend in the air. Cassidys worst nightmare was being paired off against Neilly in training games. “Between him and Sean Marty , I dont know how many roastings I got over the years.” Birt gave Cassidy the nod to warm up at the interval and six minutes into the second half, he entered the fray. “I was coming in fresh and the first ball I got, I turned and fired this thing over the bar from  yards. You looked like a super player but the breeze was carrying it.” Bellaghys defence, which included man of the match Peter Diamond, held Errigal scoreless for a full  minutes until Mark Hartes consolation goal in stoppage time. Six minutes before that, Cathal Scullions goal put the game to bed and Bellaghy could savour the march to glory. “Karl Diamond put the ball into the corner,” Cassidy recalls, with the help of watching the game again in his father Dan Joes Ballynease museum of GAA. “Gavin Diamond came off the shoulder, I flicked it to Gavin and it became a two versus one. He put it into Chubberwho put it into the back of the net.” Cassidy and McNally, interviewed separately, both speak with a laugh of Scullion swinging his jersey over his head in celebration. “I will never forget Peter Docon the terrace, jumping up and down. At that stage, you knew you had it. There is no better feeling when you have trained your whole le to try and win something,” Cassidy enthused. For McNally, it was always about learning from defeats and the steeliness it helps to generate. “I always tell people its not all badit makes you come back the following year that bit more determined.” It took Scullions goal to cement the result. Some years later, Ciaran lost his fatherand mothersuddenly but he clearly remembers his father telling of the sheer joy on the Clones steps, as Bellaghy eventually ended their Ulster losing streak. “The supporters were so disappointed in previous years. To have that picture in your head, of us being home and hosed, it was special.” At the final whistle, McNally embraced goalkeeper Ciaran Donnelly before being whisked off to the presentation area by an Ulster Council official. After years in the Ulster wilderness, the Tones skipper stood alone, before bellowing into the microphone to urge the throngs of joyous royal blue clad players and fans to join him. McNally didnt tempt fate. No speech was prepared, but two things came flooding back. He firstly made sure to commiserate with Errigal Ciaran. He knew the drill, having had one hand and four fingers of the other on the Seamus McFerran Cup before McEntee, Moley and Short – on three separate occasions - pulled it out of Bellaghys grasp. He also had a sincere word of thanks for Seamus Birt and Colm McElwee who took an awful lot of abuse following defeats to Cross and Enniskillen. “I hope you are as quick to come forward and thank them,” McNally told the Bellaghy faithful. “They done a lot of work, won us three-in-a-row and an Ulster.” Following the customary post game meal in Paudge Quinns restaurant, the team bus – rocking from the sing-song inside – rolled into the middle of Bellaghy. The players marched up to Muldoons shop and back to the Diamond, before heading to the club to celebrate long into the night. “Those are the nights you will never forget,” Cassidy insists. “There is no tomorrow, just endless partying, craic and everybody is in good form. There is something special about waking up the morning after a club final. There is no hangover, you just cant wait to get to speaking to people and meeting your family.”  Ciaran McNally rasies the Seamus McFerran aloft in the Clones tunnel. His younger brother Ryanlooks on. In the All-Ireland semi-final, they were defeated by eventual winners Crossmolina. It was an emotion Bellaghy knew only too well. Crossmaglen , Ballinderry and St Galls also beat the Tones on their way to lting the Andy Merrigan Cup. Patrick McAndrews goal gave the Mayo men a - to - interval lead. With eight minutes to go, two Gavin Diamond points had the margin down to two points before Ciaran McDonald was sprung from the bench. “He was carrying an ankle injury, but the next thing he came on and fired over a couple of absolute reevers and they beat us by four,” states Joe Cassidy, who one of Bellaghys only two scorers that day. Later that night, in the wee small hours, Ciaran McNally sat out on the swing in the family garden. Staring into oblivion, until the birds began to chirp. It was time to reflect. “I just couldnt go into the house,” he said. Despite people trying to soften the blow earlier in the night, McNally knew it was going to be a long way back. For Cassidy, he feels he speaks for everyone of that era - highlighting the regret of not winning an All-Ireland. “After that, managers came in and tried things and what youll find is...managers will generally get the blame, iniably from players – and I include myself in that,” Cassidy said. “It is only with experience and hindsight, you realise it had f**k all to do with management. It was to do with hunger and lots of us were making excuses.” Ballinderry beat them in , a final Bellaghy played better than their grind a year previous. First round defeats at the hands of the Shamocks and Glenullin prevented them from getting back to a decider until Slaughtneil beat them in the  final. Under the tutelage of Damian Cassidy, they realised that John McLaughlin wasnt a million miles away again. “One of his main attributes as a manager is his ability to get best that he can out of squads. Every night at training, he challenged you, states Joe, who was top scorer in the  championhship. Their - to - win over Loup in  took Bellaghy to  on the roll of honour. It was followed up by an Ulster win in Crossmaglen but that was the last hurrah in the winners enclosure. St Galls, with future Bellaghy boss John Rafferty at the helm beat them in an Ulster final. “Money couldnt buy what I got out of it,” McNally sums up of his career. “The only travesty about it is that you get too far down the line before you realise it. It was taken for granted.” “You see things now, with families all gathered aroundtaking photos...we didnt do that because we thought thats the way it was.” Its a regret. McNally got his hands on championship silver in four of the first five years of his senior career. “If I had a few lean years before it, you maybe wouldve knew to appreciate it,” he concludes. When Joe Cassidys lofted ball landed in the Moneymore goalmouth all those years ago and McNallys fisted goal brought silverware back to Ballynease, it was only the beginning of a journey to the steps of the Gerry Arthurs stand...a day when Bellaghy were kings of Ulster.

Michael OKane took on the role at St Colmcilles Primary School in Claudy after Easter this year, with schools already closed by the first Covid- lockdown. He was nominated for the award by parent Fiona Garrett, who told presenter Stephen Nolan that Mr OKane had helped her children with two particularly tricky transitions. “My son Matthew was transitioning from P to big school and my daughter Oacuterlagh-Janetransitioning from nursery to P,” she said. “My daughter has a statement of special educational needs. During lockdown, she became very distressed at the sudden change of routine and Mr OKane really helped with this. googletag.cmd.push “He did this by doing videos to show her where her new classroom was going to be, what it would look like, who her new classroom assistant was going to be and how to sanitise your hands properly. “He also helped my son with the P leaving transition. My son started becoming distressed at not seeing his friends and the fact they wouldnt get a last opportunity to all be together. “Mr OKane arranged a wonderful Year  leaving mass, where he shot a beautul photo and video of the group together with his drone. “Matthews short, but positive experience of Mr OKane actually inspired him to want to become a teacher now.” googletag.cmd.push Miss Garrett said Mr OKane had gone beyond the call of duty to make sure parents were looked after too, and said he was a special person. “He is so good with children who have special educational needs. He goes above and beyond, going that extra little step just to make everything run smoothly.

Absolutely anything is possible with the right support and Im so grateful.”     Michael admitted it was a shock to receive a call from Stephen Nolan, initially askinganything was wrong, but he regained his composure to pay tribute to the schools staff. “I only started here at Easter and I inherited a fantastic school with fantastic staff and I dont think Ive done too much myself – everybody in the school has really pulled together,” he said. “Im just looking out the window here on a dreary Monday morning and thats the sort of thing we need to hear. Im in shock here, but Id just like to thank the staff, and in particular Fionas childrens teachers. “Theres a fantastic team in Year  who made children feel comfortable in coming back to school. “Its been tough, but everybody has gone above and beyond from teachers, classroom assistants, our building supervisors and cleaners. “Im going to relay this to all the staff because it will lt everybodys spirits,” he added.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

I was fully booked and had to turn people away, and people have rebooked, so that means a lot,” she told the County Derry Post. “I didnt really know what I wanted to do until I left school, but I always knew I wanted to work with animals. “I wanted to be a vet, but after a bit of work experience I changed my mind!” googletag.cmd.push Clionas mum Joanne has supported her throughout her move into dog grooming, and said the former St Patricks College, Maghera student had an early introduction to animals. “There have always been animals around her,” she said. “Shes had dogs all her le and used to do horse riding lessons at Laura Browns in Magherafelt. When she was two and a half she asked Santa for a moo, neigh and a quack! “Her uncle built her a stable and Santa brought her a first Shetland pony when she was two and a half.” Dogs have always been part of Clionas le. After leaving school, Cliona completed a Diploma at Wizards of Dogs in Cookstown, where the experience was immersive. googletag.cmd.push “When I was training,a dog comes in that was biting or anything, we had to do it ourselves, to help us learn how to cope when we qualy,” she told the County Derry Post. “That prepared me for going out on my own when you get dogs like that you know how to deal with it. You just try your best to work with them and find a way that works better than what youve tried. “I couldnt have done it without the Wizard of Dogs, Ive learned so much. You do your first aid and start off grooming two dogs a day.     “By the end it was loads more, and I covered all the dferent cuts, so I got plenty of experience there,” she added. While dog groomers have been able to remain open throughout the latest raft of Covid- restrictions, Clionas sister, Nicole, hasnt been so lucky. “Her sister has a salon in Maghera and we were laughing that Cliona has only started and she can stay open whereas Nicole has to close,” explained Joanne. “We could maybe get her an odd dog to bath.” You can follow Fairy Tail Dog Grooming by visiting their Facebook and Instagram pages.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Several important areas of land on key entrances to the city are currently vacant. Derry City and Strabane District Council is now looking to set up the new  to ask their opinion on the design quality of any planning applications which are made for these sites. One of the sites expected to be discussed is the derelict site of the former Tillie and Henderson shirt factory at the cityside end of the Craigavon Bridge. googletag.cmd.push It emerged recently that the current owner of the site is to apply for planning permission to build an apartment complex on the land. Speaking at a meeting yesterday of the local councils Planning Committee, Eamon Molloy, the councils Head of Planning Performance and Improvement, outlined the proposal for the new advisory . He said the creation of such  had been put forward as part of a review of the Planning Service. Mr Molloy said the  would offer advice to councillors on important gateway sites in the council area. He said the setting up of such a  would also allow the council to be in a state of readiness for the post-Covid recovery period when, he said, there hopefully would be many opportunities in terms of development in the council area. googletag.cmd.push Mr Molloy told the meeting that he would be in contact with the Ministerial Advisory Group on Architecture and Built Environment to agree terms on how the proposed  would operate. He said he would bring a report on the matter to next months meeting of the Planning Committee. There has been much debate in recent years about the development of gateway sites in Derry. The Tillie and Henderson site, in particular, has been at the forefront of the discussions. The site has been unused since the derelict factory building was destroyed in a fire in . The owners of the site, Belfast-based Andras House, had originally planned to build a hotel on the site.     However, those plans never came to fruition and it emerged last month that Andras House has now teamed up with local developers, the Martin Property Group, to build an apartment complex on the site. Director of Andras House, Rajesh Rana, said a residential development is the most appropriate use that can be delivered at this time. Just across the road from the Tillie and Henderson site is another derelict piece of land which was also previously home to a shirt factory. This would also be regarded as a gateway site in Derry.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Health Minister Robin Swann said:“We have seen an increased uptake in thefluvaccine programme this year and whilst this is very encouraging it remains extremely important that we take all necessary measures to help reduce the spread offlu. “This is especially true given the very high levels of Covid- transmission in our communities.

Bearing this in mind, people in this group can also avail of theflujab, through participating community pharmacies.” Acknowledging the hard work of GP practices and pharmacies in delivering thefluprogramme to date, Minister Swann said:“I want to pay tribute to GP practice teams and community pharmacies who have worked throughout the pandemic to vaccinate those most vulnerable in our community. googletag.cmd.push I also want to acknowledge the increased role pharmacy teams will play in vaccinating this additional group which will allow GP practices to concentrate on rolling out the Covid- vaccination programme.” The current groups eligible for a freefluvaccination from their GP are now everyone aged  and over, pregnant women, those aged under  years of age in clinical “at risk” groups, all children aged  to , primary school pupils and school children in year  who missed the school vaccination, household contacts of those who received shielding letters and frontline health and social care workers.

I would implore that everyone plays their part, stays at home, follow the guidelines and take the vaccine.ldquoWe are absolutely slaughtered in hospitals and those big numbers of new cases will feed into admissions and we are already at capacity.ldquoA fortnight from now, a proportion of the new cases will end up in hospital and hospitals have not yet had the chance to get out of surge two and we are straight into surge three.The local councillor spoke of her personal relief at being vaccinated.ldquoAt the moment Irsquove only got the first jab which I will get the second in about  weeks time. But % or so protection is better than none.ldquoI view it as a great blessing and we have to be very grateful to our scientists who have worked around the clock to get us where we are today.The DUP councillor said she experienced no issues from having the vaccine.She confirmed that her vaccination team are doing around  vaccinations a day and that hospital staff will be rolling out the Pfizer vaccine while Gps will be responsible for administering the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine.ldquoWe have our doctors and nurses taking the vaccine and these are healthcare professionals who understand the rigorous testing that all new drugs go through, said Cllr Owen. ldquoThey are putting their money where their mouth is and at the end of the day so am I.ldquoIrsquom happy to stand over this to encourage others in the uptake.

I thought this group without doubt deserved more. They are outstanding and deserve a Christmas performance so I went about to make this happen, he explained.ldquoI decided to put on a show for the children as for some of my class this would be their final hurrah in an eagerly anticipated Christmas play with a dference.Mr McGarrity said St Malachyrsquos had previously used green screen technology and he set about organising an ldquoamazing surprise to mash the school play and green screen technology together to make a Christmas show.ldquoThe boys and girls were so excited and overall delighted to be taking part in a somewhat dferent type of production, he said.And with only three weeksrsquo practice before the Christmas holidays they pulled it out of the bag, planning, ing and deliveringlsquoScroogehellipA Ghost of a Chance rsquo, which was screened via YouTube.Mr McGarrity said the link for the recent screening was shared with families, local community groups and care homes as the pupils wanted their story to be heard across the country in a time of need.The primary school teacher said the school was also keen to promote festive cheer and good old Christmas spirit, especially in these unprecedented times, bringing hope and joy to all families. young and old.The St Malachyrsquos production can be viewed at https:youtu.be vsNXbepVw and the school is hoping it will help put a smile on peoplersquos faces..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6th January 2021 Ballykinlar.jpg","title":"Ballykinlar is key to future in Down  ","story":"DOWN GAA county secretary Sean Og McAteer has said there potential for ldquoimaginative funding ahead of what is likely to be a very testing year financially at inter-county level.All sporting bodies found their funds hit last year by the spread of covid- and the impact that had.With sport shelved for a large part of the year, and the same happening again in the early part of , it continues to be a trying time.With the virus still posing a signicant threat going into the new year, it is likely that sport at all levels will continue to see many dficulties going forward.Conor Murray, an Irish Research Council Postgraduate scholar at the School of History and Geography at Dublin City University, has been analysing numbers from the GAArsquos annual financial reports from -.He has calculated the levels of grant money given to each county to fund games development and expenses.Whilst at the top end of the scale, Dublinrsquos figure sits at euro. million for the period, for Down the figure is a much more modest euro,, putting them in bottom place.Mr McAteer said Downrsquos expenditure was in no way comparable with that of other counties.ldquoWe are on the low side of the money list, no doubt, he admitted. ldquoWe certainly have the ambition to begin to address the deficit. We want to be able to develop our coaching set-up, particularly in urban centres like Downpatrick, Newry, north Down, the Down parts of Belfast. Hopefully those opportunities will come up.Mr McAteer said the implementation of a Down training hub at Ballykinlar was a key aim when it comes to considering where spending will take place in Down GAA.ldquoThe development at Ballykinlar is a huge thing, both for Down and the community in Ballykinlar. That is one of the key fronts we are working on, he said.ldquoOf course though, we cannot take our eye of the importance of development in urban areas. We can see how much Dublin for example have benefited from utilising their urban areas, and the rewards they have reaped from that in recent years on the pitch, as well as financially.He did caution that, as ever, the availability of funding is major issue.ldquoThe GAA took a huge hit financially in  - that is likely to happen to some degree at least, again this year.ldquoIn terms of us here in Down though, we are in a stronger position to deal with the climate I would like to think, certainly when compared to other northern counties.ldquoWe have big urban centres which is vitally important. We can also explore the possibility of greater cross-border development with counties like Louth, and the use of the Dublin Institute of Technology. There is, going forward this year, a lot of potential for imaginative funding that we can use to our advantage here in Down.Another cornerstone of the approach to keeping Down GAA in good health is continuing to appeal to the younger generations coming through in the Mourne county.ldquoWe need to try to make Gaelic Games the number one sport of choice for young kids in Down, Mr McAteer said.ldquoIf you look at our record from July of  to the end of the year, we staged , games. A lot of those games were at an under-age level.

Parking that is preventing farmers from accessing livestock and farm machinery being able to pass through the local narrow roads.ldquoWe have so many cars parked up that visibility when exiting driveways and peoplersquos homes is non-existent. When you combine this with charging recommencing for vehicular access to our forest parks, we are going to see further and signicant pressures at the entrance to Tollymore Forest Park in particular.Many people went on to social media complaining of being blocked into their driveways and cars parked on double yellow lines, particularly in Bryansford.Cllr Devlin said that there was a growing feeling of tension between visitors and local people.ldquoI really do fear thata Fire Brigade or an ambulance is required, it simply would be unable to navigate through the hundreds of cars.ldquoI have written to the Executive Office asking that they explore and consider additional restrictions in terms of travelling for exercise similar to the South of Ireland.ldquoThe current essential travel message simply isnrsquot hitting home, as literally thousands of cars are arriving into Newcastle and the Mournes each day and our local Covid cases will undoubtedly rocket in the days ahead.She said that the community faced dficult times ahead and she urged people in the interim to remain near their homes..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6th January 2021 Soccer.jpg","title":"Soccer chiefs in Covid wait  ","story":"LOCAL football chiefs say there is still hope that some type of season can be salvaged, despite the ongoing havoc caused by the spread of coronavirus.Grassroots sport continues to be left in limbo as to when and how they will be able to get their competitions underway as the spread of Covid- continues.Newcastle League secretary Alan Craig admitted that the recent statistics on infection rates do not give a lot of cause for hope.There is no point in us discussing things as to how we may get the league back up and running, when we know the likelihood at the minute is events in government will overtake us.ldquoUltimately we are still in the same situation as we have been for the last several months.ldquoWhen you see the rates of infection, there is certainly not much there to encourage us that we are going to get away from this problem soon. We have in essence been in a lockdown-type situation for a long time.Even so, Craig said Newcastle League officials are not yet throwing in the towel in trying to devise a way for a season to be played.ldquoAny decision we make with regards to how and when we can get football back up and running again will be taken in conjunction with our clubs.ldquoWe need their input on how they feel about the situation, and there needs to be a want from the clubs to get back to playing as well. All of those things will be up for discussion within the league committee when we know where we stand.Amateur League chairman Terry Pateman says he has not yet given up hope of getting some sort of season put together over the next few months.ldquoWe are still essentially working blind, he said. ldquoWe are trying to devise ways of starting the new season before we know what the government are going to decide next, he said.ldquoIf there were no further stoppages beyond the dates already in place for us, we could proceed with what would obviously be a shortened season. I am confident we do still have the time to organise something by way of the teams seeing some action.A part of the plan the Amateur League are working on is to play into the summer.ldquoWe have a request in with the Irish FA that we be allowed to play our season into June, confirmed Mr Pateman. ldquoThere has been no response as of yet, but I am hopeful that it would be granted.ldquoWe are trying to think ahead and devise plans that give us a chance of playing. The clubs have been with us in what we have tried to do so far.ldquoCertainly,there is a concrete chance of being able to bring something together, we will consult with them again.ldquoAt the moment however, we are not at that stage. We are all still somewhat in the dark unfortunately.With the soccer season supposed to have kicked off last August, officials have been left with major headaches.However Mr Pateman says the Amateur League are not thinking yet about the season being abandoned.ldquoIt has obviously been very tough trying to work out, not just how we can start a campaign, but also how we can do so safely, he said.ldquoA plan is still there that we can tweak depending on how things develop with the spread of the virus.ldquoI am still hopeful we will see some amount of football in the league this year though..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6th January 2020 South.jpg","title":"South Down MP Chris Hazzard’s hopes for 2021  ","story":" will hopefully bring many opportunities, as well as challenges, for our local community here in South Down.The Covid- pandemic has devastated many families in , especially those who have lost loved ones.It has changed our lives, how we all live, and stretched our invaluable front line health and social care staff to their very limits.As we continue to battle the spread of this virus, the advent of le-saving vaccines brings us much-needed hope and optimism.And as we enter this New Year, it must be with a fresh determination to build a new society, based on equality, inclusion and opportunity for all.Sinn Feacutein is continuing to work to support and deliver for communities, families and businesses during these unprecedented times.Our immediate priorities have been to protect public health and provide practical and financial support to workers, families and local businesses.The pandemic and its impact on almost every aspect of our lives has opened up space to discuss how we resource our public services and to assess who and what we value as a society.Our people have shown that they are our most valuable asset.Workers once classied as ldquounskilled are now recognised as essential. While the appreciation of these workers may have changed in the eyes of some their pay and conditions have not.The crisis has further illustrated the incredible work undertaken by our nurses and doctors, in addition to the work undertaken by public transport workers, cleaners and those in our emergency services.Long periods of having to work from home for others have also served to highlight that homes are our sanctuary. The lack of affordable, decent homes must be addressed in the time ahead mdash especially in areas like South Down where many young people can not chose to stay and live in their local community.So there is no doubt that challenges remain for us as we enter this new year, but there is light at the end of the tunnel. Vaccines are already being rolled out to those most vulnerable, as well as to our front line healthcare staff.Brexit has created four-and-a-half years of ision and grave uncertainty for our workers, families and businesses.I have worked with other pro-Remain parties, the Irish Government, and European leaders to protect the Good Friday Agreement, prevent a hard border and safeguard Irish interests. This has served our people well.The voice of Ireland, and the concerns of the North, have been heard and heeded.And while a deal has now been agreed between the EU and British Government, our priority remains on ensuring unique protections for Ireland and the full implementation of the Protocol.Brexit has opened up a public discourse on the future of this island and exposed the undemocratic nature of partition.In , we will look back at a seminal chapter in our history mdash the partition of our island. For nationalists and republicans, the centenary of partition will not be a cause for celebration.It does, however, give us cause to look to the possibilities and opportunities for the future of the people of this island.This is a defining moment in our history and people will have decisions to make on what is in the best interests of our island.We are in a decade of opportunity where the right to decide our own future rests in the hands of our people. The conversation on Irish unity is well underway across our society.The provision for a referendum on unity is part of the Good Friday Agreement.We now have a choice between a narrow, inward-looking vision of Brexit Britain or the open inclusive vision of a New Ireland. should be about an inclusive conversation. This is a time for debate and big, bold ideas for everyone who calls this island home.Let us all begin this new year with a sense of realism about the challenges we continue to face but also optimism and a commitment to help us build a new and better future for everyone..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6th January 2020 Workers.jpg","title":"Workers set for strike  ","story":"TALKS between Newry, Mourne and Down Council and trade unions have failed to stop industrial action which started on Monday.The industrial action, including a work-to-rule by all trade union members, is already having an impact with residents claiming overflowing bins have not being emptied.A second day of strike action has been called for end of the month.

In , he was a member of a crew of just eight leboat volunteers from across the UK who flew out to aid the relief effort in flood-stricken Mozambique.Together, the team faced the dangers of crocodiles, hippos, poisonous snakes and anti-personnel mines, navigating rivers that had burst their banks, in a rescue mission to bring desperately needed medical relief to , people in villages marooned by flood waters.ldquoWe had five small D class inflatable leboats, and had to ferry doctors and medical supplies to areas that had been written off as impossible, as helicopters couldnrsquot land there and they were inaccessible by road, he said.ldquoIt was so hot that the soles of my boots melted. We had to spend the night on sandbars where we took turns to keep watch, as the crocodiles were very keen to join us.Since he joined the crew, Mike has combined his volunteering with his paid job in the South Wales Fire and Rescue service. He joined the service back in , at just , and progressed from his position as a firefighter, to the lead instructor for recruit training, finally finishing his career in  as Chair of the Water Rescue group, and a member of the servicersquos all Wales flood response team.Over the past four decades, -year-old Mr Kingston has seen huge changes in the way the RNLI operates.He has seen Penarth leboat station move from its original home in the deck chair store underneath the current Coffi Co building on the Esplanade, to its current location just up the road in a purpose built, modern leboat station.ldquoIrsquom sure the people of Penarth will remember the hand held maroons that were fired off by a leboat crew member to call the rest of us to the station for a launch, he said.ldquoBut even before that, I remember when the Pier Master would get us down to the station by firing the maroons out of a small cannon.ldquoNowadays, technology has moved on and we use pagers, mobiles phones and computer systems to respond to a shout.ldquoThese systems are a lot more sophisticated, but itrsquos still the same feeling when yoursquore called out of bed in the early hours of a freezing cold January morning.ldquoNo matter how times have moved on, one thing that remains constant is the unbelievable commitment of the whole RNLI team.ldquoThere have been so many highs and lows over the past  years. As all the team will know, itrsquos good to feel that yoursquore part of a team, giving something to your community.ldquoBut there have also been some sad times when people have lost their lives.

They have done an incredible job over the past few weeks to be ready for delivery.ldquoThe secretary of state said, crucially, that this is a UK-wide effort will he give a cast-iron guarantee that not only this tranche of vaccines but future tranches will be available on a completely equitable basis throughout the UK, so that we can bear down on this virus in every part of our country It was good to get a guarantee on that from the secretary of state. I also spoke this week on the worrying reversal in progress tackling global hunger and famine.With so many struggling to access basic food needs at home and abroad, wersquove seen an extraordinary lack of compassion from this Tory government in the run-up to Christmas by failing to tackle holiday hunger in England at the same time as slashing our humanitarian relief while millions face famine.Itrsquos time for a Christmas U-turn on both.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a commentOrder byOldest firstNewest firstHighest scoredLowest scoredLoading comments...

These projected figures are the highest we have ever seen in this County and are likely to reach almost , cases per , in the seven-day period up until Christmas Day.If you compare that with the figure of  cases per , when we entered the local lockdown, you can see how serious the current situation is. We can no longer be complacent.We know from the first and second waves that as case numbers increase, more people get seriously unwell, and we will inevitably see more deaths from Coronavirus - many of which can be avoided,we act now.We are deeply concerned that hospitals and primary care services across Cardf and the Vale of Glamorgan are now under unsustainable pressure due to COVID-, and sadly, but inevitably, the number of people who are becoming very sick is increasing daily.Each and every one of us has a responsibility to act now. We must all follow Welsh Government coronavirus regulations, butyou can also take further actions to protect those you love, then we urge you to do so.We should not meet with anyone outside our household bubble and keep contact with people outside our household to an absolute minimum until the current threat has passed, but especially in the run-up to Christmas.We know that staying away from loved ones will be painful for many, especially at this time of year, butwe do this now, we will be doing everything we can to protect our family and friends for the months to come.We know many people think that the vaccine is going to become more widely available, so everything is going to be okay. Regrettably, that is simply not the case. If we donrsquot change our behaviour now,many people will die before the vaccine is rolled out, people who donrsquot need to die, possibly people who you know.The full roll out of the vaccine will take many months, so now is not the time to be complacent. Very few of us are immune and the virus is still prevalent in our communities and our hospitals. By practising social distancing, washing our hands regularly and wearing face coverings we will all be doing our bit to help.So, our message is simple.Wash your hands regularly oryou canrsquot do that use sanitiser hand gel.Please try and stay at home and only go out for essential reasons andit is essential to go out, please do so in quieter periods.If you do go out, wear a mask when required and keep socially distanced by at least  metres, wherever possible.Please do not mix with other households or your friends.Work from home,you can do so.If you develop symptoms such as a new and continuous cough, a temperature, or a loss of taste or smell please self-isolate with your household and arrange a test.These small steps can really help us all to keep our communities safe.As a Health Board and Council, we are fully mobilised in the fight against COVID-. Doing so continues to be a huge challenge and is one that we will best achieve,we do it together, just as we did in the Spring.We are asking every one of you to achieve this challenge together.Letrsquos stop the spread, and letrsquos keep the Vale of Glamorgan, the NHS and our loved ones safe.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Hospitality businesses would have joined them on pm Christmas Day, with a level four lockdown coming into place on Monday, December . The five day lsquorelaxationrsquo period would have still been in place according to these rules, but a change from three households mixing to two.But on Saturday, December , all this changed as prime minister Boris Johnson held a press conference to update the UK on the rapid spread of the new strain of coronavirus and announcing that the South East of England, including London would be moved into tier four.Tier four means residents must stay at home with some limited exemptions ndash which includes workunable to do so from home, however, working from home is strongly advisedit is possible. Non-essential services must also close.

He announced that the tier four lockdown would come into place from midnight on Saturday, December , meaning businesses had a matter of hours to come to terms with the news and people rushed out to do some last-minute Christmas shopping before all the non-essential retail closed.Some of the supermarkets across Wales have now taken their lsquonon-essentialrsquo items off sale.The festive period bubble rule has also changed, with a maximum of two households allowed to mix on Christmas Day.MORE NEWS:Mr Drakeford said in a statement on Saturday evening that the pattern of transmission in London and the South East of England, which is linked to the new iant of coronavirus, is ldquoremarkably consistent with the rapid acceleration of transmission in Wales in recent weeks.Also in the statement, the first minister said that latest evidence had suggested the new strain is present throughout Wales and that it needed an ldquoimmediate response.After meeting with the Welsh Governmentrsquos Cabinet on Saturday and taking into consideration advice from senior medical and scientic advisors, he said: ldquoThe situation is incredibly serious.

And light does more than create a festive mood mdash light brings hope.ldquoFor Christians, Jesus is lsquothe light of the worldrsquo, but we canrsquot celebrate his birth today in quite the usual way. People of all faiths have been unable to gather as they would wish for their festivals, such as Passover, Easter, Eid and Vaisakhi. But we need le to go on.ldquoLast month, fireworks lit up the sky around Windsor, as Hindus, Sikhs and Jains celebrated Diwali, the festival of lights, providing joyous moments of hope and unity mdash despite social distancing.ldquoRemarkably, a year that has necessarily kept people apart has, in many ways, brought us closer. Across the Commonwealth, my family and I have been inspired by stories of people volunteering in their communities, helping those in need.ldquoIn the United Kingdom and around the world, people have risen magnicently to the challenges of the year, and I am so proud and moved by this quiet, indomitable spirit. To our young people in particular I say thank you for the part you have played.ldquoThis year, we celebrated International Nursesrsquo Day, on the th anniversary of the birth of Florence Nightingale. As with other nursing pioneers like Mary Seacole, Florence Nightingale shone a lamp of hope across the world.ldquoToday, our frontline services still shine that lamp for us ndash supported by the amazing achievements of modern science ndash and we owe them a debt of gratitude.ldquoWe continue to be inspired by the kindness of strangers and draw comfort that ndash even on the darkest nights ndash there is hope in the new dawn.MORE NEWS:Do you know what happened to this poor kitten How Sully came together at Christmas through the power of the artsAll the supermarket opening times over Christmas and New YearldquoJesus touched on this with the parable of the Good Samaritan. The man who is robbed and left at the roadside is saved by someone who did not share his religion or culture. This wonderful story of kindness is still as relevant today.ldquoGood Samaritans have emerged across society showing care and respect for all, regardless of gender, race or background, reminding us that each one of us is special and equal in the eyes of God.ldquoThe teachings of Christ have served as my inner light, as has the sense of purpose we can find in coming together to worship.ldquoIn November, we commemorated another hero ndash though nobody knows his name. The Tomb of the Unknown Warrior isnrsquot a large memorial, but everyone entering Westminster Abbey has to walk around his resting place, honouring this unnamed combatant of the First World War mdash a symbol of selfless duty and ultimate sacrice.ldquoThe Unknown Warrior was not exceptional. Thatrsquos the point. He represents millions like him who throughout our history have put the lives of others above their own, and will be doing so today. For me, this is a source of enduring hope in dficult and unpredictable times.ldquoOf course, for many, this time of year will be tinged with sadness: some mourning the loss of those dear to them, and others missing friends and family members distanced for safety, when all theyrsquod really want for Christmas is a simple hug or a squeeze of the hand.ldquoIf you are among them, you are not alone, and let me assure you of my thoughts and prayers.ldquoThe Bible tells how a star appeared in the sky, its light guiding the shepherds and wise men to the scene of Jesusrsquos birth. Let the light of Christmas mdash the spirit of selflessness, love and above all hope mdash guide us in the times ahead.ldquoIt is in that spirit that I wish you a very happy Christmas. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Wherersquos the robust plan to make sure our childrenrsquos education isnrsquot being ruined ldquoI donrsquot disagree at all with the decision to keep them off school, but there needs to be a plan in place.Mrs Lacey, who works full-time as well as her husband, said on Wednesday her son had received no face to face teaching by midday.ldquoI think schools are trying, but communication with parents needs to improve in our case.ldquoWersquove also had little clarity on whether the mock exams he did when he was in before Christmas will have a bearing on predicting grades later this year. Itrsquos very uncertain and the I do get the feeling the goodwill is starting to dwindle.Nikki LaceyOn Wednesday it was confirmed that internal assessments replacing next summerrsquos cancelled exams in Wales are scheduled to start in schools on February .Mother-of-three Clare Hollinshead, who has two children at primary school and one in secondary school, also says she felt the decision to extend the closure was the right one.Mrs Hollinshead ndash who is undergoing cancer treatment and is vulnerable ndash says she worried about relying on the actions of others to keep her family safe.Clare HollinsheadldquoI think the decisionhad to be made, but I do have concerns for my children, she said.ldquoThe impact on them not seeing their friends and not getting the education they deserve is something them makes me anxious.ldquoToo much time alone and in front of a screen is no good for anyone.ldquoIt will be more concerningit continues after January . Itrsquos dficult to maintain that motivation to keep going and keep balancing le with home-schooling.ldquoButitrsquos what we have to do then so be it. Itrsquos so important we protect the NHS. Irsquod hate for someone who was in my positionto not get the treatment they need because our hospitals are overwhelmed.On Tuesday Ms Williams said schools will only remain closed after January  ldquo thatrsquos the only thing we can do to suppress the virus.ldquoClearly any decision to close schools for face-to-face teaching contact for the majority of children is a really dficult decision, she said, ldquoand itrsquos a decision which has grave consequences for children.ldquoEducation has a role to play in helping suppress the virus and helping our NHS to cope, and helping those doctors and nurses and healthcare professionals who are on the front line and struggling so hard. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Mum was a real wheeler dealer and I learned so much from her in those amazing summers, travelling around Scotland and the North of England, her original home.”Maggie was born Margaret Titler in March  in Gateshead, which then was part of County Durham. The eldest of four children, Maggie lived through World War II and survived Scarlet Fever.She moved at the age of  to Northern Ireland with her family when her father, Jack, was asked to manage the Powell’s Products’ factory in Portadown.

She felt really ill on New Year’s Eve and she knew time was running out.“We got organised in two hours and married at pm.“She then fell asleep the same evening and never woke again.“She slipped away in her sleep,” said Lee.Writing on Facebook he revealed that the couple made the choice to bring their wedding forward.“She knew in herself that her time was getting shorter. We got married at home surrounded by close friends and family in a very intimate ceremony.“Jade passed away peacefully at home early on the nd of January with myself and Billyholding her hand. Our hearts are broken but at peace knowing Jade is no longer suffering,” wrote Lee, thanking everyone for their support.Before Christmas, Jade was not just planning her wedding but also her funeral.Lee said: “She has banned black from her funeral and she hates being the centre of attention,”Jade’s struggle started in November  with headaches and doctors said she had nasal polypsand gave her antibiotics.Later she was given an appointment with the ENT unit at Craigavon Hospital but the COVID- pandemic hit and all appointments were cancelled.Lee explained that she began to get very bad headaches and the polyps started to grow, so much so that her eyes were bulging from her head.After a CT scan in April last year, they diagnosed a tumour and Jade had an operation the following week.“About five weeks later the tumour came back and after a second operation they removed as much as they could.“She has had four blocks of chemotherapy, three times a week. “At the end of her chemo she started radiotherapy in September. She had to be kept in hospital for seven weeks and couldn’t see the boys.“She missed our six year old son’s birthday,” said Lee.“She finished that treatment on November  but we had to go back to Craigavon Hospital when she started to get extreme pain in her legs and couldn’t move. She kept falling asleep so quickly.”Lee said they were told on December  the cancer had spread and the diagnosis was terminal.A GoFundMe page had been set up to help the couple with their wedding and funeral arrangements.Donations came to £, and the page has since closed.Lee’s cousin Marianne Parker, who set up the page said: “On behalf of our family I would like to say a huge thank you to each and every kind person that donated.

As a result, Cllr Baxter’s proposal passed with  votes in favour, eight against and one abstention recorded.However, upon discussion of the committee meeting’s minutes at December’s meeting of full council, Councillor Liam Mackle proposed that Council did not accept the recommendation put forward by the committee.This proposal was seconded by his party colleague Councillor Paul Duffy.Councillor Pope said it “was very important” that the occasion is marked and noted the need for education and cultural events to be spread throughout the borough.He also expressed his concerns about budgets and the idea of a large event taking place giving the current pandemic.“I would propose we accept the original recommendationfrom the November committee that listed the programme, including the £, budget,” said Cllr Pope. This proposal was seconded by his party’s group leader, Councillor Eoin Tennyson.Speaking about the issue, Cllr Tennyson said the programme had been discussed atand explained, from his perspective, initialdiscussions were constructive.“All parties engaged with a view to marking the centenary in a way that was inclusive and respectful,” said Cllr Tennyson. “I think the original recommendation that was presented by officers to the committee was one that did that.“It would allow us to mark the centenary in a way that was inclusive and reflective of the entire borough and also balanced against the need to be prudent in terms of the financial situation we as a council and indeed many of our rate payers are in.“I can’t in good conscience support a proposal that would see this council commit to an additional £, unbudgeted spend. The reality is that money is going to have be found through the estimates process.“We could end up in the situation where that money will have to be found through a rates hike or cuts to services. I think Councillor Pope’s proposal is an eminently sensible one and I hope all parties can see it in themselves to support that approach.”DUP councillor Darryn Causby sought clarity on what was being proposed andthe proposals tabled complied with standing orders.“Under standing order .. there should only be one amendment moved and discussed at one time, the same applies for proposals on the floor,” said Cllr Causby.“There was one on the floor, Cllr Pope then put a second one on the floor but can I please get clarity on the first one [Cllr Mackle’s proposal] it seems to be a direct negative of what is in the papers and under standing orders I am not clear on whether that is acceptable.“The other point I would raise is the budget was actually agreed at the November council meeting and we just ratied that a short time ago.“If someone is not happy with that, I suggest they look through standing orders and bring a rescinding motion to change that decision.”At this point Council’s Lord Mayor, Councillor Kevin Savage informed members he needed to speak with Council’s Chief Executive Roger Wilson and muted his microphone.Following his confidential discussionwith Mr Wilson, the Lord Mayor confirmed the budget had already been agreed before putting Councillor Mackle’s proposal, to reject the recommendation put forward by the committee, to the floor.All unionist councillors present voted against the proposal as did the three members of the Alliance Party. The members of Sinn Fein and the SDLP voted in favour of the proposal.With the votes totalled, the proposal was defeated with  members voting against the proposal and  voting in favour.The Lord Mayor then explainedthat as the recommendation of the committee stands, a rescinding motion would be requiredbefore Cllr Tennyson’s proposal could be heard.Councillor Tennyson said he was not sure he agreed with this interpretation.“The proposal was that we proceed with the programme originallyproposed by officers not the budget,” said Cllr Tennyson.“The budget may have been agreed, the programme has never been agreed therefore a rescinding motion is not required.“We have proposed that we proceed with the originalprogramme as proposed to the economic development and regeneration committee, it just so happened to be at a cost of £,.“I would be quite keen for that to be voted on as I do not share the analysis that a rescinding motion is required for a decision that has never been taken.”Councillor Baxter then said that as a matter of process given that Cllr Mackle’s proposal has fallen by “default the recommendation goes through”.“I do note Alliance are quite clearly trying to claw back as they could not bring themselves to vote for the celebration of Northern Ireland at the last committee meeting,” said Cllr Baxter.“By the very fact Cllr Mackle’s proposal has failed this recommendation from the committee is going through.”The Lord Mayor said that was his understanding as well and the recommendation as it stands has now gone through.A proposal to accept the minutes of the committee was put forward by Councillor Brian Pope and seconded by SDLP group leader, Councillor Thomas O’Hanlon.Editor’s message:Thank you for reading this article.

As at the beginning of the Covid- outbreak, these changes will allow Translink to focus their efforts on providing travel for key workers and ensure that people have access to essential services. However, I can assure the public that no geographical area is losing services and people will continue to be able to practice social distancing on our public transport network. “My priority as always is keeping our communities safe and my Department is doing everything it can to ensure essential services and connections are maintained for those using and reliant on our infrastructure network. I will keep the public transport situation under constant review in line with the public health advice. “As we enter a further period of enhanced restrictions, I am asking for your support and would ask everyone only to traveltheir journey is essential. If you do need to use public transport for an essential journey, I would again reiterate that people must wear a face covering. These requirements are part of the continuing effort that all of us must make to reduce the risk of transmission of Covid-. All of us have a responsibility to act to keep each other safe. Please do everything you can to protect yourself, protect your family and protect your community.”  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_ddefcdbabdccaed   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_edefcffaabfdedec   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"}]
