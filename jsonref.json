Among the tweets were ones that pictured Jarrett next to a character from Planet of the Apes, and a doctored image of Whoopie Goldberg wearing a t-shirt that shows Trump shooting himself in the head      Despite apologizing for her previous comments about George Soros and Valerie Jarrett, Barr retweeted a stream of content that backed her remarks while wading into other right-wing causes and conspiracies      Barr also said she thought former Obama adviser Valerie Jarrett was white when she penned the racist tweet that got her show pulled from television          Barr said she though Jarrett \u0027was Jewish and Persian\u0027 amid a bizarre flurry tweets penned late on Tuesday night          Valerie Jarrett was born in Iran but both of her parents are African American, and her great-grandfather was the first credited African American architect. She appeared on MSNBC on Tuesday (pictured) to lay blame for Barr\u0027s rhetoric at the feet of President Trump, saying: \u0027The tone comes from the top\u0027          The shamed star also blamed her racist rant on sleeping pill Ambien. Users have previously reported going into blackouts and performing complex actions such as driving and making food without recalling it           Roseanne\u0027s show was the most viewed program on ABC before it was cancelled over a tweet in which she said Jarrett was the lovechild of the \u0027Muslim Brotherhood and Planet of the Apes\u0027          Actor John Goodman, 65, stepped out to walk his dog in New Orleans on Tuesday soon after news broke that his show \u0027Roseanne\u0027 had been canceled because of his castmate Roseanne Barr\u0027s racist tweets          She then went on to rant about what she described as a Soros plot to overthrow America \u0027by buyingbacking candidates 4 local district attorney races who will ignore US law \u0026amp favor \u0027feelings\u0027 instead-and call everyone who is alarmed by that \u0027racist\u0027.\u0027Following on from that, she called on Americans to unite against his narrative while throwing a reference to MK Ultra, a discontinued CIA program that right-wing conspiracy theorists believe is still ongoing, into the mix           It was during this rant that Barr made the comment \u0027muslim brotherhood and planet of the apes had a babyvj\u0027, using Valerie Jarrett\u0027s initials, that would see her show axed.Barr subsequently deleted the tweet but not before it had been copied and shared across social media, leading to swift calls for her show to be pulled from the air.          After Barr\u0027s now-infamous Planet of the Apes tweet had been sent, Clinton replied around 9am to say that she was not in fact married to a Soros, though she admired the work his foundation does.Barr subsequently sent a Tweet apologizing to Clinton for the mistake, though launched another broadside at Soros by claiming he was a \u0027Nazi\u0027 who betrayed Jews during the holocaust.The actress also launched a salvo at Clinton\u0027s actual husband, Marc Mezvinsky, saying: \u0027HER HUSBAND IS THE SON OF A CORRUPT SENATOR.\u0027Clinton\u0027s father-in-law is a former congressman and convicted felon who in March of 2001 plead guilty to 31 of 69 felony charges of mail, bank and wire fraud.            But as the Clinton saga wound to a close Barr\u0027s tweet about Jarrett was catching a massive amount of attention, forcing the actress to brand her remark \u0027a joke\u0027.She also defended herself against allegations of racism by countering that Islam \u0027is not a race\u0027.The remarks were not enough, however, and around an hour later she offered a full apology to Jarrett and announced that she would be leaving Twitter.           Shortly after midday Wanda Sykes, an African-American comedian and writer working on the Roseanne reboot, announced that she was walking away from the program.Around an hour later ABC broke its silence over the controversy to say that Roseanne was being cancelled.We now know that the network spent this time contacting Jarrett to apologize and inform her of the cancellation.Barr later said that the network had bowed to pressure amid calls for a boycott of Roseanne\u0027s advertisers, though ABC did not immediately respond to her remark.In its statement, ABC said Roseanne\u0027s remark was \u0027abhorrent, repugnant and inconsistent with our values\u0027.       Soon after the news broke, Goodman, who played Barr\u0027s husband Dan on the TV show, was spotted looking very glum as he walked his dog          Goodman, 65, is yet to offer any comment on Barr\u0027s tweets or their show being axed          Gilbert, who played Darlene Conner on the series, had earlier slammed Barr\u0027s tweets as \u0027abhorrent\u0027  Barr also lashed out at former costar Sara Gilbert for her reaction to the racism row, in which Gilbert called her comments \u0027abhorrent\u0027 and \u0027disappointing\u0027, by saying \u0027wow! unreal\u0027  Bar clapped back at Michael Fishman, who played DJ Conner for the entirety of the series and was featured in the revival with a biracial daughter, accusing him of throwing her under a bus      Barr was widely condemned after she tweeted that Jarrett looked like \u0027Muslim brotherhood \u0026amp planet of the apes had a baby\u0027.Jarrett responded to the ordeal when she spoke at a town hall on MSNBC called \u0027Everyday Racism in America\u0027 later on Tuesday. She revealed that Disney CEO Bob Iger had called her to apologize.\u0027He wanted me to know before he made it public that he was canceling the show,\u0027 she said. \u0027First of all, I think we have to turn it into a teaching moment. I\u0027m fine. I\u0027m worried about all the people out there who don\u0027t have a circle of friends and followers coming to their defense. \u0027The person walking down the street minding their own business and they see someone clinging to their purse or walk across the street... or every black parent I know who has a boy who has to sit down and have a conversation, the talk as we call it.\u0027Those ordinary examples of racism that happen every single day.\u0027     ABC has decided to cancel Roseanne Barr\u0027s television show just hours after the comedian posted a racist tweet about Valerie Jarrett          \u0027We have decided to cancel her show,\u0027 Channing Dungey, President of ABC Entertainment, announced on Tuesday afternoon           Disney CEO Bob Iger  tweeted about ABC\u0027s decision, saying: \u0027There was only one thing to do here, and that was the right thing.\u0027 Disney owns ABC Television Group   Barr came under fire for a racist tweet about Valerie Jarrett during an unhinged rant on Tuesday morning          Many on Twitter were appalled by Barr\u0027s tweet, which was in response to an article from a conspiracy website The Disney CEO also tweeted about the decision to terminate the show, saying: \u0027There was only one thing to do here, and that was the right thing.\u0027Shortly after Barr\u0027s show was cancelled, talent agency ICM Partners revealed they were dropping her as a client. \u0027We are all greatly distressed by the disgraceful and unacceptable tweet from Roseanne Barr this morning,\u0027 ICM said in an internal note to employees that was obtained by the Hollywood Reporter. \u0027What she wrote is antithetical to our core values, both as iniduals and as an agency.\u0027 \u0027Consequently, we have notified her that we will not represent her. Effective immediately, Roseanne Barr is no longer a client.\u0027 It appears the cancellation of the show will also affect the cast\u0027s Emmy prospects, as ABC revealed it is suspending the show\u0027s FYC (For Your Consideration) campaign. Other networks including Viacom also dropped reruns of the original Roseanne as the industry turned its back on the show and its star performer. The swift fallout from the tweet began when Wanda Sykes  quit her role as the show\u0027s consulting producer and celebrities condemned Barr\u0027s words.   Emma Kenney, who played Sara Gilbert\u0027s daughter on the show, also revealed on Twitter that she planned to quit before finding out the show had been cancelled. \u0027I am hurt, embarrassed, and disappointed. The racist and distasteful comments from Roseanne are inexcusable,\u0027 the 18-year-old wrote. \u0027As I called my manager to quit working on Roseanne, I was told it was cancelled. I feel so empowered by @iamwandasykes , Channing Dungey and anyone at ABC standing up for morals and abuse of power. Bullies will NEVER win.\u0027Tom Arnold, who co-starred on the show from 1989 to 1993 and was married to Barr from 1990 to 1994, praised the decision to cancel the show.   \u0027Ton of respect for Bob Iger. Tough decision with financial consequences for his company but right for America,\u0027 he wrote. Michael Fishman, who played DJ Conner for the entirety of the series and was featured in the revival with a biracial daughter, said he was \u0027devastated\u0027. \u0027Today is one of the hardest days of my life. I feel devastated, not for the end of the Roseanne show, but for all those who poured their hearts and souls into our jobs, and the audience that welcomed us into their home,\u0027 he wrote on Twitter. Comedian Wanda Sykes had earlier revealed she would not return to the show following the comedian\u0027s racist tweet about Valerie Jarrett (Pictured L-R: Sykes, Russell Peters, Barr, JB Smoove, Keenen Ivory Wayans in 2014)          Sykes, a consulting producer for Barr\u0027s eponymous show on ABC, revealed the news on Twitter          Emma Kenney, who played Sara Gilbert\u0027s daughter on the show, revealed on Twitter that she planned to quit before finding out the show had been cancelled           Tom Arnold, who co-starred on the show from 1989 to 1993 and was married to Barr from 1990 to 1994, praised the decision to cancel the showFishman said he condemned Roseanne\u0027s statement \u0027vehemently\u0027, saying they were \u0027reprehensible and intolerable\u0027 and \u0027truly offensive\u0027.  \u0027My character was designed to represent the inclusive nature of my views. To represent potions of society often marginalized,\u0027 he wrote. \u0027In this moment it is important to be clear. We must stand up against bias, hatred, bigotry, and ignorance to make society a better place for all.\u0027  Many called on ABC to fire Barr or drop the show as others criticized the broadcast network for its enduring silence amid recent controversies with the comedian.Others were skeptical that ABC would dare touch the hit series, which is the third highest-rated show this year following Sunday Night Football and This Is Us.The revival of Roseanne was a ratings juggernaut when it premiered on ABC to a whopping 25 million viewers in April.It\u0027s surprising success even elicited a congratulatory phone call and tweet from President Donald Trump. Ratings dropped steadily thereafter, with last week\u0027s season finale garnering 10.33 million viewers.ABC  initially ordered 13 episodes for the second season and said the show would move away from its controversial politics and focus on family.    Roseanne\u0027s mention of the \u0027Muslim brotherhood\u0027 seems to be due to the long-running conspiracy theory that Jarrett is Muslim, despite there being no supporting evidence           She also retweeted an article with the headline: \u0027Valerie Jarrett...was her mommy a Commie?\u0027The show most recently came under fire for featuring an episode in which Barr\u0027s character believes her new Muslim neighbors are terrorists. Roseanne\u0027s mention of the \u0027Muslim brotherhood\u0027 in her Tuesday tweet seems to be due to the long-running conspiracy theory that Jarrett is Muslim. Jarrett, who was Obama\u0027s senior adviser during his presidency, was born in Iran to American parents and lived in Shiraz for six years. The family had moved to Iran because her father was part of a program that sent American physicians to help developing countries. He ran a children\u0027s hospital.There has never been any indication that Jarrett or her parents are Muslim.  Barr later claimed the comment was a \u0027joke\u0027 when she was called out on Twitter by CNN reporter Andrew Kaczynski. \u0027ABC is doing their best to ignore some of these statements from Roseanne and she is making it really hard for them by taking it to the next level here,\u0027 he wrote. After Roseanne responds, Kaczynski replied: \u0027understand it\u0027s a joke, but can you see why some people think comparing a black woman to Planet of the Apes might be racist and find the Muslim Brotherhood reference to be conspiratorial and Islamophobic?\u0027  A sudden hail shower saw large balls of ice fall in Daventry townHilarious moment cheeky kangaroo farts and wafts away smellSausage dog with punctured windpipe balloons three times its sizeRare footage show the world tallest man Robert Wadlow in 1936Bank to pay couple after son fleeced their bank accountsWorkman bites off the head of a live PIGEON in shocking videoHow to survive a knife attack: Chinese police\u0027s 12 second advice goes viral\u0027It\u0027s not a forever job\u0027:  Nick Grimshaw steps downYoung boy tries multiple times to give President Trump a hugShocking brawl breaks out between English and French touristsOut of control bus causes cars to collide on main road    A number of stars have since condemned Barr for the tweet, including Patricia Arquette and Julianne Moore. Rev Al Sharpton used ABC to fire Barr, while Rosie O\u0027Donnell defended her          Not everyone was happy with ABC\u0027s decision to cancel the show. Some stood by in their support for Barr, while others said the network should have continued without her A number of celebrities  also condemned Barr for the tweet, with some urging ABC to fire her from the show completely.\u0027I am repulsed that Valerie Jarret had that racist and bigoted \u0027joke\u0027 made at her expense and I am sickened that any Black or Muslim person has to keep hearing this sickness in 2018,\u0027 Patricia Arquette tweeted. \u0027You can take @RoseanneOnABC out of racism but you can\u0027t take the racism out of @therealroseanne,\u0027 Don Cheadle wrote. \u0027I told y\u0027all about Roseanne. I told you. So,\u0027 author Roxane Gay added, to which Julianne Moore replied: \u0027Yes you did. #FireRoseanne.\u0027 Reverend Al Sharpton also criticized the comedian and called on ABC to \u0027take action now\u0027. \u0027The comparison by Rosanne Barr on ABC of Former Obama aide, Valerie Jarrett to an APE is racist and inexcusable,\u0027 he tweeted. Tomi Lahren was a rare prominent conservative voice to hit out at Roseanne. \u0027What Roseanne said was wrong,\u0027 she tweeted. \u0027I\u0027m sure she knows that. She made a mistake.\u0027 \u0027I don\u0027t know why fellow conservatives are playing mental gymnastics trying to justify it. Come on. Wrong is wrong.\u0027 Only Rosie O\u0027Donnell appeared to lend some support to Roseanne, writing that she loved her \u0027quite a bit\u0027. \u0027The comment Roseanne tweeted was racist and childish and beneath her best self,\u0027 O\u0027Donnell wrote. \u0027She has apologized.

I disagree on some things, but give him benefit of doubt-4 now,\u0027 she added. The tweet was similar to when, in 2015, Barr revealed that she believed the Pizzagate conspiracy theory that Hillary Clinton was running a child sex-ring in a pizza shop. \u0027Americans! The reason #DEMOCRATS aren\u0027t approving #Sessions is bc he will prosecure #HRC – and make arrests over PedoGate RT THIS!! WAKE UP!!\u0027Barr was slammed and derided for the tweets. She later apologized for mentioning child trafficking and said Twitter was \u0027not the place for it\u0027. In 2015 Barr made headlines after tweeting she \u0027hope all the jews leave UC Davis and then it gets nuked!\u0027 after the student body voted to est from companies that have ties to Israel           In 2012 the comedian came under fire after she spoke out against transgender bathroom rightsIn 2012 the comedian came under fire after she spoke out against transgender bathroom rights. \u0027Women do not want your penises forced in their faces or in private bathrooms. Respect that,\u0027 she wrote.  After the comedian\u0027s most recent Twitter controversies came to light, Walt Disney President Ben Sherwood responded that \u0027you can\u0027t control Roseanne Barr\u0027.\u0027Many who have tried have failed. She\u0027s the one and only,\u0027 he added. But as Tuesday\u0027s news has proved, you can still cancel here.                         \u0027You\u0027re a racist pig \u0026amp ABC should be ashamed that they give you a platform,\u0027 another added. Roseanne later tweeted, in an attempt to defend herself, that \u0027Islam is not a race\u0027. \u0027Islam includes EVERY RACE of people,\u0027 she added, still without acknowledging the fact that there is no evidence Jarrett has ties to the Islamic faith. She also retweeted an article whose headline read: \u0027Valerie Jarrett...was her mommy a Commie?\u0027 About an hour later, Roseanne apologized and said she was leaving Twitter.     \u0027I apologize to Valerie Jarrett and to all Americans,\u0027 she wrote in a separate tweet. \u0027I am truly sorry for making a bad joke about her politics and her looks. I should have known better.

His body was laid to rest in a casket measuring 10 feet, 9 inches, and weighing 1,000 pounds.A life-size bronze statue of him stands in his hometown of Alton, Illinois, while three others stand in Guinness Museums around North America with several wax models of him  in Ripley\u0027s Believe It or Not Museums for people stand alongside and pose next to him.

(Zimbabwe, for example, was allowed to continue trading diamonds despite the Mugabe government’s involvement in massacring gem miners.)Although some fear De Beers’s move could devastate its core mining business by knocking the floor out of diamond prices, its executives have come round to the view that people are increasingly happy to buy diamonds for their sparkle alone, rather than their high value and exclusivity.And from a PR point of view, it plays to the public’s growing concern about the ethics of the business — and may well empty the pockets of dictators, terrorists and shady middlemen who still make billions from the trade in illegal gems.The science behind the man-made gems set to revolutionise the market is far from new. It was in the early Fifties that technicians at the American industrial giant General Electric took a tiny fragment of diamond (called a ‘seed’) and subjected it to intense pressure and heat (4,000c) in a hydraulic press, while carbon-containing gas was passed over it.    Djimon Hounsou (left) and Leonardo DiCaprio (right), starred in the 2006 film Blood Diamond — which highlighted the illicit trade in diamonds mined by workers in war zonesThis mimicked the conditions that create diamonds over millions of years underground: carbon atoms in the gas stick to the seed one by one, building up the intricate carbon lattice structure of a diamond at a rate of roughly 0.0002 of an inch per hour.The end result, a chunky cube of diamond, can be cut and polished into the traditional shape. Manufactured diamonds produced in this way have sold for a discount of 20-40 per cent on the real thing.De Beers is well versed in the technology, as the world’s leading supplier of synthetic industrial diamonds through its UK-based subsidiary Element Six.Diamond, long regarded as the world’s hardest-known material, is used for cutting, grinding, drilling, oil extraction, marble polishing, and in precision electronic sensors for cars.As well as this high-temperature technique (which also requires pressure equivalent to placing the 7,300-ton Eiffel Tower on a single can of Coke), De Beers has been developing a cheaper synthetic diamond-making process called chemical vapour deposition.This involves pumping carbon-containing gases into a low- pressure vacuum around the diamond seed, again building up in layers to create a single stone.In the past decade, the technologies involved have advanced so much that synthetic diamonds are now much cheaper to produce.What’s more, their quality is such that it is no longer possible to tell the difference between natural and lab-produced gems with the human eye. Even professionals, using magnifying glasses and microscopes, find it difficult.\u0027I\u0027ll treasure it forever\u0027: Heartbroken bride whose fiance...Share this articleThis was amply demonstrated six years ago when 600 lab-grown diamonds were found in a collection of 1,000 gems. The synthetic stones even included intentionally created impurities to make them look more natural.The only people who could detect the difference were experts at the International Gemological Institute in Antwerp.So if the synthetic versions are that good, should buyers care that they are not ‘real’?Well, there is always the small matter of value. One of the biggest fears of traders, collectors and owners of diamond jewellery is that a flood of comparatively cheap, lab-made diamonds will result in a dramatic devaluation of mined diamonds.But in fact, contrary to Marilyn Monroe’s claim, diamonds were never really a girl’s best friend in terms of investment or resale.While large rare diamonds may command a premium, the small ones found in rings, bracelets, pendants and earrings are too common to appreciate in value. They seldom even keep the price paid for them at a jeweller’s.But clearly there will be an impact, not least because synthetic gems are unlikely to have any resale value in a world that could be awash with them.There is no question that this is a canny move by De Beers.

One stupid joke in a lifetime of fighting 4 civil rights 4 all minorities, against networks, studios, at the expense of my nervous systemfamilywealth will NEVER b taken from me.\u0027That comment came hours after Barr retweeted an outlandish statement suggesting that Michelle Obama played a role in her firing.       She suggested Michelle Obama was behind her firing by retweeting two unsourced claims alleging that the former first lady conspired with Channing Dungey ahead of ABC\u0027s decision          \u0027According to sources ABC President Channing Dungey had a long conversation via phone with former First Lady Michelle Obama before deciding to cancel the Roseanne show,\u0027 read the tweet. \u0027Michelle Obama was reportedly enraged and insisted an apology was inadequate.\u0027Barr also retweeted a post that further suggested this was an attempt by the Obamas to get revenge after she mocked the couple\u0027s Netflix deal with a hashtag last week that became a trending topic.\u0027Interesting. A few days after the popular #ObmasNetflixShows was all over the place making people giggle. Not surprised and I would not doubt it being very true,\u0027 read the post that Barr shared with her followers.These were just two of the conspiracy theories retweeted by Barr in the wake of the show\u0027s cancellation.    ABC decided to cancel Roseanne Barr\u0027s television show \u0027Roseanne\u0027 on Tuesday just hours after the comedian posted a racist tweet about Valerie Jarrett          Valerie Jarrett has spoken out on the controversy surrounding Roseanne Barr\u0027s racist tweets, saying the ABC made the right decision to cancel her show          Roseanne caused outrage when she compared ex-Obama adviser Valerie Jarrett to an ape on Twitter           Keeping above the fray: Barr also retweeted an inidual who suggested the Obamas, who employed and are close friends with Valerie Jarrett, did this as revenge because Barr mocked their $50 million Netflix deal (l to r: Jarrett, Michelle and Barack in 2014)It comes after her ex-husband Tom Arnold told CNN\u0027s Anderson Cooper that he wasn\u0027t surprised and it was only a matter of time before all hell broke loose. Arnold - who was a writer on the original Rosanne series - claimed that Barr\u0027s politics and social media showed that she was obsessed with the conspiracy theories that Donald Trump has been feeding to the masses.  \u0027This monkey thing is something that she tweeted before about black people, its a meme that she and thousands of her alt-right fans do. They love to call black people monkeys, it\u0027s not a one time joke,\u0027 Arnold said. \u0027They can do this because we have a white trash racist president. That\u0027s a fact!\u0027Arnold shared his disgust with how Trump was only concerned with how the media had treated him when news of Barr\u0027s tweets made their way to him.        Meanwhile, Barr\u0027s son Jake shared text exchanges with his mother on Wednesday to seemingly prove she was not racist.\u0027Her and her dad, I thought they were white,\u0027 Barr wrote in a text message she purportedly sent her son.She followed that up by saying: \u0027I would never have called a black woman an ape I\u0027m not stupid!\u0027 That is a lie however, with Barr having called former national security advisor Susan Rice just that in a 2014 tweet. The third text stated: \u0027I thought she was Jewish of Iranian.\u0027 Her son captioned the image by writing: \u0027Mom and I are too dumb for the internet lol.           On Wednesday, actor Tom Arnold appeared on AC360 to share that he wasn\u0027t surprised when ABC pulled the plug on the \u0027Roseanne\u0027 reboot  Contextual: Her son also shared text messages that he and his mother purportedly exchanged in which Barr writes that she thought Jarrett was \u0027white\u0027 and \u0027Iranian,\u0027 posted eight hours after the show was cancelled            Commander-in-chief: President Trump complained that ABC president Bob Iger \u0027never ... apologized for the HORRIBLE statements made and said about me on ABC\u0027Barr had previously blasted two of her co-stars for speaking out against her in tweets posted around midnight.Hours after claiming she was quitting Twitter, Barr began to rail against her critics while also posting an occasional apology.Michael Fishman, who played D.J. Conner on the show and started working with Barr when he was just six, was the first to feel the wrath of the show\u0027s creator after he released a statement criticizing her racist tweet saying Jarrett looks like the lovechild of the \u0027Muslim Brotherhood and Planet of the Apes\u0027.\u0027I condemn these statements vehemently,\u0027 wrote Fishman, who is the father of a black daughter in the reboot. \u0027They are reprehensible and intolerable, contradicting my beliefs and outlook on life and society. I have always lived and taught my children to be inclusive. I believe our show strived to embrace different backgrounds and opinions, through open dialogue.\u0027Barr was none too happy with that statement and fired back on Twitter. \u0027I created the platform for that inclusivity and you know it. ME. You throw me under the bus. nice!\u0027, she wrote.Fishman responded, stating: \u0027You fought, built, and designed Roseanne for inclusiveness. That is why yesterday was so out of character with the last 30 years. It was in your hands from the beginning to the end. No one can deny that.\u0027Barr fired back: \u0027Please leave me alone, thanks.\u0027             Michael Fishman, who played D.J. Conner on the show, released a statement criticizing Barr\u0027s racist tweet  Weighing in: Gilbert, who is a producer on the reboot, let her disgust be known on TuesdayBut Fishman was not the only original cast member to take a stand, with Sara Gilbert, who played Roseanne\u0027s daughter Darlene, also releasing a statement that very much echoed the one released shortly after by ABC cancelling the show.\u0027Roseanne’s recent comments about Valerie Jarrett, and so much more, are abhorrent and do not reflect the beliefs of our cast and crew or anyone associated with our show. I am disappointed in her actions to say the least,\u0027 wrote Gilbert, who was a producer on the reboot and largely responsible for reuniting the cast.\u0027This is incredibly sad and difficult for all of us, as we’ve created a show that we believe in, are proud of, and that audiences love— one that is separate and apart from the opinions and words of one cast member.\u0027\u0027Wow! unreal,\u0027 wrote Barr, who had confessed in earlier interviews to the difficult job Gilbert had of trying to rein in her impulse to tweet offensive comments.However, she later followed up, tweeting: \u0027No, I understand her position and why she said what she said. i forgive her. It just shocked me a bit, but I indeed f***ed up.\u0027She reiterated this soon after when a follower criticized Gilbert, saying: \u0027She\u0027s distancing herself from me and my tweet-she has to.\u0027A downcast Gilbert was photographed on her phone outside an LA restaurant yesterday as John Goodman, who played Barr\u0027s husband Dan on the show, looked similarly bereft as he walked his dog in New Orleans.   "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/31/00/4CC4208C00000578-0-image-a-6_1527724492447.jpg","title":"British woman 30 survives plunging 100 metres rocky mountain crossing icy summit","story":"    A British woman has survived a horrific plunge down a rocky mountain after trying to cross an icy summit.

Anti-establishment leader Luigi Di Maio (pictured) made a move on Wednesday to resurrect a populist coalition in Italy that collapsed at the weekendWhile a clear majority of Italians favour 5-Star and League forming a government, a large majority also want to remain part of the euro.Two polls show that between 60-72 per cent of Italians want the country to remain part of the euro while 23-24 per cent would choose to drop the common currency. On Wednesday, 5-Star Movement leader Luigi Di Maio attempted to resurrect the populist coalition by offering to withdraw Eurosceptic Paolo Savona as his choice for finance minister. Italy\u0027s \u0027populist\u0027 parties get MORE popular: Anti-EU League...\u0027Brussels has no shame!\u0027 Italian populist leaders demand an...Share this article    Sergio Mattarella vetoed the appointment of Paolo Savona (pictured) who has described the euro as a \u0027German cage\u0027 and said that Italy needs a plan to leave the single currency \u0027if necessary\u0027The euro, bonds and stocks initially rallied on Monday after President Sergio Mattarella vetoed Savona\u0027s nomination, but relief turned to fear over snap elections. The gap between Italian and German 10-year bond yields, a measure of Italian risk, widened to its highest in over four years.\u0027The election is going to resemble a referendum, de facto, on the European Union and the euro,\u0027 said Francesco Galietti, head of political risk consultancy Policy Sonar in Rome. \u0027It\u0027s an existential threat for the entire euro zone.\u0027If Italians were to cast a protest vote against the EU and euro at fresh elections, it would deliver the bloc\u0027s biggest challenge since Britain voted to quit the union two years ago and raise questions about the future of the single currency.As the euro zone\u0027s third-largest economy, heavily indebted Italy also represents a far bigger potential threat to the single currency than the Greek economic crisis.Polls show the League has gained support since winning 17 percent of the vote in inconclusive March 4 elections, climbing as high as 24 percent. The 5-Star has been drawing about the same 32 percent it got two months ago.Former prime minister Massimo D\u0027Alema, caught speaking on an open microphone on Saturday, summed up the fears of traditional parties: \u0027If we go back to elections because of a veto on Savona, they (anti-establishment parties) are going to win 80 percent.\u0027On the street, some voters believe Salvini is right to challenge the president\u0027s veto and go back to the polls.\u0027I\u0027m really ticked off. The president sold out the country,\u0027 said Giancarlo Sacco, 54, owner of a cafe in central Rome. Sacco said he wanted Italy to remain in the euro but that its concerns needed to be taken seriously by EU partners.\u0027It just has to make itself respected again.\u0027The president\u0027s veto of Savona as economy minister has put the currency, which was little discussed in the last election campaign, at the centre of the debate.\u0027Membership of the euro is a fundamental choice,\u0027 Mattarella said in a televised speech, explaining his veto. \u0027If we want to discuss it, then we should do so in a serious fashion.\u0027In February, Salvini railed against the euro, saying it was a \u0027mistake for our economy\u0027.\u0027We don\u0027t have a euro in our pockets. We have a German mark which they called the euro,\u0027 he said.The 5-Star dropped its previous calls for a non-binding referendum over Italy\u0027s euro membership, though its founder, comic Beppe Grillo, recently revived the idea.Political tensions are running high, with the League threatening street protests against Mattarella.On social media, League and 5-Star sympathisers made death threats against the president, while supporters crowding around Salvini and Di Maio during live TV interviews late on Sunday shouted insults at him.On the other side are Italians who, like many Britons devastated by the Brexit vote, see the country\u0027s relationship with Europe as fundamental.\u0027I am absolutely pro-European and I believe that Italy is connected, must have a connection with Europe for our future,\u0027 said Irene Teramo, a shopper at a street market in Rome, who supported the president\u0027s decision.Italians will also be weighing concern about their savings as financial markets put the country\u0027s stock market and bonds under pressure and borrowing costs increase.\u0027In his heart, the average voter will probably be cheering for the anti-establishment forces, but his wallet will be saying the opposite,\u0027 said political risk expert Galietti.\u0027It will be a heart versus wallet election.\u0027                                                              Luigi Di Maio offered the president a compromise over a controversial pick for economy minister          The League has so far insisted on new elections as the party\u0027s polling ratings soar. Pictured, League leader Matteo Salvini          But on Wednesday evening, Salvini was reported as saying that he would discuss the issue with Di MaioMattarella\u0027s veto of Savona and subsequent nomination of Cottarelli as caretaker prime minister angered lawmakers, most of whom had been ready to back the Eurosceptic as economy minister.There is almost no chance of his formation gaining parliamentary approval now that Five Star - the largest single party in Italy\u0027s hung parliament - have confirmed that they like the League will vote against.In the meantime factions in both houses had been trying to reach agreement over how long Cottarelli\u0027s caretaker mandate would last before new elections are held, with officials from the centre-left Democratic Party calling for the country to go to the polls as early as July.That could only happen if the parliament was dissolved before Friday.A more likely scenario is new elections in early October, should Di Maio and Salvini not agree on moving Savona to another ministry.So far, Salvini has made no secret of his hostility to trying again with Mattarella before fresh elections.      Investors have been dumping Italian government bondsImpact on Britain\u0027s economy?Britain is not in the Eurozone and UK banks have already reduced their exposure to Italy, so the impact is limited, for now. However, the FTSE 100 has been pummelled, with £25 billion wiped off the value of the blue chip index on Tuesday.Italy abandoning the euro would also be bad for Europe as a whole as it would be likely to trigger a financial crisis in one of the continent\u0027s biggest economies.The pound would normally benefit from a continental crisis as investors flock to safe haven assets, but since the Brexit vote the pound has fallen out of favour and has moved up only marginally against the euro.Political implications for the UK?Analysts fear that the Euroscepticism of the League Party and Five Star Movement could ultimately spill over into a Brexit-like disaster where Italy not only crashes out of the single currency but also out of the EU.But that is a long way off and Britain has its own political crisis brewing. Theresa May\u0027s Conservative Party is yet to ink a Brexit transition deal or give any indication whatsoever of how it plans to honour its pledge to deliver the \u0027exact same\u0027 benefits of EU membership from outside the bloc.What are the experts saying?Some believe that a full blown crisis is under way. Others, such as UBS chief economist Paul Donovan, think it is overblown.\u0027Everyone needs to take a deep breath and calm down,\u0027 he said.\u0027Bond market moves do not break up monetary unions. Bank runs do. There is no evidence of bank runs. Neither Italian parties nor Italian voters support leaving the euro.\u0027                                                     Stefan Leifert on Twitter: \u0026quot¿Dann müsste die Troika in Rom einmarschieren und das Finanzministerium übernehmen.

Repeat offenses could trigger fines of up to 10,000 kroner (£1,180) or a jail sentence of up to six months.Anyone forcing a person to wear garments covering the face using violence or threats can be fined or face up to two years in prison.There are around 310,000 Muslims in Denmark, according to the Pew Research Center, and most do no wear a veil. Denmark joins Austria, France, Belgium and Bulgaria which already have similar nationwide laws.Scale of anti-Muslim sentiment in Europe is revealed, with...ISIS claim responsibility for Belgium terror attack as...Share this articleAt least half of Germany\u0027s 16 states have bans on teachers and public servants wearing full-face veils.In 2016 Angela Merkel proposed banning full-face veils \u0027wherever it is legally possible\u0027, though no national legislation has yet been passed.The Netherlands and Italy also have partial burqa bans, though they are confined to specific towns, public places, or jobs.Gauri van Gulik, Amnesty International\u0027s Europe Director, said: \u0027All women should be free to dress as they please and to wear clothing that expresses their identity or beliefs.           Denmark is the fourth European country to pass such a law, after similar bans in Austria, Belgium and France (pictured, protesters oppose the French law)\u0027This ban will have a particularly negative impact on Muslim women who choose to wear the niqab or burqa.\u0027Whilst some specific restrictions on the wearing of full-face veils for the purposes of public safety may be legitimate, this blanket ban is neither necessary nor proportionate and violates the rights to freedom of expression and religion.\u0027If the intention of this law was to protect women\u0027s rights it fails abjectly. Instead, the law criminalises women for their choice of clothing and in so doing flies in the face of those freedoms Denmark purports to uphold.\u0027 Supporters argue the ban enables better integration of Muslim immigrants into Danish society, claiming the garment is used to oppress women.Martin Henriksen, spokesman for the anti-immigration Danish People\u0027s Party, said: \u0027Some people use (the full-face veil) to promote an ideology which, if successful, would mean many others would lose their right to freedom. It\u0027s a matter of balance.\u0027But Ayesha Haleem, a Pakistani woman who has been wearing the niqab for the past six years while in Denmark, said no one, including her husband, forced her to wear it.\u0027Many people believe that men force us to wear the niqab or burqa. That\u0027s completely wrong,\u0027 she told Danish public broadcaster DR.\u0027If I didn\u0027t want to wear the niqab then I wouldn\u0027t, even before meeting my husband,\u0027 Haleem said. \u0027I\u0027d rather leave the country than take my veil off.\u0027 "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/31/10/4CC5642700000578-5790409-image-a-11_1527758853715.jpg","title":"Russia calls North Korea sanctions lifted Sergei Lavrov meets Kim Jong un","story":"    The meeting was the first time Kim Jong-un had ever received a Russian official in Pyongyang          Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov (front) steps off a plane at Pyongyang on Thursday          Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov bows after laying flowers at the statues of the late leaders Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong IlTrump shares photo of \u0027great meeting\u0027 with Kim Kardashian in...North Korean ex-spy chief boards a plane for New York in...Secretary of State Pompeo meets top North Korean official...Share this articleHe also urged the state to hold off on relinquishing their nuclear weapons until tangible action had been taken to lift the economic stranglehold. \u0027This cannot be achieved at one go\u0027, he added. \u0027There can be no immediate denuclearisation, this should be done step by step and all sides should go half-way during every single phase of this process\u0027. The meeting was the first ever between the North Korean leader and a Russian official - and Lavrov used the opportunity to invite Kim for a return fixture in Moscow.\u0027Come to Russia, we\u0027ll be very happy to see you,\u0027 Lavrov told Kim in remarks released by the Russian foreign ministry.Last month North Korea\u0027s foreign minister Ri Yong Ho held rare talks with Lavrov in Moscow as Pyongyang moves to improve strained ties with global powers.      Foreign Minister Lavrov walking with several members of the North Korean delegation at the flower-laying ceremony          Diplomatic teams from North Korea and Russia in discussions on Thursday at the Mansudae Assembly Hall in PyongyangLavrov passed greetings from Russian President Vladimir Putin to Kim, saying he wished him success in the \u0027major undertakings that have been initiated on the Korean peninsula\u0027, the ministry said in a statement. The meeting between Lavrov and Kim lays bare Russia\u0027s desire to involve itself in diplomatic relations between North Korea and the US ahead of a potential summit. President Trump and Kim had planned to meet in  Singapore for a meeting on June 12 to discuss the potential for denationalization and greater cooperation between North and South Korea.Efforts are currently underway to restore the plans after Trump dramatically announced he was pulling out of the summit in a letter to Kim in May. Kim\u0027s right hand man General Kim Yong Chol flew into New York on Wednesday to try and salvage the assembly.

It has initially formed a system combat capability,\u0027 Ren said, without elaborating.    Little is known about the aircraft carrier programme, which China regards as a state secret. Pictured is China\u0027s second aircraft carrier, which is unnamed and solely developed by Beijing          China\u0027s second aircraft carrier is transferred from dry dock into the water on April 26, 2017China\u0027s second carrier began sea trials earlier in May. It is China\u0027s first domestically developed carrier and is yet to be named.Chinese military experts have told state media the new carrier is not expected to enter service until 2020 - once it has been fully fitted out and armed. The carrier was built in the port city of Dalian in north-east China\u0027s Liaoning Province.Unlike the U.S. Navy\u0027s longer-range nuclear carriers, both of China\u0027s feature Soviet-design ski-jump bows, intended to provide sufficient take-off lift for fighter jets. They lack the powerful catapult launch technology that U.S. carriers have.          Beijing said it has claimed the S. China Sea region enclosed by the \u0027nine-dash line\u0027 for centuries  Two U.S. Navy warships sailed near South China Sea islands claimed by China on Sunday, prompting anger in Beijing (pictured is Woody Island in the South China Sea)    U.S. assertions that China is militarising the South China Sea are \u0027ridiculous\u0027, said Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying (pictured in a file photo)\u0027This sounds like a case of a thief crying \u0027stop thief\u0027 to cover their misdeeds,\u0027 she said.Speaking at a separate briefing, defence ministry spokesman Senior Colonel Ren Guoqiang said they had noted that the United States had recently been \u0027turning a blind eye to the facts and hyping up\u0027 the militarisation of the South China Sea.No country has the right to \u0027make irresponsible remarks\u0027 about China\u0027s building of necessary defence facilities on its own territory, Ren said.However, he said the United States had formally proposed Mattis visit China, and both countries were coordinating on details. He did not provide a date for a possible trip. The Global Times, a state-backed Chinese tabloid that does not reflect official policy, said in an editorial on Thursday that China must prepare to forcefully respond to any \u0027extreme\u0027 U.S. interference in the South China Sea.\u0027Aside from deploying defensive weapons on the Spratly Islands, China should build a powerful deterrence system, including an aerial base and a roving naval force and base,\u0027 the paper said.

Eric Denson flew through a H-bomb radiation cloud above Christmas Island. Pictured: One of the first Hydrogen detonation on the islandAnd the effects of the sick experiment did not end with Eric\u0027s passing.Eric and Shirley had already had one daughter together before he was involved in the experiment. She was born healthy.However, 37 per cent of their descendants from children born after Eric passed through the radiation cloud were born with defects or unexplained medical conditions.These included skull deformities, missing or extra teeth and spinal problems.Two of his four children with Shirley were born with abnormalities, as were some of their grandchildren and great-grandchildren.RAF hero Eric was involved in early tests into the radiation caused by atomic and hydrogen bombs.In 1958 he was stationed in the Pacific Ocean on Malden Island and Christmas Island - the site of Operation Grapples, which saw the UK carry out some of its earliest nuclear weapons tests.Eric was ordered to fly his Canberra B6 bomber through a cloud left in the wake of a 2.8 megaton nuclear explosion on April 28, 1958, documents reveal.X-ray badges were stuck to his seat to measure the barrage of radiation as he and two others entered the cloud.They were placed behind his head, on both armrests and by his groin.The documents reveal \u0027care was taken to ensure as little shielding effect as possible\u0027 was given to the X-ray badges. Of course, this meant Eric and his crew became vulnerable to the deadly radiation.          Shirley (pictured holding a photo of Eric) claims many other young men were killed by the tests. \u0027They weren\u0027t told of any danger,\u0027 she said. \u0027Otherwise they wouldn\u0027t have gone\u0027          Squadron Leader Eric Denson (pictured) suffered chronic headaches and eventually killed himself in the wake of the Cold War experiment          The descendants of Shirley and Eric (pictured) have suffered from skull deformities, missing or extra teeth and spinal problemsThe document was an Atomic Weapons Establishment paper looking at ways of testing the badges to make sure they were accurate.They detail the exact amount of radiation absorbed by the head, arms and groin and the bomber\u0027s pilot, navigator and wireless operator.They also note the time spent inside the cloud, the height of the plane and the time the bomber entered the cloud after the bomb detonated.          The MoD continues to deny that Eric and his crew was subjects of an experiment, despite the emergence of new papersThe documents goes on to set out the pros and cons of the badges in measuring radiation. They also suggest re-running the experiment with more badges.When Eric\u0027s bomber touched down after the test he began to experience vomiting and developed a rash - common symptoms of radiation poisoning.The documents, written by scientists running the experiments, show that Eric, who was 24 at the time, had his head exposed to 65 years\u0027 worth of normal ­background ­radiation.This amounted to 17,500 dental X-rays worth of radiation during just six minutes of flight.The badge placed near Eric\u0027s groin recorded a dose of 8.8 Roentgens - about 30 years\u0027 worth of background radiation.In total he received 18.8Rs, the worst of the three-man crew which flew that day.Shirley is seeking an apology from the Ministry of Defence, who have insisted veterans were not used as guinea pigs during nuclear tests.She said: \u0027I want medals for my fellow veteran, and an apology and an acceptance of responsibility and I want compensation for us all because we lost our husbands. We lost our incomes.\u0027I was left with four children, with nothing.          The documents admitted the pilot was in the most exposed position to radiation          The documents detailed the exact amount of radiation absorbed by the head, arms and groin and the bomber\u0027s pilot, navigator and wireless operator.  Pictured: Scientists prepare for nuclear tests on Christmas Island\u0027The Americans have been marvellous with their nuclear veterans, the Russians put nuclear veterans right at the front of the parade.\u0027The British government - nothing.

His body was laid to rest in a casket measuring 10 feet, 9 inches, and weighing 1,000 pounds.A life-size bronze statue of him stands in his hometown of Alton, Illinois, while three others stand in Guinness Museums around North America with several wax models of him  in Ripley\u0027s Believe It or Not Museums for people stand alongside and pose next to him.

It has initially formed a system combat capability,\u0027 Ren said, without elaborating.    Little is known about the aircraft carrier programme, which China regards as a state secret. Pictured is China\u0027s second aircraft carrier, which is unnamed and solely developed by Beijing          China\u0027s second aircraft carrier is transferred from dry dock into the water on April 26, 2017China\u0027s second carrier began sea trials earlier in May. It is China\u0027s first domestically developed carrier and is yet to be named.Chinese military experts have told state media the new carrier is not expected to enter service until 2020 - once it has been fully fitted out and armed. The carrier was built in the port city of Dalian in north-east China\u0027s Liaoning Province.Unlike the U.S. Navy\u0027s longer-range nuclear carriers, both of China\u0027s feature Soviet-design ski-jump bows, intended to provide sufficient take-off lift for fighter jets. They lack the powerful catapult launch technology that U.S. carriers have.          Beijing said it has claimed the S. China Sea region enclosed by the \u0027nine-dash line\u0027 for centuries  Two U.S. Navy warships sailed near South China Sea islands claimed by China on Sunday, prompting anger in Beijing (pictured is Woody Island in the South China Sea)    U.S. assertions that China is militarising the South China Sea are \u0027ridiculous\u0027, said Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying (pictured in a file photo)\u0027This sounds like a case of a thief crying \u0027stop thief\u0027 to cover their misdeeds,\u0027 she said.Speaking at a separate briefing, defence ministry spokesman Senior Colonel Ren Guoqiang said they had noted that the United States had recently been \u0027turning a blind eye to the facts and hyping up\u0027 the militarisation of the South China Sea.No country has the right to \u0027make irresponsible remarks\u0027 about China\u0027s building of necessary defence facilities on its own territory, Ren said.However, he said the United States had formally proposed Mattis visit China, and both countries were coordinating on details. He did not provide a date for a possible trip. The Global Times, a state-backed Chinese tabloid that does not reflect official policy, said in an editorial on Thursday that China must prepare to forcefully respond to any \u0027extreme\u0027 U.S. interference in the South China Sea.\u0027Aside from deploying defensive weapons on the Spratly Islands, China should build a powerful deterrence system, including an aerial base and a roving naval force and base,\u0027 the paper said.

I read The Hobbit until it fell apart as a child, and have always strived, in my own contributions to the genre, to take even a shred of the care in my world-building that Tolkien did in his. “It is written in my life-blood,” he said of The Lord of the Rings, “such as that is, thick or thin and I can no other.” A rallying cry for anyone who has known what it is to inhabit a world of one’s own.“Tolkien was a genius with a unique approach to literature,” says Richard Ovenden, Bodley’s Librarian at the University of Oxford. “His imagined world was created through a combination of his deep scholarship, his rich imagination and powerful creative talent, and informed by his own lived experiences. We are incredibly proud to hold the Tolkien archive and to be able to share so many previously unseen items in this once-in-a-generation exhibition.”An exhibition, Tolkien: Maker of Middle-earth, is at the Weston Library in Oxford until October. Visiting before it opens, with preparations still ongoing, I must rely a little on my imagination to colour between the lines. We pass the skeleton of what will be the main entrance to the exhibition I am told by its curator, Catherine McIlwaine, that the Doors of Durin will be projected into this dark passageway to welcome visitors.At the heart of the gallery is a model that will chart the routes taken by Tolkien’s characters through the landscape of Middle-earth. As McIlwaine talks me through the items, I find that seeing the exhibition in this liminal state lends an unexpected resonance to the experience. After all, never is a story more alive than when it is in progress. Though many authors have since found great success in his genre, Tolkien, born in 1892, is unrivalled in his reputation as a meticulous creator who knew his world down to the last blade of grass. Today, Tolkien might have come to represent the old guard of fantasy – the “locker room” that the late Ursula K LeGuin once derided. Yet fierce passion for his work endures, and even his harshest critics will concede that few creators have succeeded in building a paracosm that touches the depth of Middle-earth. Every so often, a new offering will stoke the coals of Tolkienmania – Beren and Lúthien was published in 2017, and this August The Fall of Gondolin will expand on another story from The Silmarillion. Meanwhile Amazon has signed a deal for an ambitious TV adaptation of The Lord of the Rings. Throughout my career as a writer, I have found Tolkien to be a source of both self-doubt and inspiration. On the one hand, it can be tempting to give up in the face of his brilliance. He began to invent his first Elvish language when he was a student at Oxford, and eventually built a “Tree of Tongues” – one of the items on display in the exhibition – that charted his constructed languages from source. McIlwaine tells me about a painting Tolkien did when he should have been studying for his finals, of the realm of Valinor. “In 1915, it was all there, already in his head,” she explains. Dwelling on this too deeply could induce an existential crisis. More often, however, the knowledge of how fully Tolkien inhabited his work is a catalyst and a beacon. It fuels me to build larger, to dream weirder and to push harder at the bounds of my imagination.Exhibitions of the Bodleian’s extensive Tolkien collection are rare. Kept in a strongroom with four papyrus scrolls from Herculaneum, the material is tested before and after display and shown in the same womb-like darkness that wraps the Book of Kells in Dublin. Given the importance of preserving the collection, there has been no major exhibition for 26 years. After finishing its run in October, it will travel to New York, then to the Bibliothèque nationale de France. This is the first time the latter will host an exhibition about a foreign author. It is all too easy to believe in the myth of the professor as the one true god of a world he knew in its entirety. The truth, however, is more complex. Tolkien was not always sure of himself. A notebook page reveals that Gandalf once had the Elvish name Bladorthin, meaning grey wanderer. Gandalf, it turns out, was the original name of Thorin Oakenshield. Tolkien flickers between names in the text, as if torn. “He spoke about sub-creation,” McIlwaine says, “and I think this tied into his religious beliefs that all talents and gifts come from God. God is the one creator, and what we do is in imitation of that. Tolkien was a very humble man.” There is abundant evidence of his humility. He was uncertain of his skill as an artist, responsive to criticism, and went out of his way to seek feedback from his friends and children. He could also make the most absent-minded of mistakes – for instance, when he forgot to write his own name on the manuscript title page of The Hobbit.More than 200 items will be on show at the Weston Library, many for the first time – including personal objects donated by the Tolkien family, such as a pipe and a briefcase. Among my favourites is a letter from a fan who has attempted to write a poem in Elvish, which Tolkien has translated and annotated. He was confident enough in his grasp of his world to know when its rules were broken. Rules, after all, are vital in the creation of what he called “secondary belief” in an invented setting – yet he would have been the first to admit that there were uncharted places in Middle-earth.“I don’t desire to go and have afternoons talking Elvish to chaps,” he once said. “Elvish is too complicated. I’ve never finished making it.”Although Tolkien: Maker of Middle-earth will be free to attend, this is the first exhibition at the Bodleian to be ticketed. “I think people are going to be surprised,” McIlwaine tells me. “We don’t know what they will bring with them, but I’d like them to leave with the impression of the whole man and his work – not just Tolkien as the maker of Middle-earth, but as a scholar, a young professor, a father of four children.” In this, I believe McIlwaine has succeeded. I am comforted to have glimpsed the man behind the myth, and I am more inspired than ever by the scope of his creation.The final item I admire is a gathering of patterns in black ink, on the back of a meeting agenda. Its title, written in Quenya, is Parma Mittarion, or “book of enterings”. It was probably intended to be a book cover, but what the book was to contain remains a mystery. Long after I leave the exhibition, my imagination runs wild. I ask myself what Tolkien intended for this book, whether he ever wrote it – either in his mind or on lost pages – and what he could have meant by the phrase “light in the eye”, which he tucked among the decoration. I realise I am beginning to write a story between the lines, and that anyone who looks at the page will perhaps do the same. In this way, Middle-earth will live for ever.• Tolkien: Maker of Middle-earth is at the Weston Library, Oxford, until 28 October. tolkien.bodleian.ox.ac.uk.

She was joined by the former MPC member Kate Barker and Richard Hughes, the Treasury’s director of fiscal policy.A Women’s Equality party (WEP) spokeswoman said the appointment of Haskel sent the wrong message about the Treasury’s commitment to improving ersity in important areas of public life. “It suggests that even if they had an all-female shortlist, they would probably still appoint a man,” she said.“Macro-economic policy affects men and women differently because of their different positions in the economy and outside of it. Austerity has disproportionately hurt women, and trade liberalisation and changes to interest rates can have negative consequences for women’s employment. “Unless and until the Treasury pays greater attention to these issues, we cannot hope to make progress on women’s equality.”Rachel Reeves, the Labour MP for Leeds West and chair of the business select committee, said it was “truly staggering that the Treasury has failed to appoint a woman to this role”.“The fact that four women were shortlisted shows that there are plenty of capable and well-qualified women but yet again the top jobs seem to be reserved for men.” The decision comes only weeks after Threadneedle Street’s deputy governor, Ben Broadbent, was forced to apologise for likening the economy’s lack of productivity to the menopause.Ministers have also come under fire after the publication of figures that showed women chair only four of the 47 public bodies overseen by the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy. A report by the department also showed that of the 36 public bodies that work in partnership with BEIS, only seven are led by female chief executives. FTSE 100 bosses were criticised by the business minister Andrew Griffiths after his department released a report that revealed their objections to promoting women to senior positions, leaving only a handful of women on the boards of large companies. Griffiths said the Hampton-Alexander review showed that women had a long way to go before they gained parity in Britain’s boardrooms.WEP said that while the government protested its dismay with the lack of women in the boardroom, it appeared to be unable to promote women when it had the opportunity.It said: “The government has today decried the pitiful excuses for women’s underrepresentation in the boardrooms of listed companies. The question is, what’s their excuse?”Reeves added: “On the day the Hampton-Alexander review has revealed that firms are dragging their feet on ersity and making excuses for their own failures, this appointment demonstrates the true extent of the challenge that still exists in changing the face of our corporate and financial sectors.”Haskel came to prominence last year following the publication of his book Capitalism Without Capital: The Rise of the Intangible Economy, and for his success in the Indigo prize for economics, which he shared with the Manchester University economist Diane Coyle.Haskell’s team put forward a plan to extend GDP to measure intangible and free goods, and also to measure the welfare of societies. His views chime with those of several MPC members who believe officials statistics fail to capture the workings of a sophisticated economy in the digital age.Carney said: “His broad academic experience and the depth of his knowledge on productivity and innovation will be hugely valuable to the committee as we seek to promote the good of the people of the United Kingdom by maintaining monetary stability.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/947cd012cd70396ca2b408408bd23bc3ea642a7b/0_30_4278_2567/master/4278.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=63944c44e5046b45b10ce57637a68c20","title":"carluccios given go ahead for restructuring plan","story":"Chain is latest casualty of casual dining crunch, which has hit Byron and Jamie’s ItalianLandlords of struggling Italian chain Carluccio’s have backed a restructuring plan that could result in the closure of more than 30 of its restaurants. The Carluccio’s chief executive, Mark Jones, said: “We are pleased that our proposal for a CVA has been approved by our creditors. This vote was vital to protect our strong core business and the Carluccio’s brand.”The restaurant chain founded by the late chef Antonio Carluccio in 1999 is the latest casualty of the casual dining crunch, which has forced major chains including rival Prezzo, the burger chain Byron and Jamie’s Italian, which had also over-expanded, to close restaurants amid a slowdown in consumer spending.A group of 34 restaurants, which employ about 500 people, are affected by the CVA with landlords agreeing to cut rent bills by a third for six months. They will close at the end of that period unless a new, reduced rent deal is agreed.Will Wright, a restructuring partner at KPMG and joint supervisor of the CVA, said: “This is an important step forward for the business, allowing Carluccio’s to complete its financial restructuring plan and embark on a comprehensive transformation programme.”Carluccio’s is controlled by the Landmark Group, the Dubai-based retail and hospitality conglomerate. It has promised to finance a multimillion-pound refurbishment programme for the 69 restaurants unaffected by the CVA.Jones, who joined from five-a-side football firm Goals Soccer Centres in January to lead a turnaround, added: “The positive outcome enables us to kickstart an extensive programme of reinvigoration across our estate – with the aim of elevating the guest experience and underpinned by our brand ethos of minimum of fuss, maximum of flavour, championed by Antonio Carluccio.”A number of big high street names, including New Look, Carpetright and Mothercare, have turned to CVAs to jettison unwanted stores. House of Fraser, the struggling department store, is the latest and is expected to publish an update on its restructuring plan imminently.

It is possible that Mark Carney, who often points out that he is the 120th in an unbroken line of male governors, is privately tearing his hair out. To be fair also to Jonathan Haskel, professor of economics at Imperial College Business School, he was a perfectly decent candidate his expertise in productivity could be useful in the current climate.Yet this feels like a huge missed opportunity by the Treasury, whatever it says about how it contacted 44 women to apply for the post. The next opportunity to address the 8-1 male bias on the monetary committee may not arise for another four years, given the tenures of the current crew. It is only Carney who is definitely departing soon and the betting odds heavily suggest the 121st governor will also be male. Meanwhile, the 13-strong financial policy committee contains one woman. And 10 of the 12 members of the Bank’s governing court are men. The Labour MP Rachel Reeves, chair of the business select committee, called the latest appointment “truly staggering”. In a week in which some of the business world’s ludicrous justifications for male-dominated boardrooms were exposed in a government-commissioned report, one can only agree. Haskel, no doubt, will pass his confirmation hearing in front of the Treasury select committee with flying colours. It would more interesting to hear the MPs grill Hammond.The miracle is that Tim O’Toole lasted eight years as the chief executive of FirstGroup. An innings of that length usually counts as decent when the share price travels in the right direction. At FirstGroup under O’Toole, the journey has been from 300p to 90p. Shareholders haven’t even had the consolidation of a idend for the past half-decade.The source of half of FirstGroup’s woes is the top-of-the-market $3.6bn cash takeover in 2007 of US group Laidlaw, owner of an impressive school bus operation but also the Greyhound long-distance coach business. That deal happened before O’Toole’s arrival but his attempts to deal with the debt hangover never hit the mark. The thumping £615m rights issue in 2013 only semi-repaired the balance sheet and the option of selling Greyhound was resisted, with the word “iconic” being grossly overused. It is only now, with FirstGroup taking a £277m goodwill impairment against Greyhound, that a sale is being contemplated amid grumbles about competition from icon-toppling US budget airlines.In the circumstances, O’Toole’s resignation was inevitable after the latest grim results. The shame is that for the first 20 years of its life FirstGroup was a story of stunning success as it grew from a few bus routes in Dundee to become the UK’s biggest transport company. Recent chapters have involved scraps with activist investors and, last month, a vague bid approach from the private equity group Apollo Management, which was dismissed by the board as “opportunistic.”Despite FirstGroup’s many woes, saying no to Apollo was justified. There should – still – be a decent business lurking within. It does, though, require the next boss to change a corporate mindset that the Unite union fairly condemned as “managed decline” under O’Toole. Find some rigour – quickly.Lesley Titcomb, the chief executive of the Pensions Regulator, can take a hint. She won’t seek to renew her four-year contract when it ends next February. Mind you, MPs were hardly subtle in pointing out the exit door. The “current leadership” of the organisation may not be equipped for cultural change, said the two committees probing Carillion’s collapse, adding that “a tentative and apologetic approach is ingrained”. The work and pensions committee called next year’s corporate plan “very modest in scope”.Many in the pensions industry think it’s all terribly unfair. The worst mistakes at BHS and Carillion were made before Titcomb became boss. Wasn’t the goverment giving mixed messages on how quickly companies should close pension deficits? Hasn’t Titcomb also managed the logistical challenge of rolling out auto enrolment?Well, yes, some sympathy is in order. But regulation is a rough business and a pensions enforcer needs to be feared in the outside world. Titcomb, perhaps out of loyalty to long-serving staff, never was."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9cdf4e1219d033fc7c40f146c95f14fa1d03aeec/22_0_5789_3473/master/5789.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4907be03ef31d7c0d26bb127df2d455c","title":"kaliningrad the russian enclave with a taste for europe","story":"It’s a European-leaning city cut off from Russia – but are recent moves to focus on Kaliningrad’s Prussian past a step too far for the Kremlin?When relations between Moscow and the west plummeted in 2014 over Vladimir Putin’s seizure of Crimea, pro-Kremlin media went into overdrive. They portrayed European countries as morally depraved, harbouring a visceral hatred of Russians. The foreign ministry warned travellers abroad against the risk of being “seized” by vengeful western intelligence agencies.For residents of Russia’s vast heartland – the overwhelming majority of whom have never travelled to Europe – it was a potent and powerful propaganda campaign. Anti-European sentiment rocketed to its highest level since the cold war (the first one, that is). But in Kaliningrad, it was a much harder sell.A little parcel of land smaller than Wales wedged up against the Baltic Sea, Kaliningrad has no common border with Russia, which is almost 300 miles to the east – and unlike most Russians its residents travel frequently to the EU. The city centre is 75 miles from the Lithuanian border, and a mere 30 miles from Poland. At weekends and on public holidays, there are long tailbacks at both border crossings. Gdansk, the nearby Polish port city, is a particularly popular destination.“I travel to Poland a lot and see how people relate to Russians. Everything is fine, there are no problems,” says Alexander, a 35-year-old office worker. “The Poles are people, just like us.” Like many others here, he dismisses the state-run Russian media’s unflattering depictions of European countries as “lies”.Many Kaliningrad residents travel to Poland and Lithuania to stock up on western foodstuffs banned by Putin in 2014 in response to European and US sanctions. Although the quality of Russian-produced cheeses and hams has improved slightly in recent years, there remains a deep hunger for forbidden culinary delights: parmesan, camembert and jamón.“It’s just like when I was a kid in the Soviet Union,” says Alexei Chabounine, the 48-year-old editor of a local news website. “Back then, we used to go to Lithuania all the time to get meat, milk and other things that we couldn’t get hold of in Russia. Of course, there were no borders then.”“They see Europe for themselves and not through a television screen.”That’s not to say that Kaliningrad is a bastion of liberal values. In the compact city centre – a mishmash of Soviet-built flats, public squares and modern shopping centres – it’s not uncommon to see people wearing T-shirts depicting Russian Iskander nuclear missiles, which the Kremlin deployed to the region in February. Local authorities have cracked down on independent media and opposition activists, while NOD, the ultra-nationalist pro-Putin movement that blames westerners for most of Russia’s ills, has a thriving local branch. “Most of these people still go to Poland or Lithuania to do their shopping though,” laughs Chabounine.During the communist era, getting from Kaliningrad to Moscow by land involved nothing more complicated than an overnight train journey through neighbouring Soviet republics. But when the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, Kaliningrad suddenly found itself cut off from Mother Russia by the newly independent countries of Belarus, Latvia and Lithuania. A decade later, when Latvia, Lithuania and Poland joined the EU, Kaliningrad residents required visas to travel overland to Russia. This sense of geographical isolation is reflected in common expressions: ahead of trips to Moscow, people will routinely say “I’m going to Russia” one local laughed when I pointed out he was already there. On national TV, Kaliningrad is sometimes left off weather maps. The Soviet collapse was the latest twist in Kaliningrad’s strange history. Founded by Teutonic knights in the 13th century, it was previously known as Königsberg, the capital of East Prussia, where Prussian kings were crowned. At the end of the second world war, the city was annexed by the Soviet Union and renamed in honour of Mikhail Kalinin, a Bolshevik revolutionary.After Stalin expelled the ethnic German population, Soviet citizens were shipped in to repopulate it – many were Russian military families who described their move to Kaliningrad as “moving to the west”. Lyudmila Putina, the Russian president’s ex-wife, was born here in 1958. A key outpost for the Soviet military, the entire Kaliningrad region was strictly off-limits to foreigners until 1991.Yet Kaliningrad’s proximity to Europe, and its Baltic port, meant it was exposed to far more western influences than the rest of the USSR. Soviet sailors would bring back clothes, books and vinyl from western Europe and beyond.“People have always likened themselves to Americans – our families all came here from different places across the Soviet Union and created a melting pot with what was practically a new ethos,” says Oleg Kashin, a well-known Russian journalist who was born in Kaliningrad.The defining symbol of that era is the foreboding House of the Soviets, a world-famous example of brutalist architecture. This unfinished 28-storey building, which locals say resembles a robot’s head jutting out of the earth, stands on the former site of the 13th century Königsberg Castle, whose ruins were blown up in 1968 on the orders of Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev. (The area around the House of Soviets will house the fan zone for this summer’s World Cup.)Otherwise, very few of the city’s pre-Soviet buildings survived the twin assaults of an RAF bombing campaign and the Red Army’s three-month operation to capture the city. Today, the most high-profile architectural remains of Kaliningrad’s Prussian past are seven neo-Gothic gates that ring the former city limits, along with the Lutheran cathedral, a redbrick Gothic construction where Immanuel Kant, the German philosopher who died here in 1804, is buried. Souvenir stalls do a roaring trade in fridge magnets reading “Kant touch it” and “Yes, I Kant”. Also for sale: miniature busts of Putin and Stalin decorated with amber, the fossilised tree resin for which the region is famous. As the Soviet past recedes, Kaliningrad is rediscovering its Prussian history: there are calls for the use of alternative Prussian street names and to reconstruct Königsberg Castle.The phenomenon has been condemned by local Kremlin supporters as a sign of “Germanisation”. “It’s infantile,” says a state-media journalist, Nikolay Dolgachev, of the interest in Prussian heritage. “It would be like today’s Americans feeling nostalgic about Native American culture.” Pro-Putin political analysts in Moscow have gone further, suggesting that growing enthusiasm for the city’s Prussian past is a sign of creeping separatism.Critics say the accusations of “Germanisation” are ludicrous. “The term has no basis in reality,” says Dmitry Selin, a former gallery curator. There have been consequences, though. In 2016, the German-Russian House, a local cultural and educational centre, was forced to close down after being declared a “foreign agent”. And earlier this year, an Aeroflot steward was fired after referring to Kaliningrad as Königsberg ahead of a flight from Moscow. “Sometimes,” sighs Selin, “I can’t get help but get the feeling that the authorities want to fence us off from Europe.”For more on life inside the Russian cities hosting the World Cup, visit  Cities or follow on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e52c35c7f68ee17f5e2d7dd450de0e10c0bfb5d8/0_27_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a3f2a7c8131f4a1d404602bd4cebf31b","title":"george osborne edit evening standard","story":"A few months ago I was thrown off a jury. Not because I am an argumentative pain in the backside, which I am. But because I knew one of the barristers. A group of us were being assessed for jury suitability, and he and I both immediately made it clear that our friendship represented a serious conflict of interest. Though I would have attempted to be scrupulously honest and unbiased, it would have been impossible.I’ve been thinking a lot about this episode in the context of journalism, and in particular the role of the multi-talented and multi-employed George Osborne, who edits the Evening Standard, a newspaper I used to work for. He is certainly the least experienced high-profile editor in Britain, possibly the world, but I wonder if he is also the most compromised.The salary he earns from editing London’s free newspaper is supplemented with at least eight other roles. Most recently, he was appointed chair of a group of high-profile business leaders who will oversee Exor, the holding company of the Agnelli family, which owns Juventus football club, Fiat, Ferrari and myriad other businesses, including The Economist magazine. He is also a visiting fellow at the Hoover Institution, a dean’s fellow at Stanford business school, chairman of the Northern Powerhouse Partnership and an adviser to BlackRock, the US asset manager, for which he is paid an eye-watering £650,000 a year for working one day a week.I’ve no doubt that Osborne’s tireless work ethic will ensure he fulfils all of his obligations – with the exception of one. Editor. Because, like me at jury selection, he cannot possibly say that he is not conflicted by personal interest. His honesty, capacity for unbiased decision-making and ability to judge stories without fear or favour are highly compromised by his close – and remunerated – association with some of the world’s biggest companies and most powerful business leaders.It’s crucial that readers trust what they are reading. It has been claimed this week that Osborne’s latest wheeze is to offer special clients “money-can’t-buy” positive news and “favourable” comment coverage in return for paid advertising. If true, it would be a partnership fraught with potential mistrust and conflict of interest because readers would not know what was real reporting and what had been paid for so much so that OpenDemocracy claimed Starbucks had flatly rejected the offer. The Evening Standard group’s commercial director, Jon O’Dowell, has vociferously denied the allegations, saying that the idea the paper was “selling news” was “grossly inaccurate and a wildly misunderstood interpretation of the London 2020 project”, that all commercial content was labelled as such and that “under no circumstances have these clients been guaranteed news coverage for their own ends, nor would they ever be”.But regardless of the veracity of these latest claims, the dilemma persists for Osborne and the reporting of business stories in his newspaper. We cannot know for sure what is real journalism and what, because of his many jobs, has been ​compromised.Journalists have always displayed a bias in story selection that has not been made clear to readers in many ways, yet never to the same degree as editor Osborne. His overenthusiasm in the Evening Standard towards companies such as Uber – a significant BlackRock client – is just one of the most notable examples. Yet BlackRock has assets worth more than $2bn (£1.5bn) in pretty much every single major business you can think of.So how can the editor of a newspaper disassociate himself from the fair reporting of a company or inidual who is in some way associated with those who pay him extraordinarily generous annual stipends? When editorial conference focuses on the day’s reporting of business news, does the editor of the Evening Standard recuse himself from discussions about BlackRock and Exor clients, or does he helpfully proffer his expertise and inside knowledge? Can he honestly say that his judgment is not compromised?As I said earlier, I’m not concerned about Osborne’s physical and intellectual capacity to carry out his roles. This is about ethics. Readers need to know that what they’re consuming is honest and unbiased and if there is potential doubt about the content, they should be told.So when a restaurant critic is friends with the chef or owner of a swanky new joint they – nearly always – own up. When I worked on the Daily Mail I remember being admonished for not revealing in a piece about the internet property company Zoopla that it was part-owned by the same people who owned the newspaper. Richard Desmond, who owned the , sometimes asked us to plug one of the new ventures he was helping to back and would always provide a quote somewhere in the piece making clear his link.Sometimes clarity and transparency are lacking. One newspaper executive incessantly forced us to plug the clients of a PR company that one of his children worked for, for no other reason than that family connection. That kind of murky deal still goes on, but not right at the top. An editor must be seen to be above it all his or her judgment cannot be clouded by unspoken financial commitments or interests.Of course they can still show bias – Osborne’s almost daily vendetta against Theresa May is evidence of that. It’s petty, nasty and over the top, but not against the spirit of editorship. Everyone has favourites they shower with praise and enemies they seek to destroy.As an industry, journalism has never been more vital to society. Yet because of the scourge of fake news it is also one of the least trusted. Osborne’s editorship can only dent that level of trust further. There are many talented journalists who work on the Evening Standard and the paper’s columnists are some of the best-connected writers around. But they will never again be able to write about iniduals who are conflicted by multiple interests without knowing, deep down, that their boss is one of the most conflicted of all.• Grant Feller is a former newspaper executive and media consultant"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f973363bf5156a8382a55a865ff8c8befb5c83f7/112_0_3829_2297/master/3829.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=420f247b50c4754883fb95adafb469d8","title":"avoiding meat and dairy is single biggest way to reduce your impact on earth","story":"Avoiding meat and dairy products is the single biggest way to reduce your environmental impact on the planet, according to the scientists behind the most comprehensive analysis to date of the damage farming does to the planet.“A vegan diet is probably the single biggest way to reduce your impact on planet Earth, not just greenhouse gases, but global acidification, eutrophication, land use and water use,” said Joseph Poore, at the University of Oxford, UK, who led the research. “It is far bigger than cutting down on your flights or buying an electric car,” he said, as these only cut greenhouse gas emissions.“Agriculture is a sector that s all the multitude of environmental problems,” he said. “Really it is animal products that are responsible for so much of this. Avoiding consumption of animal products delivers far better environmental benefits than trying to purchase sustainable meat and dairy.”The analysis also revealed a huge variability between different ways of producing the same food. For example, beef cattle raised on deforested land result in 12 times more greenhouse gases and use 50 times more land than those grazing rich natural pasture. But the comparison of beef with plant protein such as peas is stark, with even the lowest impact beef responsible for six times more greenhouse gases and 36 times more land. The large variability in environmental impact from different farms does present an opportunity for reducing the harm, Poore said, without needing the global population to become vegan. If the most harmful half of meat and dairy production was replaced by plant-based food, this still delivers about two-thirds of the benefits of getting rid of all meat and dairy production.Labels that reveal the impact of products would be a good start, so consumers could choose the least damaging options, he said, but subsidies for sustainable and healthy foods and taxes on meat and dairy will probably also be necessary. The new research has received strong praise from other food experts. Prof Gidon Eshel, at Bard College, US, said: “I was awestruck. It is really important, sound, ambitious, revealing and beautifully done.” He said previous work on quantifying farming’s impacts, including his own, had taken a top-down approach using national level data, but the new work used a bottom-up approach, with farm-by-farm data. “It is very reassuring to see they yield essentially the same results. But the new work has very many important details that are profoundly revealing.”Prof Tim Benton, at the University of Leeds, UK, said: “This is an immensely useful study. It brings together a huge amount of data and that makes its conclusions much more robust. The way we produce food, consume and waste food is unsustainable from a planetary perspective. Given the global obesity crisis, changing diets – eating less livestock produce and more vegetables and fruit – has the potential to make both us and the planet healthier.”Poore said: “The reason I started this project was to understand if there were sustainable animal producers out there. But I have stopped consuming animal products over the last four years of this project. These impacts are not necessary to sustain our current way of life. The question is how much can we reduce them and the answer is a lot.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/17a4691b2fd7d1f689046408fb657644fbc29151/0_4_4464_2678/master/4464.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7b48fb893ba3c58fac9d6a80a1d511bf","title":"tell us how you are rewilding or improving nature in your area","story":"We’d like to hear about – and see pictures of – the small things you are doing to encourage nature where you liveNaturalist Patrick Barkham wrote in the  this week about the principles of rewilding – stepping back and allowing natural processes to occur, and encouraging wild plants and insects.As the rise of herbicides and insecticides destroys aspects of nature, embracing these acts could be more necessary than ever – we’re interested in hearing what you are up to, whether in the city or the country and however small you think your efforts.Maybe you’ve ditched concrete in your garden, allowed your lawn to grow wild or planted window boxes to attract insects?

A pause. “And back.” It must be hard not to look smug – he’s probably been dying for someone to ask him that all day.This is my first taste of audax: a noncompetitive form of long-distance cycling that traces its history to the 1890s, not long after the invention of the modern bicycle. I was expecting old men on steel-framed bikes with calves cast from iron and glasses held together with gaffer tape, cake and clipboards in dusty village halls, and checkpoints on bleak petrol station forecourts. Only part of that was true.A few years ago I wouldn’t have been far wrong. The London-Wales-London ride had been running for decades under the name of Severn Across, and until recent years the average turnout was around 35 riders.But ultra-distance cycling has surged in popularity. Just as runners who have tackled a few regular marathons might think “what now?” and have a go at an ultramarathon, increasing numbers of cyclists are looking for something more than a 100-mile sportive. This appears to be down partly to self-supported races like the Transcontinental across Europe and the 6,800km Transamerica, partly to the profile of riders like the late Mike Hall and partly to that familiar human urge to try for a little bit more.Spend any time looking into ultra-distance and audax events and you’ll soon hear about the 1,200km Paris-Brest-Paris and the 1,400km London-Edinburgh-London, which are both held every four years.Last year, organiser Liam FitzPatrick rebranded the Severn Across ride as London-Wales-London. This year the event sold out in under eight hours. FitzPatrick opened a waiting list but closed it once he had another 75 names. The flow of emails from disappointed riders continued right up to the big day.So what I got when I arrived at Chalfont St Peter community centre at 6am on a bright May Saturday morning was a lot of fit cyclists, some expensively cut Lycra and merino, a clutch of carbon bikes … and the odd crusty old-timer. Conscious that it’s all too easy to overdo it early on – a lesson learned from a few ultramarathons – I pottered along comfortably enough to the first checkpoint at Woodstock after 70km. I was somewhat surprised to be greeted by a full fry-up – some of the old reputation clearly still rings true – but I’d missed breakfast so wasn’t complaining.There is time to chat to fellow riders, so I struck up conversations, asking people about their setups (lots had dynamo hubs to generate electricity for lights and GPS units) and trying to pick up ideas for future events. Many are aiming for Paris-Brest-Paris next year, and a fair few tackled London-Edinburgh-London in 2017. The growth of ultra-distance cycling can be seen in the participation numbers for that event: 29 starters in 1989, 1,500 last year.FitzPatrick had warned me before the event that the mental challenge could be tougher than the physical. “What makes it difficult isn’t so much the speed, it’s that you’ve got time to think,” he said. “If your thighs hurt or you’ve got saddle sores then you might have another eight hours of this, grinding you down. When it’s three in the morning, when you’ve had a couple of punctures, when it’s cold and wet … that’s when it gets to you.”His advice for finishing successfully was to pay extra attention to staying hydrated (easy to forget on long events) and not to spend too long riding alone, especially at night.Following his first suggestion, I stopped to refill my water bottles outside the three staffed checkpoints – which meant I did spend some time on godforsaken petrol station forecourts. For the second, I teamed up with fellow rider Alex Kew when we found ourselves at the same pace.It’s not always easy to know when to hold back or when to press on, but I eased off when he was struggling up Yat Rock he paid that back many times once he’d recovered. As a time trialist, Alex couldn’t help himself every time we hit a long straight A-road – he was on the front, head down, powering away, and all I had to do was stick to his back wheel. The miles flew by. Darkness fell. Surrounded by silence but for the whirr of wheels and the sound of breathing, we negotiated gravelly, potholed single-track roads at 30mph with just a pair of small lights to fight the pitch-black night. The company took a lot of stress out of it.London-Wales-London is not a race (technically it’s a randonné). Riders are free to complete the 407km at whatever speed they want so long as they average 15-30kph. That made the earliest allowable finish 10.30pm the latest was 9am the next day.With no serious mechanicals, Alex and I rolled into Chalfont just before midnight. The fastest riders – including world 24-hour time trial champion Jasmijn Muller – were back before it got dark. The last rolled in at 8.20am. London-Wales-London (or Chalfont-Chepstow-Chalfont, as one wag had it) certainly lives up to its epic new name. Whether you’re an old-school audaxer or someone dressed head to toe in Rapha with a fetish for sleeping in bus shelters, it’s a welcoming way to explore. And it’s an antidote to overblown sportives. Rolling in after 407km, we got our brevet cards stamped and tucked into warming bowls of homemade daal. There were no spectators lining the finish chute, no bag of freebies, no medals – but it was all the better for it.London-Wales-London 2019 will run on 4 May"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/473d9104c8bdc3973f220998afcd52460390b12a/203_476_3155_1893/master/3155.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e50227f8b502dc499a63a2d72774542e","title":"half the picture amy adrion interview","story":"Amy Adrion’s new documentary rounds up 40 film-makers, including Ava DuVernay and Lena Dunham, to talk about systemic undermining of women in HollywoodIt isn’t. But it has been as the women of Hollywood have publicly waged a battle for fair hiring practices, with a boost from the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and the ACLU who led separate investigations into the drastic gender disparity in 2013 and 2015, which culminated in official government letters informing the studios they must correct the imbalance or risk lawsuits. Two months into the EEOC inquiry, Adrion started filming Half the Picture, interviewing over 40 female film-makers, and her feisty documentary feels like getting the inside scoop. “The problem gets logged as this Hollywood elitism, that it’s a privilege to work in this industry at all,” says Adrion on a drizzly afternoon in Los Angeles. “The bottom line is, you can’t just hire white men for jobs when there are qualified women. Whether that’s for a cashier or a bank teller or for Hollywood movies, it is illegal.” “For a long time, it took people who were at the end of their career to tell their stories because they were like, ‘What do I have to lose?’” says Adrion. Today – and together – the women are able to be brave. Half the Picture sparkles with star power: Ava DuVernay, Jill Soloway, Catherine Hardwicke, Miranda July, Lena Dunham, Gina Prince-Bythewood, Kimberly Peirce, Sam Taylor-Johnson and Penelope Spheeris make up just a fraction of the wattage. “Women at the top of their game don’t have to talk to me on the record about how the system is broken,” says Adrion. After all, Half the Picture is her first feature. “It’s not like, ‘You have to speak to me!’” she says with a laugh. “Things are changing, and they’re leading that change.”Half the Picture plays like a cocktail party where everyone’s had a glass of wine and is ready to get real. Adrion bounces between interview clips as though the women are having a conversation. It’s not a screed – it’s fun and surprising, and Spheeris, a self-described “smart-ass punk attitude bitch” has the best zingers. They joke about macho meatheads challenging their authority on set and questions they’ve parried – Do you want a family? Are you willing to insert four scenes of naked breasts? Can you start a week after you give birth? (Answers: yes, yes and yes) – and in a lovely through-line, point to the other women in the documentary who inspired them to push forward. DuVernay applauds Prince-Bythewood for advising her to deal with on-set sexism in public so that everyone can see the offender grovel. Otherwise, notes DuVernay, “I would have lost control of the set.” The women trade stories about the tiny ways female directors get undermined even after they manage to land a job. Chris Hegedus sighs that after 40 years making Oscar-nominated docs with her husband and partner, DA Pennebaker, journalists still only want to interview him. Lucy Walsh’s own Oscar campaign for her doc Waste Land was dinged by reporters who accused her of not directing it at all. American Psycho’s Mary Harron rolls her eyes at critics who assume her male editors and cinematographers “saved” her films. “I didn’t sit around doing nothing!” she groans. Brave’s Brenda Chapman opens up as much as she legally can about proving herself in the all-male meetings at Disney, only to have Pixar strip her from her passion project and attempt to ban her from speaking at the Academy Awards. And in a jaw-dropping anecdote, Patricia Riggen recounts how her producers on The 33, a drama about the Chilean miners, prioritised the schedule around pleasing the second unit AD – and when he squandered three weeks of filming, gave her three days to redo his unusable footage. Half the Picture is hunting for solutions. (Adrion notes that the EEOC is now overseen by attorney general Jeff Sessions, who’s no champion of equal rights.) Film festivals play a major part in amplifying new voices, especially Sundance, which premiered Half the Picture in January (and recently hired Kim Yutani as its new director of programming).“If you get into Sundance, that is the golden ticket, period,” says Adrion. “Our experience with this film has been kind of meta that way,” with her debut about how to fix filmmaking taking the same path her subjects described. In fact, it’s been too meta. Half the Picture includes a section where her directors explain that the crucial trade publications that make or break a movie are mostly written by a small group of male critics who are inclined to connect less to female-driven stories. Adrion inserted an image of one important critic’s review, and then heard he’d been assigned to review.“At a few of the Q\u0026ampAs, men have said, ‘How do we be allies?’” says Adrion. Listening to these directors speak is a good first step. These smart, resolute women make their own argument for success. In 2018, we should all question the tough-guy stereotype of leadership. On, off and behind the screen, it’s time for GI Joe to retire.  • Half the Picture premieres at Sundance London on 1 June.

A 49-word statement published on their website on Thursday pointed to the “current unfavourable investment climate” as a key factor in their reasoning, yet the Home Office’s delay in renewing Abramovich’s visa, which had expired, is understood to have prompted the owner’s decision to shelve the scheme.Abramovich is apparently reluctant to invest heavily in a major project in the capital of a country where he has been denied a visa. The oligarch, who has been a regular visitor to Britain since buying Chelsea in 2003 but does not hold an employment position at the club, was unable to attend his team’s victory in the FA Cup final at Wembley this month with the process unresolved, and has since secured Israeli citizenship.An Israeli government spokesperson confirmed this week that the 51-year-old was to move to Tel Aviv. Although he would be able to visit the UK visa-free for up to six months at a time on his Israeli passport, Downing Street has confirmed he would not be permitted to work in this country.The Jerusalem Post reported on Thursday that the billionaire had withdrawn his request for a British investor visa, quoting a source close to Abramovich as saying: “He understands and respects that the UK are reviewing their processes and has therefore chosen to withdraw until a new process is in place.” Once a new policy was in place, the source added, Abramovich would “want to clarify any misunderstanding and speculations. He has spent many years in the UK and is a legitimate businessman, nothing has changed.”The issue has flared at a time of heightened tensions between Britain and Russia since the poisoning of the former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in Salisbury in March. Britain has blamed that act on Russia, though the Kremlin denies involvement. Abramovich’s previous tier one visa, which allows anyone who invests more than £2m in the British economy to stay for 40 months, had been granted before tighter regulations were introduced in April 2015. The government has since launched a further crackdown on wealthy investors coming to the UK and, it is believed, would have required some financial disclosures if Abramovich’s UK visa were to be renewed.Chelsea, who finished outside the lucrative Champions League qualification places last season, insist Abramovich remains as committed to the club as ever, and will continue to invest funds for transfers. However, the desire to redevelop Stamford Bridge had been motivated primarily by the prospect of increased match-day revenues, which would allow the Premier League side to be more competitive in the transfer market while complying with Uefa’s Financial Fair Play regulations.The ground’s 41,631 capacity leaves them in the smallest stadium of the current top six given Tottenham Hotspur will return to a redeveloped White Hart Lane next season. In that regard, the decision to put plans on hold would appear to damage the club’s long-term ability to compete financially with the Premier League’s elite.Chelsea had previously explored purchasing the Battersea Power station site and land around Earl’s Court, before opting to transform Stamford Bridge into what the architects, Herzog and de Meuron, described as a “cathedral of football”. Planning approval was received from Hammersmith and Fulham council last year, with the mayor of London Sadiq Khan also giving the green light, and Chelsea had hoped to move to Wembley for up to four years while work was carried out.Costs for the ambitious scheme had escalated wildly, doubling to around £1bn largely because of the time allocated to the build and its complexity. Chelsea had started the process of sounding out banks and blue-chip companies over commercial deals and to seek a potential naming-rights partner, though they would have leant heavily upon Abramovich to fund the project.“Chelsea has put its new stadium project on hold,” the club said. “No further pre-construction design and planning work will occur. The club does not have a time frame set for reconsideration of its decision. The decision was made due to the current unfavourable investment climate.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7715324d5cc48b310686f57401cda057d918d1c3/0_77_4182_2509/master/4182.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=99d68f923d896e5f4d624998d7672cc2","title":"zinedine zidane real madrid manager steps down","story":"• Club legend steps down after winning third Champions League• Zidane had won six major trophies since January 2016• As it happened: read our rolling report on Zidane’s surprise exitZinedine Zidane has walked away from Real Madrid, only five days after winning a third consecutive Champions League. The Frenchman announced his decision at the Valdebebas training ground on Thursday afternoon, insisting he and the club needed a change and admitting he was not convinced Real would continue winning if he remained in charge.The club’s president, Florentino Pérez, described it as a “sad day” and said the decision was “totally unexpected”. Zidane would not say exactly when he made the decision to depart.Pérez said Zidane had communicated his decision on Wednesday and a press conference was hurriedly called on Thursday morning. At the same time the players were informed of the decision by text message. Zidane said he had spoken to the Real captain, Sergio Ramos, and he would speak to the other club captains, Cristiano Ronaldo and Marcelo, in due course. He said he had no plans to manage another club but was not tired of coaching. Real did not say anything about a successor but Mauricio Pochettino is among those they have long identified as candidates.Zidane had been due to discuss plans for the coming season – plans that would include the futures of Gareth Bale and Ronaldo, both of whom had suggested they would leave immediately after the Champions League final. Instead, it is the manager who walks away. “I have taken the decision not continue as coach of Real Madrid next year,” Zidane said. “I spoke to the president to explain what I thought. I think it is the moment, for me and for the squad. I know it is a bit of a strange moment but I think it is the right moment. This is a team that should keep on winning and it needs a change for that. After three years, it needs another discourse, another working methodology, and that’s why I took this decision.”“There are complicated moments in the season when you ask: ‘Am I still the right person? I don’t forget the hard moments too. There are lovely moments and we ended with a spectacular moment but there are hard moments that make you reflect.” He identified Real’s defeat in the Copa del Rey as one of the key moments.“I think it’s the moment to go,” he added. “I also think the players need a change. They’re the ones who fight on the pitch. It’s not easy for them. It’s a demanding club, a club with a huge history and the players are always squeezed. We always want more and more and there is a moment when you think: ‘Well, what more can I ask from my players?’ I want to win and if I don’t see clearly that we’re going to keep on winning, then it is best to change and not do anything stupid.”Zidane leaves having won nine titles, including three consecutive European Cups, although he said the title that gave him the greatest satisfaction was last season’s league win. Asked if he might have stayed on had Real not won the Champions League final against Liverpool, he replied: “I don’t know. Could be, could be.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7b6ac6fc5c2605c88ba796b11331f7284b2bd842/123_20_1482_889/master/1482.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6b4922d971bb0f854662d4f4c10d4cb3","title":"everton marco silva manager third premier league club","story":"Seven years after ending a modest playing career the Portuguese is about to embark on a sixth managerial jobIt is easy to see why Everton identified Marco Silva as their ideal head coach last October but less easy to understand why they persisted in doing so after his time at Watford unravelled in off-pitch acrimony and on-pitch chaos. The manner in which his performance in Hertfordshire went from immaculate to inadequate must at the very least have made what might once have been a straightforward decision significantly more complicated.Everton will believe they have the status to keep Silva’s ego satisfied for a bit longer than the two months and nine matches that separated his first game with the Hornets from the decision that he could do better. The coach’s history certainly suggests that what follows is likely to be fun as well as dramatic.Silva turns 41 this summer and no coach goes inside seven years from allowing a mediocre playing career to drift to a conclusion at a mid-ranking Portuguese second ision club to a third Premier League managerial appointment without having ambition.He spoke of this when he signed a two-year contract at Vicarage Road last May. “They showed me the project and I like the ambition,” he said. “I’m excited. It’s a good challenge and I’m really happy. The club want to improve and this is what I try to fight for in my career as well – to always improve. The ambition this club has is really important to me.”But almost immediately he demonstrated dissatisfaction with some elements of his role. While he was instrumental in the arrival of the Brazilian forward Richarlison and the club also brought in the winger André Carillo, who had worked with Silva at Sporting, the head coach had limited influence in player recruitment.This did not stop him talking in public and at length about players he wanted to sign, with Leicester’s Islam Slimani, who excelled under Silva at Sporting, frequently mentioned. “Do I know the player? Of course I do. He worked with me three seasons ago. Do I like the player? Of course I like the player. Is he a player that could help us? I’m sure about that,” he said in August. “If I could control everything maybe I’d answer to you another way. In this moment I can’t control situations.”Once the summer transfer window closed Watford were delighted with their recruitment, believing they had provided their coach with a significantly strengthened squad capable of finishing in the top half of the Premier League. They were then astonished when Silva strongly criticised their dealings in a press conference. “I expected something different,” he said. “I’m clear, last week was not the best for us in the market.”This tallies with accounts of Silva’s time at Sporting, who sacked him in 2015, a few days after he had led them to victory in Portugal’s domestic cup. One of the explanations given by the club was that he repeatedly used press conferences to air his unhappiness about issues which they felt had been settled in private.A source at Sporting complained to the radio station TSF about Silva’s “provocative and disloyal attitude”. He swiftly joined Olympiakos, and set a new postwar European record by winning his first 17 league games – they won 28 of their 30 matches that season, which they ended 30 points clear of second-placed Panathinaikos. As a result of that success Porto attempted to sign him in May 2016 Olympiakos, who had tied him to a two-year contract, blocked the move and he abruptly resigned the following month.So Everton should not expect long-term stability. What still attracts them to Silva is his record of coaching success, with the final weeks at Watford the only blot on a spectacularly bright landscape. At Estoril he took a club with few pretensions out of second-tier mediocrity and into Europe at Sporting he won the cup, lost only two league matches and ended with a points tally that would have been enough to win the title in seven of the previous 10 seasons (but in 2014‑15 took them to only third place).His teams were unbeaten in 41 successive home games, a record achieved at four clubs in three countries. He wrought instant if ultimately insufficient improvement from Hull following his appointment there in 2017, and for the first two months of last season appeared to have turned Watford into genuine challengers for the top six.As the popular reaction to Sam Allardyce’s time at Goodison Park proved, results are not enough on their own. But at their best Silva’s teams are committed to attack and are constructed to allow their brightest talents to flourish, especially in wide areas.There is an element of tactical inflexibility, with a particular unwillingness to countenance fielding two strikers, but also a willingness to change. He earned particular praise for switching Watford’s formation at half-time of a game against Swansea which they were dominating, anticipating the home side’s own reorganisation and pre-emptively neutering it. The Hornets won their first two away games of last season 2-0, producing displays of great assurance and class, while in that honeymoon period they also beat Arsenal and terrified Chelsea.With a better squad, a bigger budget, greater contribution to transfer policy and full commitment, Everton can expect Silva to produce entertainment and results. What will happen next, however, is anyone’s guess."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b0ec6e87c133f90c0cad5d128d89424f764b964e/0_346_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ae3e99f8abc10dc87680270f88398883","title":"how have a zero waste kitchen tips from jamie oliver tom kerridge skye gyngell and more","story":"Restaurants have a daily battle against wasting food. We asked top chefs for their home hacks that will save you money and give your cooking a flavour boostAccording to the campaigning waste charity Wrap, UK households bin 5m tonnes of edible food every year. That is 1.1m tonnes less than in 2007, a drop that, in CO2 terms, is equivalent to taking 2.2m cars off the road each year. But, clearly, there is still a lot that could be done to inspire us to use the ingredients we buy with greater diligence.Tom Tanner, a spokesperson for the Sustainable Restaurant Association (SRA), says: “It’s all very well telling people that the average UK household throws out £700 of food each year, but it can be tough playing Ready Steady Cook at home.” The SRA is attempting to help with its new One Planet Plate recipe site, a global inventory of sustainability-focused restaurant dishes complete with recipes.But faced with a fridge full of turning veg, the wreckage of a Sunday roast or pans of leftover rice, there is no such thing as too much inspiration. In that spirit, we asked a range of chefs who grapple with this issue daily to give us their waste-saving tips. Some are eco-conscious practitioners of nose-to-tail and root-to-fruit cooking (Silo in Brighton is Britain’s first “zero-waste” restaurant), while others are simply trying to keep costs down. Here are their household hacks, aimed at saving you a few quid and giving your cooking a flavour boost. Who said that saving the planet can’t be a win-win?We keep all vegetable peelings. Almost the best flavour is to be found in carrot, beetroot or celeriac skins. We make a simple puree using potato peelings cooked in salted water with herb stalks, then pureed with butter, pepper and buttermilk. To turn that into soup, omit the butter and thin using stock. We also make a peel coleslaw – at this time of year, from asparagus, young carrots, leek tops, beetroot and radish leaves – which you can dress with creme fraiche. Stir in honey, salt and any soft herbs for a nice summer accompaniment to roast chicken.Bread should never be wasted. If you look at great cooking from around the world, bread is often used stale and transformed into all sorts of tasty things, such as the classic Italian tomato and bread soup, pappa al pomodoro, or panzanella (tomato and bread salad). Turn already-stale bread into croutons or, if you know you won’t finish your loaf before it turns, thinly slice it and leave to go stale for perfectly crisp toast – it is a fantastic vehicle for tapenade or bruschetta toppings. And you can always blitz stale bread into breadcrumbs for crispy coatings on fishcakes or to toast and scatter over pasta dishes. Delicious.Take the breasts off a chicken, use the leg meat in a curry and, for a third meal, roast the wings and carcass to make a lovely bone broth. Add madeira wine and roasted vegetables, top it up with water and cook gently with fresh herbs and salt. Don’t boil it it will go cloudy. It surprises people that this clear liquid delivers so much flavour.You can pickle pretty much anything with a 3:2:1 mix of vinegar-water-sugar. If it can’t be pickled, it can usually be frozen. In the restaurant, we sweat vegetables in fat, puree and freeze them. That’s a good soup base. You can freeze herbs or salad leaves and mix them with oil to make sauces and pestos. I use the freezer loads at home. Label everything, though. It’s really important. A permanent marker pen is essential kit.Don’t discard meat fat after cooking. As a child, I’d eat my Filipino mum’s vegetables cooked in pork fat. In a Spanish kitchen, we use traditional recipes that emphasise the need of fat for flavour. We’ve used rendered ibérico fat to cook eggs, to flavour garlic soup and whipped like aioli to accompany fish. You can store most fats in jars in the fridge and they will be more effective than constantly using that posh olive oil that you should only use for dressing, not frying.Shop little and often. When I used to shop for the week, I’d end up with everything in the fridge going off, especially quick perishables such as salad leaves, tomatoes, cucumber and mushrooms, or going out of date before I got around to cooking it.Why not use the leftover vegetables from your Sunday roast to make pakoras? Any vegetable you have is fine. Thinly slice, add chopped onion, ginger, garlic, whatever spices you like and chickpea flour (about one-fifth of the total), make into balls in your hand, then deep-fry until crispy.The best way to reduce household waste is putting less on your plate. You can always go back for more. As for leftovers, dried fruit skins blitzed into a powder add an intense orange or lemon zest to cakes.Rather than a supermarket cauliflower that has been stripped of all its leaves and wrapped in cellophane, I’d encourage people to get one that has still got its beautiful green plumage. Don’t be afraid of using everything. It’s a versatile vegetable. We saute the florets, stir-fry the leaves or toss them in turmeric and ras-al-hanout and griddle them, and make a puree from the caramelised stalks.When we have a roast on, any ‘leftyeovers’, as we call them, go into the following day’s beef and potato cakes, shallow-fried with a poached egg and hollandaise. That would work a treat at home too.We dry vegetable peelings to make into flavoured salts which we use to season vegetables. It’s really easy: put the peelings on a rack in a really low temperature oven – a lot of modern ovens have a 50C degree setting – leave for three hours, blend in a processor and mix through sea salt.Once squeezed, good unwaxed lemons can be finely sliced, massaged with salt, packed in a jar and, after four days at room temperature, ferment into this lovely sour condiment. Use that as a relish or in any dish to replace lemons. The other day, I made olives, feta and pasta with preserved lemon. It was the best pasta I’ve had for ages.At home, prepare in bulk. Prepare dishes on a larger scale, freezing portions, and leftovers won’t exist. Not everything freezes well, such as rice, but you can cook those items fresh and be precise. Saucy things such as soup, curries and braises can be batch-frozen ready to pull out whenever it’s convenient."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c1dc5dad67781274e8c4548341b87f25b5e6cae3/0_221_3319_1992/master/3319.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cf04ca10ebfbb0e75807f2ada06c0d71","title":"truth about only children insular confident worry","story":"This week, Elizabeth Hurley said she would like to have had more children, as only children are insular. Such stereotypes are entrenched – so should today’s one-child families worry?Nineteenth-century psychologists, it seems fair to say, did not always approve of only children. It was G Stanley Hall, the American psychologist, who claimed being a lone child was “a disease in itself”. Soon afterwards, another psychologist called Eugene W Bohannon offered a devastating analysis of the only child. They were “less venturesome” and “oversensitive” prone to “priggish self-conceit”. An only boy was likely to be “effeminate, both because he associates too little with boys and too much with the mother”. Bohannon did concede that only children were imaginative, though he put this down to “a lack of companionship” and besides, he pointed out, such talents could well be used for “the practice of deception and lying”.Such stereotypes about spoiled, lonely and peculiar only children have endured for more than a century, despite a wealth of research showing lone children are usually none of those things and often do better in many areas than children with siblings. But despite one-child families becoming far more common, our fascination with their implied unusualness endures. This week, the actor and model Elizabeth Hurley – who has a 16-year-old son, Damian – offered her own take on the issue, saying her one regret was not having more than one child. “I was one of three, a big sister and a little brother to squabble with and to love,” she said in an interview with Grazia. “Damian doesn’t have that. They’re very different, single children, more insular but very at ease with themselves, very self-possessed, focused.”There are obvious reasons for this. Often it isn’t due to a choice to stick with one child – or it doesn’t feel like a choice. Delayed parenthood, fertility problems, relationship breakdowns and financial pressures including housing and childcare costs can all result in a single-child family. But at the same time, evidence is mounting to show a one-child family can be a positive choice for both parents and child.Much of the only-child myth-debunking has been done by Toni Falbo, a professor of educational psychology at the University of Texas, who has researched only children since the 1970s. In one meta-analysis of studies, with Denise Polit, the pair found that “across all developmental outcomes, only children were indistinguishable from firstborns and people from small families” and did better than children from large families.As for being awkward and antisocial, one study from 2011 found that while adults who had been only children engaged in fewer social activities with relatives (which may possibly be explained by having fewer relatives to begin with), they found no difference in the number of social engagements with others, such as friends and colleagues. A survey of more than 2,500 Spanish teenagers found only children experienced higher rates of peer victimisation, but Hughes points out this may be affected by their perception of victimisation: “To some extent, siblings really teach you how to take the rough with the smooth.” A study last year, by Southwest University in Chongqing, China, on more than 250 college-aged students, suggested only children were more flexible in their thinking, and therefore more creative, though showed “lower agreeableness”.The clinical psychologist Linda Blair, author of the book Birth Order, says there can be huge benefits to this family structure, as parents can focus all their time and energy on an only child, “and also continue to have your own life. That means, in terms of the child’s point of view, you make growing up look pretty interesting.” In previous generations, being an only child “didn’t used to be so good for two reasons. One was that parents usually couldn’t have another child – it wasn’t because they chose not to – and the problem was that then they overprotected the child. The other reason was only children were in the vast minority, so they often felt bullied and left out. But nowadays, this is a positive choice for a lot of parents so the kid feels not that unusual and also they don’t feel overprotected, they just feel valued.”There are also downsides, Blair says. “One is that, even with the best efforts of parents to get their child to spend lots of time with kids their own age, they often feel a little bit awkward.” This is partly because these encounters usually happen in a supervised setting – nursery, or school, for instance. “So you don’t get the ease of street smarts that kids learn when they have siblings – not to get your Lego knocked over, not to get beaten up.” Children with siblings “learn to read other kids more quickly and easily. It still comes with single children, but it’s just not quite the same.” Blair advises going on holidays with other families with children of similar ages: “That’s the nearest you’ll get to a situation like siblings.”What may be great for a young child or teenager – having more resources, more attention – doesn’t necessarily hold true when that child is an adult, dealing with ageing parents and, eventually, being alone, with nobody who remembers the idiosyncrasies of your family or who shared your childhood. Although this assumes that most people have a reasonable relationship with their adult siblings. For every only child who remembers a lonely childhood there will be others who were traumatised by a bullying brother or sister.Hughes says it is not the number of siblings that is important, but the quality of the relationships. “There is no guarantee if you had a second child that your children are going to get on beautifully. I personally think that having a sibling is an amazing thing, but I wouldn’t want people who have one child, and don’t think they’re going to be able to have a second, to feel their child is inevitably going to lose out.”As for the perfect family size, says Blair, there is no such thing. “The perfect family, if you want the most psychologically well-adjusted children, is the number of children you have, because if you love them, they will be happy.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8ed2340b42cf8b2616eaaea9ca9c6aa9e2a64d79/4_0_2283_1370/master/2283.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c88e9ac58284acfcbf115f34c9230d19","title":"love island danny dyer dani jeff goldblum","story":"After Love Island Contestant Announcement Day, are you ready for a long and complicated relationship with Eyal of the forgotten boy band, Niall the noisy eater and Danny Dyer’s daughter? Plus: How Jeff Goldblum got jazzyOnce again, as sure as day turns to night, the pulsating slime-drenched Love Island ovipositor has retched into action, heaving out another phalanx of contestants. For many of us, Love Island Contestant Announcement Day is the highlight of the entire year essentially a version of Apprentice Contestant Announcement Day that’s kinder on the soul because you know the assembled people haven’t thunk their way into an aneurysm trying to origami a double windsor in a mirror.This year brings us Eyal, a model and former member of a boyband you’ve never heard of Laura, a cabin crew member who once saw Channing Tatum on a flight Niall, a student who likes to boast about what a noisy eater he is Wes, who enjoys having lots of followers on Instagram and there is Hayley, a model who “says what she thinks”.And, of course, there is Danny Dyer’s daughter. Her name – arguably the best celebrity offspring name since Jermaine Jackson took leave of his senses and called his son Jermajesty – is Dani. Dani Dyer. God bless us.Collectively, these contestants do nothing to dispel one’s belief that Love Island exists as a kind of overflow pipe for Take Me Out auditionees. But then that’s what everyone always thinks about Love Island contestants at first sight, isn’t it? They are younger than us, they have better haircuts than us and they are going to spend the summer dancing around the peripheries of sexually transmitted infection like Fred Astaire on rollerskates. Of course, your first instinct is going to be blind hatred. You’re only human.But as we should all know, this is just the first stage of a long and complicated relationship. For Love Island tends to come at us in waves. This sense of disgruntlement, this sense of being tied to a chair and helplessly watching civilisation burst into flames, is always how it starts. But when Love Island actually begins next week, we’ll slowly get to know these people. And that’s when things will get complicated.Wave two will be empathy. As the days wear on, we’ll begin to see past the sixpacks and blowdries, and start to see ourselves. We’ll see cracks of vulnerability. We’ll see their mistimed jokes and unconvincing bravado and think of all the times we’ve ever accidentally detonated a potential romance purely with the power of our own awkwardness. We’ll see kernels of genuine affection bloom one glance at a time, and we’ll remember what it’s like to be young and in love, and then without warning we’ll suddenly be rooting for them. In this crazy, mixed-up world, who are we to deny these people happiness? Even if it’s fleeting. Even if it’s ill-advised. These people are humans, and all humans deserve to feel some semblance of joy.Wave three comes a fortnight before the end of Love Island, and it’s where all the broadsheet columnists pile on and over-intellectualise the programme in a doomed attack on the pulse of the nation. We shan’t dwell on this stage.And then comes wave four, when Love Island ends and the contestants – now paired up and blissfully happy – try to pivot their notoriety into genuine celebrity. They will go to parties. They will give interviews to magazines. They will singularly fail to realise that we only liked them in the self-contained bubble of Love Island. They will push things a millimetre too far and then we will violently reject them for something newer.Expect this last wave to happen faster than usual this year. Gone will be the breathless reportage about cheating scandals, the horrifying swimwear weddings on breakfast television and the inevitable, harrowing, dead-on-arrival musical careers. Because this is the fourth series of Love Island, and fourth series tend to mark a tipping point for shows like this. In the first, celebrities are created from novelty alone. The second improves on the formula, casting people with actual charisma. The third is the one that breaks all the viewing records because people want to see what all the fuss is about. And then, in the fourth, we look around and realise we can’t move for former contestants refusing to relinquish their 15 minutes, and everyone is instantly banished to obscurity as a result.Big Brother 4 gave us Cameron Stout. The fourth X Factor was won by Leon Jackson. The breakout star of the fourth Apprentice was Raef Bjayou, a man subsequently most famous for appearing on Ready Steady Cook once. And so it will be with Love Island. Society is already brimming with fake-tanned people clinging on to the sidebar of shame like their lives depend on it, and the last thing we need is any more of them. So farewell Dani Dyer, we barely knew ye.It says something awful about 2018 that, when Jeff Goldblum starts to trend on Twitter, your first question is essentially, “Is he dead or is he a pervert?” But this time, the truth is arguably worse. Jeff Goldblum is a jazz pianist.At some point in the near-to-mid future, Goldblum will release his debut jazz album on Decca. It might be a solo album, or it might be recorded with his jazz group The Mildred Snitzer Orchestra. We just don’t know. All we really know is that this feels inevitable. Because, with his tics and quirks and the way he delivers lines like a man watching a confused moth circle a lampshade, Goldblum is essentially jazz incarnate.So irrepressible is he, in fact, that cries of “vanity project” turn to ash as soon as they leave our mouths. Even if you don’t like jazz, the simple joy of Goldblum’s existence should be enough to forgive him for indulging his hobbies like this.This is perhaps down to Goldblum’s late blooming as a style icon. Look at any recent photoshoot of his and you will see rings on his fingers and volume in his hair and clothes in colours that are rarely worn by 65-year-old men. Out of nowhere Goldblum is the internet’s boyfriend, assuming that the internet has deep-set daddy issues.Goldblum has become a lifeline for men of a certain age a clarion cry to rage against the dying of the light, a neon sign reading, “You too can be like this”. He’s interested and interesting and he refuses to be constrained by the limits of age. We can all be like Goldblum, and all we have to do is marry a woman half our age.It’s no coincidence that Goldblum’s recent uptick coincides with his marriage to 35-year-old Canadian gymnast Emilie Livingston. They seem blissfully enamoured, and he has been reinvigorated beyond words by the relationship. In this dark and dismal time, it’s refreshing to know that true happiness can transform us all, and all we need to get there is to shack up with a woman who was only 10 years old when we made Jurassic Park. Jeff Goldblum, you are an inspiration to men everywhere."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/005f17f40e080f04b984b4060ad9f0239e747f02/60_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f43f40efdba1329350cbb9026163924a","title":"we need to talk aboutveganism","story":"In this monthly podcast,  supporters share their experiences and put questions to a panel of journalists and industry experts.

But a simple question about postal votes to the MP suddenly made him feel like he did not belong in the party. “I just asked a question,” he says. “In no way did I insinuate that I was going to do anything silly or illegal regarding postal votes. But his response was ‘This is the UK, sunshine’. It was really patronising – would he have said that to someone not of colour? He was inferring that I wasn’t British.”He then overheard other members talking disparagingly about another candidate of Pakistani heritage in a different ward. Not long after, he heard another party member say “the only good Muslims are Ahmadiyya Muslims”. “That’s like saying the only good Christians are the Coptics,” he says. “It’s insulting to all the others.”While he was not directly racially abused by other party members, seeing Islamophobic comments on local party Facebook groups was common, he says. “It wasn’t a nice experience in the party. Those in the right of the party you felt a sense of being looked down upon, they were patronising you. The whispers weren’t nice at all. But now those same members are very Islamophobic on their Facebook posts, now you see it quite openly.” A party member in the West Midlands says he made a complaint to the Conservatives’ regional headquarters, after an older councillor made a racist remark during a meeting. “It was totally brushed under the carpet they didn’t want to know,” he says. “They just said ‘don’t worry about it, he’s an old man’.”He contacted the Muslim Council of Britain after seeing other complaints about Islamophobia in the party. “When I saw the letter, I thought how refreshing – this is something that all Muslim Conservatives are feeling,” he says. “Only Muslims can feel Islamophobia and only black and ethnic people can feel racism – if you are not black or Asian you are not going to feel it. But they say to you ‘it’s nothing, it’s you, you’re reading too much into it’. But I can feel it, it’s how people look at you when you go to pray, or when you are fasting. It’s in how people talk to you.”When no action was taken over the member who used racist terminology, it made him feel like he was “on the outside”, he says. “My dad has been here for 60 years, but it makes me feel like we are back in the days of Enoch Powell it makes me feel like we haven’t moved on at all.”“It’s a problem throughout the party. It’s rampant because people don’t understand Islam. They think it’s a religion based on terrorism. We don’t think Isis are Muslims. They are a bunch of idiots, we believe they are terrorists like everyone else.”Another councillor did not want to be named because he believed it would be political suicide. “They’d put me under a bus for speaking about it,” he says. He feels his progress in the party has been blocked because of his religion. “It was fine in the local party until I showed some ambition,” he says.After he pushed to advance in the party, barriers suddenly appeared and he was made to feel like his face did not fit, he says. “They use terms like ‘the right sort of candidate’,” he says. “I sometimes wear a skull cap and people came to me and said that the local party leader had said that I looked too Muslim and I wouldn’t be accepted.”He says he has complained about the issue, but feels he cannot push it any further. “You mention Islamophobia and they run for the hills. The problem is too many people have too many friends in high places, so nothing is ever done about it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a1db61c1e696fb6e8da5dd1de277a858d2e87bd3/0_55_4048_2428/master/4048.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ff48cf893e6719924508e28286723cf0","title":"cameron norrie kyle edmund french open tennis 2018","story":"Kyle Edmund, the last British player standing in a slam for the third time in a row, could “get into the top 10 – in the next year, maximum, maybe less” according to John McEnroe. Admittedly, that was the American’s view before Edmund survived a worrying mid-match dip and went on to overpower the in-form Hungarian Marton Fucsovics, 6-0, 1-6, 6-2, 6-3 in the second round on Thursdayto earn a showdown with the flamboyant Italian, Fabio Fognini, on SaturdayBut the judgment largely holds true that the British No\u0026nbsp1 is plateauing nicely at a high level, week after week, to build on his hugely encouraging start to the season, when a hip injury and Marin Cilic stopped him in the semi-final of the Australian Open.McEnroe, commenting for Eurosport, said: “He’s got a lot fitter, a lot more confident. He’s got a great shot to get into the top 10 – in the next year, maximum, maybe less. He’s improved all parts of his game shored up his backhand, more prepared to move forward. Against a lot of players he’s got an edge walking on the court. You’ve got to make them feel your presence out there.”There were moments when he lost his way – courtesy of a paper cut on a finger of his serving hand that split during his collapse in the second set, although he dismissed the distraction as trivial – but he had too much game for Hungary’s best male player, who arrived in Paris buoyed by winning in Geneva and with a career-high ranking of 45. It could have been his legs felt the burden of that success when Edmund cranked up his menacing forehand.“I try to focus on getting my game out on court first, because that gives me a good chance – then certain tactics or plays you look out for when you’re playing a particular opponent, whoever that is.”As for the Italian’s sometimes volatile behaviour, Edmund said: “He’s an emotional type of player. That’s just the way he is. But the tour is aware of all players and what their attitudes are like or the way they go about things. That’s the way he operates, but that doesn’t necessarily make a difference in terms of your thought process. You’ve still got to go in and do your thing.”Moments before Edmund’s win, Cameron Norrie enhanced his growing reputation with a fighting performance on Court Philippe-Chatrier against the world No\u0026nbsp16 Lucas Pouille, whose experience on clay and on this court in front of his home crowd no doubt lifted his spirits during many tight calls on his way to a 6-2, 6-4, 5-7, 7-6 (3) in two hours and 43 minutes.Norrie, troubled by a stomach virus when the match began the previous evening, fought doggedly to extend the contest by taking the third set, and he was in contention throughout the fourth, before the chair umpire ruled he had touched the net in the course of hitting what would have been a winning shot trailing 3-5 in the tie-break.Resigned, but happy with his performance, the 22-year-old left-hander said: “It was only one point of the match. It’s not really a big deal. But everyone makes mistakes. I may or may not have touched it, I’m not really sure.”His own mistakes (rather than the umpire’s, presumably) dwindled after he struggled in the gloaming on Wednesday evening. Revived, he showed his true form and ability against an opponent who is in his 17th slam event and reached the third round last year.Norrie, properly integrated into the British tennis scene since moving to London as a teenager, looks to have a temperament suited to the vagaries of his sport, and allowed himself a smile when told that an Argentinian radio announcer had been calling him Chuck Norris live on air. “I know he’s pretty famous. When I went to Argentina for pre-season they actually thought my name was Chuck Norris at the team I played for. It was pretty funny. And I guess it’s an honour to be compared to him.”As one of the many jokes about the all-conquering action hero goes: “Chuck Norris is the only man to ever defeat a brick wall in a game of tennis.” Norrie came up against one here and, while he might have left a little bruised, he appeared to relish the experience.As for his plans before Wimbledon, he said: “I’m just going to chill out for a little bit. I’ve played lots of tournaments. I think I’ve played, like, five or six weeks in a row. So a little bit of down time heading into the grass.”Not the long grass, of course. As well as an acute tennis brain, Norrie has a quiet calm under pressure that is impressive, reflected in his low-key demeanour off the court. Not unlike Edmund, in fact."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/728fdf1e21aa5ff94a3716749e4e57ad292d4d96/418_64_3152_1892/master/3152.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bc3cf526e924f2f410aad0c94eceb536","title":"england pakistan second test headingley bayliss","story":"There would be huge relief at the beleaguered ECB if England could square the Pakistan series but there is no guarantee of that, especially since the fitness of Ben Stokes is in doubtThe Headingley Test has become a spicier match than was ever anticipated at the start of the summer. England were so dire at Lord’s, so emphatically beaten by the side ranked No 7 in the world, that the calls for upheaval will reach a deafening crescendo if England lose again in Leeds.Suddenly jobs are at stake. Another defeat and there will be more demands for heads to roll. The usual reaction and the one that we are used to whenever a football side are losing is simple: sack the coach. In any case, in this instance, it is Trevor Bayliss’s turn. Joe Root was appointed captain only 15 months ago Ed Smith, the national selector, one month ago. If England slump again Bayliss is most obviously in the firing line.The fact that cricket operates in a completely different way to football will be ignored as this inconveniently muddies the waters. In football, the managercoach makes all the major on-pitch decisions and the results dictate whether he stays or goes. Apply those principles to the current situation with England cricket team and there is scope for confusion.England are ranked the best side in the world in ODI cricket so coach Bayliss must be brilliant England will be ranked No 7 in the world in Test cricket if they lose at Headingley, so coach Bayliss must be hopeless.Something does not tally. The two forms of the game are not so radically different that a coach can be excellent when there is a white ball and execrable with a red one. In reality, England’s plight demonstrates the limitations of the coach in cricket. To a large extent his success is dependent upon the quality of the personnel at his disposal. Currently England have discovered some dynamic, confident cricketers, intuitively led on the field by Eoin Morgan in one-day cricket, but their Test team is nowhere near as well-endowed.There are pragmatic reasons why ditching Bayliss as the Test coach is fraught with difficulty. For a start, who would sack him? Theoretically that is the job of the cricket director, who is Andrew Strauss, but he is on compassionate leave and has just been replaced by Andy Flower. Can the locum take such a major decision, especially when he would be a candidate to plug the gap in any interregnum?Tom Harrison, the chief executive of the England and Wales Cricket Board, could intervene though he already has a hundred problems mounting up on his desk.So there would be huge relief at the beleaguered ECB if England could square the series at Headingley but there is no guarantee of that, especially since the fitness of Ben Stokes is in doubt. We constantly hear of his totemic presence within the side, though in blunt figures his contributions in the three Tests he has played since his enforced absence are modest – 150 runs at an average of 25 and three wickets.However, Stokes bowled with vigour at Lord’s and at least he looked as if he was going to score runs. There is the possibility that he could play at Headingley as a batsman only, which would not be good news for Dawid Malan.The call-up of Sam Curran, Surrey’s left-handed all-rounder, as cover for Stokes is another bold selection. He is only 19 but is twice as experienced as Dom Bess since he has played 38 first-class matches as opposed to 17 and, unlike Bess, he has been among the wickets this season, taking 10 at the Oval against Yorkshire, including that of Root. Like his older brother Tom, Sam does not give the impression that he is easily overawed. He has steely eyes. As a bowler he lacks pace and height but he does have the capacity to swing the ball back in to the right-handers, which on his day can deliver lbws.His method recalls that of Mike Smith, the Gloucestershire left-armer, who played his solitary Test at Headingley in 1997 against Australia. A catch was dropped by Graham Thorpe in his third over, Matthew Elliott made 199 and Smith ended up wicketless. It was just about the only day that season that Smith was unable to get the ball to swing. Curran, who is also a promising batsman well beyond Smith’s capabilities, will hope for better luck if he plays.If Stokes is sidelined or unable to bowl and Curran is selected then the chances of Chris Woakes replacing Mark Wood are enhanced, partly because this would strengthen the batting. The idea of playing Wood ahead of Stuart Broad is eye-catching but highly unlikely to happen. The principle of ensuring that none of the senior players take their places for granted is sound but in these volatile times this is probably not the case. Everyone is on edge.In fact, for England to prevail it is the batsmen who must start to deliver. The fresh-faced Keaton Jennings is recalled – and perhaps he can go to forward short leg rather than Root, who has enough to do – to rejoin Alastair Cook, who is playing his 154th consecutive Test, a world record.Meanwhile, Pakistan’s only selection issue is how to replace the unfortunate Babar Azam, who has a broken bone in a forearm. Usman Salahuddin is therefore likely to make his Test debut in the middle order."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/22847924c8603d709d6ee3e00aa32c901160dd29/0_34_4632_2780/master/4632.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a62cc737aee21b4c556f0ee9ed3c091d","title":"lebron james cleveland cavaliers nba finals","story":"As the NBA finals get started we know LeBron James’s brilliance is undeniable. But the relative merits of the greats is a debate many players find dullI often get asked about LeBron. How does his play now compare to when he was younger? How long can he keep playing? What does it take to stay in the game so long? Is he the best player who ever lived?LeBron is a much better player today than he was when he was younger. Few can dispute that he was the catalyst who drove the Cavaliers to defeat the Celtics in the playoffs. Having that power isn’t just a matter of skill, it’s a willingness to take on the responsibility of rallying the team and of having the respect of the team as a leader, not just a player. Seizing that responsibility shows a man of confidence, maturity and inner strength. Earning the team’s respect shows a man who is knowledgeable about the game, dedicated to the team as a whole and cares about players as iniduals. LeBron is a great inidual player, but he’s an even greater team member. And that’s what wins championships.Based on the fire inside him that we witnessed during the playoffs, LeBron could probably play another seven or eight seasons, during which time he might also break my record and become the NBA’s all-time leading scorer. If he does, my reaction will be the same as when he broke my postseason scoring record: good for him. Any time someone breaks a record, everyone benefits because the limits of what a person can accomplish have been nudged just a little further. The real question isn’t can he, but will he want to continue playing that long. He has nothing left to prove to himself or anyone else. If he walked away today, he would still be considered one of the finest players in history.Playing professional sports in your mid- to late-30s is not for the faint-hearted. As The Eagles say in After the Thrill Is Gone: “Half the distance takes you twice as long”. When I played at that age, I had to make a conscious effort to stay in shape all year round. I lifted weights for strength, jumped rope for cardio-vascular, and practiced yoga for flexibility. Younger players might be able to fall off the training wagon during off-season, then jump into an intensive fitness regimen before the season to get back in playing shape. That doesn’t work for older players. Will LeBron want to continue with that unrelenting routine for five to seven more years? Especially given the level of his achievements, his wealth, and his young children at home. His skills will eventually deteriorate and there is some nagging frustration at not being able to play at the level you used to, even if it’s at a higher level than most other players.Fans love to speculate about who’s the greatest player ever. Is LeBron greater than Michael Jordan or Kobe Bryant? Am I better than Wilt Chamberlain or Bill Russell? While this might be a fun pastime for fans and sports journalists, most players find this kind of alternate universe pondering to be fairly boring, somewhere along the lines of who would win in a fight: Hawkeye or Green Arrow? Aquaman or Sub-Mariner? In sports, a player develops his style, his skills, his sensibilities based on the time period he grew up in. The way basketball is played today is different to what it was 10, 20 or 30 years ago. Then along come game innovators – whether players or coaches – and the sport evolves. LeBron is one of the best players now and his intelligent combination of team leadership, brawny lay-ups, dominating rebounding, and surgical passing is elevating the game to its next level. Just as Michael Jordan, Jerry West, Larry Bird, Magic Johnson and others did. In fact, for those paying attention to the playoffs: Bill Russell went to eight NBA finals in a row, and his teams won all eight.Basketball may be the only sport in which fans are guaranteed to see an amazing feat of athleticism every minute or so. On Thursday, LeBron James will once again demonstrate why he deserves to be a living legend as he leads his team, regardless of whether they win or lose, further into greatness."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2b294570e3082d4904076f54d7535b436d6f1cfc/69_26_6909_4145/master/6909.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8f574c29027df00063b103558e8d9aac","title":"perfect clarity can lift the oaks claim first classic clive cox horse racing","story":"For the third year in a row, a single-figure field will go to post for the Oaks at Epsom on Friday afternoon when softish ground is expected to complicate the test for horses, riders and punters alike. Epsom somehow managed to escape a downpour during the day but, with a sudden heavy shower still possible until well into the night, the going for the Oaks and Saturday’s Derby is likely to be good-to-soft at best.“You could see it coming our way on the radar from first thing,” Andrew Cooper, Epsom’s clerk of the course, said on Thursday afternoon, “but so far, it just hasn’t materialised in any quantity.“There’s no sign of any rain on the radar now, though things can pop up pretty quickly and we won’t be out of the woods until midnight according to some forecasts. But it’s encouraging that we’ve escaped so far and now there’s probably as good a chance of us staying dry as there is of us getting some rain.”Even on fast summer ground, Epsom is quite a test for a lightly-raced filly in the early stages of her three-year-old career. Genuinely soft ground for the Oaks would increase the challenge significantly in a contest where even Flattering, the outsider of the entire field, is no bigger than 28-1 with the major firms.The betting is so open, at least in part, because Charlie Appleby’s Wild Illusion, the likely favourite, has not so much claimed her place at the top of the betting as inherited it. John Gosden’s Lah Ti Dar seemed sure to start favourite before being ruled out by injury a few days ago, and though Wild Illusion was a Group One winner as a juvenile and finished fourth in the 1,000 Guineas, she has no form at all beyond a mile.She is also up against no fewer than five fillies trained by Aidan O’Brien, including Magic Wand, who, like last year’s winner Enable, took the Cheshire Oaks on her way to this race. Magic Wand finished nearly four lengths clear of Forever Together, who will join her stable companion in Friday’s field, but Forever Together would have been much closer with a clear run. As a result, it could be argued that O’Brien’s team may be longer on quantity than quality.If so, the way could be open for Perfect Clarity (4.30), the Lingfield Oaks Trial winner, to maintain the only unbeaten record in the field. Like Appleby, Clive Cox, her trainer, has yet to win a Classic, but nine Group One wins show he knows what it takes at the highest level.Like Enable, Perfect Clarity is a daughter of Nathaniel and her win at Lingfield made it clear that Friday’s trip should hold no fears, even on soft ground.“We’ve always held her in high regard at home,” Cox said. “She’s only had two starts and she’s not as experienced as some of the others but she’s progressive and she’s got class.“She only ran once at two and Nathaniel is not known for first-time-up juvenile winners but she won it well. She won a Listed race on just her second start and she’s got a live chance tomorrow. It will be a huge step forward for her, but we’re really hopeful that she will acquit herself well.”The time of Perfect Clarity’s win at Lingfield was also that of a very talented filly and at around 8-1 she is a fair price to give Cox his Classic breakthrough."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7fe73e514a5142094e00559be902a45a9d05978d/1518_1115_4050_2430/master/4050.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a9fd7c959f417415cfd698932612596b","title":"how much screen time is too much for kids parents advice children digital media","story":"Parents have been advised to limit media consumption, but research suggests it’s the nature of it that mattersFor many parents in the digital age, battles over screen time and devices have become a depressing part of family life, and knowing how much is too much has become a moving target.Whether it’s three-year-olds throwing tantrums when the iPad is taken away, seven-year-olds watching YouTube all night, nine-year-olds demanding their own phones, 11-year-olds nagging to play 18-rated video games that “all their friends” are, or 14-year-olds who are never off Instagram, every stage of childhood and adolescence is now accompanied by its own delightful new parenting challenges.Up until a few years ago parenting advice centred around the concept of “screen time” quotas with a Goldilocks-style sweet spot of two or so hours of screens a day, beyond which media use could become harmful.The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) still recommends a maximum of one hour of “high-quality programming” for children under 6, but thereafter simply encourages parents to “place consistent limits on the time spent using media” and designate screen-free time as a family.It’s unclear whether that means four hours playing a video game on a Sunday is okay, or whether it is better to have three 20-minute sessions with the iPad than one hour-long session. Is it really that bad if my 18-month-old watches a couple of episodes of the Twirlywoos before dinner?Many parents will be relieved to hear that recent research suggests that it’s not so much the length, but the nature of the screen time that matters. Whether it’s passive TV or social media monitoring, active video game playing, socialising with WhatsApp, or getting creative in iMovie.Jocelyn Brewer, a psychologist who specialises in the concept of “digital nutrition”, likens media diets to what’s on our plates: rather than counting calories (or screen time), think about what you’re eating. “It’s not just about whether you consume any potential digital junk foods, but also your relationship to technology and the role it plays in your family life,” says Brewer. “We know that using screens to soothe or pacify kids sets up some concerning patterns of relying on devices to calm or distract a child (or teen, or adult) from their experience of unpleasant or uncomfortable emotions – so we want to avoid using screens to placate tantrums, just like we want to avoid eating ‘treats’ to calm emotional storms.”For young children, the most important thing is whether parents and kids are playing, watching or browsing together.Another study from December by the University of Michigan on people aged four to 11 similarly found that “how children use the devices, not how much time they spend on them, is the strongest predictor of emotional or social problems connected with screen addiction”. But the authors said that concern over a child’s screen use is warranted when it leads to poor behaviour, loss of interest in other activities, family or social life, withdrawal, or deception.Talk about kids and technology usually tends towards the negative, but it doesn’t have to be so. The internet and video games can be fun, social and provide a new creative outlet for children. “Evidence-based benefits identified from the use of digital and social media include early learning, exposure to new ideas and knowledge, increased opportunities for social contact and support,” says the AAP. The consensus is that screen time, in and of itself, is not harmful – and reasonable restrictions vary greatly, depending on a child’s behaviour and personality. There is little point in obsessing over how many minutes a day your kids are spending with screens. Instead, parents should be doing what they can to ensure that what they’re watching, playing and reading is high-quality, age-appropriate and safe – and joining in wherever possible.“It’s important there is balance in the online and offline worlds and in leisure and learning, but what that looks like for different kids at different ages and in different families is hard to ‘prescribe’,” says Brewer. “Research shows that not having access to the digital world has a negative impact on kids – so its about finding the right amount with a holistic approach.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d33b587980bf6e6e207698db0638fd3700d3300c/0_182_4925_2954/master/4925.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fcb58edaefa6fd1073f34a6099518835","title":"proposal for scottish islands passport could lead to travel discounts","story":"Regional transport group Hitrans suggests passport scheme to boost tourism to Scotland’s 93 inhabited islandsFrom “munro bagging” to completing the West Highland Way, travellers to Scotland have always loved a challenge. Now, with plans being drawn up to for a Scottish islands passport, a new task for tourists could be on the horizon: visiting the country’s inhabited islands – 93 of them.The Scottish islands passport scheme was proposed in a recent report by regional transport body the Highlands and Islands Transport Partnership (Hitrans).Travellers would be encouraged to collect a stamp for visiting each island, which could then be linked to travel discounts. It was inspired by Ireland’s Wild Atlantic Way passport, which encourages visitors to complete the 2,500km route and collect 188 stamps along the way. The Wild Atlantic Way has proved successful since its launch in 2014, attracting an estimated 1.3 million visitors last year. Hitrans hopes a passport scheme could have a similar impact on the Scottish islands, boosting tourism and supporting the “lifeline” transport services to the remote islands in the process. Writing in the report, Hitrans partnership manager Neil MacRae said the marketing possibilities around the concept were “endless”.“For example, the passport could be issued to everybody in Scotland to encourage them to visit as many of the islands as possible over their lifetime,” he wrote.According to the 2011 census, Scotland has 93 inhabited islands with a population of 103,700, served primarily by ferry but also air services. The passport scheme hopes to work in partnership with the different transport operators in the region, boosting local economies, while encouraging more visitors to the smaller and less-accessible islands.A spokesperson for VisitScotland said: “The Scottish islands passport idea is at a very early stage but we would be supportive of any initiative that brings more visitors to our islands, with a unique stamp to represent each inidual island as a strong call to action.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d3ead505b1ff92d5282b58067807c06813f3da3e/0_210_4039_2424/master/4039.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b12fa54fc35131e9f5e4b05ebf8e574c","title":"matt leblanc to leave top gear bbc","story":"Star will leave BBC show after 26th series to spend more time with family and friendsMatt LeBlanc is to leave Top Gear after the next series, BBC Studios has announced.The actor thanked the team for “a great drive” and said he was leaving the motoring show to spend more time with his family and friends.“My experience on Top Gear has been great fun.

The government said it is not aimed at any religions and does not ban headscarves, turbans or the traditional Jewish skull cap.But the law is popularly known as the “burqa ban” and is mostly seen as being directed at the dress worn by some Muslim women. Few Muslim women in Denmark wear full-face veils.The justice minister, Søren Pape Poulsen, said it would be up to police officers to use their common sense when they see people violating the law, which comes into force on 1 August.The legislation allows people to cover their face when there is a “recognisable purpose” such as cold weather or complying with other legal requirements, for example using motorcycle helmets under Danish traffic rules.Those violating the law risk a fine of 1,000 kroner (£118). Repeat offenders could be fined up to 10,000 kroner or jailed for up to six months.Austria, France and Belgium have similar laws.Gauri van Gulik, Amnesty International’s Europe director, said of the Danish decision: “All women should be free to dress as they please and to wear clothing that expresses their identity or beliefs. This ban will have a particularly negative impact on Muslim women who choose to wear the niqab or burqa.“While some specific restrictions on the wearing of full-face veils for the purposes of public safety may be legitimate, this blanket ban is neither necessary nor proportionate and violates the rights to freedom of expression and religion.“If the intention of this law was to protect women’s rights, it fails abjectly. Instead, the law criminalises women for their choice of clothing and in so doing flies in the face of those freedoms Denmark purports to uphold.”Associated Press contributed to this report"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0c5ed69d5fe47e37dc08c500a41d5f097dafb024/0_77_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=65d4f8ac47580cb147620de9dcbcf9c8","title":"how chopping off their horns helps save rhinos from poachers","story":"Violent but bloodless, dehorning is considered a necessary evil by anti-poaching campaigners in South AfricaArmed with a dart gun in a helicopter hovering above Somkhanda game reserve in South Africa, the vet Dr Mike Toft has just shot a powerful cocktail of drugs into the massive white rhino below.The 2,000kg (315st) bull starts to stagger and sinks slowly to its knees as the drugs take effect. Though immobilised, the rhino is conscious. So, once it has been moved into the right position by a team on the ground, foam earmuffs and a blindfold are placed on its head to reduce stress levels.After marking the ideal cutting point to avoid damaging the living growth plates at the base of the horns, Toft fires up a chainsaw and slices both of them off.Those magnificent horns, which have helped to protect this species for millions of years, are the reason that more than 7,000 rhinos have been killed in South Africa in the past decade. A persistent human desire for rhino horn – for everything from traditional medicine to hangover cures or status symbols – drives the slaughter of more than 1,000 of the animals each year in the country that has the largest rhino population in the world.News doesn\u0027t always have to be bad – indeed, the relentless focus on confrontation, disaster, antagonism and blame risks convincing the public that the world is hopeless and there is nothing we can do.This series is an antidote, an attempt to show that there is plenty of hope, as our journalists scour the planet looking for pioneers, trailblazers, best practice, unsung heroes, ideas that work, ideas that might and innovations whose time might have come.Readers can recommend other projects, people and progress that we should report on by contacting us at theupside@theWorldwide, the situation is grave. The northern white rhino became functionally extinct after the death of Sudan, the last male, in March, while the black rhino population is down to about 5,200. The situation for Asian rhinos is equally bleak: there are just 3,200 surviving Indian rhinos, about 76 Sumatran rhinos and 60 Javan rhinos. There are fewer than 30,000 rhinos globally, with Africa’s southern white rhino the most populous species at about 20,000.These alarming figures have driven wildlife managers in several South African reserves to take the drastic step of sawing off hundreds of horns every year, before criminal syndicates can get their hands on them. With the poachers’ prize removed, the risk to the hornless animals is greatly reduced.Toft has removed close to 1,800 horns from 900 rhinos in the past three years in KwaZulu-Natal, which has been heavily targeted by poachers. Both Galliers and Toft acknowledge that dehorning is not a permanent or ideal solution to the crisis. “This is not something we want to do. It’s expensive and invasive but we believe it is a necessary evil,” says Galliers, noting that it costs about £580 to safely dehorn a rhino.The cost is based on the hiring of helicopters and skilled vets. Galliers, also head of the anti-poaching initiative Project Rhino, points out that dehorning must be repeated every 18-24 months as the horns regrow naturally.Even then, there have been cases of dehorned animals being shot for their stumps. Toft has developed a method of removing as much horn as possible without causing pain to the rhino or damage to its growth plates. The horn is removed to about three finger widths from the base, then the stump is further trimmed around the edges with an angle grinder, enabling the removal of an extra 2kg of horn on a large bull.The operation is noisy and violent, but there is no blood – and Toft insists it is no more painful than trimming your fingernails if done correctly.Galliers and Toft believe dehorning could help save rhinos under threat elsewhere in Africa and Asia. But the cost means that might only be possible in small and medium-sized reserves. Dehorning only selected bulls is not an option, as those without horns would be more vulnerable in territory fights. In parks where the entire rhino population is dehorned, all bulls are placed at equal disadvantage. But dehorned rhinos can still fend off lions by using their considerable bulk as a weapon, Toft says. For trophy hunters, the aim is to acquire both the head and the horns. Many other horned animals are hunted: elephants are slaughtered for their ivory, but Toft does not think detusking is a solution. Tusks are partially hollow and contain sensitive roots and nerves. Although it would be feasible to remove the solid portion, a large volume of tusk would have to remain intact, which could still attract the attention of poachers. Tusks are also essential tools for elephants to strip tree bark or dig up succulent roots and tubers.For now, dehorning appears to be achieving success as an emergency measure, buying time while the decades-old debate continues about how to end the demand for rhino horn.This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

The relatively unknown law professor was due to meet Italy’s president, Sergio Mattarella, on Thursday night.“All the conditions have been fulfilled for a political, Five Star and League government,” Luigi Di Maio, the Five Star chief, and Matteo Salvini, the League leader, said in a joint statement on Thursday after several hours of talks in Rome.The deal will bring at least temporary calm to a political crisis that has roiled Italy for weeks. The tumult raised questions – in Brussels and among investors around the world – about whether the rise in Italian populism and the collapse of traditional parties posed a fundamental threat to the country’s future in the eurozone.A formation of the new government will at least temporarily allay those concerns, because it will – for now – remove the threat that snap elections will be called later this summer, a prospect which worried investors because it could have bolstered anti-EU parties.Italian press reports indicated that the populist leaders had stepped back from their insistence that Paolo Savona, an 81-year-old eurosceptic, serve as finance minister. The choice had been vetoed by Mattarella days ago, prompting the M5S and the League to call off their deal. Savona is now expected to be nominated to serve as EU minister, instead.But there are still many unknowns about how the new government, comprised of an uneasy alliance between two former political opponents, both jockeying for power, will govern Italy.Salvini, the bombastic and xenophobic leader of the League, who rose in politics in recent years on the back of incendiary and racist statements about migrants and Roma, is expected to take on the role of interior minister. Salvini has campaigned on the promise of mass deportations of migrants, and has said that a new government would build new detention centres around the world.He is also a fierce critic of Brussels, and has called for closer ties to Russia.Di Maio is expected to lead a powerful new post that will combine labour and industry portfolios, in a move that could mark big changes to labour and environmental policies, given the M5S’s stated opposition to big industry.Giovanni Tria, a little known economics professor, is expected to be nominated to the finance ministry. While Tria has been critical of the EU, he is not been seen as an advocate for an exit from the eurozone.The new deal has not yet been blessed by Italian president Sergio Mattarella, who earlier this week nominated a technocrat, Carlo Cottarelli, to serve as prime minister. Those plans were put on hold after Mattarella opted to give the populists more time to reach a new agreement.The new government is expected to take a far more antagonistic stance against Brussels than the previous government, headed by the centre-left Democratic Party. But the alliance between the M5S and the League will only have a relatively narrow majority in the Italian Senate, easing some concerns among investors and officials in Brussels that the new government could take drastic actions.While both parties are populist in nature, and have railed against Brussels and Italian “elites”, they have long been natural opponents in politics.“They are both led by young and ambitious leaders who share prime-ministerial ambitions. Due to mutual distrust, it has taken both parties over 70 days to reach a deal and choose an unknown third figure as prime minister,” said Wolfango Piccoli, the co-president of Teneo Intelligence in London.Their shared agenda includes taking a far tougher line on migrants, including a plan to open new detention centres across Italy. They have also proposed plans to cut taxes, scrap a previously agreed pension plan, and institute a “universal basic income”.While many officials in Brussels sought to ease tensions with Rome this week, and came to the defense of Mattarella after the president took a political risk by defending Italy’s role in the EU, a top official on Thursday issued a tough critique of Italy.Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European commission, said Italians need to work harder, be less corrupt and stop looking to the EU to rescue the country’s poor regions.“Italians have to take care of the poor regions of Italy. That means more work less corruption seriousness,” Juncker said. “We will help them as we always did. But don’t play this game of loading with responsibility the EU. A country is a country, a nation is a nation. Countries first, Europe second.”Additional reporting by Daniel Boffey in Brussels"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ff84c48828989deba9b73d38b8209eaa292b5100/0_227_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cfc773ca56f07929c68725954efe29df","title":"karachi residents cool off pakistan heatwave in pictures","story":"Pakistan’s most populous city is in the grips of a heatwave as temperatures soar to 45C.

Photograph: Stephen CollinsCollins PhotosAnastasia Kriegel’s death notice was clear in its instruction.“Ana loved sparkle and colour,” it said. “The family wish for the dress code to reflect this.”And so they came on Thursday, to Newlands Cross Crematorium, close to 1,000 family and friends to say their goodbyes to the 14-year-old girl who was adopted from Russia aged two and who sang, danced, laughed and cuddled her way into their hearts.But it was Ana herself who sparkled brighter than anyone throughout the civil funeral service, one that was devoid of the usual religious obsequies but was brimming with love, memories and many, many tears for a life cut cruelly short.“None of us wants to be here this afternoon,” said the celebrant, Padraic Cawley, “none of us wants to say goodbye to Ana for the last time. We are all numb, confused and very angry and bewildered that such a thing has happened to the most beautiful, caring, kind, strong willed, crazy, sometimes cheeky but always a loving princess.”The glittering, bubbling life celebrated in the austere, circular crematorium setting seemed so terribly far removed from the one that ended in an abandoned and derelict Lucan farmhouse on May 14th and in relation to which another child has been charged with murder.The little girl from Russia loved her dancing, her music, her fashion, swimming, dogs, her heritage, her annual holidays in France. What words could anyone use, asked Mr Cawley?“There are no words,” he said in answer.But while the occasion was one of great sadness, it was also an opportunity to celebrate a short but very full and colourful life.The choir of Confey Community College, which Ana attended, sang A Million Dreams, from the musical, The Greatest Showman — “A million dreams is all it’s gonna takeA million dreams for the world we’re gonna make” – and Ana’s dancing friends from Dance LA of Leixlip, red headscarves tied up into bows to hold their hair up, and all wearing silver sequined wristbands, provided a guard of honour.Many were in tears as Ana’s coffin was walked in past them, weeping that for many continued throughout the service of reflection.The Russian ambassador to Ireland,Yuri Filitov, paid his respects to Ana’s grieving parents, Geraldine and Patrick, lingering with them, holding hands and whispering comfort.Young relatives brought symbols of Ana’s life. There was the flag of Russia which they laid open on her dark wood coffin. There was a matryoshka doll, like the one Geraldine and Patrick used to hold a photo of baby Ana which they handed to family friends, the surprise inside announcing an imminent arrival in Leixlip of the then 2½-year-old who later liked to announce proudly that she came from Siberia. There were Ana’s headphones a photo of Eddie, her favourite dog and a model of the Eiffel Tower symbolising her love of France and the annual family holidays spent there with Patrick’s relatives. There was a memory box filled by the students of Confey College and finally, Ana’s outfit from Dance LA.Ana embraced life with both hands, said Mr Cawley. But inside Siberian warrior Anna, as she liked to style herself, was also a little girl who loved to cuddle up in her pyjamas with her Mum on a Sunday “watching some beautiful fairytale princess movie while munching her favourite food, popcorn”.This was what she and Geraldine had done on Sunday, May 13th – the day before everything changed.“Life is so, so fragile,” said Mr Cawley. “It is a privilege and tomorrow is never promised to any of us... So live every day as a blessing, an opportunity and leave nothing behind.”Ana’s aunt Jan remembered Ana’s exuberance as a child, delighting in water – first the family shower, then swimming in the lake. She loved to perform for her family, dancing and singing for them she wanted to be a mermaid and Santa Claus obliged – a photograph on screen showing a pretty girl in an orange mermaid outfit, posing stretched out on a sofa.“She just loved it and as far as she was concerned, it was the most natural thing to be dressed in on Christmas morning,” said Jan.And as the delightful, pretty child blossomed into a beautiful teenager, the love of display took on new forms, the latest being a dalliance with goth sub-culture. Ana mused one day with the notion of getting some piercings, much to the anxiety of her mother who suggested that delaying a little would be a good idea.Ana responded, said Jan: “You’re always tell me to be myself Mam and this is me!”Through further memories from close family friend Catherine Murphy TD and two of her teachers, the theme of “This is me” was never far from the surface. The Ana who emerged from stories of holidays in France, her impact in San Carlo National School and more recently Confey College, was a sparkling, loving, gifted, ever eager and obliging child with a big personality that impacted on all who knew her.A slide show of images showed a pretty and playful child emerge into a beautiful young woman, a dazzling butterfly looking more than the mere 14 years she was. And in the background, the song This Is Me, also from The Greatest Showman, played: “When the sharpest words wanna cut me down I’m gonna send a flood, gonna drown them outI am brave, I am bruised I am who I’m meant to beThis is me...”Looking out from in front of the altar was the now well known photograph of Ana from her recent fashion show – looking out, side on, her hand raised to her lips, blowing a kiss to the photographer, her hair set in high chignon style.But as the celebration drew to a close, it was the final image shown, that of an effortlessly beautiful girl next door, no make-up, no special hair do, no gold lame dress, just a naturally pretty young woman, that drew an ovation and many, many tears."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3513041.1527621230!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit aids surge in irish passport applications","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe Department of Foreign Affairs has appealed to people to renew passports online.The UK’s exit from the European Union next year has “undoubtedly” contributed to a 25 per cent spike in applications for Irish passports, the Department of Foreign Affairs has said.The number of applications in the first four months of this year has increased by 25 per cent when compared with the figures for the same period in 2016.The department said the Passport Office, which falls under its remit, was currently experiencing “peak season”, adding that the number of applications received is up by 10 per cent compared with last year, continuing a recent trend.Each year, the Passport Office recruits additional temporary staff to assist with the seasonal increase in applications. This year, sanction was received for 220 temporary clerical officers to assist permanent staff in processing applications.“The increase in the volume of applications is undoubtedly in part influenced by Brexit-related demand, with around 10 per cent of all applications this year from applicants living in Great Britain,” the department said in response to queries.“However, there are also other drivers of demand, including a trend towards early renewal of passports, a growth in outbound travel, and a growing population.”As of the end of April, more than 276,000 passports had been issued since the turn of the year. In the same period, 39,000 passport applications were received from applicants residing in Northern Ireland, and more than 41,000 were received from applicants residing in Britain.The department said that in addition to taking on temporary staff, the Passport Office was working to improve services, including plans to expand the online renewal project, as part of its response to increasing application volumes. It said iniduals seeking to renew their passport should do so online, as waiting times for this service had been reduced significantly in recent years.“Adults renewing their passports are strongly encouraged to renew their passport online,” it said. “The online passport application service is fast, convenient and secure, and is processing applications in 10 working days, plus postage time.“In fact, in 50 per cent of cases, the processing time is currently down to five working days. “Applicants can apply from anywhere in the world, with no need for a paper form, witness or printed photos. Renewal applications received through Passport Express are currently processed in 16 working days.”It also said that applications from first-time applicants, as well as from those with loststolen passports, take longer to process.“For these categories of applications, robust identity verification and entitlement checks, as well as vital fraud and security procedures, are necessary to ensure that the integrity and security of the Irish passport is maintained,” it said. “These checks take additional time to complete.”Negotiations move to phase II after agreement reached on protecting the rights of citizens in both UK \u0026amp EU, Northern Ireland and the financial settlement of the orce"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3515012.1527767286!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coveney refuses to apologise for stubborn brexit talks strategy","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTánaiste Simon Coveney said at this stage of Brexit negotiations, Ireland needs to be protected. Photograph: Cyril ByrneTánaiste Simon Coveney said he would “make no apologies” for the Government being “overly stubborn or persistent” in pushing the British to commit to the so-called backstop option to avoid a hard Irish Border.Speaking at a Brexit conference in Dublin, Mr Coveney, the Government’s lead Brexit minister, said negotiations between the EU and UK were in “a critical phase” over stalled progress on finding a solution to avoid a hard Border on the island of Ireland. “Certainly, it would be easier not to be so persistent about this and to be reassured that everything will simply work at the time in the context of the future relationship discussions but I’m afraid we can’t do that – we can’t take that risk,” he told a conference hosted by the Association of Higher Civil and Public Servants. The Tánaiste said that at this stage of the negotiations Ireland “needs to be protected” and is “not going to be separated from the pack” of the remaining 26 EU member states.Mr Coveney said the backstop, which would keep Northern Ireland in the EU’s customs union and the single market to avoid a hard border without another option, was the “only visible solution” on the table. Protecting the peace process was why the Government was “so adamant” about legally operable backstop being agreed by the next European Council meeting of EU leaders at the end of June, he said. “Personally, I think if we don’t have progress in June we are in for a very difficult summer with negotiations. It is important to be honest about that now with our friends and colleagues in London,” he said.Mr Coveney said his “personal view” was that the transition period after the UK leaves the EU in March 2019 was that it was going to take more than two years. He told the audience of civil servants at the Morrison Hotel in Dublin city centre that it was important in Brexit negotiations that what politicians and public servants say “constantly tally and I don’t go off on some tangent for political reasons or the civil service doesn’t feel the need to correct the political system.”The Tánaiste praised British civil servants as arguably the best in the world and spoke of the importance of close relations between senior Irish and British officials in the negotiations.“The kind of conversations that they can have to anticipate and compensate for the lack of political progress at times is really important to keep this whole thing moving forward,” he said.He stressed how critical the Brexit negotiations were and how Britain’s departure from the EU would change relations between Ireland and the UK and between the EU and the UK.“This is not a case of a political storm that we must weather and at the end of it when we get out the other side, everything goes back to normal,” he said. “This is a political challenge that is going to permanently change the relationship for future generations in Ireland in the context of how we interact, how we trade and how we work with our closest neighbour.” Mr Coveney repeated his view that it was “not helpful” to be calling for border polls on the island of Ireland in the middle of Brexit negotiations.“It feeds and fuels polarisation in Northern Ireland which at a time when we are trying to provide practical, sensible solutions for Brexit,” he said.Talking about the close Anglo-Irish relations even within his own family, Mr Coveney admitted that one of his English uncles on his mother’s side voted for Brexit – “the one I don’t talk to,” he said, to laughs. Another speaker, Dave Penman, general secretary of the British civil servants’ union, the FDA, said the absence of clear political direction in the UK was “the biggest threat” to an orderly Brexit.“We have situation where the civil service are having to negotiate effectively with both hands tied behind their back it is unclear what they are being asked to deliver the government can’t agree with itself,” he said.Brendan Halligan, former secretary of the Labour Party and a one-time MEP, told the conference that there was a “very mild chance” of a cliff-edge Brexit where the UK would leave the EU without a deal leading to a “legal, economic and political blackout” the morning after Britain departs in 10 months’ time.“I think that the car crash is very much on the cards,” he said. Mr Halligan said that, “thinking the unthinkable” post-Brexit, there was a possibility of the UK breaking up “as a consequence of the driving force behind Brexit, which is English nationalism.”“It has reached the stage where economics doesn’t matter ideology has been triumphant,” he said. He found it “slightly frightening” that Northern Ireland had come back on the political agenda and said Northern nationalists were determined “they are not going to go back into a cage” post-Brexit.Emer Deane, director of the Brexit team in Ireland’s Permanent Representation to the EU in Brussels, described Brexit as “the biggest change management project we have ever had to deal with.”Negotiations move to phase II after agreement reached on protecting the rights of citizens in both UK \u0026amp EU, Northern Ireland and the financial settlement of the orce"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3515352.1527786084!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"two boys in critical condition after swimming incident in ennis","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe alarm was raised at around 3.30pm and a search mounted at disused quarry near Knockanean on the outskirts of Ennis.Two teenagers have been airlifted to hospital after they got into difficulty while swimming in Co Clare this afternoon.

Calls from some quarters for a Border poll now or in the near future are not wise and not welcome.”Mr Coveney told the attendees the Government continued to do everything in its power to ensure the relationship between Britain and Ireland would thrive following Brexit.But he added: “We should not confuse optimism and positivity over future relations with any naivety over current talks. On the contrary – we are clear-eyed that greater intensity and realism needs to be brought to bear. And also that this needs to happen urgently.“It is acknowledged now that the EU and UK teams have not made the headway since March that we had hoped they would,” said Mr Coveney. “In response, we have made two things very clear. Firstly, that significantly more progress must be made on the protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland before the June European Council. And secondly, that there will be no final withdrawal agreement, in October or at any stage, without that backstop on avoiding a hard border.”He said that backstop should now be the “highest priority”.The Minister emphasised the importance of delivering on commitments already made, and “the overarching guarantee of no physical infrastructure at the Border and no associated checks or controls”.He said progress in the negotiations since March had been too slow and that “significantly more by way of agreement is needed ahead of the June European Council”.Mr Coveney noted that those at the dinner represented some of the 38,000 Irish companies now doing business in Britain.He said they exemplified the mutually beneficial trading relationship Ireland and the United Kingdom enjoyed, a relationship worth more than €65 billion each year, which sustained more than 400,000 jobs across both islands.Negotiations move to phase II after agreement reached on protecting the rights of citizens in both UK \u0026amp EU, Northern Ireland and the financial settlement of the orce-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":null,"title":"miriam lord it took 35 years to build this stunning result","story":"Thirty-five years after it was placed into the Constitution, the electorate voted for the Eighth Amendment to be repealed and for provision be made for the regulation of termination of pregnancy.

Photograph: Nick BradshawIt took 35 years to build a landslide.Repealing the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution was neither quick nor easy, despite what the margin of difference might say.Sixty-six per cent said “Yes”. Makes it look simple.But that two-thirds majority conceals hard history and hard-fought battles behind a stunning final result.Woman by woman, story by story, year upon year, day after day. The rocks and pebbles of countless unjust ordeals and small personal tragedies piled up after each furtive trip to Liverpool and beyond.Brave campaigners for basic abortion rights did everything they could to increase the pressure, their efforts ignored and condemned by priests and politicians and that tiresome class of pious people who live in terror of the slippery slope.They thought they could hold back a landslide. On Friday, gravity kicked in. The slippery slope did for them in the end.The Eighth Amendment, which guaranteed a foetus the same right to life as the woman carrying it, is gone from the Constitution. Good riddance to it. It brought nothing but difficulty and despair to Irish women in times when they desperately needed proper care and compassion at home.It was a wonderful morning on Saturday in the RDS when the boxes were opened and the votes counted. It was a wonderful afternoon in Dublin Castle when crowds filled the courtyard to hear the official declaration. It was a wonderful day for Irish women.A day made even better in the happy knowledge that the vast majority of Irish men are looking out for them and want only the best for them. By voting in their droves to repeal, they placed the concerns of women far above the fears of ideologically-motivated crusaders who prize saving souls above having a heart.With repeal looking the likely outcome, there were calls from some quarters for a muted and dignified response. Perhaps it was the reason why there was neither screen nor public address system for the huge crowd at the castle.But no. For all the decades of all the women who suffered, and for all the women who fought and agitated for change, we had to celebrate this historic turning-point in modern Irish society.Some never thought they would live to see the day. Some, like Monica Barnes and Mary Holland and Nuala Fennell and many more, didn’t. The celebration was for them too.It was for Ailbhe Smyth, who never stopped fighting. It was for senator Ivana Bacik, Catherine Murphy, Joan Burton, Catherine McGuinness and many more who were there from the start.Political rivalries were cast aside for the day. “Oh, c’mere to me,” said socialist Bríd Smith, giving Fianna Fáil’s Timmy Dooley a hug.Obstetrician Peter Boylan, looking very cool in his shades turned up and it was like George Clooney had just rambled in, such was the clamour which greeted his entrance. The three co-directors of Together4Yes – Ailbhe Smyth, Orla O’Connor and Gráinne Griffin – arrived to rapturous welcome.Senators Lynne Ruane and Alice Mary Higgins were in floods. Ruth Coppinger was hugging for Ireland. Katherine Zappone, who demanded the referendum as her price for supporting the Government, was ecstatic.“Oh God, I told my husband I’d give up the fags if there was a repeal,” said Fine Gael’s Kate O’Connell, one of the party’s most active campaigners, as she ran out for a smoke.Brendan Howlin arrived in just after Mary Lou McDonald’s big entrance. The Labour party was fighting the cause when all the others didn’t want to know. “We never get the credit,” said Howlin, shrugging. “We carry the flag, but then in comes the fresh faced Leo to take all the glory.”Maybe not. Health Minister Simon Harris pretended to be embarrassed by the “I fancy Simon Harris” poster, but he was secretly thrilled. Wherever he went he was mobbed. No wonder Leo stuck close by him.Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin maintained a low-key presence, but his early intervention and support for repeal and the proposed legislation was a pivotal point in the campaign.It was a courageous move which now sees him on the right side of history and one half of his parliamentary party stranded on the other.As Micheál walked through the crowd, tearful young women hugged him. A man and woman approached. “We’re one of those couples who had a fatal foetal abnormality,” the women said to him. “Thank you. Just, thank you,” she sobbed.Meanwhile, back in the RDS, the Attorney General was chatting to former Supreme Court Judge Catherine McGuinness.She had had eye surgery the day before but the doctor gave her a special dispensation to attend the count. “Theoretically I should have a patch over my eye today.”At Dublin Castle, Frank Crummy (81), who set up Ireland’s first family planning clinic, was resplendent in his repeal jumper, alongside his wife Evelyn.There was a lot of discussion about why so many politicians and pundits called the campaign so wrong. The Together4Yes team remains amused by the old school, outmoded metric used by some of them to evaluate their very effective efforts. It was as if they were affronted at the idea that people outside the Kildare Street bubble might actually know more than they do about what the electorate really wants these days.Independent TD Clare Daly, a politician hugely deserving of credit for the part she played, decided to stay away from the castle bunfight. Instead, a number of Johnny Come Lately politicians with a weakness for self-publicity preened and waved from the platform.It’s always the same.A third of the electorate voted No. “I feel like I’ve lost my country,” a woman told us amid the celebrations in the RDS. She was very sad. She couldn’t be consoled.Cheers and tears and champagne greeted the announcement. The sky fell in briefly when a few drops of rain fell. Everyone danced.Because it was a monumental day. The day when the intelligent, compassionate citizens of Ireland turned to the Catholic Church and the retreating fundamentalists and firmly said: “Thanks, but no thanks.

The ban was backed by the ruling liberal-conservative coalition parties, the far-right People’s Party and the opposition Social Democrats.From August violating the ban will result in a 1,000 kroner (€134) fine for the first offence and up to 10 times that for four or more breaches. The government in Copenhagen insists the law targets face covering in general and is not aimed at any religion. It does not outlaw headscarves, turbans or the traditional Jewish Kippa. Ahead of the vote, justice minister Søren Pape Poulsen said Danish police would not forcibly remove veils from women. “I do not want police officers pulling items of clothing off people – burkas or otherwise,” he told the Politiken daily. “That is not going to happen.”Instead the woman will be asked to go home, if she lives nearby, or brought to a police station to be collected by a family member.The Danish People’s Party, campaigning for a ban for a decade, had proposed prison sentences for breaching the bill, but this was removed from the final draft. It said the veils were “incompatible with Danish culture and the foundations on which Denmark is built” and that it was “always Danish to protect Denmark”.In 2011 France became the first European country to legislate against face coverings in public and Austria the most recent country to follow suit last October. The Austrian ban, forcing people to show their face from forehead to chin, was loosened during the winter. Police were told to be more lenient towards people covering up against the cold. A similar provision exists in the new Danish law.No recent figures exist over how many women actually wear the burka or niqab in Denmark. The most recent figures, from 2010, show a maximum of 200 women wearing the niqab, the full veil with a slit for the eyes, and the burka, a full veil with a mesh screen for the eyes.Human rights groups were critical of the ban, saying it went beyond what was needed for public safety and would exclude some Muslim women from public life.“All women should be free to dress as they please and to wear clothing that expresses their identity or beliefs,” said Ms Gauri van Gulik, Europe director of Amnesty International. “The law criminalises women for their choice of clothing and in so doing flies in the face of those freedoms Denmark purports to uphold.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3515404.1527787322!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"italy s five star and league parties reach agreement","story":"Italy’s populist Five Star Movement and League parties have come to an agreement on a government team, with economist Giovanni Tria as the leading candidate for the job of finance minister, according to party officials.Five Star’s Luigi Di Maio and the League’s Matteo Salvini agreed on a proposed administration during a meeting at the Rome parliament on Thursday, according to officials from both parties who declined to be named discussing confidential talks. The populists had previously agreed on law professor Giuseppe Conte as potential premier.Mr Tria (69) will be finance minister with Eurosceptic economist Paolo Savona (81) responsible for European affairs, according to a senior League politician. The accord excludes the far-right Brothers of Italy, which had campaigned with League in a centre-right alliance, from the team.Italian bonds gained after the news, with the 10-year yield falling about 18 basis points to 2.7 per cent before rising again to 2.8 per cent. Previous efforts to form a populist government had spooked markets with a programme that pledged a spending spree and tax cuts, challenging European Union rules.Mr Conte was meeting Mr Di Maio and Mr Salvini on Thursday evening, newswire Ansa reported. President Sergio Mattarella had on Sunday vetoed Mr Savona as part of a Five Star-League administration, citing concerns about his stand on the euro.The Five Star-League candidate for the foreign ministry is pro-European Enzo Moavero Milanesi, a former minister for European affairs.The head of state, whose task it is to appoint a premier and government ministers, held informal talks with premier-designate Carlo Cottarelli, a former International Monetary Fund director, on Thursday, according to a senior state official. Mr Cottarelli could give up on his mandate to allow Five Star and the League to seek a green light from Mr Mattarella.Mr Tria\u0026nbspis head of the Economy Faculty at Rome’s Tor Vergata University and has called for a debate on the euro in Italy and across Europe.“People who call for unconditionally leaving the euro as a cure for all ills aren’t right. But neither is the European Central Bank president Mario Draghi when he says ‘the euro is irreversible’ if he doesn’t clarify the conditions and the timing for the reforms which are necessary for its survival,” wrote Mr Tria in a March 2017 article in newspaper Sole-24 Ore.Former campaign rivals Mr Di Maio and Mr Salvini, who also leads a broader centre-right alliance with ex-premier Silvio Berlusconi as a junior partner, had agreed on a government programme which includes a guaranteed “citizen’s income” for the poor, scrapping a pension reform which raised the retirement age and strong curbs on immigration.The old order buckled at the March 4th elections as the centre-left Democratic Party of ex-premier Matteo Renzi suffered its worst ever result, and Mr Berlusconi (81) was eclipsed as leader of the centre right by the more hard-line League. Five Star became the single biggest party.Mr Di Maio and Mr Salvini have been pressuring the president, who upset their bid for power by vetoing Mr Savona. Mr Mattarella placed Mr Cottarelli on standby as he awaits news from the populist leaders on their attempt to revive plans for governing together. – Bloomberg"},{"url":null,"title":"hawaiis erupting

health organization cautiously optimistic ebola response","story":"Health workers prepare to attend to patients in the isolation ward to diagnose and treat suspected Ebola patients, at Bikoro Hospital in DRC. The World Health Organization is cautiously optimistic that the current Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo can be controlled after response efforts have so far averted the explosive increase in cases officials had earlier feared, Peter Salama, WHO’s Deputy Director of Preparedness and Response said on Tuesday.Four hundred potential contacts in the city of Mbandaka - 90 per cent of those at risk - have been vaccinated under a ‘ring vaccination’ programme using an experimental vaccine developed after the last Ebola crisis in west Africa.The WHO has so far identified 900 people in DRC it is following that may be at risk of contracting the disease due to contact with someone who has been infected. The WHO acknowledged however, that identifying all potential contacts remains challenging.  Since the start of the current outbreak earlier this month, 54 cases -  including 35 confirmed instances - of the disease have been reported, mostly in the remote areas of Bikoro and Iboko in the country’s north-west Equateur province. Twenty-five people have died. No new cases have been reported in the past two days. Although only a minority of cases have been reported in Mbandaka, the vaccination effort has to date focused on the densely populated city of 1.2 million due to fears the number of Ebola cases could rise rapidly in an urban environment.Dr. Salama said that take up of the vaccine among people deemed to be at risk of the disease has been high. “The vaccine is proving to be a very acceptable intervention to the community,” said Dr. Salama.He acknowledged however, that the WHO and partner agencies were “still at an early stage in this outbreak response”. He said: “We can’t conclude that we have safeguarded the city of Mbandaka.” Dr Salama did not rule out the possibility of further cases in the city.   The WHO is now expanding the vaccination campaign into the rural areas at the centre of the outbreak. On Monday, WHO began vaccinations in Bikoro, where the outbreak was first declared.  The WHO is also expecting to receive approval in the next few days from the government of the DRC to use five new drugs on patients in Ebola treatment centres. The drugs are all unregistered and will be used as part of a clinical trial.  Dr. Salama said that it was not a simple effort to do this kind of trial in this kind of environment. The WHO hopes that the trial will pave the way for future Ebola treatment efforts. Earlier this month, WHO experts concluded that the current Ebola outbreak did not constitute a “public health emergency of international concern. The health agency is however, continuing to monitor potential locations, including 80 ports on the Congo river in DRC and neighbouring Republic of Congo for new cases of the disease.The current outbreak in the DRC is the worst outbreak of Ebola since the 2014 - 2015 outbreak which killed  11,300 people in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.Protect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health SecurityNicola Sturgeon told to \u0026#39stop putting nationalism before the NHS\u0026#39 as indy blueprint backlash growsBrexit bulletin: Eurocrat corruption, brawls and bullying exposed Mariano Rajoy facing abrupt end to his rule as \u0026#39Frankenstein coalition\u0026#39 looms over SpainUK is world’s biggest seller of dark web cocaine, Australian study finds Widow stalked for five months by hotel manager who followed her back to UK after holiday romanceIs this the end of the great \u0026#39gold plated\u0026#39 pension cash-in? Database aims to counter surge in luxury watch thefts Missing his family and friends, Matt LeBlanc quits Top GearComment: Tears of Sarah Huckabee Sanders could prove watershed for Republicans troubled by TrumpBBC ‘infuriated’ by delay over Radio 4\u0026#39s Eddie Mair wage cut following gender pay gap scandalSilver surfer gender gap as men more likely to be online than women Bill Cosby accuser Andrea Constand says she was \u0026#39crying out inside\u0026#39 in first interview about attack Afghanistan war hero in row with neighbours over charity tank outside homeComment: Nick Grimshaw out, Greg James in – but who is the Radio 1 breakfast show actually for?Comment: Ukraine\u0026#39s flirtation with fake news could be disastrous for the West How the Queen fused the medieval traditions of the Coronation with the modern worldDonald Trump praises ‘very good’ North Korean meetings as he awaits letter from Kim Jong-unLocals warn tourists to stay away from summer capital of British Raj after severe water shortagesWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":null,"title":"city highlights fromnational geographic travel photographer","story":"This is a selection of images from the National Geographic Travel Photographer of the Year Contest which is open for entries until May 31, 2018.The Scenic Suitcase taken by Stephanie MillerThe colorful streets of Bo Kaap weren\u0027t always this way.

Many advisers take a percentage of the cash lump sum as a fee for the advice, meaning it can run into thousands of pounds. Nicola Sturgeon told to \u0026#39stop putting nationalism before the NHS\u0026#39 as indy blueprint backlash growsBrexit bulletin: Eurocrat corruption, brawls and bullying exposed Mariano Rajoy facing abrupt end to his rule as \u0026#39Frankenstein coalition\u0026#39 looms over SpainUK is world’s biggest seller of dark web cocaine, Australian study finds Widow stalked for five months by hotel manager who followed her back to UK after holiday romanceDatabase aims to counter surge in luxury watch thefts Missing his family and friends, Matt LeBlanc quits Top GearComment: Tears of Sarah Huckabee Sanders could prove watershed for Republicans troubled by TrumpBBC ‘infuriated’ by delay over Radio 4\u0026#39s Eddie Mair wage cut following gender pay gap scandalSilver surfer gender gap as men more likely to be online than women Bill Cosby accuser Andrea Constand says she was \u0026#39crying out inside\u0026#39 in first interview about attack Afghanistan war hero in row with neighbours over charity tank outside homeComment: Nick Grimshaw out, Greg James in – but who is the Radio 1 breakfast show actually for?Comment: Ukraine\u0026#39s flirtation with fake news could be disastrous for the West How the Queen fused the medieval traditions of the Coronation with the modern worldDonald Trump praises ‘very good’ North Korean meetings as he awaits letter from Kim Jong-unLocals warn tourists to stay away from summer capital of British Raj after severe water shortagesLove Island 2018: The complete beginner\u0026#39s guide as the new series starts on ITVWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/05/31/TELEMMGLPICT000165031573_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqB9TNGSg3mw1zIYGf6IZil_PnnjZCHM7buvIhfynOWKk.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"mariano rojoy facing abrupt end rule frankenstein coalition","story":"Rajoy\u0026#39s rule is almost certainly at an end after opposition parties promised to back a motion of no confidenceMariano Rajoy is facing defeat in a crunch vote to oust him as prime minister of Spain as his party looks likely to lose its grip on power after being swept up in a corruption scandal.The prime minister\u0027s rule is almost certain to end  on Friday as opposition parties in the Spanish parliament promised to back a motion of no confidence after senior former ruling party officials were jailed in connection with a corruption scandal.Pedro Sánchez, leader of the main opposition socialist party, will become prime minister in place of Mr Rajoy when, as is expected, an absolute majority in Spain’s Congress supports the motion in a vote on Friday afternoon.The dramatic demise of Mr Rajoy’s conservative government creates fresh uncertainty within the eurozone’s southern reaches where Italy has been grappling with its own political crisis. A last-ditch attempt to form a government in Italy appeared to offer an answer to the impasse late on Thursday night.There was speculation that Mr Rajoy could opt to resign before Friday’s vote in Congress, in which case his People\u0027s Party (PP) government would remain in power as an interim administration. But the PP secretary general, María Dolores de Cospedal, said on Thursday evening that Mr Rajoy would not stand down “as it would not benefit the interests of Spain”.While Mr Sánchez seems certain to win the motion, it will be hard for the socialists to govern effectively with only 84 members in the 350-strong lower house. Mr Sánchez has said he plans to call elections before the legislature expires in 2020, but has so far refused to set a date.The socialists triggered the motion after a court in Madrid last week sentenced several former PP officials, including the party’s onetime treasurer, to hefty jail sentences in a largescale corruption trial. In their verdict, the judges concluded that the PP had run a slush fund of kickbacks from companies “parallel to its official financial structure” from its foundation in 1989 up to 2005, the last year under investigation in the case.  Mr Rajoy was called as a witness in the trial, but his testimony that the PP had not used off-the-books accounting was described in the judges’ ruling as “not credible”.Mr Sánchez urged Mr Rajoy to resign for reasons of “political hygiene”.Mr Rajoy responded that he had personally done nothing wrong, and warned the assembled politicians about backing a “Frankenstein government”, in reference to the socialists needing support from the Left-wing Podemos, pro-independence Catalan parties and the Basque Nationalist Party (PNV), among others, to reach a majority.Mr Sánchez promised to maintain financial stability and that his government would respect the state budget for 2018, approved only last week. On the issue of the Catalan government’s bid for independence, the socialist leader promised to enter dialogue to reach agreements “within constitutional bounds”.   Please review our commenting policyNicola Sturgeon told to \u0026#39stop putting nationalism before the NHS\u0026#39 as indy blueprint backlash growsBrexit bulletin: Eurocrat corruption, brawls and bullying exposed UK is world’s biggest seller of dark web cocaine, Australian study finds Widow stalked for five months by hotel manager who followed her back to UK after holiday romanceIs this the end of the great \u0026#39gold plated\u0026#39 pension cash-in? Database aims to counter surge in luxury watch thefts Missing his family and friends, Matt LeBlanc quits Top GearComment: Tears of Sarah Huckabee Sanders could prove watershed for Republicans troubled by TrumpBBC ‘infuriated’ by delay over Radio 4\u0026#39s Eddie Mair wage cut following gender pay gap scandalSilver surfer gender gap as men more likely to be online than women Bill Cosby accuser Andrea Constand says she was \u0026#39crying out inside\u0026#39 in first interview about attack Afghanistan war hero in row with neighbours over charity tank outside homeComment: Nick Grimshaw out, Greg James in – but who is the Radio 1 breakfast show actually for?Comment: Ukraine\u0026#39s flirtation with fake news could be disastrous for the West How the Queen fused the medieval traditions of the Coronation with the modern worldDonald Trump praises ‘very good’ North Korean meetings as he awaits letter from Kim Jong-unLocals warn tourists to stay away from summer capital of British Raj after severe water shortagesLove Island 2018: The complete beginner\u0026#39s guide as the new series starts on ITVWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/05/30/TELEMMGLPICT000164886317_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bqek9vKm18v_rkIPH9w2GMNtm3NAjPW-2_OvjCiS6COCU.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"smoking declines around world countries set miss targets report","story":"Many countries look set to miss national and global tobacco reduction targets by 2025Tobacco use has fallen significantly since 2000 but less wealthy countries are lagging behind, a new report from the World Health Organization has found.The report, released to coincide with Global No Tobacco Day, shows that worldwide the number of smokers fell by 29 million from 2000 to 2015 as more countries adopt policies to help their populations kick the habit. Today, some 1.1 billion people - 20 per cent of the population over the age of 15 - smoke.  Yet, although most countries have seen a fall in smoking rates, only a minority of countries look set to meet global and national commitments to cut tobacco use in over 15s by 30 per cent by 2025. The UK is one of a handful of countries on track to meet this goal.Which countries are on track to meet global tobacco reduction targets?The UK, where the first voluntary warnings appeared on cigarette packets in the 1970s and a smoking ban in public places has been in force since 2007, is one of a number of mostly wealthy countries that has led the way in tobacco control. Today just 16 per cent of the British population smokes, compared to 46 per cent in 1974.Across the rest of Europe smoking is also fast falling out of fashion. Last week, a new study revealed that smoking is starting to lose its allure in France as one million daily smokers kicked the habit in the last year thanks to the recent introduction of anti-smoking measures including higher taxes on cigarettes and plain packaging.Even Greece -  the European country where the biggest proportion of the population lights up - has seen a fall in smoking rates by almost two percentage points a year.Where are people stubbing out their cigarettes?The report reveals, however, that there are stark disparities between countries and regions. While 62 million smokers  in high-income countries stubbed out their cigarettes between 2000 and 2015, the number of smokers in low and middle income countries actually increased by 33 million.Less wealthy countries will see an increase in smokersThe report said that efforts to reduce tobacco use in low and middle income countries has likely been impeded by the tobacco industry whose relentless lobbying has stopped governments from introducing stronger policies.Dr Vinayak Prasad, co-lead author of the report and programme manager of  WHO\u0027s Tobacco Control, Prevention of Non Communicable Diseases team said: “It’s easier to get the political will and to explain the problem of tobacco but the tobacco industry is taking strong measures - they use all kinds of arguments such as the argument that controlling tobacco harms people\u0027s livelihoods.  The data however, disproves that controlling tobacco affects livelihoods.”The WHO’s Eastern Mediterranean region - which covers much of the Middle East and North Africa - is one region where overall smoking rates have barely fallen. The actual number of people smoking is expected to rise from 47 million in 2000 to 103 million in 2025 - a more than two-fold increase.Smoking rate are falling in most of the world- except the Middle East and AfricaDr Prasad said that multiple reasons lie behind high smoking rates in the region. “It’s culturally and socially acceptable to use the water pipe in many countries in the Eastern Mediterranean region, there’s been no strong leadership to push tobacco reduction at the highest level and countries have been hesitant to tax,” he said.Some GCC countries such as the UAE which introduced a \u0027sin tax\u0027 on cigarettes last October are starting to take measures but these have so far not been sufficient, according to Dr. Prasad.Some countries are bucking global trends as more people light upWhile the picture in many low and middle income countries is less sanguine, one group that is bucking the trend is women.Globally, women are kicking the habit faster in all regions of the world except Europe. “European women are an outlier globally,” said Dr Prasad. He said that factors including more liberal gender attitudes are contributing to a slower fall in smoking among women.Every year tobacco kills seven million people around the world – more than AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria combined.Tobacco use and second-hand smoke exposure are key causes of cardiovascular diseases such as heart attacks and stroke. Cardiovascular diseases kill 18 million people each year - with smoking responsible for some three million of these deaths.“The single biggest killer in the world is cardiovascular disease,” said Dr Prasad. “They are responsible for almost 44 percent of non-communicable disease deaths. If you fix the heart problem, you fix a big proportion of NCDs,” he said. According to the WHO few people are aware of the link between heart disease and tobacco as there is evidence of a serious lack of knowledge of the multiple health risks associated with tobacco.“Most people know that using tobacco causes cancer and lung disease, but many people aren’t aware that tobacco also causes heart disease and stroke – the world’s leading killers,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General.In recent years, more countries have adopted tobacco control policies such as plain packaging, taxation and banning smoking in public places.More people are now covered by tobacco control measuresAlthough Dr Prasad acknowledges that the tobacco industry and the continual development of novel products to continue to lure smokers remains an obstacle, he said that tobacco control policies have had a marked impact in many countries - including in low and middle income countries.“Taxation for sure is definitely an instrument - the additional revenue has been used to help the government fund universal health care in places like the Philippines,” said Dr Prasad. “Smoke free policies also cost very little as do warning labels and plain packaging,” he added.   Although the WHO’s current projection shows few countries will meet the 30 per cent target, Dr Prasad pointed to the example of France as evidence of what a country can achieve with political will. “France wasn’t doing anything until 2016 then woke up and introduced plain packaging. Things change.”Protect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health Security Please review our commenting policyNicola Sturgeon told to \u0026#39stop putting nationalism before the NHS\u0026#39 as indy blueprint backlash growsBrexit bulletin: Eurocrat corruption, brawls and bullying exposed Mariano Rajoy facing abrupt end to his rule as \u0026#39Frankenstein coalition\u0026#39 looms over SpainUK is world’s biggest seller of dark web cocaine, Australian study finds Widow stalked for five months by hotel manager who followed her back to UK after holiday romanceIs this the end of the great \u0026#39gold plated\u0026#39 pension cash-in? Database aims to counter surge in luxury watch thefts Missing his family and friends, Matt LeBlanc quits Top GearComment: Tears of Sarah Huckabee Sanders could prove watershed for Republicans troubled by TrumpBBC ‘infuriated’ by delay over Radio 4\u0026#39s Eddie Mair wage cut following gender pay gap scandalSilver surfer gender gap as men more likely to be online than women Bill Cosby accuser Andrea Constand says she was \u0026#39crying out inside\u0026#39 in first interview about attack Afghanistan war hero in row with neighbours over charity tank outside homeComment: Nick Grimshaw out, Greg James in – but who is the Radio 1 breakfast show actually for?Comment: Ukraine\u0026#39s flirtation with fake news could be disastrous for the West How the Queen fused the medieval traditions of the Coronation with the modern worldDonald Trump praises ‘very good’ North Korean meetings as he awaits letter from Kim Jong-unLocals warn tourists to stay away from summer capital of British Raj after severe water shortagesWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":null,"title":"widow stalked five months hotel manager followed back uk holiday","story":"The woman, 54, met Georgios Katsikidis in Skiathos, two months after the death of her husbandA widow endured the holiday romance from hell after a fling with a Greek hotel manager led him to stalk her for five months when he followed her back to the UK.The grieving woman, 54, was bombarded with phone calls and texts by Georgios Katsikidis who she met in Skiathos in August 2016, two months after the death of her husband.Norwich Crown Court heard Katsikidis, 39, harassed his victim for five months and threatened to send explicit pictures of her to her husband\u0027s relatives after she tried to dump him.The terrifying campaign culminated in January last year when Katsikidis crept into the woman\u0027s home in Norfolk and assaulted her while holding her prisoner for two hours.Katsikidis fled back to Greece where he was arrested before being extradited back to the UK on a European Arrest Warrant.He admitting stalking, false imprisonment, common assault and intimidation and was jailed for 16 months on Wednesday.Katsikidis, who lived in Skiathos, followed his victim back to UK where his ex-wife and two young children live.Prosecutor John Morgans said: She did not want any kind of relationship at that stage.She felt it too soon after the death of her husband but he seemed very attentive and she was grateful for the distraction.Mr Morgans said the pair had started to meet occasionally in the UK, but from a very early stage she was concerned he was too intense.The woman\u0027s attempts to let him down gently by saying she did not want a relationship ended in failure, he added.Mr Morgans said: She was too afraid to be in her home not knowing where he was. She had five days with relentless contact and went to stay with friends.The court heard that the victim\u0027s daughter left for school at around 7.40am in January 16 last year.The woman was followed back to the UK after leaving SkiathosMr Morgans said: Shortly after she hears what she describes as quiet footsteps climbing the stairs, and suddenly he is in her bedroom.His first words to her were \u0027I\u0027m not going to hurt you\u0027. She reaches for the house phone to call 999 but he takes the phone from her. Until 10am he is effectively keeping her a prisoner in her own home.The assault takes place as she tries to get hold of the phone and she is able to text her friend who calls the police.Katsikidis continued to harass his victim by messaging and emailing her even after he was bailed.He was completely blaming her for the situation and asking her to drop the charges, said Mr Morgans.Robin Howard, defending, said Katsikidis had lost his head over a love affair and was deeply and utterly ashamed.He added that Katsikidis had become homeless before rattling around Europe for 12 days with no passport.Judge David Goodin also gave him a restraining order banning him from contacting his victim or being in Norfolk, telling him: Leave this county and do not return.Nicola Sturgeon told to \u0026#39stop putting nationalism before the NHS\u0026#39 as indy blueprint backlash growsBrexit bulletin: Eurocrat corruption, brawls and bullying exposed Mariano Rajoy facing abrupt end to his rule as \u0026#39Frankenstein coalition\u0026#39 looms over SpainUK is world’s biggest seller of dark web cocaine, Australian study finds Is this the end of the great \u0026#39gold plated\u0026#39 pension cash-in? Database aims to counter surge in luxury watch thefts Missing his family and friends, Matt LeBlanc quits Top GearComment: Tears of Sarah Huckabee Sanders could prove watershed for Republicans troubled by TrumpBBC ‘infuriated’ by delay over Radio 4\u0026#39s Eddie Mair wage cut following gender pay gap scandalSilver surfer gender gap as men more likely to be online than women Bill Cosby accuser Andrea Constand says she was \u0026#39crying out inside\u0026#39 in first interview about attack Afghanistan war hero in row with neighbours over charity tank outside homeComment: Nick Grimshaw out, Greg James in – but who is the Radio 1 breakfast show actually for?Comment: Ukraine\u0026#39s flirtation with fake news could be disastrous for the West How the Queen fused the medieval traditions of the Coronation with the modern worldDonald Trump praises ‘very good’ North Korean meetings as he awaits letter from Kim Jong-unLocals warn tourists to stay away from summer capital of British Raj after severe water shortagesLove Island 2018: The complete beginner\u0026#39s guide as the new series starts on ITVWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":null,"title":"uk house prices property may nationwide index mortgages","story":"A likely interest rate hike will keep prices subdued, said one economistEconomists and property experts have painted a gloomy picture of the year ahead for house prices, after the latest Nationwide house price index showed the market missed expectations this month. UK house prices rose 2.4 per cent in May compared with the same month last year, which was a slower rate of growth than expected, according to the new data.Between April and May, prices were down 0.2 per cent, with supply remaining low and surveyors reporting subdued levels of new buyer enquiries.\u0026nbspIt follows the trend seen throughout the first quarter of 2018, during which London was the weakest performing region with prices dropping 1 per cent on the year before. In the first three months of the year, the north of England recorded stronger house price performance than the south, while Northern Ireland led UK regions for property price growth. Robert Gardner, Nationwide’s chief economist, said the fact that annual house price growth has stayed within a “fairly narrow range” of 2-3 per cent over the past year suggested there was “little change in the balance between demand and supply in the market over that period”. “There are few signs of an imminent change,” he added. “Looking further ahead, much will depend on how broader economic conditions evolve, especially in the labour market, but also with respect to interest rates. “Subdued economic activity and ongoing pressure on household budgets is likely to continue to exert a modest drag on housing market activity and house-price growth this year, though borrowing costs are likely to remain low.”Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said it was unlikely that the near-flat trend in prices will improve imminently.“Mortgage rates, which jumped in April, will continue to rise over the coming months,” he said, noting that the Bank of England had only delayed raising interest rates, meaning a hike is still on the cards this year.“Demand likely will remain at levels consistent with merely stagnant house prices,” Mr Tombs said.Jonathan Samuels, chief executive of property lender Octane Capital, said: “Tight supply and subdued demand are the key contributors to the ongoing limbo gripping the UK property market. A lethargic economy populated by cautious and squeezed consumers has created a property market lacking both momentum and direction. “The property market is fuelled by confidence but many consumers are running on fumes. Low stock levels and continued cheap borrowing rates will prevent a material decline in prices but equally a rise greater than very low single digits is highly unlikely. “From a house price growth perspective, 2018 is looking greyer by the day.”Craig McKinlay, sales and marketing director at Kensington Mortgages, said the trend highlighted by the Nationwide data was “all too familiar”. “An insufficient supply of new housing is continuing to make prices creep up year-on-year. Whilst price rises of late have been more sustainable, the challenges of the housing market remain,” he said. “The situation can be resolved, but it will take time, and the government will need to redouble its efforts to meet the housing targets for future generations.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Last week, Oxford University admitted it needed to do more to improve student ersity after more than a third of its colleges admitted three or fewer black applicants over three years.Labour MP David Lammy accused the prestigious institution of being “a bastion of white middle-class southern privilege” after the figures came to light.\u0026nbspOn the latest figures from, Mr Lammy, the former Labour higher education minister, said: “It is simply not good enough for Ucas to say that they do not know why black applicants are so much more likely to be flagged up by Ucas admissions systems.\u0026nbsp“Ucas need to explain why over half of all flagged applicants are black, despite black students accounting for just one in ten applications.\u0026nbsp“Why are one in every hundred black applicants flagged compared to one in every two thousand white applicants? Ucas needs to be able to explain this huge disproportionality and satisfy students from ethnic minorities that their applications will be looked upon fairly.”\u0026nbspIlyas Nagdee, black students’ officer for the NUS, said: “While it is encouraging to see Ucas being transparent about the university application process and particularly its verification service it must take immediate steps to implement the actions it is promising.\u0026nbsp“Currently they are unsure why a disproportionate number of black applicants are being flagged and until this is properly addressed and investigated we risk prospective black students losing all confidence in what is supposed to be a fair and equitable application process.”He added: “We hope Ucas will undertake the programme of work they set out today immediately and with great attention to detail.\u0026nbspAll students must be able to have faith in the application process.“Black students are let down and failed by the higher education system in a number of other ways during their time in study.\u0026nbspUcas must ensure that they are not put off or dissuaded from applying due to unconscious bias.”Clare Marchant, chief executive of Ucas, said: “Ucas uses industry standard software to screen applications for fraud on behalf of universities and genuine applicants.\u0026nbsp“This analysis gives us confidence we are only cancelling applications where there’s clear evidence of fraud or missing information.”She added: “However, there is more work for us to do to ensure that flagging is as robust as it can be across all areas of the verification service.\u0026nbsp“We’ve already made enhancements to our fraud detection service, introduced an additional review of applications prior to cancellation, and ensured all staff involved in verification activities have had up-to-date unconscious bias training.\u0026nbsp“We have set out a programme of work to further review verification processes in collaboration with universities and colleges, and we will be inviting organisations that represent Black, Asian, and minority ethnic groups to work with us to help us take a thorough look at key areas of our business, to improve the experience for all applicants.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

One was so long ago that engraving had to do the job of photography the other was recent enough that some people alive today will have heard about it from their parents. In one, a foreign ship came to grief in British waters in the other, a British vessel went down in foreign waters, and down she stayed.First to Texel, safe haven, population 13,500: the largest of the West Frisian Islands off the coast of the Netherlands in the Wadden Sea. Today it is a magnet for Dutch cyclists, walkers, swimmers and riders (the latter an important reminder that Texel is the only known place where an entire navy was defeated by men on horseback, which is another tale altogether).In June 1743, a 700 ton vessel, VOC Hollandia, set sail on her maiden voyage bound for Batavia, the capital of the Dutch East Indies, now known as Jakarta. In any study of trade between Europe and Asia throughout the 17th and 18th centuries, the Dutch East India Company is pivotal, shipping everything from nutmegs and cinnamon to coffee and tobacco, porcelain to rubber. And that is what VOC stands for: Vereenigde Oost-Indische Compagnie.A brief history of democracy: Is it the \u0027will of the people\u0027?Yet on this prestigious occasion, Hollandia, being of brand new and bold design, an impressive 42 metres in length, was carrying a particularly special cargo: not only many VIP passengers but also 130,000 coins. Most were “pillar-dollars”, cut to represent smaller denominations, but among the haul were also highly valuable Mexican and Guatemalan silver coins.Hollandia’s captain must have been nervous therefore, as he headed for Brittany through rough seas. Perhaps he was aware too that just 36 years before, in 1707, at least 1,550 men had perished in the same waters, haplessly drifting towards the Scillies aboard four Royal Navy warships: the Firebrand, the Romney, the Association and the Eagle. (Indeed, square mile for square mile, the treacherous Scillies are probably responsible for more of the world’s estimated 159,000 shipwrecks than anywhere else.)Remember, these were the days before the invention of reliable navigation instruments still before the erection of most lighthouses.Texel is now a popular tourist venueSure enough, like those earlier ships, the Hollandia was blown off course, scarcely six weeks after setting sail, on a blustery 13 July. And it too came to grief off the Isles of Scilly, striking the notorious Gunner Rock, going down just off Annet, an uninhabited nature reserve just 54 acres in size, 20 miles from the Cornish coast.Nobody lived to tell the tale.Miraculously, in 1971 a London attorney called Rex Cowan discovered the Hollandia’s wreck, along with its bronze cannons and some of its treasure. Unusually, he was using a proton magnetometer, allowing him to test the Earth’s field of magnetic resonance, which in the process reveals every slight variation across that field – including ferrous objects embedded in land or sea.However, it is now time to turn to the anniversary of a sinking far further away and to consider the watery grave awaiting an equally emblematic vessel. This was a calamity that was far more preventable.Many boats have come a cropper in the waters around the Scilly Isles (iStock)State of the art flagship and battleship, the HMS Victoria – named in named in honour of the Queen’s impending Golden Jubilee in 1886 – was launched at a cost of £845 from Elswick on the Tyne. When she headed for the Mediterranean in June 1893 for training exercises, she had already endured one major mishap – a grounding at Platea, off the Greek coast, with Captain Maurice Archibald Bourke having permitted members of his crew to misplace the buoys that might have saved him from some very shallow waters.On that first cataclysmic day, 29 January 1892, no full tide – indeed nothing at all – would get the extraordinarily long (100 metres), extraordinarily heavy (11,200 tons) Victoria afloat again. Jettisoning 483 tons of coal, and calling for a tow from three other Royal Navy frigates, somehow the Victoria – its bottom damaged, three of its compartments seriously damaged – resumed its voyage on 4 February, limping into the new Hamilton Dock, Malta, for repairs. Bourke, despite being severely censured, retained his command.  HMS Victoria in dock, prior to completionAt the dawn of a second catastrophic day, 22 June 1893, Bourke and his contemporaries, among them Captain Jenkins on the Collingwood and Captain Markham on the Camperdown, were lined up like tin soldiers ready for an experimental manoeuvre – a very tight one at that. It was their misfortune to be in the hands of Vice Admiral Sir George Tryon, Commander of the British Mediterranean fleet: an obstinate, overbearing man with some very peculiar traits and strategies.Tryon was deliberately taciturn and unapproachable – the better, he thought, to assert the superiority of his rank. The better too to outdo “inferior” French and Italian navies also cruising the vital Mediterranean and the better to force his officers to think on their feet.Inexplicably – and at a time when signalling remained primitive, based as it was on a mixture of flags, semaphores and lamps – Tryon wanted the two columns of his fleet to turn, uniformly, a full 180 degrees, first towards each other then (so the theory went) retracing their prior course. His 11 Captains – with Tryon himself menacingly aboard the Victoria – were to do this whilst positioned a mere 1,100 or 1,200 metres from each other, even though a gap of 1,800-2,200 metres might have been considered a safe bare minimum.Markham hesitated. Surely Tryon had confused radii for diameters? Surely he had issued the sort of order likely to be revoked any minute? Perhaps Tryon really intended the convoy to turn 60 degrees to port, then 60 degrees to starboard, before resuming its original course?Tryon however, was getting impatient. Fearing humiliation – his colleagues also hesitant to defy their esteemed commander – Markham aboard the Camperdown conceded, swinging towards the fated Victoria, despite believing he cannot avoid hitting her.  Even so, the Victoria – built before the installation of automatic bulkhead doors – has many proven stabilisers. Perhaps Bourke is a more gifted captain than he has previously demonstrated?At the last, both lead vessels went straight into reverse thrust. But it was all too late.Vice Admiral Sir George Tryon was a difficult man insofar as his junior colleagues were concernedThe toughened steel ram of the Camperdown tore 9 feet into the side of the Victoria, a full 12 feet below its waterline. After two minutes the two vessels disengage but the Victoria lists, her many gun hatches and portholes taking in floods of swirling water.Three minutes later, her bow dips – but an unrelenting Tryon demands any rescue boats return to their respective ships. Now he commands the leaking Victoria to head straight for the shores of Tripoli, five miles distant. After all, the Victoria’s engines are still running, many men below deck unharmed.Maybe Tryon trusts that the “watertight” doors are still closed, so trapping many hands not already flushed into the ocean. Rapidly though, certainly by collision plus eight minutes, the whole of the Victoria’s bow is submerged, its stern far out of true, propellers turning in open air.At last, but way too late, Tryon yells: “Abandon ship! Everyone for himself!”  Five minutes on, the top deck goes under. Loosened boilers explode. Everything remotely portable bounces into the already hazardous surrounding ocean.Two men on board refuse to jump ship: Reverend SD Morris, the chaplain on duty in the sick bay, who folds his arms across his chest, closes his eyes and says a final prayer and Tryon himself, in time honoured tradition, going down on his watch, muttering: “this is entirely my doing, entirely my fault”.HMS Victoria disappears beneath the Mediterranean’s surfaceBourke – fitter and quicker than his superior – does, with great difficulty, make his escape. A distinguished fellow-escapee is the fevered John Jellicoe, one day himself to be promoted to commander-in-chief of the British Grand Fleet and dispatched to confront a detachment of the German navy off Jutland.Staff Commander Thomas Hawkins-Smith, one of Tryon’s most vocal critics, also survives by clinging on to rigging.\u0027Made in China’ label helps archaeologists solve 800-year-old mysteryIn total, 358 of Victoria’s complement perished, coincidentally the same number as those believed to have been saved. Six bodies only were taken ashore, along with 173 men injured during the tumult. Jenkins on the Collingwood unarguably rescued more people than any other captain on duty – mainly due to his not recalling his lifeboats.The stricken Camperdown, despite taking 90 minutes to effect partial water resistance, partial stability, somehow managed to keep going, battered, but without loss of life.Back in England, reliable news was scarce. Only Markham’s telegram listing 22 surviving officers was to hand and so thousands of anxious friends and relatives milled round the Admiralty.Anger and sorrow rapidly give way to philanthropy. Within three weeks, a remarkable distress fund of £50,000 was raised for Victoria widows and orphans – the equivalent of more than £5m today.John Jellicoe survived HMS Victoria’s sinking and went on to become Commander-in-Chief of the British Grand FleetDebates raged about whether there should be a public inquiry into the disaster some argued that would hand too many secrets of British seamanship to her enemies. A court martial was opened – Bourke’s second – with reporters allowed to witness some of the proceedings. Bourke requested that any captain sistering the Victoria was exempted as a judge.In the dock, Bourke kept referring to navy ships as if they were on a highway, obeying “rules of the road”. But the very concept of obedience troubled the chief investigator, Sir Michael Culme-Seymour – “a safe pair of hands” – throughout his deliberations.It appeared to be common ground that Markham on the Camperdown should have followed his first instinct and aborted the manoeuvre. But then, had there not been a collision, Markham would have been hauled over the coals for insubordination.Tryon actually gave his orders in person ignoring them was extremely difficult, however foolish and foolhardy they were.HMS Camperdown was commissioned at Portsmouth in 1889Culme-Seymour himself had to walk a tightrope: avoiding any hint at a precedent for altering (let alone ignoring) instructions from above. Tryon’s mental health was queried. Perhaps he was suffering from a brain disease, dementia, when he sent the Victoria to its doom?In the end, Bourke came out best, his reputation undiminished. Markham, meanwhile, was censured almost as much as his flag captain, Charles Johnstone. Both could have acted differently at different stages in the unfolding catastrophe. Markham was stripped of his command, his pay halved, and relegated to minor duties. He died early, aged 65, in 1906.Crucially, Tryon’s philosophy of seamanship was abandoned, history not permitted to be kind to his memory. Of the engaged fleet formation only a repaired Camperdown was still being tossed by high seas in 1898.Like the Hollandia, the Victoria’s wreckage lay undiscovered for a long time. Not until 111 years and two months later, on 22 August 2004, was the ship found, by Austrian-Lebanese er Christian Francis, assisted by British explorer Mark Ellyatt. It was positioned almost vertically, 140 metres below their search vessel. They concluded that a full 30 metres of the Victoria’s bow had buried itself in the seabed.Our fascination with the ocean is ceaseless (PA)Three intriguing footnotes to the sinking of the Victoria continue to tantalise. First, it has long been the legend that, at the very moment of inevitable collision between the Victoria and the Camperdown, Mrs Tryon was hosting a party in her London mansion, when Commander Tryon himself, but ghostlike, descended the staircase to join festivities.Second, one of Tryon’s hobbies was collecting memorabilia connected to his hero, Horatio Nelson. In 2012, Ellyat temporarily retrieved Nelson’s sword from Tryon’s cabin but, unsure what to do with this precious artefact, he hid the discovery in a different part of the wreck where it abides till this day.Third, is the very title “Victoria” fated? After all, it was the MV Princess Victoria, a British Railways’ roll-on, roll-off ferry that sank on its passage from Larne to Stranraer, on 31 January 1953, costing 133 lives (at the start of the weekend of the great Lincolnshire floods, which left many people drowned across East Anglia and the Low Countries).How Chad’s killing fields have been turned into an elephants’ havenHow crowdfunding is enabling indie talent to create graphic novelsWhy women in South Africa are carrying the burden of HIVAnd barely six weeks after that terrible storm, a reordered SS Victoria also sank, this time striking rocks – just as the Hollandia did.Why, though, recognise the anniversary of any ship’s demise when there are no living survivors and nothing to add to any inquest? Well, the lure of the sea still captivates and enchants even the most landlocked of the general population.Despite all its dangers – because of all its dangers – the sea is where many of us are most alive.Isles of Scillyor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Will it secure a good future for our young people and allow them to thrive? Will it help protect and grow the number of well-paid, highly skilled, jobs that Wales needs?”\u0026nbspIt warned that the promises of £350m\u0026nbspa week for the NHS or the prospect of new trade deals immediately after Brexit were not going to be kept, while important issues such as the Irish border were rarely discussed during the campaign.The letter added: “For all these reasons we are coming together, on a cross-party basis, to speak out for the people of Wales and to demand, for them, and for everybody else in the UK, a people’s vote on the final Brexit deal.”Former Labour leadership hopeful Owen Smith, who was sacked from the shadow cabinet earlier this year for calling for another referendum, also threw his support behind the calls.Shadow international development minister Preet\u0026nbspGill had to delete a tweet earlier this month after setting herself at odds with the leadership by backing a people’s vote on Brexit.Meanwhile, shadow business secretary\u0026nbspBarry Gardiner\u0026nbspavoided getting sacked despite claiming parts of Labour’s approach were\u0026nbsp“b******s”.Several Labour MPs have publicly\u0026nbspbacked a public vote, including Chuka Umunna, Welsh MP Geraint Davis and London MP Gareth Thomas, who put forward a Commons bill calling for a people’s vote\u0026nbspon the deal.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

UK house prices rose 2.4 per cent in May compared with the same month last year, which was a slower rate of growth than expected, according to the new data.Between April and May, prices were down 0.2 per cent, with supply remaining low and surveyors reporting subdued levels of new buyer enquiries.\u0026nbspIt follows the trend seen throughout the first quarter of 2018, during which London was the weakest performing region with prices dropping 1 per cent on the year before. In the first three months of the year, the north of England recorded stronger house price performance than the south, while Northern Ireland led UK regions for property price growth. Robert Gardner, Nationwide’s chief economist, said the fact that annual house price growth has stayed within a “fairly narrow range” of 2-3 per cent over the past year suggested there was “little change in the balance between demand and supply in the market over that period”. “There are few signs of an imminent change,” he added. “Looking further ahead, much will depend on how broader economic conditions evolve, especially in the labour market, but also with respect to interest rates. “Subdued economic activity and ongoing pressure on household budgets is likely to continue to exert a modest drag on housing market activity and house-price growth this year, though borrowing costs are likely to remain low.”Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said it was unlikely that the near-flat trend in prices will improve imminently.“Mortgage rates, which jumped in April, will continue to rise over the coming months,” he said, noting that the Bank of England had only delayed raising interest rates, meaning a hike is still on the cards this year.“Demand likely will remain at levels consistent with merely stagnant house prices,” Mr Tombs said.Jonathan Samuels, chief executive of property lender Octane Capital, said: “Tight supply and subdued demand are the key contributors to the ongoing limbo gripping the UK property market. A lethargic economy populated by cautious and squeezed consumers has created a property market lacking both momentum and direction. “The property market is fuelled by confidence but many consumers are running on fumes. Low stock levels and continued cheap borrowing rates will prevent a material decline in prices but equally a rise greater than very low single digits is highly unlikely. “From a house price growth perspective, 2018 is looking greyer by the day.”Craig McKinlay, sales and marketing director at Kensington Mortgages, said the trend highlighted by the Nationwide data was “all too familiar”. “An insufficient supply of new housing is continuing to make prices creep up year-on-year. Whilst price rises of late have been more sustainable, the challenges of the housing market remain,” he said. “The situation can be resolved, but it will take time, and the government will need to redouble its efforts to meet the housing targets for future generations.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Digital minister Margot James told BBC Radio 5 Live that fans looking to buy tickets from a secondary site should not choose Viagogo, one of four major ticket reselling firms in the UK, because “they are the worst”. Meanwhile, National Trading Standards said on Wednesday that it had been in contact with the Advertising Standards Authority in relation to Viagogo. “As such we have now launched an investigation into Viagogo, which will look at all legal options to bring them into compliance with the law,” a spokesperson for Trading Standards said.Viagogo has previously been censured by the Advertising Standards Authority for “failing to make clear upfront all fees that can be calculated in advance when making price claims”, putting it in breach of the \u0026nbspUK Code of Non-broadcast Advertising and Direct \u0026amp Promotional Marketing, known as the CAP Code.The ASA said it had received complaints about how prices were presented on the Viagogo website, with quoted costs not making clear to consumers that they would be expected to pay additional fees and charges when ordering tickets. The ASA said it contacted Viagogo in March requesting that the company make changes to its website, and the firm said it would make the necessary amendments. However, the ASA added, as of Wednesday, Viagogo’s website “continues to include pricing information that is in breach of the CAP Code and the ASA’s ruling”. As a result, Viagogo has been placed in the ‘non-compliant advertisers’ section of the ASA’s website. Viagogo has been contacted for comment. The company was not the only firm implicated in the ASA’s crackdown earlier this year: StubHub, Seatwave and GetMeIn were also accused of misleading customers about fees and charges when booking tickets.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Italian governments have failed to meet the aspirations of Italians since at least the 1990s and the voters have been turning to ever more populist and extremist parties as a result. The brief premiership\u0026nbspof Matteo Renzi, which fell at the end of 2016 after\u0026nbsphe lost a constitutional referendum was probably the last gasp of conventional politics. A kind of Italian version of Tony Blair or Emmanuel Macron, Renzi\u0027s\u0026nbsppromising attempts at political and economic reform eventually stalled. His progressiveliberal Democratic Party secured a little over a fifth of the vote at the last election, pushed into third place\u0026nbspthe League (37 per cent) and\u0026nbspFive Star (32.7 per cent).\u0026nbspThe two leading groups in Italy are now the Five Star Movement, which was, literally, founded by a comedian, and is a kind of Italian Ukip and The League, formerly the Northern League, which enjoys most of its support in the wealthier north of Italy, rather than the poorer, more rural south. (Analogous to Catalan separatism in Spain).The League advocated virtual separation for the Northern provinces to form their own state. Some seek outright independence, reversing the historic Resorgimento (unification) of 1861. The League is thus a kind of cross between the politics of the SNP and Ukip.\u0026nbspThe president vetoed their choice of finance minister because he was a eurosceptic and might seek to lead Italy out of the euro – for which the Five StarLeague parties did not receive a mandate from the Italian electorate. The parties then refused to form a government, hence the stalemate. Some form of technocratic government will govern Italy until fresh elections are held. These may in effect become a referendum on staying in the euro (though not the EU).Italy’s slow-growing economy means poorer public services, bigger national and private debts, lower wages and lower living standards than expected.\u0026nbspSome blame immigration, and Italy is certainly the first destination for many making their way across the Mediterranean from Africa.Some also resent the euro, the European single currency, fully adopted in 2002, and regard it as a German racket. On this reading of things, the Germans do well out of Italy by selling the Italians their cars and then lending the Italians the money to pay for them, a cycle leading to a sort of economic bondage.\u0026nbspItalians thus believe the EU, and Germany in particular, has too much power over Italy hence the new strain of euro scepticism in what was traditionally an enthusiastic founding member (1957) of the European Union. Once the tacit admission in Italy was that they’d prefer Brussels to turn their affairs than Rome. That has now changed.So the Italian populist parties are stirring up conflicts with the EU Commission in Brussels and the European Central Bank in Frankfurt – convenient scapegoats.The Italian state and the Italian banks are going bust simultaneously, because they rely upon each other and neither is strong.The banking crisis after 2008 exposed two particular Italian problems, apart from longer term demographic and industrial trends, and these are still the immediate issues. \u0026nbspFirst and most serious is the weakness of her banks. By tradition most of the debts issued by the Italian government were purchased by Italian banks, pension funds and other financial institutions. The Italian banks are therefore stuffed full of Italian government bonds, and investors are becoming increasingly concerned that the weaknesses in Italy\u0027s public finances, namely a very large national debt, would lead to a default on the bonds, leaving them less valuable or worthless, and destroying the financial assets of the banks – which would then suffer a run and go bust.Italy and Italy’s banks would be insolvent – and beyond the capacity of Germany or the EU to rescue.\u0026nbspOnly a huge programme of buying Italian government debts, via the Italian banks, by the European Central Bank, in turn funded by the German taxpayer, has prevented this collapse from happening sooner.Since the banking crisis in 2008 the Italian has not developed as badly as the Greek one – but it is not entirely fixed either.Now that there is talk about the ECB buying less Italian government debt the old worries about Italy are coming back. These are exacerbated by the populist programme of the Five Star and League parties – which would need to borrow much more in order to fund their ambitious spending programmes.Dissolution with the post-Mussolini, post-Second World War settlement set in during the 1990s, when the old parties, the Christian Democrats and Socialists, became mired in scandal and associated with political and economic failure.Italy’s economy had began to stagnate, losing its competiveness and compounded by a low birth rate and declining working population. The post-war boom, an economic miracle which had seen Italians moving from the countryside to the towns and cities, owning scooters and cars\u0026nbspand growing prosperous was ending.In the 1950s and 1960s Italy, carried along by the increase in trade in the original EU, was growing at 7 per cent or so a year. Names such as Fiat, Lambretta and Zanussi became famous globally powerful brands, along with luxury brands such as Prada, Armani and Ferrari.But by the 1990s low growth, higher unemployment and stagnant living standards became the norm increased migration, which might help the Italian economy if properly managed, was viewed with resentment and suspicion.It was then that figures such as Silvio Berlusconi and his Forza Italia gained in popularity, themselves eventually giving way to Five Star and The League.If the economy, public finances and banks were fixed, many of Italy’s political problems would melt away. There are three options:This would mean allowing a Five StarLeague government to carry out its spending plans, allowing it to borrow and print much more money, and have the ECB buy all the resulting debt without complaint.Italy would also be allowed to print a parallel euro currency of its own, as the populist parties would like, (“mini bonds”) to help fund its spending, any inflationary problems being dealt with by the ECB, again without penalty to Italy.This would require the wealthier economies of Germany, the Netherlands and Finland, for example, to continue to subsidise Italy, in return for its continuing membership of the single currency and something resembling stability.However the ECB has already indicated it wishes to scale back its purchases of Italian government debt – which has fuelled investors’ concerns that no-one else will buy them.Exitaly: Italy leaves the euro\u0026nbspIn the long term this would enable Italy to devalue its own currency to get through structural reforms, solve any problems with international trade and to accommodate inflation, as was traditional when they used the lira. It cannot do this under the euro, and instead has to cut public spending, cut wages and undergo austerity – all deeply unpopular.However, bringing back the lira also means that interest rates would soar to persuade investors to take on the risk of a devaluing new lira currency or a default by an Italian government unable to pay back its treasury bonds.In the short run, Italy\u0027s already large national debt would need to be redenominated in the new lira currency, which, being worth less than the euro, will make the debt more expensive to service, perhaps prohibitively so.A European Risorgimento: Reform of the euro system: adding a banking union and a fiscal unionThis is the kind of solution President Macron of France has been campaigning for. It would mean that all eurozone governments in effect take on each others debts, and all are responsible for the stability of the banking system in every member state of the single currency.So this would include the likes of Greece, Spain and Italy, but not Sweden, Poland, Denmark, or the UK for that matter, who are not euro members.There might be more pressure on the Swedes and others to join the euro to “burden share” the costs of the European fiscal union. It would also require a powerful central European finance ministry and chief. \u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThe Macron reforms would work because any monetary union, such as the euro, will never work smoothly, or at all, without a corresponding fiscal union, and preferably banking union too.However the objection is that it would require the transfer of huge sums from the richer northern economies (Germany especially) to the poorer southern ones (Italy especially), and a leap forward in political integration.Angela Merkel has made plain her reluctance to take on such obligations and, in parallel to Italy, extremist eurosceptic movements such as the AfD have been making progress in Germany at the expense of the traditional Christian Democrats and Social Democrats.Germany, as much as Italy itself, may soon have to choose whether it still wants Italy in the eurozone.Without Italy, the zone\u0027s third largest economy, though, the fundamental sustainability of the euro would come under question. Financial chaos could break out and, via “contagion” in interlinked banks and economies, spread through the wider European financial system and economy, with a global impact.One side effect of that would be to make Brexit look somewhat more palatable to the British.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

But most people won’t actually be able to take advantage of the service.The high quality streams will be limited to a small number of people. They will be allocated on a first-come, first-served basis, and only to people with the right TVs.“We are pleased to announce a new cutting-edge trial which will see all 29 of BBC One’s World Cup matches available in Ultra HD and High Dynamic Range (HDR) on BBC iPlayer – but fans should grab their seats early as there is a limited number of spaces available (tens of thousands) for each game,” the BBC’s website reads.As well as the fact that the number will be kept to a minimum by only allowing a limited number of streams, a range of popular video players are not being given access to the high quality video. A full list of compatible devices can be found on the BBC’s website.The move will ensure that the bandwidth used by the ultra high definition streams – which are viewed over the internet\u0026nbsp– will be limited. 4K streams use up considerably more data than high definition ones, making them more intensive for the BBC and other broadcasters to support.The BBC’s Ultra HD offering is still being tested out – having so far been rolled out on lower profile broadcasts – and so restricting the data needed by limiting the number of people able to watch them will ensure that the streams can run properly.“The combination of the BBC and the World Cup can drive massive audiences, and right now there is limited bandwidth available to deliver live Ultra HD content to such large audiences over the open internet,” a BBC spokesperson said. “We’re making our Ultra HD trial available to as many people as possible within those limitations, while testing our systems on the largest scale yet.“The experience and data we gather from performing these trials will help us to optimise and scale up UHD delivery in the future.”For the same reason, the BBC recommends that anyone using the 4K streams make sure that their TVs or set-top boxes are plugged into the internet rather than connected over WiFi.The World Cup will also be broadcast over a special VR app, which will allow people to watch the game inside a virtual room on a huge, virtual television, the BBC announced.“The BBC has brought major live broadcasting breakthroughs to UK audiences throughout the history of the World Cup,” said\u0026nbspMatthew Postgate, BBC chief\u0026nbsptechnology and product officer.“From the very first tournament on TV in 1954 and England’s finest hour in 1966, to the first colour World Cup in 1970 and full HD in 2006. Now, with these trials we’re giving audiences yet another taste of the future.”In the UK, the rights to broadcast games are split between ITV and the BBC and the final is shown on both channels. All 33 of the BBC’s matches will be part of the 4K and VR trials.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Legislation is passed down the chain until everyone agrees and it is ratified, often taking many years.The CoR has made no note of how it plans to answer Mr Juncker\u0026rsquos task force\u0026rsquos objectives, but details are expected to be published in July.

The European Parliament refused to be part of the Commission-led group.The Conference of Presidents \u0026ldquodecided unanimously to decline the invitation to participate in the task force, according to minutes of a meeting held between representatives of all eight political groups.A spokesman for the liberal Aide group said it was MEPs job to scrutinise how the Commission shapes the European Union and not be involved at the inception of regulation.Jeroen Reijnen said: \u0026ldquoIt is the job of the European Parliament to assess the proposals of the Commission once they are released."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/nintchdbpict000278857477.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"national living wage uk 2018 increase minimum wage 16 18 25 year old","story":"But the amount is still below the Real Living Wage, a voluntary scheme to which thousands of employers including retailers, local authorities and charities have got involved.The National Living Wage is the amount of money all employees aged over 25 are legally entitled to.It used to be known as the National Minimum Wage, but it was re-branded in 2016.The National Living Wage increased from £7.50 to £7.83 for those aged 25 and over.The 33 pence-an-hour rise was introduced on Sunday April 1, 2018.The compulsory National Living Wage was introduced in 2016.The first National Minimum Wage was set in 1998 by the Labour government.Mr Hammond is aiming to get the wage to £9 by 2020.The National Minimum Wage is the amount which workers aged under 25, but of school-leaving age, are entitled to.However, the amount differs depending on age and whether the worker is on an apprenticeship scheme.Workers aged 21-24 were paid £7.05 - and it went up to £7.38 from April 1, 2018.The wage increased from £5.60 to £5.90 for 18 to 20-year-olds, and from £4.05 to £4.20 for under 18s.However, apprentices were only entitled to £3.50 if they are under-19 - this increased to £3.70 from April 1, 2018.In April 2018, the minimum wage for 25-year-olds rose from £7.50 to £7.83 an hour.The national limits are legally binding.Anyone who thinks they are not getting the National Living Wage or National Minimum Wage should complain to their employer in the first instance.If this does not get anywhere, the next step is to take the complaint to HMRC who will investigate.Those who are self-employed, voluntary workers, company directors and family members who live in the home of the employer and do household chores do not qualify for either rate.There is no difference in pay for those that live in London compared to elsewhere.The only discrepancy is for people working in agriculture or horticulture.Workers already employed before October 1, 2013 are entitled to the pay set under their contract of employment.This is a voluntary scheme aiming to recognise the actual cost of living, to which 3,000 employers have signed up.Under it, the lowest rate of pay is calculated according to the cost of living in the UK based on the changing cost of a basket of groceries.The amount is set by the charity Living Wage Foundation, and accredited employers include local authorities, NHS trusts, banks, retailers, charities and construction companies.The foundations calculations put the real Living Wage at £8.75 an hour - and £10.20 in London.These rates also apply to over-18s in recognition that young people face the same living costs as everyone else.And while companies are not legally entitled to pay more than the National Living and Minimum Wages, those which have signed up to the real Living Wage scheme have pledged to pay all workers those rates.The rate is calculated every November, and accredited employers are committed to any increases.While theres no legal obligation for your employer to pay you more than the National Living Wage (£7.50 from April 1, 2017), if your company is accredited by the Living Wage Foundation you should be receiving more than that.The foundations head of partnerships Graham Griffiths said anyone concerned can use their online whistleblowing service, and any employer not adhering to the Real Living Wage faced losing its accreditation.Graham said one area where it was challenging to pay the living wage were retail and hospitality but pointed to Ikea, Aldi and Lidl, which have agreed to pay the same rate.The scheme was launched in 2001 by parents in East London, and the foundation was set up in 2011.In 2005 following a growing interest from employers, the Greater London Authority established the Living Wage Unit to calculate what the lowest pay should ideally be.In 2008 Trust for London selected the scheme as a special initiative and made a grant of more than £1million to campaign for it and set up an accreditation scheme for employers.In April 2016 it became the inspiration for the governments higher minimum wage rate, which it rebranded the National Living Wage.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Effing and jeffing, he sped off.After managing to hail down an approaching car, Scott blurted “Jeremy Thorpe” to the driver.A police investigation lead to a trial in the Old Bailey with the Liberal leader accused of conspiracy to murder along with three other men. But the jury did not feel convinced that Thorpe, a man of hitherto unblemished reputation and a national figure with a very distinguished public record could be capable of the crime. And he was acquitted along with the others.But Scott maintains Thorpe wanted him dead and said he only felt safe when the politician died in 2014.His younger self has been played by actor Ben Wishaw in the new BBC drama starring Hugh Grant called Very English Scandal."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000404427254.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"stephen lawrence friend duwayne brooks tories mayor of london sadiq khan","story":"Speaking exclusively to The Sun, gang crime campaigner Duwayne Brooks branded Labours Sadiq Khan “the worst Mayor ever” as he revealed he has joined Theresa May’s party.He said: “I’ve made the decision to join the party in Government - because I want to be able give young black men a voice, across not just London but across the country.”Mr Brooks, who was with the slain teen when he was stabbed by racist thugs in 1993, last night slammed Labour for letting black community down with “poor houses, poor education and high crime”.And he urged Mr Khan to get a grip on rising violence in the capital or quit.Mr Brooks was waiting at the bus stop in Eltham with 18-year-old Stephen when the pair were brutally set upon in an unprovoked attack in 1993.He previously served as a Liberal Democrat councillor in Lewisham, South-East London and stood as an independent candidate in last month’s local elections.He was awarded an OBE in 2015 for his campaigning work.Now senior Tories believe he could be their man to run for City Hall in 2020.One London Conservatives source said: He would be a brilliant candidate to take on Londons failing Mayor.Yesterday Mr Brooks blasted incumbent Sadiq Khan over the politan Police’s controversial “Gang Violence Matrix” that a recent report found to be racially discriminatory.The police database holds information on thousands of people deemed a threat to community safety, but the Met have admitted 1,500 names on the list posed no threat to the public.Taking aim at the Labour Mayor, Mr Brooks blasted: “I don’t understand nobody has called for his head to roll following the discovery of the Gang Matrix.“It is beyond me that Amber Rudd can be forced to resign on issues that were nothing to do with her, and yet here here we have Sadiq Khan who must have had knowledge that this gang matrix document existed.“And he hasn’t apologised to London, he hasn’t apologised to black Londoners.”He added: “This is why London needs a voice, why young black men need a voice. And Labour isn’t that voice for young black men. I’ve seen it, I’ve experienced it.He added: “Labour failed us, and London predominantly.“Yet we have a Mayor that seems to not recognise that his leadership is part of the problem in London.”Asked if he could run for City Hall himself, Mr Brooks said he was focusing on his community work but did not rule out a bid one day.The Conservative party declined to comment.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The knife is not the crime. Children seldom randomly pick up knives and decide to stab people. In my experience it often starts when the child is young.This spate of killings will pass but for now it affords the attention and opportunity to reflect.Currently, the debate is cyclical and futile. Mayor of London Sadiq Khan says it’s not his fault, he needs more police. The police say we need more of them. The Government says you’ve had more police but it didn’t make a difference. Meanwhile, children are dying on the streets.The search for solutions must stretch beyond the police. Aside from outrage, there needs to be a focus on the causes, as well as the symptoms, of these crimes.This shouldn’t detract from taking knives away from those carrying them, but we can’t ignore the fact that replacing a blade is as simple as going to the kitchen drawer.Those of us who are more able to look at the world through the eyes of young people who carry knives for protection and status get closer to how they think.What we are witnessing is a sophisticated type of group mind. Some of our boys are so mentally zoned into a culture of violence. All of my youths know, directly, someone murdered, or at least seriously injured, on our streets. Some have been involved.How did we get to this place? Slowly. As the influence of parents, pastors and school principals has waned, all our young people speak of a distinct feeling of powerlessness.The tried and traditional levers and sanctions affecting the development of children are not functioning effectively. For too many, the family bond is damaged and so ruptured we overlook its devastating effects. My young people need something to fight, something to believe in. Like everyone else, they want to be someone, and sometimes that means fighting each other.It is a sad day when, for some, employment prospects are more plentiful with local dealers selling weed and crack than the only other job on offer at the local barber’s.Some of the young people I work with speak about the role of their family’s socio-economic status in their life choices. If they’re lucky, they see their parents locked into dead-end, minimum-wage jobs with no security or satisfaction. Knives, they conclude, are a type of urban qualification. As one put it: “Everyone wants to be someone, this is my way.”Digging deeper, I learned that 85 per cent of my students had never patronised a black-owned business in the past five years, aside from a barber shop. Too many of them carry the assumption that blacks are inferior. “This is how it is,” Adamu told me. “Our business is on the road, we are designed for the hustle.”I began this work with an agenda to keep black boys from being arrested in their droves.Sadly, a lot of our kids have ended up in prison, but they started the three-lap race of life two laps behind. For some, it is almost impossible to work through all the scars.For many of our children, entrance to crime and urban violence is connected to a sense of wanting to be accepted and acceptable — violence is currency.Their hope is that they survive long enough to one day grow out of it. The desire to belong is so real that any community, including gangs, will do.The more law enforcement is used, the more of a challenge it becomes. It almost acts as encouragement because it is something else to beat.Drugs are also a way of life. For some it’s about using, for others it’s selling. It’s simply a way to earn money. A visit to our social housing estates will reveal high levels of organisation. Like any business, you have distribution points, a clear marketing strategy and, most of all, plans to deal with the opposition.I also see the age of involvement getting younger and they don’t care if they live or die. In that sense they are like suicide bombers.Recently I was involved in the rehabilitation of two nine-year-old boys. One was tasked with moving weapons from location to location and the other given addresses for drug drops. He would deliver the packages during school lunch breaks in exchange for McDonald’s, KFC and clothes.Children like these do not grow up seeing themselves as having a future in business or leadership. They are crying out for genuine role models. When our young men find more employment opportunities from businessmen than “road men”, real change will begin.Until that time, we need to love these children back to sanity. They are simply not able to make the rational choices our education and social systems demand.We experience a ruling class committed to maintaining the status quo. Talk about social mobility is just air. Our children are left with the crumbs that fall from the master’s table.The Government is afraid of the mob — but in some areas there is little less than anarchy breaking out.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The Government has no credible policy and the whole world knows it.“Whitehall’s real preparations are for the continuation of EU law and the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice.“The State has made no preparations to leave and plans to make no preparations to leave — even after leaving.”Barring a last-minute change of tune, Mrs May is walking into an ambush which will sour relations with Brussels and condemn Britain to a generation of rancorous civil discord.A botched deal will be dressed up in Brussels newspeak as a triumph for all sides.In fact it will almost certainly betray 17.4million British people who explicitly voted OUT in the biggest democratic mandate ever seen in this country.Voters who hoped for clear and unequivocal freedom from EU laws and regulations are unlikely to stay silent for long.They expected Brexit ministers to carve out a prosperous and independent future.Instead, they have watched defeated Remainers mount a ruthless and successful counter-attack.From a position of strength as a major trading nation, Britain has surrendered on all fronts, caved in to Brussels bullies — and handed over a £39BILLION ransom for the privilege.We are likely to remain bound by a version of the EU customs union, the single market and the European Court of Justice for years to come. Meanwhile, mass immigration runs out of control.Perhaps to his own amazement, EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier has succeeded in his aim to make Britain worse off outside.We will not be allowed to flourish as a free-trading sovereign state.Nobody can be more vividly aware of this than Mrs May as she prepares for her looming summit.Yet she has only herself to blame, starting with the catastrophic snap election which destroyed her Commons majority.She needlessly coughed up that £39billion with nothing in return from Brussels and allowed herself to be derailed by phantom threats of IRA violence if the UK establishes any sort of border with Ireland.The sad truth is that Mrs May is not up to the job as Prime Minister at a momentous point in our history.In an age when words really count, we are lumbered with an ultra-cautious leader who cannot think on her feet or speak without notes.At a time when we should all be doing our best to make Brexit work, we have a Prime Minister who would much prefer to Remain.For the moment, Leavers such as Iain Duncan Smith and Jacob Rees-Mogg are pledging their loyalty.But a bad deal would provoke die-hard Tories into the only honourable action they feel they can take — and put her premiership on the line.They already have the votes needed to trigger a leadership contest.They will not support key Commons votes to dilute Brexit, risking Government defeat by an unholy alliance of Labour opportunists, Lib Dem and SNP wreckers and Tory Remainers.A disastrous combination of weak leadership, cack-handed communication and dismal diplomacy has plunged Britain into a needless constitutional crisis.It says something about Mrs May’s position as leader that her strongest card is the prospect of yet another general election — the third in three years.And the nightmare of political throwback Jeremy Corbyn storming the barricades and leading his Marxist extremists to power.[boxout featured-image=6392734]AS PM, Tony Blair insisted 50 per cent of school leavers must go to university.The result was grade inflation across the board and “Ology” graduates struggling to find a decent job.Now his sensible son Euan, 34, is arguing for tailor-made apprenticeships, giving kids a chance to earn while they learn.His views coincide with new Tory policy – T-levels, technical and trade qualifications which fit pupils to the work they want.They can range from plumbers and computer wizards to City bankers.Many will be driving their own car and buying a home by the time pals leave university with mountains of debt.It is the way forward in skill-hungry Britain.[/boxout] Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Some is also done to shut down anything other than the argument that says “It needs more money”, while other bits are there just because TV executives have noticed it’s the NHS’s 70th birthday and think they’d better do something to look caring.Like, for instance, ITV’s A\u0026ampE Live, “from the frontline”, at Leeds General Infirmary.A self-defeating three-day experiment which, on the one hand gleefully promised us all sorts of carnage: “It’s hotting up here.” But on the other was swift to assure viewers they were operating on a time delay in case patients refused filming consent, thereby ruling out most of the drunks and any possibility of a bloke being wheeled into reception with a Hoover attachment up his fundament.I’d avoid describing LGI as the most sedate-looking A\u0026ampE unit in Britain, though, because ITV had attempted to redress the noise balance by having it hosted by human Tannoy system Davina McCall, who lost little time in telling us: “I had to get hypnotised to do this job, can you believe it?”Yeah, I can, actually.“I saw my granny sever her toes with a lawnmower,” she went on to explain, “and it made me squeamish.” If you thought for one minute, however, it sedated her, you either overestimate the powers of hypnotherapy or you haven’t been watching Davina’s career closely enough.The woman was in full Street Mates mode from the moment she clocked a young couple in the waiting room. “Are you going out?” said Davina, without so much as checking their vital signs.“We were on a date . . . our first date.”“AH-MAY-ZING! THIS IS GREAT. And it’s something to talk about when you have children . . . ”Silence. “I took it too far, didn’t I?”You did rather, Davina, though I get the squeamishness thing and actually flinched when she then told us: “A 23-year-old man, Tommy, is being brought in by ambulance after being rear-ended at high speed.”You’d hope Tommy got some of Davina’s meds as well, ’cos a weird thing happened on Wednesday and Thursday’s broadcasts.She actually calmed down a bit. To the extent I finally noticed the staff, who turned out to be naturals in front of a camera, which really shouldn’t have been a surprise given TV’s insatiable appetite for this sort of show.Among other recent TV offerings, we have: A\u0026ampE Live, A\u0026ampE, 24 Hours In A\u0026ampE, The Real A\u0026ampE, Sun Sea \u0026amp A\u0026ampE, A\u0026ampE On The Road.And that’s just the ones with A\u0026ampE in the title.There’s a whole load more with the words ambulance and emergency, which you may also have watched but entirely forgotten.Why?’Cos an actual visit to A\u0026ampE is a real, vivid, frightening, frustrating, disturbing, impressive and unforgettable experience that can leave you weeping with gratitude for the NHS.TV, by contrast, generally offers a dumb, censored, antiseptic, grovelling, uncritical, cult-like, agenda-ridden version, with this sort of dialogue.Davina (to ambulanceman Gavin): “How important is it you get there early.”“The sooner we get there the more chance the patient has of surviving.”“And that’s so important, isn’t it?”Thank you, live TV. Where would we all be without you?Good Morning Britain’s Piers Morgan: “I leave a lot of phones in my bedroom, ’cos you never know when you’re going to get THE call when your manager says, ‘Got it. Prime-time America. You’re back on’.”And it’s go go go with My 600lb Life.NOTE: In order to avoid Britain’s Got Talent Live, I’m heading south of the border, down Mexico way. Column returns in a fortnight.BBC1’s version of the Jeremy Thorpe murder plot saga, A Very English Scandal, is nuts.It’s very entertaining as well, but it is nuts, with CGI badgers running around in episode one and a couple of Yucca plants shoved in some sand dunes to try and make us think North Devon is actually “California,” on Sunday night.The main issue, however, is that A Very English Scandal can’t quite decide if it’s a comedy or not. So it’s deadly serious whenever Thorpe’s commenting on Europe, immigration or gay rights, but pure Carry On when his ex-lover Norman Scott starts having it off in a caravan with the bird out of Torchwood.It’s more than saved, though, by the incredible storyline and performances of the brilliant Alex Jennings, who totally vanishes into the part of Thorpe’s sidekick, Peter Bessell, Patricia Hodge as Ursula Thorpe, and Ben Whishaw, who’s got the most difficult role of all as the insanely irritating Scott, but does it well enough to make me wish he’d been shot on Exmoor rather than his dog.In that sort of company, of course, it was also incredibly brave to give the lead role to Hugh Grant, who never quite convinces me he’s anyone other than Hugh Grant, yet I will say this for a performance that stands out from anything he’s ever done before.He’s wearing a hat.Courtesy of ITV’s Lee Dixon on England’s World Cup goalies: “You’d be down to one goalkeeper and a nervous one.”“You’d be down to one goalkeeper and a Neville Swan.”INCIDENTALLY, who claimed the following, last week: “People always get excited about cockchafers.”EASIEST gig on the soaps?EastEnders’ Big Mo, who’s just set herself up as Walford’s resident psychic and fortune teller.A job with my name on it, frankly, as I wouldn’t need a crystal ball, money or much encouragement to tell the locals: “This old craphole will be locked in an ever more depressing cycle of baby abductions, love triangles, disrupted weddings, head transplants and escaped animals from now until kingdom come. Get the hell out, while you still can.”Walford CID might also want to put me on a profiling retainer as well, given they’re the only people who haven’t noticed that every single street crime, including – surprise, surprise – last week’s stabbings of Keanu and Shakil, has been carried out by a white, working-class male with a bad stage school Cockney accent.I guess Big Mo’s probably safe in the position for the moment, though, as she seems to have foretold the re-appearance of Shane “Alfie” Richie in The Vic, earlier this month.However, at roughly the same time, she also predicted: “Jean (Slater) will get a job with teeth.”This Morning, “Earth Angel” Sarah Rebecca Vine: “I am a spiritual life coach and healer and, I feel, a messenger to wake people up.” Zzzzz.And First Time Mum, Ferne McCann: “The hypnotherapist session definitely calmed me down and emptied my mind.” Of what?The Chase, Bradley Walsh: “On the flag of South Sudan blue represents the waters of what major river?”Bradley Walsh: “What UK Prime Minister read geography at an all- women’s Oxford college?”Jackie: “Tony Blair.”Bradley Walsh: “In a hospital, the H\u0026ampN unit refers to the head and what other part of the body?”Jackie: “Nose.”And Ben Shephard: “In Australia and New Zealand a ‘long black’ is a variety of which hot beverage?”Teri: “Beer.”The BBC’s Friday night schedule offering us two left-wing panel shows (HIGNFY and New World Order), featuring ’s Mona Chalabi, when one was far too many.The A\u0026ampE Live caption writer responsible for the spelling of “interupt”. Channel 4’s Goggleboxers and all the other people who seem to think The Handmaid’s Tale is a documentary.Car Share lacking either the brains or the balls to make a preview copy of its finale available.And Good Morning Britain without that oaf Piers Morgan, on Thursdays and Fridays. An experience which really is as pointless and empty as Tight Fit performing The Lion Sleeps Tonight, without Steve Grant on lead vocals.Brilliant performances from Alex Jennings, Patricia Hodge and Ben Whishaw, as Peter Bessell, Jeremy Thorpe’s mum and Norman Scott, on A Very English Scandal.BBC1’s Motty: The Man Behind The Sheepskin, revealing an even odder character than I was expecting. Dave’s How The Young Ones Changed Comedy (not entirely for the better).And The Chase offering up my favourite quiz show moment of the year, so far.Bradley Walsh: “Which astrologer published a colouring book called The Art Of Astrology?” John: “Galileo.” Bradley: “Russell Grant.”Gareth Bale: “I haven’t seen the goal back yet, I’ve only watched it again now.”Steve McManaman: “It’s a surprise that Bale’s not playing, but it’s not a surprise that he’s on the bench.”And Rio Ferdinand: “Win the Champions League and it’s chance to be forever mortalised.”(Compiled by Graham Wray)THIS week’s winner is Britain’s Best Home Cook’s Mary Berry and Gary Oldman as Dracula.

In the US — officially the world’s fattest nation — that figure is 18.5 per cent.UK stores now stock plus-size clothes for under-tens, with H\u0026ampM becoming the latest chain to sell a “generous fit” range for kids as young as eight.Obesity is predicted to double in the next 25 years — while tens of millions of pounds of taxpayers’ money has already been thrown at the problem.But a simple — and cheap — solution can already be found on the playgrounds and fields of around 6,000 primary schools where more than a million children take part in the Daily Mile.The exercise regime means that at some point in every school day, pupils leave their classroom, still in their uniform, to run, jog or walk for up to 15 minutes.Youngsters can set their own pace and talk to their friends while they go round.Most of the children complete a mile or more in the quarter of an hour.Teachers all over the country have reported how pupils return to the classroom invigorated and eager to learn after doing what is being called “jography”.Last week, Prime Minister Theresa May praised the Daily Mile and called on schools to take it up — but stopped short of saying it should be compulsory.Now, for all our kids’ sakes, The Sun is calling on Education Secretary Damian Hinds to make the Daily Mile mandatory in all primary schools.The idea began six years ago and has been growing steadily. But only now have scientists been able to prove it really does have an effect.Over the course of an academic year, a team of experts from Stirling University compared nearly 400 children, aged four to 11, from two primaries, with one group doing the Daily Mile and the other not.The Daily Mile kids were put through a series of tests to calculate whether they became fitter and whether they lost fat.IF you are a teacher or parent who would like to get your school doing the Daily Mile check out thedailymile or go to @_thedailymile or on Facebook. There is lots of information showing how easy it is to incorporate the Daily Mile and to support schools who want to get involved. You can also register your interest.The findings, which have just been released, show how they lost an average of four per cent body fat.They were also fitter and more active during the day, while time spent sitting around dropped by an average 18 per cent.Another investigation, conducted at an inner city school in London, found Daily Mile youngsters did much better than expected in SATS tests.Other tests have shown how children also feel less stressed and more confident.Retired head Elaine Wyllie, 62, came up with the idea of the Daily Mile almost by accident when pupils at her St Ninians school in Stirling wanted to get fitter.After just six weeks, not one of the 57 children in her first year was overweight.But to persuade the Government to introduce the Daily Mile into all Britain’s 20,000 primary schools, scientific proof was needed.After reading the latest results from Stirling University, Elaine said: “I knew this research would be the game-changer which would prove what I had believed all along — that the Daily Mile makes children fitter, happier, more active and a healthier weight.“I am delighted and relieved that we now have objective proof.”But education chiefs appear reluctant to make the Daily Mile compulsory for fear of upsetting head teachers, who might see it as an extra burden on their staff.However, Jim Cleaver, head of Westgate Community Primary in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, says: “The beauty of the Daily Mile is its simplicity.“It takes 15 minutes out of the day and for staff it is as easy as opening a door.”At Woodlands, a school for children with special needs in Leatherhead, Surrey, lead nurse Emma Packham has seen children lose weight as a result of the Daily Mile.She says: “We had five children who were clinically obese whose weight was just going up, up, up.“Since we started 18 months ago nobody in the target group has gained weight. Some have lost weight.No other factors in their lives have changed.”It is not just the children’s weight that is changing. Teachers are reporting that behaviour in classroom is improving. And many parents say their children sleep better at night.Former MP Andy Burnham, now the Mayor of Manchester, is a fan and wants his city to become the first where every primary school does the Daily Mile.Unlike some schemes, there would be no costs with introducing it into schools. All associated expenses are currently being paid by Britain’s richest man, Jim Ratcliffe, who has also used some of his £21billion fortune to advertise it during Ant \u0026amp Dec’s Saturday Night Takeaway.Sports commentator Jake Humphrey, who runs the Daily Mile with youngsters at Trowse primary school in Norwich, says: “I honestly don’t think parents are aware of how unfit their children are. Why weren’t we doing this 20 years ago?”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

That readiness is absolutely vital to securing a genuinely beneficial deal.We know that Civil Service mandarins want Brexit to fail.They’ve set up roadblock after roadblock in the hope we’ll be forced to cave in and change our minds on the whole exercise.That cannot be allowed to happen.Jacob Rees-Mogg is spot on when he says the PM needs to show some iron, and that Brussels won’t get the money they desperately need unless they play ball with Britain. It’s the only way we’ll focus minds across Europe.Without a plan, we’re only planning to fail.THE calls for abortion reform in Northern Ireland are entirely understandable.It looks increasingly odd that its laws are so out of step with both the rest of the UK and now with their southern neighbour.But Ulster’s abortion laws have always been a matter for the people of Northern Ireland.For devolution to work, Westminster needs to acknowledge the right of the Scots, the Welsh and the Northern Irish to set their own rules.It’s not a pick ’n’ mix depending whether or not MPs agree with them.And the way some Labour politicians have suddenly become dedicated activists to drive a wedge between the PM and the DUP is shameless.The Government’s priority in Northern Ireland must be to restore a functioning Assembly, which has been missing for more than 500 days. Then the province can have an abortion debate.But it is for Ulster, not Westminster, to make any decisions.KYLIE Minogue has had us Spinning Around for decades. We wish the Red Blooded Woman a very happy birthday.If only we could all be So Lucky to look that good at 50.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Some Italians told me unelected bankers and institutions in Brussels were being put first. They have a point.The EU and Italy’s President now need to tread incredibly carefully. The 5-Star Movement is already mobilising voters through street protests. The League party is calling on them to vent their frustration at the banks and financial markets.Yesterday, one EU official suggested the financial markets would teach Italian voters a lesson by withdrawing investment from the country. This will only pour gasoline on the populist fire.So, what happens next? The populists will almost certainly sweep to another victory at fresh elections, possibly triggering a new financial crisis and creating another major headache in Brussels. One of the parties might also propose a referendum on Italy’s euro membership.It seems very likely this chaos is not going anywhere anytime soon and the EU will soon be presented with yet another crisis.The events in Italy have clear implications for the Brexit debate. The EU has struggled to make sense of why Leavers opted for Brexit, just as today they are struggling to make sense of the mood in Italy.Many Leavers voted for Brexit because they felt the EU was not able to manage its own affairs, and they will see Italy as further evidence of that.But also many Leavers were anxious that the European Union allows very little room for other political views and they will see that as well in the Italy crisis.While the president was acting in the remit of his constitutional office, the problem is that many Italians and Europeans feel this is an example of Europe’s inability to accept any opposition to the euro single currency.It seems difficult to see how this crisis can be resolved without a more openly Eurosceptic Italy — and without a populist government at the head of the eurozone’s third largest economy.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Its lavishly-funded Remainer stooges aim to do the same with Brexit.How does Brussels think this all ends?If Brexit is negated there will be a collapse of faith in democracy and probable civil unrest beyond anyone’s experience.In Italy, eurosceptic parties will now have an even bigger mandate. What then?The EU meets any dissent not with wise compromise but with brute force.It is the enemy of democracy. Its contempt for voters will prove its epitaph.WE like Theresa May’s tougher tone towards the EU. But it’s action that counts.If she’s serious about withholding our £39billion divorce payment until a trade deal is signed, great. But last we heard she was relying on “good faith” from Brussels which does not exist.The PM must not issue empty threats. Nor pay a penny without a guaranteed return.LIKE it or not, Brexit day next March will be a historic moment.A new series of commemorative coins is a great idea the Treasury seems to back. Which makes it even more illogical not to print Brexit stamps too.Logic, though, doesn’t cut it at the Royal Mail. Only its Remoaner chiefs’ prejudices.THE usual Sun-hating nitwit celebs and gormless keyboard warriors piled into us over Raheem Sterling’s tattoo.Some, laughably, screamed “racism”. As if we wouldn’t put a white England star with a freshly-inked M16 on the front page (we would).Others whinged we had undermined the nation’s World Cup hopes. As if the squad’s mental fortitude is that fragile.No one supports England teams more vocally than The Sun. But are we supposed to censor or bury a controversial picture a footballer has already posted to 3.6million Instagram followers?Or ignore a tattoo which, with gang violence rife, outrages anti-gun campaigners? And is Damilola’s dad “unpatriotic” in urging Sterling to apologise?Sterling is a great talent.

She feared she would die.Her ex Michael Goodwin, 30, has now been jailed for four years and three months.Martha has courageously spoken out about her ordeal to help raise awareness of domestic violence.She and builder Goodwin had been together 18 months but she grew sick of his ­abusive behaviour.He locked her in his flat in Tooting, South London, after finding a text from her pal urging her to leave him.She told The Sun: “When he saw the text message he was livid. I was terrified so I tried to get my things and go.He told me I couldnt leave and locked both the doors.I went to the window to see if I could jump out safely but suddenly I felt an excruciating pain and remember nothing else.”When she regained consciousness, she was in agony and could hardly move. Goodwin, seen posing with a gun against his head in an online pic, was still in the flat so Martha took the selfie.She added: I woke up in bed. I knew he must have put me there but I couldnt move. I couldnt feel my legs and I had the most painful headache.I couldnt lift my head up at all. My eye wouldnt open and my face felt thick with dry blood.Martha said she had decided to take a selfie to see the damage to her face.She said: I wanted to see what was wrong with me. I was horrified at what I saw.I sent the picture to my friend so that she would get help. It was only afterwards that I realised he had kicked me in the head.My friend told my parents straight away, and my dad, who doesnt speak very good English, went to the police station with the text.I could have died if left without medical attention for much longer.”Cops began hunting Goodwin, who had left the flat by then.He returned and took Martha, also from South London, to hospital. He ordered her to say she fell down stairs but she later told cops what happened.And the selfie helped convict the thug at Kingston crown court.He was found guilty of ABH, assault by beating and breaching a restraining order.Martha now hopes her story will help other women come forward.She said: After the attack people would say to me hes an animal - but he is not, he is a monster.No matter how educated you are no matter how strong you look it can happen to anyone.I thought because Im smart, have a degree, am independent and see myself as a feminist that I would be able to see it happening.But domestic violence does not chose someone based on those things.Sian Hawkins of Women’s Aid said Martha was “incredibly brave” to speak out. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The number of Brits talking part in industrial action has also fallen to a record low of just 33,000.Both figures are the lowest since figures have existed, in 1891. Just 276,000 working days were lost in 2017 due to industrial disputes, compared to 162 million during the general strike in 1926, 29.5 million in the 1978/79 winter of discontent, and 27.1 million in 1984, the year of the miners’ strike.Railway disputes dominated the strikes, accounting for more than two thirds of all working days lost, along with the storage sector.Meanwhile, the firebrand union that lead much of the action that plunged commuters into misery, the RMT, yesterday announced it will “align” itself to Labour.While it is stopping short of full affiliation with Jeremy Corbyn’s party, its 80,000 members will now be encouraged to be active in it. Conservative Party Chairman Brandon Lewis said: “The hard-left takeover of Labour continues with the militant RMT union realigning to Labour.“Not content with causing misery for millions of commuters, the RMT are now turning their attention to ousting the last-remaining moderates in Labour.”The strikes figures were revealed in a study by the Office of National Statistics. ONS Senior Statistician David Freeman said: “While the number of days lost wasn’t quite a record low, it has significantly reduced since the early 1990s.“This is a stark contrast to the levels seen when the miners went on strike in the 1970s and 1980s, and the even greater levels of industrial action in the 1910s and 1920s.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It will mean that I wont be able to go to school, go to work or go out with my family.But I wont take my niqab off so I have to find another solution.Pape Poulsen, who leads the conservative party in the coalition, has described keeping ones face hidden in public as incompatible with the values of Danish society or respect for the community.But Ibn Hssain rejected suggestions that wearing the veil symbolised the rejection of Danish values or oppression of women.She said: It has nothing to do with integration or that were oppressed. For me it is a war on Islam.Human rights group Amnesty International called the ban a discriminatory violation of womens rights ... All women should be free to dress as they please and to wear clothing that expresses their identity or beliefs.Ibn Hssain, who says she has been yelled at and spat at in public for wearing the niqab, will stay for now in Denmark despite the ban.She said: If I leave Denmark the politicians win.

Doris the dachshund has a rare condition that means she cannot keep her food down and would starve to death without help. The pooch looks the picture of health in footage of her being fed by owner Sarah Buck - but this wasn\u0027t always the case. At one point the poor pup was half her breed\u0027s normal weight and looked like a bag of skin and bones due to her condition. Sarah found the solution in the high chair and trained her to sit in it on command for liquidised meals.  Doris suffers from Megaesophagus, which means her esophagus is enlarged and makes it impossible for her to hold down food. But her Bailey Chair, a canine version of a child\u0027s high chair, forces her to eat in an upright position, and to remain upright for up to 25 minutes afterwards. Sarah, from Middlesbrough, shared a clip of Doris’ feeding time routine on Facebook with the caption: “What life is like living with a pup called Doris who has Megaesophagus.” The clip begins with Sarah rapping a spoon on Doris’ dinner bowl, and says: “Right, dinner time with Doris.”  The tiny dachshund can be seen excitedly running towards a her specialised ‘Bailey Chair’, surrounded by plenty of toys, in the corner of the room. Doris starts to get herself into the seat, by reversing, and waits expectantly for Sarah to give her dinner. Sarah can then be heard saying, “In properly, no cheating!” and the pup responds by reversing herself fully back into the seat - which has a plaque reading “Dinner with Doris” above her head. Sarah then begins to spoon feed Doris her specially liquidised food, and the pup gobbles it up. The 10-month-old pup has to keep her head up to stop her from regurgitating her food, so Sarah has to keep clicking her fingers and trying to keep her head up.  The pup listens and clearly trusts Sarah as she lifts her head back up every time she is told to. As the clip ends, Sarah has to almost wrench the spoon from Doris’ mouth as she finishes feeding her. Scores of social media users were quick to comment under the clip. Sara Freeman said: “So cute. I’m sorry she has this but I love how she goes and sits in her chair - a real help for others to see I think too!”  Jessica Auty added: “This video just melted my heart. What an angel.” Jo Howe commented: “So much love for this story, she has a wonderful temperament and obviously so much trust and a great attitude. Nothing is going to get in the way of this little ones food, nothing. Teamwork at its best.” Denise Rothery wrote: “How touching. Doris you have made me feel a little teary, as you are just so beautiful getting into your feeding chair.” While Laura May said: “Oh my gosh she is amazing and so clever.” Speaking today, Sarah said: “Doris is a clever little pup and we’ve had a long hard journey to maintain some health and weight on her finally.

The driver wouldn\u0027t even give his \u0026pound1 back when my son asked for it. If he gets the bus I always meet him a few stops down on Mansfield Road when he gets off. But he never got off the bus and I was waiting for him until 5pm when he walked down the road.  I was so upset when he walked down towards me, he said he had never felt so embarrassed and he was made to feel really small. I can\u0027t believe he was made to walk, all for the sake of 10 pence, if it was the bus drivers child I am sure he would not have made him walk or left him at the stop.

Samantha Markle has branded the 35-year-old\u0027s 13-month jail sentence for contempt of court \u0027ridiculous\u0027. On Friday Robinson, real name Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, was jailed for contempt of court after he filmed outside an ongoing court case at Leeds Crown Court. He was under a suspended sentence for the same offence at the time.  A petition has been set up to \u0027free\u0027 right-wing Robinson, who now considers himself a journalist, and Samantha Markle shared it to her more than 5,000 Twitter followers.   Far right activists in American have leaped to Tommy\u0027s defence and say that reporting restrictions - put in place to ensure those on trial receive a fair hearing - are tantamount to a \u0027gag order\u0027. Conspiracy theorists think Tommy was imprisoned as part of a plot to silence the far right. The EDL founder was arrested by police outside court and taken to court where he pleaded guilty to contempt of court and breaching his suspended sentence before being blasted by Judge Geoffrey Mason QC for his highly prejudicial actions. Robinson now has support from a relative of the royal family but Samantha has been slammed for her view. One said: Maybe you should pay attention to the mess in your country before you trying to change another country you have no deep understanding of or even live in.

Laura Bentley said she choked on her tea when she learned the pink plastic vibrator was used to keep the bassinet gently shaking. Her partner Ben had devised the innovative method to help 10-week-old daughter Lucie sleep.  The Aussie mum-of-four, from the Gold Coast, Queensland, left the internet in hysterics with a viral image of the infant slumbering soundly next to the vibrator.   But the 33-year-old admitted she has since been flooded with messages from other sleep-deprived new mums desperate to try the trick for themselves. Laura, who has her own business with Brad, 34, alongside running Instagram blog Attempting to Mum, said: “Lucie is baby number four so we are used to it by now, but she does not do very well at day sleeps. “We’ve found to put her down, we have to literally stand behind her rocking the bassinet to replicate the movement of the car. “On Monday, I was at the gym and Brad got done with spending 20 minutes rocking the bassinet, so he decided force the process and thought ‘what can I use to make the vibrations’.  “He had to go digging for it, I had no idea where it was because we’ve just had a baby! “I came home, and he just said ‘I used the vibrator to get the baby to sleep’. “The thing is, it sent her to sleep straight away! It’s amazing and works so well. “It’s now more inconspicuously hidden in the bassinet, but we’re still using it.” Laura, who is also mum to Will, 10, four-year-old Indie and Zahli, two, said she was momentarily concerned keyboard warriors wouldn’t see the funny side of her post. But the blogger, who has 10,000 Instagram followers, said other parenting blogs also credit vibrators with helping keep their little ones slumbering soundly.

Ella Jansen had the mirene coil removed after her dentist linked the two, but her teeth are still getting worse. The 29-year-old has now been diagnosed with gum disease and has been told she will probably lose all her teeth in her 30s. Ella, who lives in Solihull in the West Midlands, was on her way to a modelling career when her teeth started to change and she claims it has ruined her life.  She claims she had no idea the coil could do this, and now wants to raise awareness for other woman. She said: It\u0027s absolutely ruined my life – I was getting into modelling before I got the coil and I had a few photoshoots. It all seemed to be going so well, but now I can’t even smile properly – I don’t want people to see my teeth because they look so bad. I really want to raise awareness about the issues that can come along with the mirena coil – I don’t want any other girls to have to go through what I went through.  No one mentioned this was a risk when I got the coil and it’s had such a massive impact on my life. After getting the coil in 2013 when she was 24 , Ella began to notice that her gums started to swell and noticed gaps forming between her teeth. Her dentist diagnosed her with gingivitis - gum disease which is linked to bad hygiene.  Ella was very strict with her dental hygiene so was shocked by the discovery. She has claimed that the dentist told her it was caused by a hormonal imbalance from the mirena coil. But despite her concerns and numerous medical issues, Ella says nurses were reluctant to take it out and she was stuck with it for almost two years.  Elle said: I had no idea that the mirena coil could cause my teeth to go rotten, it was a huge shock when my dentist linked the two. She began to also experience leg pain and found herself unable to walk for any longer than a mile before her left leg would give up. Ella added: My left leg would just give way and later on I found out that that can happen when the coil is fitted incorrectly. I was dealing with so many side-effects, but I just couldn\u0027t get my nurse to take it out – she said she was worried I would get pregnant. My teeth eventually got worse and it became full blown periodontal disease – which is gum disease.  It\u0027s incredibly painful – my gums are constantly swollen and bright red, and they bleed often - my teeth are now wonky and sometimes overlap. My gums got infected and the dentist had to make my gums bleed to get the infection out by scraping the gums. I\u0027ve always taken good care of my teeth and had a good diet and exercise. Ella is extremely embarrassed by how her teeth look now and doesn\u0027t like people seeing them. She said: I struggled to get the coil taken out, but it was finally removed in 2015 and my symptoms started to balance out again, but my teeth just got worse and worse. The dentist said that I’ll have lost 11 of my teeth by the time I’m 35 - when he said that I won’t lie, I did cry for days.

Katrina Holmes, 34, was sexually abused by her babysitter, Deborah Evans, in the late 1990s after the woman became close with her family and gained her father\u0027s trust. In secret diaries, the then 15-year-old kept detailed how Evans, 27, groomed her and forced her to perform repulsive acts. Two decades later the entries helped convict Evans, now in her 40s, who has been sentenced to seven years jail. The pair first met when Katrina was seven years old and Evans was aged 19. Evans would babysit Katrina while her father was at the pub.  Katrina, from Cardiff, told Wales Online: “I really liked her – she always had a can of lager in her hand and would get pretty tipsy. “But she was mischievous and fun. My own mum lived hundreds of miles away so I really looked up to Deborah and felt safe with her.” Evans became a family friend, but her attitude towards Katrina changed after the girl turned 15, leading to the woman making a pass at the teenager during a sleepover. Katrina said: “She stayed over our house in my bedroom – with two single beds.  “She said ‘kiss me’. I remember her opening her mouth as her lips tried to close onto mine. “I froze and pulled away from her. ‘What are you doing?’ I said, trying to laugh it off. “She was 27 and I was 15. I wanted her to care about me but I felt more afraid than safe when she was around. “I wanted us to be close – more like a parental figure – not in this way.”  Evans became “controlling and bossy” and even called Katrina’s school to say if there were any problems they were to call her. But things escalated even further when Evans began forcing the girl to take part in sex games at her flat. Katrina said: “One evening when she stayed over at dad’s house she tried to make me perform a sex act on her. It was repulsive. “I said ‘I don’t want to’. But she carried on and ignored me. I felt powerless and afraid. Maybe I wasn’t a tiny child but she had so much control over me.  “Inside I was crying – this woman who I looked up to and loved was now abusing me. She seemed to get a thrill out of the fantasy of being caught. “One morning I was ironing my school uniform and Deborah walked into the room. She said to me ‘You are gay’. But I answered ‘I’m not gay’. “She gripped me hard. ‘You are gay and you will always be gay’, she said aggressively.” The abuse, which went on for five months, was eventually reported to police 12 years later, with Katrina using diary entries she made as a girl as evidence.  Evans, who at the time owned catering firm Cardiff Cuisine Catering with her girlfriend, was charged with 11 counts of indecent assault. She denied the attacks ever took place during a trial at Cardiff Crown Court in February this year but was eventually found guilty and jailed for seven years. Katrina, who gave evidence in court and has bravely waived her legal right to anonymity, said: “I looked over at her to gauge her reaction but there was none. She showed no emotion. “It took me 12 years to speak because I blamed myself for so many years. But when I got to 27 myself I realised what she had done was very wrong.

Kaylee Muthart said she took a hit of laced methamphetamine without knowing in February which left her in a drug-induced psychosis. Under a state of hallucination she found herself in, she gouged her own eyes out using her hands and permanently blinded herself. The incident happened outside a church in Anderson, South Carolina, US and was just days before she intended to go to a drug rehabilitation unit, according to reports.  Kaylee had to have emergency surgery to clean her empty sockets and spent weeks recovering, which included time at a psychiatric unit.  But since the beginning of March she has been allowed back to her mum\u0027s house and is on the road to recovery.  She has stayed clean of illicit drugs and is beginning to adapt to her life without her sight. Kaylee said she felt like she was back to herself, and revealed she likes sleeping because dreaming gives her the illusion that she can see something.  She told People : “My dreams are colorful, and it’s like being able to see again - I like sleeping a lot because it’s like I can see.”   Kaylee has bravely taken part in mobility and orientation training and is trying to be optimistic. But she admitted there are times when she feels frustrated and sad about the new reality of her life. She uses Netflix by selecting its audio description option and has spent time playing the guitar and the piano. In July, she is set to have an operation to her orbital cavities that will prepare her to be able to get prosthetic eyes in the future.

A local paper reported several tourists had been hurt in the mass punch-up in the party resort’s raucous strip of bars and nightclubs.  The violent altercation happened outside a tattoo parlour at roughly 5.30am today.  Footage published by island newspaper Ultima Hora showed a bare chested youngster - also thought to be British - exchanging blows with another man after landing the first punch before he ended up on the ground.  He had to be held back by other revellers as he tried to continue the fight in confusing scenes filmed by a witness on a mobile phone and watched by scores of other youngsters including some who appeared to be encouraging the two men. Seconds later another fight thought to be linked to the first incident kicked off a few feet away. A woman - whose condition was not known this afternoon - was picked up and taken to the side of the road so she could receive first aid. A female partygoer could be overheard yelling “she’s out” - before adding “she’s knocked out stone cold” - as worried pals and onlookers gathered round her. Another man could be heard repeating over and over in English: “Two people, two people, stand back”  It was not immediately clear how the unnamed woman tourist had been hurt. She is thought to have been with one of the groups involved in the fighting. There was no obvious police presence and Ultima Hora reported local security guards had stepped in to separate the warring holidaymakers. Civil Guard officers were not available at lunchtime today to comment on the number of injured and say whether anyone had been arrested.

A majority of lawmakers voted in favour of the ban as Muslim women wearing conservative religious clothing looked on. The law was proposed by the centre-right government which argued face veils were contrary to Danish values - but it insists the ban doesn\u0027t target religious groups. First-time offenders of the so-called burqa ban - which goes into effect on August 1 - will be fined 1,000 Danish crowns (about \u0026pound115). The fine increases to 10,000 crowns (\u0026pound11,500) after a fourth violation.  Denmark is the fifth European country to pass a complete \u0027burqa ban\u0027 in public, joining Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria and France, which in 2001 became the first to do so. Denmark\u0027s law also applies to face coverings such as false beards and masks. It is estimated that only about 200 women in Denmark wear the niqab or burqa. The niqab is a veil that covers a woman\u0027s entire face except the eyes, while the one-piece burqa, which covers a woman\u0027s body and entire face, has a transparent veil.  Human rights group Amnesty International called the ban a discriminatory violation of women\u0027s rights. An earlier proposal that allowed prison sentences as punishment had been previously removed. The Danish People’s Party failed in its attempt this week to amend the legislation to include prison sentences for offenders. Other European countries or individual regions have full or partial bans.  In the Netherlands, face veils are banned in some public places, including schools, hospitals and public transport. A similar law is in effect in the German state of Bavaria. The Swiss canton of Tessin has outlawed the religious clothing entirely in public. Danish lawmakers voted 75-30 on Thursday to pass the legislation proposed by the country\u0027s three-party centre-right coalition -  The Liberal, Conservative and Danish People’s parties all voted in favour of the law, along with the opposition Social Democrats except for one lone MP, Mette Gjerskov, The Local reported.

The youngsters often jumped into her bed in the middle of the night. And when they didn\u0027t, they would leap into each other\u0027s beds. So when they came into Vanessa\u0027s room, crying, and climbed into bed with her eight years ago today, she comforted them with cuddles. They all then drifted back off to sleep. But heartbreakingly, Chase and Tyler never woke up. Their mum, 37, did awake - but felt agonising pain and experienced every parent\u0027s worst nightmare as she looked across at her sons. I saw my children lying on my bed and knew something was terribly wrong, Vanessa, from Victoria, Australia, told .  Confused and barely able to move, she managed to call an ambulance and her ex-husband before paramedics attended the scene. It was only later, while in hospital, that she found out Chase and Tyler had died from accidental carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning. A gas heater in another room of her rental house had leaked the colourless and odourless gas, which she and the boys had inhaled. While her sons lost their lives, Vanessa suffered acute CO poisoning and rhabdomyolysis, where damaged skeletal muscle breaks down. She also had hypoxia and a dislocated shoulder. They say that this was due to lying on the arm for so long being unconscious, she told us. Now, exactly eight years on from the tragedy on May 30, 2010, the brave mum is fighting to raise vital awareness of accidental CO poisoning. She has set up The Chase and Tyler Foundation , an independent charitable organisation that works to prevent such poisoning.  The accident still feels like yesterday to me, she said. After the accident, people would say things to me and not realise their words were insensitive, such as \u0027You can have more children\u0027, \u0027At least they went quietly\u0027, \u0027They are with God now\u0027... People don’t know what to say and they also want to see people fixed straight away and not suffering. As a bereaved parent, you are never fixed and there is no such thing as closure or moving on. Little Chase and Tyler, who adored each other, enjoyed football, riding mini motorbikes, playing on scooters and watching TV. They were pretty cheeky boys who were always together and typically like boys, always fighting between each other, said Vanessa. She added: Tyler was a little shier than Chase and he adored his older brother when Chase wasn’t tormenting him.  The day before the boys\u0027 deaths, Vanessa believes they were all watching films together - although she struggles to remember. I have memory problems from the accident, she explained. It was in the early hours of the next day that Chase and Tyler climbed into her bed, in tears, before they all fell asleep together. Chase and Tyler were always jumping into my bed. If they weren’t in my bed, they were always jumping in each other’s beds, she said. I can’t remember what I said to Chase and Tyler. I just know they climbed into my bed as they were crying - obviously due to the CO poisoning - and that we were all together and went back to sleep. They never woke up. Vanessa found out her beautiful sons had passed away while in hospital. I didn’t really know until after I woke up in hospital, she said. I don’t know if anyone told me prior to this, but due to the acute CO poisoning, I was not in a position to comprehend.  She added: I was hospitalised for a month and a half and then had a long time recovering from my injuries. I struggled to walk initially and couldn’t use my left arm or hand for quite some time... I needed help to dress me. The long-term damage is memory damage due to hypoxia and severe nerve damage to my left shoulder, arm and hand. I take a fair bit of painkillers every day. The emotional scars are the worst wounds of all, which will never heal. When she was eventually discharged from hospital, Vanessa, who works in medical administration, moved in with her mum. I had no home, my children were dead, and I couldn’t look after myself due to my injuries, so I had to move into my mother’s home, she said. I was heavily sedated due to the physical injuries, as well as suffering post traumatic shock which was a blessing in disguise. If I had to face my new reality with full comprehension - which took over a year if not more - I feel I could not have survived.  She added that there wasn\u0027t a carbon monoxide alarm fitted at her home in Mooroopna, north of Melbourne, when the leak happened. The only time I had ever heard of carbon monoxide poisoning was via movies when people died from intentional exposure within their vehicles, she said. She had no idea that people like her sons could suffer carbon monoxide poisoning from their gas or fuel burning appliances. Determined to save the lives of others, Vanessa set up The Chase and Tyler Foundation and Carbon Monoxide Awareness Week. She also began lobbying Australian parliament for mandatory gas appliance servicing and CO alarms, and publicly campaigning. I knew that if I didn’t do anything, this prevalent issue within our community would soon become old news and nothing would change, and more people would die, she said. I couldn’t let that happen.

This surprising discovery was made by images captured by NASA \u0027s New Horizons spacecraft which flew past Pluto in July 2015.  Experts said the likely source of the dune grains is methane ice blown from nearby mountains. Despite its low atmosphere, moderate surface thermal winds of between 30 and 40 kmh had sufficient force to shift the solid grains of frozen gas into tell-tale ridges with a stripped effect. Until now it had been a mystery how the dunes formed on the planet which has an atmosphere 0.001 per cent as thick as Earth\u0027s - which has dunes of sand. The discovery adds Pluto to a list where dunes are known to form including Earth, Mars, Venus, Titan and Comet 67P.  Dr Matt Telfer, lecturer in physical geography at the University of Plymouth, said: We knew that every solar system body with an atmosphere and a solid rocky surface has dunes on it, but we didn\u0027t know what we\u0027d find on Pluto. It turns out that even though there is so little atmosphere, and the surface temperature is around -230C, we still get dunes forming. Pluto has a low gravity with is a twelfth that of the Earth, sparse atmosphere, extreme cold, and surface composition of Nitrogen gas (N2), carbon monoxide (CO), water (H2O), and methane (CH4) ices. Dr Telfer and colleagues from Germany and the US spotted a collection of 357 pale ridges, as well as six darker wind streaks, located on one of Pluto\u0027s largest features, a vast ice plain called Sputnik Planitia. Along the western area of the plain, the ridges run parallel with a mountain range. But further east, they shift their orientation and become more spread out, a pattern also seen in the wind streaks. Several clues revealed these landforms were created by wind because of the location of the ridges and their distribution patterns. Modelling showed wind can create these dunes once the grains are airborne. However a process called sublimation is required first, to lift the grains from the planet\u0027s surface.  In this process, the sun heats surface ice enough that gas is released into the atmosphere, lofting particles into the air as a result. Dr Eric Parteli, Lecturer in Computational Geosciences at the University of Cologne, said: On Earth, you need a certain strength of wind to release sand particles into the air, but winds that are 20 per cent weaker are then sufficient to maintain transport. The considerably lower gravity of Pluto, and the extremely low atmospheric pressure, means the winds needed to maintain sediment transport can be a hundred times lower. The temperature gradients in the granular ice layer, caused by solar radiation, also play an important role in the onset of the saltation process. Put together, we have found that these combined processes can form dunes under normal, everyday wind conditions on Pluto.

Melissa Matos would get high locked away in her blood-spattered bedroom while her eight-year-old daughter, Katherine, helped her younger sister with her homework before getting her ready for school. Katherine would then go upstairs to bring her \u0027sick\u0027 mum food and drink and rub her head to make her feel better, unbeknown that her mum had been ravaged by opiate abuse for almost a decade. At times Melissa, with scabbed spots covering her face, and black circles under her eyes, would spend days and nights in a self induced coma on the toilet floor. Melissa\u0027s harrowing Facebook post, that she shared with the world in a bid to help others escape from the throes of drug addiction, showed haunting pictures of herself looking like a \u0027dead girl\u0027. Now for the first time Melissa, 40, has given an honest and brave account of how she was brought back from the brink of death by the love of her two children.  Katherine had been forced to become the mummy of the house since the age of six when her mum\u0027s life spiralled out of control after Melissa became hooked on Xanax and heroin after doctors gave her prescription drugs to help with postnatal depression and pregnancy complications. My youngest never really talks about it, Melissa told . She doesn\u0027t really remember anything and it didn\u0027t effect her. She\u0027s just proud of my recovery. But my oldest will talk about how it hurt her because I was always locked away in my room and I ignored her. How it was scary seeing me high. I spent most of my days either high or dopesick. My eldest daughter would bring me food and drinks, rub my head, stay by my side like a mother would when her child was sick. She would watch her little sister, help her with homework, help get her ready for school. All the things a mum would do, that at the time, I was not capable of doing. RELATED: Kids film horrifying moment they find their parents overdosing on drugs       My children were always in my care. They were in the house, playing or sleeping. I always used privately, in my room or bathroom. What I recall the most was my bedroom. My walls had blood splatters from trying to unclog needles. My bed sheets always had blood, and cigarette burn holes from falling asleep after using heroin or xanax. As her addiction took hold, Melissa, from Parkersburg, West Virginia, found herself lying, robbing and stealing to support her habit. Melissa, said: The mixture of all of these drugs would turn me into a zombie. I was careless, irresponsible and cold. I was absent as a mother, a wife, a daughter, a friend. I began to lose everything and everyone. This was just the beginning. My opiate addiction quickly escalated into complete chaos. The pills I was taking were not enough anymore so I started doctor shopping. Eventually, that caught up with me, I was blacklisted...and sick. Withdrawing off of the medications had me ready to kill myself.  Somehow Melissa managed to keep her children from coming into contact with any needles as they would either play alone in the house or sleeping - while she was shooting up in her room. They never found her injecting and the needles were always immediately put in a lock box by my ex, she said. The family home was a shambles - never dirty as she \u0027cannot stand filth\u0027 and the girls - now nine and 11 - constantly missed school and she admits she could barely feed them. I spent every day locked up in my room, shooting heroin and snorting xanax, said Melissa. If crack was around, I smoked it. If pills were around, I snorted them. It didn\u0027t matter. I hated myself, hated my life.  In 2015 Melissa overdosed on her bedroom floor as her children played next door. She was saved by paramedics but when she returned home her children went to stay with her parents as her life continued to spin out of control. The (paramedics) told them mummy had passed out from her anemia, said Melissa. It was one of the lowest moments of my life. Still, I was so sick in my addiction, that didn\u0027t stop me. I got home and shot up the same fentanyl that had just almost taken my life. In the next few months I lost two apartments, and just about all of my possessions.  I had started going to an Intensive Outpatient Program but was still actively using. I used to cheat my urine tests, but one day I went in so high that I didn\u0027t even think about what I was doing. I failed my test. Child Protective Services were called. I was going to lose the only things I had left, the only things I loved. That was the day I found sobriety.  Melissa has now been clean since March 1, 2016, and has turned her life around, now working with Alcoholics Anonymous and as a writer and a public speaker raising awareness of drug addiction. She also works for the Genesis program as a behavioural health technician mothers with addiction problems to get on the road to recovery. I work with women still sick and suffering, as well as women in recovery. I advocate for their rights as mothers as well. The system we have, unfortunately is much better at taking children away and shaming addicts than providing the necessary help and support to keep families together.

The incredible operation took place at the Federal University of Ceara (UFC), Brazil, in April last year but has only just been revealed after it was confirmed as a success. Patient Jucilene Marinho, 23, has now spoken for the first time and talked about how the revolutionary operation using skin of the tilapia fish has changed her life and allowed her to have sex for the first time. The unorthodox treatment, which was led by gynaecologist, Dr Leonardo Bezerra, is faster, cheaper and less aggressive than the conventional method used for sufferers of Mayer-Rokitansky-K\u0026uumlster-Hauser (MRKH). The rare congenital disorder affects approximately one in 5,000 newborn girls and results in the absence of some or all of the female reproductive organs. The revolutionary treatment involves opening a space between the vagina and anus and inserting a tubular mould lined with the skin of the freshwater fish.  Once in contact with the patient’s body, tilapia skin acts like stem cells and is absorbed and transformed into cellular tissue forming the walls of the canal, similar to that of an actual vagina. Before being used, the fish skin undergoes a special cleaning and sterilisation process in the lab followed by irradiation to kill viruses. The process removes all the scales and fish smell and results in a light-coloured gel dressing that can be stored for up to two years in refrigerated sterile packaging. An ecstatic Ms Marinho spoke for the first time to FocusOn News about how the ground-breaking surgery has changed her life and made her feel like ‘a proper woman’ who now enjoys a healthy sex life. The young university student from Lavras da Mangabeira, was diagnosed in her teens with having no cervix, uterus, ovaries or womb.  However, to doctors’ surprise she developed normally throughout puberty and even experienced menstrual cramping pains in her stomach but never had a period. At the age of 15 she was given the crushing news there was nothing but connective tissue behind the skin blocking the opening of her vagina. “I cried a lot when I found out,” she recalled. “I thought my world had ended. I’d always dreamed of having a baby of my own now I had to accept that wouldn’t be possible.”  She spiralled into a deep depression fearing she would never experience an intimate and loving relationship. This worsened when a teenage boyfriend mocked and broke up with her after discovering the disorder. But last year, six months after agreeing to become the first of four women to have the experimental procedure, Ms Marinho had sex for the first time in her life with her partner Marcus Santos, 24, who she has been with for over a year and who has supported her throughout. “I spent three months recuperating from the operation and then doctors gave me the all clear to have sex in October last year,” Ms Marinho revealed happily.  “At first I was very scared to do it because I thought it would hurt and I was worried it might damage the opening. But it was a wonderful moment because everything worked perfectly. There was no pain just a great deal of pleasure and satisfaction. “I didn’t feel any discomfort and there was no bleeding. Everything felt sensitive in what I’m told is the right and normal way. It was perfectly natural like the opening had always been there,” she confided. Dr Bezerra, who leads a multidisciplinary team of surgeons at the Assis Chateaubriand Maternity School (MEAC), has treated four sufferers with MRKH, also known as vaginal agenesis, with the break-through treatment. It is less invasive surgically than the traditional method which involves creating a vaginal canal using extensive grafts from the patient\u0027s groin. Some 23 patients have undergone the conventional treatment at MEAC over the past ten years. “This procedure can be time consuming and painful as the patient needs to recover from a large incision which leaves a scar that can be unsightly and stigmatising. There is also the possibility of discomfort with the reconstructed tissue,” Dr Bezerra explained. By comparison, neovaginaplasty has a faster recovery rate with no visible scars. There are minimal complications with no risk of rejection or infections the doctor said.  In addition, medical costs and materials are low – a significant benefit in a public health system strapped for cash - with operating times quicker and an abundance of the inexpensive, mild-tasting Tilapia fish readily available from Brazil’s rivers and fish farms. Research shows that tilapia skin, normally thrown away as a waste product, contains large amounts of moisture and is rich in collagen type 1, a protein that promotes healing. It is disease resistant and as strong and resilient as human skin. Since 2015, scientists at the UFC Research and Development of Medicines Nucleus coordinated by Professor Odorico Moraes, have been trialling a radical procedure that uses the moisture-filled skin of the freshwater fish to heal more than 200 victims with severe burns - with notable success. The normal regime is painful and involves regular changes of gauze bandages along with painkillers and ointments. “There was a eureka moment when we thought, if this membrane can be used for burns, why can’t it be used for the vagina,” said Dr Bezerra who began investigating the procedure in January 2016. “To make the ‘new vagina’ we insert a vagina shaped acrylic mould, lined with the skin of tilapia, into the space created between the bladder and the rectum. The device remains there for 10 days to prevent the walls from closing,” the doctor explained.

He was obviously an attacking player and I think he scored a few goals but he never played right up front.“That might have been because he was young and, when he first arrived, Aberdeen just wanted him getting games. Because we had Martin Bavidge as the main striker, he wasn’t going to get in the team right up top.“Saying that, I’m pretty sure Nicky regarded himself as a midfielder back then and I don’t think there was any thought of moving him forward.”After two seasons and eight goals, Clark moved on from the Blue Toon to Queen of the South in 2011 and, in terms of goals, has never looked back.Whether it was having former Rangers and Hearts front man Sandy as his father, or the foresight of someone at Palmerston, Bobby acknowledged the decision to make him into a striker was a masterstroke.“His dad has obviously had an influence on his career and he might have pushed for him to go up front, or maybe it was just something someone else saw in him that made them think they should give it a try. Either way, it was a great move for him and a player that gets the goals he does is probably just what United need right now.”The fact Clark is a player who knows the Championship well, having played there for Queens, Rangers and now Dunfermline, is a big plus.United now have a few members of their squad who are used to the rigours of the second tier and, for Bobby, that’s the way to go.“When I played in the lower divisions, the teams who were successful were usually ones who had players who knew the league.“United have brought in Nicky and, assuming he’s back fit for next season, they’ll have James Keatings just behind the main striker.“I thought he was a very good signing when he joined up last summer but the season was ruined by injuries. If he’s back, though, you are talking about a player who’s got goals at that level for quite a few clubs now.“These are the type you want – once you go up you worry about a team for the league above.“If you build a team for the league you’re in and get out of it, you find a few of the boys you did bring in are capable of doing well at a higher level.“Some won’t be and will have to be replaced but you are always going to want to freshen the squad each year.“With Nicky, only time will tell how he does if United get back to the Premiership, but he’s a proven scorer in the Championship and, right now, that’s the most important thing.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/03/5abe00fa671c1-848x564.jpg ","title":"confirmed dundee rename dens park","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee FC have completed a historic deal to rename Dens Park in a sponsorship deal.As the Tele exclusively revealed last week, the ground will now be officially known as Kilmac Stadium at Dens Park for the next two years, when the Dark Blues hope to have moved into a new stadium beside Camperdown Park.Managing Director John Nelms said: “We are always looking for new unique revenue streams and this is a fantastic opportunity for the club and it makes it even better that it is with Richard and Kilmac who are and have been lifelong supporters of the club.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/05/5b0d1efac5d76-940x444.jpg ","title":"dundee people dundee girls name chosen for huge po cruise ship","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA Dundee woman was “totally shocked” when she won a competition to name a new cruise ship.Gillian Crooks suggested her 12-year-old daughter Iona’s name to christen P\u0026ampO’s biggest-ever ship as part of a competition that saw more than 7,000 names suggested by 30,000 entrants.The new 180,000-ton vessel is said to be the most environmentally- efficient ship in the company’s history and was designed specifically for the British market.Gillian, 48, lives in Broughty Ferry with her husband David, son Shaun and Iona.As she was not the only person to choose Iona, Gillian’s name was pulled out of a hat to be declared the winner of the competition and she will attend the ship’s naming ceremony in May 2020.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/05/2505Market_02.jpg ","title":"dundee people job opportunities full and part time nurses needed","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA Dundee company is offering a salary of £33,696 for staff nurses, with full and part-time positions available.\u0026#8220We have full time, part time and bank opportunities for Staff Nurses to join our Neurodisability Care Centre,\u0026#8221 the company said.\u0026#8220We are a specialist centre providing long term person centred care and support for adults with a brain injury, complex neurological conditions with particular expertise in the management of Huntington’s disease.\u0026#8220We are respected as an authority on neurodisability care and a qualified training centre working in partnership with Dundee University.

I would imagine that should the move to ‘Nou Campy’ (the club’s proposed new stadium) happen, that will also follow suit with a stadium sponsor.”Fellow fan Garry Joiner, of Dunfermline, wrote: “Football is no longer a sport, it is a business and needs to operate as one.“A name change will have no fundamental impact on Dens Park to those who have always known it as Dens Park.”Richard Gennies, who’s based in Jakarta, backed sponsorship but insisted the stadium would “always be known as Dens Park no matter what the sign says”.Another fan who also backs the move wrote: “If the name change brings in ongoing cash investment it must be a good thing for the club.“It would be good to retain Dens in the name.”One supporter suggested the name “Kilmac Dens Park” and others said they would support the move if “Dens” was incorporated.However, others hit out at the sponsorship idea.One fan wrote: “What good would changing the name do? All it would do is annoy the loyal fans who go to Dens week in, week out.”Jasen Niblo, from Birkhill, said he didn’t like the fact the move was “all about money” and urged the club to keep the name.Another fan cautioned the club against inviting any food-related sponsors, saying: “As long as it doesn’t sound as bad as the Tony Macaroni Arena (in Livingston) we might live with it.”Graham Pert, from Whitfield, added: “I’m all up for things that will be great for the club but at this stage I think it would be sad to see the name changed from Dens

the condition.Donald Grewar joined a field of about 150 athletes to take on the scenic coastal run organised by Monifieth High School.The keen runner completed his fifth marathon just weeks before experiencing the first symptoms of MND in 2013.His determination has touched the Angus secondary to such an extent that funds from the run, which normally go to support the school, will instead be given to an Edinburgh University centre leading research into the condition.Donald, from Dairsie, contacted the school to submit his entry for the run, telling them he was keen to take on the 10k in his powered wheelchair.Monifieth High head teacher MC McInally said: “We normally hold the 10k to raise funds for pupils in the school but, after receiving Donald’s request, decided that all monies will go to the Euan MacDonald Centre which he is raising money for.“When word got out about what we were doing a couple of our younger children took it upon themselves to make cakes and they raised £63, which was a marvellous effort from them.”Donald set off ahead of the main event, accompanied by supporters and some senior pupils from the school, completing the challenge around the same time as overall winner Craig Earl.Monifieth councillor Craig Fotheringham, who started the 10k run, said Donald’s participation was a heartwarming show of determination.“This is always a popular run and as a former pupil of Monifieth High I’m very supportive of it, but especially this year when it will be raising such vital funds for MND,” he said.Donald said: “I was a keen sportsman and in April 2013 ran my fifth marathon in France.“Two months later, symptoms began and I was diagnosed with MND in January 2014.”The focus of Donald’s fundraising is the Euan MacDonald Centre, based at Edinburgh University, which involves about 30 researchers from across Scotland working to improve the lives of patients living with MND.\t\t\t"},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7486028.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"She did it  Swindon star Maisie Sly s film wins at the

Public consultation followed with 328 nearby addresses contacted, prompting 104 formal responses.The report to the committee stressed that the brief \"does not seek to create competition between the two locations\".Stratton, it stated, \"has opportunity for larger footprint retail and community buildings whereas Ashton provides opportunity for education, park and higher density residential development\".The focus of development would be \"east Ashton\". The owners of the adjacent western part of Ashton Farm do not intend selling for development but to continue farming the land.Opportunities have been identified for improving public transport links, particularly for Inverness Campus users. Transport agency HiTrans will consider the provision of a new rail station at Seafield, the campus or Stratton.Discussions are underway with the college and Highlands and Islands Enterprise on the \"early delivery\" of sports facilities at the campus. A least one pitch plus associated buildings could cost \u0026pound4.7 million.The expansion also promises to include an upgrade to the busy Inshes roundabout layout.Planning officials are discussing road widening proposals with landowners. Council representatives will attend community council meetings in the coming months to assess local requirements.A 500-space park-and-ride facility was consented as part of the Stratton scheme.The report references a landowner who argued that the brief contradicts an existing development plan and \"fails to recognise Stratton and only refers to potential future development at Ashton Farm\".They also complained that the \"vision map does not reflect the original permission\u0027 town centre at Stratton or the development plan support for it\".Another considers \"Ashton centre\" to be \"an unreasonable competitor location to Stratton\" that \"undermines\" Stratton.It is unclear from the report what long-term employment would be created in the area \u0026ndash an issue raised historically by numerous city councillors who questioned council officials\u0026rsquo aspirations for growth.The report stated: \"Analysis identified that the optimum location for a new centre is at east Ashton.\"This location is, therefore, identified as the core area for new and existing communities to visit as a destination that has footfall generating uses including a new district park, high school and mixed-use centre that includes high-density residential uses.\"It emphasised that the Stratton site does not include provision for a district park or high school with community facilities like those at Inverness Royal Academy.The brief \"does not seek to create competition between Stratton and Ashton\", according to the development planning team.Public feedback has already established an aversion to more development in the area with calls for the focus to instead be on the city centre and brownfield sites, and concern that the recent demand for new homes could stall, leaving a surplus of residential properties.Other responses included a plea that \"pubs should not be allowed\".Smithton and Culloden Community Council chairman David McGrath welcomed the document, with a caveat that it improves access to the nearby Inverness Shopping Park with a short cut for existing residents.A spokesman for the Stratton developer Hazledene said: \"We don\u0026rsquot think it\u0027 appropriate that a competitor town centre should be introduced, as this would add uncertainty and confusion.\"These [Ashton] proposals are early stage proposals and we believe should not be given the same weight as the Stratton permissions already granted.

I find NHS finance statements to be completely opaque.\"We need something much clearer based upon what we need to know each month.\"The council is to write to the health board about the issue.A report to councillors by Bill Alexander, the council\u0027 director care and learning, pointed to poor links between \"financial challenges and service planning processes, particularly regarding adult social care\".He said one of the key motivations behind integrating services had been \"the recognition that the resources of both organisations would become increasingly constrained,\" and that \"major change\" was now required to the way services are planned and delivered.Speaking after the debate, Councillor Davidson said: \"It can improve a lot.

I think it will help support people\u0027 fond relationship with the river.\"While the final detail has still to be completed, a group of fishermen from Inverness Angling Club seemed relaxed as they studied the computer generated images.Club president Graham MacKenzie said: \"Around the hut is already a gathering place.

It’s great to have the statistical back-up to the arguments.”The announcement was made by Equalities Secretary Angela Constance yesterday at Community Food Initiatives North East (CFINE), which led the six-month pilot scheme in Aberdeen.Ms Constance said: “The pilot in Aberdeen helped us to understand the barriers that some people face when it comes to accessing sanitary products and I’d like to thank CFINE for their help and work on this.“In total, 1,082 women and girls took part and helped us to identify ways that we could make free products easily accessible to those who need them.”An evaluation of the pilot showed two-thirds of those who took part had experienced difficulties in accessing sanitary products in the past.The data also shows 58% (237 women) said they had been unable to access sanitary products at times with some participants saying they had been forced to use alternatives including toilet roll, rags and nappies.Kelly Donaldson, financial capability advisor at CFINE, was one of the team tasked with reaching people who may benefit from the scheme.Ms Donaldson said her own mother was a single parent and found it “very difficult” to provide sanitary products on a budget when she was growing up.She said: “I think it helps when you’re out speaking to women for them to know they’re not alone and that we’ve been through similar kind of experiences which was good as it helped them open up a little bit more.”Ms Donaldson said they visited Aberdeen University, North East Scotland College (NESCol) and “everywhere and anywhere” to reach women across the city.CFINE CEO Dave Simmers said the issue of period poverty has long been an issue of concern for the charity.He said: “We’ve known for a long time it’s an issue for low-income families purchasing their sanitary products and another expense on a low budget and what the pilot did was affirm that.“It’s a natural function, there should be no embarrassment.“The pilot raised awareness of the issue and got people speaking about menstruation.”Meanwhile, the foodbank has revealed it gave out its highest amount of food parcels ever last month – more than 1,450.Emergency items are distributed from its centre on Poynernook Road to those in need.Mr Simmers said it was deeply concerning to see the rise in the use of the foodbank, adding he was worried about the impact the rollout of universal credit may have on the charity.He said: “It is by far the biggest amount we have given out in a month.“What we need to remember is the majority of people seeing us right now are on working tax credits so are in work but are struggling to make ends meet.“Our last highest total for food parcels was around 1,100 and that was in the middle of last year.“Last year we were probably averaging around 800 a month with it sometimes being higher so to reach 1,450 is quite dramatic.“Our foodbank is very busy just now and while people and corporate clients have been fantastic we have come close to running out of items.”Mr Simmers said the charity is expecting a “huge rise” in the demand for its services once Universal Credit is rolled out in October, replacing six other benefits for those in low-incomes or out of work.He said: “Our major concern right now is the roll-out of Universal Credit in October.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"listed consent could finally allow hall of heroes to go ahead","story":"\t\t\t\t\tCouncil chiefs have applied for listed building consent ahead of carrying out a multi-million-pound renovation of Provost Skene House.Aberdeen City Council plans to reopen the building, originally built in 1545 and now located in the heart of the Marischal Square complex, as a “Hall of Heroes” celebrating the city’s finest sons and daughters.The house was initially expected to reopen its doors to visitors at the end of 2017 but in February it was announced the attraction will now launch in the winter of 2019-20.Provost Skene\u0026#8217s House delayed until 2019 as work \u0026#8216almost has to start again\u0026#8217Councillors approved a range of conversation work for the 16th Century property on Guestrow later that month.

tomorrow evening.The Edinburgh University sports science student won the national indoor under-20 title over this distance in January and last summer she won the Scottish senior women’s 5,000m gold.Lang is currently showing outstanding form and it would be no surprise if she won again.Last weekend she knocked almost eight seconds off her previous best 1,500m time with an outstanding victory in a British Milers Club race at Watford.Her time of 4min 20.92secs leaves her within four seconds of the qualifying mark required for a place on the Great Britain team for this summer’s world junior championships in Finland.She said: “At the start of the season I didn’t think I’d be anywhere near the qualifying standard so I haven’t really thought about the world championships.“At Watford I was aiming to get under 4:25 but I was surprised to be so far below that so I was very happy.“I’ll go to the English Championships next month and try to run well and see what happens after that.“Hopefully I can run another fast time there.”Earlier this month Lang scored a notable double at the Scottish East District championships, winning the 800m in a personal best 2:12.12 and taking the 1,500m crown in 4:32.64.The only disappointment she has suffered this summer came in the British Universities and Colleges Championships at Bedford.The former Aberdeen Grammar pupil looked to be in control of the race and heading for a fast time as the leading group went through the bell, but with 300m to go she tripped and fell.By the time she gathered herself together the leaders were out of reach but she bravely carried on to finish in 10th position.She said: “I’m not sure exactly what happened.“I tripped as another girl came alongside me.“It all happened so fast but it was really disappointing as I felt I was having a good run.”Lang has bounced back superbly from that setback and looks to be heading towards more successes in the weeks ahead.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week

At times when the builders are working the gulls understandably leave the site but then return during the evenings and at weekends. Several birds were again sitting on apparent nests as recently as May 4, however it looks like many others may have moved elsewhere.Measures have since been taken by the builders to encourage the birds to leave the area prior to laying their eggs and to give them a chance of nesting elsewhere soon. Recently I had a meeting with SNH (Scottish Natural Heritage) and the RSPB and both were sympathetic and understanding of the situation.I also plan to meet with the Scottish Canals environmental scientist soon in the hope that perhaps provision can be made, within the scope of the hub project, to allow for a nesting area for the Common Gulls in future years at the site.This could give rise to an exciting opportunity enabling the public and visitors to the new heritage centre to view these gulls raise their chicks, for which is effectively the rarest colony of nesting birds in the Crinan Canal corridor.Jim Dickson, Argyll Bird Recorder, CairnbaanSir,This week Allt Dearg Wind Farm distributed over £135,000 to the Ardrishaig Community Trust, which holds the village\u0026#8217s share in this locally owned wind farm.Combined with the recent payments to the Tighnabruaich and Tarbert Trusts which hold similar shares in the neighbouring Sròndoire Wind Farm, together with the wind farms\u0026#8217 contributions to the local educational trust, this brings the total direct community benefit payments from these projects to well over £ 1 million.This is a significant milestone for the projects, and highlights the socio-economic advantages of local ownership in wind power. Despite its relatively small capacity Allt Dearg is the single largest contributor of community benefit payments in Argyll.This week the UK Government published the results of its latest tracking survey of public attitudes to energy and climate change. This shows continued growth in support for on-shore wind, and eight in ten agreed that renewable energy developments should provide direct benefits to the communities in which they are located.Some objections to wind farms remain, and our turbines remain visible in the distance. We hope that the views of Allt Dearg and Sròndoire might remind such objectors that we are economically dependent on what we can produce from the limited options available to us in remote rural areas. That our particular wind farms are able to make a significant contribution to local employment and deliver funding direct to our neighbouring communities, whilst supplying around 20 per cent of Argyll and Bute’s annual domestic electricity requirements from a clean renewable resource, is very satisfying.We would like to thank all those who have made these projects the successes they are, and in particular thank those local community councillors and trust members who have given so much of their time in recent years to make this all happen. For our part, we will continue our efforts to grow the industry and economic activity that provides secure employment and opportunity for our local community.We look forward to our community partners being able to invest the fruits of these wind farms into exciting local projects.Mary Broadfoot of Stronachullin and James F Lithgow of OrmsarySir,Loneliness is a major issue in society and affects everyone from all walks of life, regardless of age or ability.That’s why we’re pleased the Scottish Government is looking at the development of a new approach to tackling the issues of loneliness and social isolation – something we have first-hand experience of and how it affects many of the people we support in Scotland.Following a recent survey of over 150 service users of our homecare services in Stirling, Falkirk, Perth and Kinross, and Angus which focused solely on loneliness and social isolation, it was revealed that loneliest people receive far fewer visitors each week. While this is hardly surprising, we did find that those who either lived with family or had family close by were less at risk of loneliness and the negative health impacts associated. Our research also highlighted that respondents, in most cases, simply wanted a chat over a cuppa with someone their own age.Social interactions are something the vast majority of us take for granted as we all lead such busy lives, but for someone who is alone, watching time go by very slowly, it’s incredibly painful for them to sit at home day after day with no communication from the outside world.Charities such as Sue Ryder regularly arrange social events for our service users and their families.But if, as a nation, we’re serious about tackling loneliness as a public health issue then we need to be resourcing our local authorities to put in place services or to commission them from the third sector to ensure that no one feels alone and isolated in Scotland.Pamela Mackenzie, director of neurological services and Scotland, Sue Ryder, StirlingSir,This spring we hope your readers will celebrate the royal wedding with their very own Right Royal Tea Party in aid of Meningitis Now.Putting on a spread fit for a royal wedding is a piece of cake with our free fundraising pack and, as Prince Harry and Meghan Markle have requested charity donations rather than wedding presents, you can fulfil their wishes whilst helping families affected by this devastating disease.A royal-themed Time4Tea can be held anytime, not just on Saturday May 19, the date of the Royal Wedding.

Help us fight back on all fronts by funding research to eradicate the disease, raising awareness and supporting survivors.That would be the perfect wedding present.Find out more at www.MeningitisNow.org and search for Time 4 Tea.Elaine Close, community fundraiser, Meningitis NowSir,Please would the parents of the young girl who may have witnessed a recent incident with a man and dog in Inveraray Main Street be kind enough to contact my husband and I through this newspaper?We saw a man who, we believe, mistreated a dog in the street at 8.30pm on Sunday April 29, and his movements in the immediate aftermath.We are both keen to know that this young person is alright as she appeared to be terribly frightened, running off at speed with her two dogs as he headed straight for her.Knowing she was now fine would put our minds at rest.

Moore took the free-kick, but his curling effort from 27 yards lacked power.Moore, however, was not to be denied his hat-trick and 60 seconds later  steered a good low finish past Scott Urquhart\u0026#8217s left hand.The early first-half jitters returned to the League defence just after the hour mark when hesitation in the box allowed Nikki MacDougall, of host club Tarbert, to nip in and force the ball past Urquhart from nine yards to add a fifth goal for Argyll.A flurry of changes from both sides with 16 minutes remaining saw Scott Soudan and Lewis MacNaughton replace MacDougall and McCallum for Argyll.The league adjusted quicker to the changes and Kyle Reid and Robbie Martin combined well for Martin to pull a goal back in the 77th minute.With five minutes remaining, Soudan\u0026#8217s tenacity in the box robbed Daniel Smith on the six yard line and left him one-on-one with Urquhart.Soudan\u0026#8217s stabbed effort was stopped by Urquhart\u0026#8217s outstretched right foot but, typical of his luck on the day, the rebound fell kindly for the Campbeltown Pupils\u0026#8217 striker who rounded the prostrate Urquhart and walked the ball into the empty net.The full-time whistle ended an entertaining encounter with the players and officials retiring to the Islay Frigate Hotel for the presentation ceremony.The Duncan MacDougall man of the match award was given to Red Star\u0026#8217s Kieran Moore.\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"sun brings out the best in lochgilphead golfers","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 17/05/18, 2:24 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowOn a lovely sunny Sunday the gents competed to gain a place to play in this year\u0026#8217s match and knockout competition.Jim Hunter was excited to return a nett score of 58, six strokes below par.

It was a gamble \u0026#8211 but one that paid off, with the business now turning over millions each year.He left the business \u0026#8216at least 10 years ago\u0026#8217, but was a very interested visitor at last week\u0026#8217s \u0026#8216Fyne at 40\u0026#8217 celebrations \u0026#8211 more on pages 16 and 17 \u0026#8211 to mark the company\u0026#8217s four decades in business.\u0026#8216Looking back, I feel quite astonished really,\u0026#8217 he told the Advertiser.\u0026#8216I mean, away back we had a wooden hut, but before that there was a fish box and an umbrella. We were growing shellfish, cooking prawns and smoking a bit of fish.\u0026#8216The restaurant as we see it today was an old farm steading \u0026#8211 well, it was a midden, really. But we slowly evolved within it.\u0026#8216It was open to the slates and the wind used to go straight up the length of the oyster bar. We had a hessian sack to keep down the draught, and it used to stand out at about 45 degrees a lot of the time. It was very primitive for many years, because we were skint.\u0026#8216People sat in their overcoats, but they liked the style. All of a sudden they could get local shellfish, and it just developed from there.\u0026#8217He continued: \u0026#8216Since my time the whole place has had a re-make and it is really, really nice.\u0026#8216It\u0026#8217s been driven by the volume of people wanting to dine here. I mean, you couldn\u0026#8217t keep up that slightly rustic look. It\u0026#8217s a cracking place now. Just superb.\u0026#8217Johnny Noble sadly died in 2002, aged just 66.\u0026#8216He was an inspiring, lovely man, said Mr Lane. \u0026#8216No matter what disaster befell us no matter what cock-up happened, he was ever-optimistic and just kept us going.\u0026#8216We would have our business meetings in the billiard room at [Johnny\u0026#8217s home] Ardkinglas House, and there would be a bottle of something. That just keeps the morale going.\u0026#8216He was a great man, and wonderful entertainment.\u0026#8217The stories of Johnny Noble are legion, and most are true.Andy Lane recalled: \u0026#8216In the days of the Oyster Bar in our old draughty building, everyone had to muck in. Johnny would go round being the wine waiter for a while. Until, that is, someone would choose an inappropriate wine. At that point he\u0026#8217d start a sort of genial argument with them. In the end he\u0026#8217d sit down with them and you\u0026#8217d never see him again for the rest of the evening.\u0026#8216I don\u0026#8217t think we realised just how important he was for the business until he was gone.\u0026#8217Now living a quieter life in Cornwall with his Dexters, Mr Lane concluded: \u0026#8216My wife and I changed tack in life, really, and it keeps us busy.

Therefore, we support separating pedestrians, cyclists and motorists through an expansion of the network of walking and cycling paths across Scotland.We would like to stress, however, that measures like these will not single-handedly lead to safer roads. The road mentality in Scotland still favours the motorist over more vulnerable road users, which presents a huge barrier to more people taking up active lifestyles.More needs to be done to change our road culture for people in Scotland to feel safer regardless of their means of transportation, ultimately empowering them to lead healthier and more active lifestyles.Perhaps it is time we started to beat the ‘presumed liability’ drum once again?Brenda Mitchell, Road Traffic Accident Law (Scotland) LLP, Edinburgh.Sir,Some people have difficulty getting up and down the steps on the Glasgow bus. We asked West Coast Motors about this and they gave us the answer we wanted.All Citylink buses are fitted with an access ramp, worked by the driver. A platform comes out on to the pavement, with a holding bar, and is then raised up to floor level. This is designed as a wheelchair lift, where two seats at the front have to be arranged to be taken out, to give plenty of room.It was agreed, however, that if someone felt nervous about climbing up or down the stairs, they could also use the access platform. Once they have paid their ticket, they can walk to a seat.West Coast Motors asks anyone wanting this service to please remember two things.Firstly, book your single or return tickets by phone or on the Citylink website.Then, 48 hours before your journey, phone Citylink and tell them the times and details of the booking you have made and let them know you will be using the access ramp. The telephone number is 08712 663333.Kirsty McCuaig and Patricia Crawford, Mid Argyll Buddies.Sir,The ongoing effects of weather, bureaucracy and concern for the future continue to put our countryside under pressure, with few avenues to turn to for support.This can have dramatic consequences for the rural economy and the people who live and work there.The Prince’s Countryside Fund is committed to supporting community-led projects that will re-invigorate and sustain farming networks and the countryside by providing services and amenities through its grant programme.Open for applications until June 14, grants are available for up to £50,000. If you are involved in a community-run or farming support project and think your organisation may benefit – or if you know someone who might –  visit  www.princescountrysidefund. org.uk/grants.The fund has supported a diverse range of projects, including a community transport app in Argyll and projects on Barra, Orkney and Shetland. We are proud to have distributed more than £9 million since 2010 to more than 250 projects led by these grassroots organisations.It is crucial we help rural areas during these times of change to retain a thriving countryside and encourage a sustainable farming sector in the UK and would encourage people to apply for our funding.Claire Saunders, director, The Prince’s Countryside Fund.Sir,At first sight, it seems odd that the controversy over the reported disturbance to common gulls, oystercatchers and black guillemots at the old oil depot in Ardrishaig is focused on a breeding colony of common gulls.I’m no bird expert and hadn’t realised common gulls are less common than the bigger varieties or that they’re a declining species.But among the reasons given for this are predation by mink and the loss of open rubbish dumps and both might be contributing factors in Mid Argyll.It’s surely hardly surprising that the only breeding colony along the canal is at the Ardrishaig end, where the urbanisation around the tidal flats of Loch Gilp and the Lingerton dump offer prime scavenging opportunities.I don’t know whether they lose out to the bigger gull species when it comes to local island nesting sites, or whether the old Gleaner site might offer other advantages, for example, maybe less vulnerable to mink predation – but could it be the gulls are there primarily because of man-made feeding opportunities and that they’ll find an alternative site that’s similarly convenient?Likewise, the smaller populations of oystercatchers and black guillemots, however, although they’re also both amber listed they don’t scavenge and seem to be more dependent on the sea and shore for their livelihoods.Their decline might be of more concern but they’re hopefully less swayed towards easy pickings around Loch Gilp and more evenly distributed to Loch Crinan.Perhaps Jim Dickson and Andrew Tongue can enlighten us further on just how endangered the populations of these three species are in Mid Argyll.Robert Wakeham, Lochgilphead.Sir,Please would the parents of the young girl who may have witnessed a recent incident with a man and dog in Inveraray Main Street contact my husband and I through this newspaper?We saw a man who, we believe, mistreated a dog in the street at 8.30pm on Sunday April 29.We are both keen to know this young person is alright as she appeared to be frightened, running off at speed with her two dogs.Knowing she was fine would put our minds at rest.

You have a most beautiful part of the country to live in.Name and address supplied.Sir,It has been announced recently a Scottish Conservative government would invest £100 million into fixing potholes over the course of the next parliament.We all rely on our roads but they are now plagued with potholes which are damaging cars. Beyond our concerns for public safety, this systematic under-investment is slowing our economy and costing local councils a fortune in compensation for car owners.We recognise the importance of well-maintained roads and we are willing to invest in it.The SNP has consistently neglected Scotland’s roads and the results are obvious for everyone to see.Councillor Alastair Redman, Islay.On Monday May 14, I spotted six swallows over the rear of Meadows Place, hopefully heralding a decent summer.First seen this year.Mike Power, Lochgilphead.Sir,During this week\u0026#8217s Holyrood vote on the UK Government’s Withdrawal Bill, Labour, the Greens and LibDems joined the SNP in an overwhelming rejection of the UK Government’s currently-drafted Brexit plans, voting 93 to 30 against the bill.While the Scottish Government agrees in the need for UK-wide frameworks, it has described the retention of the overall control of agriculture, fisheries, food labelling and public procurement as a power grab.The Scottish Parliament has spoken loudly and clearly, and if the UK Government wants us to believe they value Scotland and devolution, they must respect the vote and remove the proposed power grab.Any constraints placed on the existing powers of the Scottish Parliament without consent would be a democratic outrage.During Prime Minister\u0026#8217s Questions, Theresa May failed to reassure us she will respect the decision of the Scottish Parliament. If she does choose to ignore the vote and force through this legislation, she will be breaking the conventions of the 20-year-old devolution settlement and imposing a power grab upon Scotland against our will.Brendan O\u0026#8217Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"science matters natures patterns","story":"\t\tDorothy H CrawfordUpdated: 20/05/18, 11:47 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe natural world abounds in beautiful patterns, each evolved to enhance survival of a species \u0026#8211 the extravagant, iridescent peacock’s tail, which serves to attract a mate, while intricate orchid flowers entice pollinators and tigers’ stripes provide camouflage.But not all nature’s patterns are quite as showy it is the mathematical symmetries that I find most intriguing.Italian mathematician Leonardo Fibonacci lived in 12th century Algeria when Indian numerals were introduced to the West via the Middle East.  In his book, Liber Abaci (published in 1202), he describes a numerical sequence, now called the Fibonacci sequence, in which each number is the sum of the previous two digits: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 ad infinitum. He formulated this recurrence in relation to rabbit breeding, but it turns out to be exceedingly wide-spread in nature, from tree branching to mollusc shell growth to bee reproduction.Plant leaves are like solar panels, absorbing sunlight to power energy-providing photosynthesis.  Thus, leaves appear in a spiral around the stem, each positioned to optimise sunlight capture.  The ratio of leaves to turns is always a ration of Fibonacci numbers 3 leaves to 1 turn for hazel, 8/3 for pear and 13/5 for almond trees.  The angle between consecutive leaves is always close to 137.5o, called ‘the golden angle’ – perfect for maximising energy production.The number of petals in most flowers also follows the Fibonacci sequence: lilies have 3, buttercups 5, delphinium 8, common marigolds 13, asters 21.  But even more striking are the complex spirals of seed-heads of sunflowers, fir cones and pineapples.  In each case new seeds forming in the centre of the flower push older seeds out into mesmerising patterns of interlocking, clockwise and anticlockwise spirals.The numbers of spirals in both directions are consecutive Fibonacci numbers with 5 and 8 or 8 and 13 in pineapples, 8 and 13 in fir cones, and numbers as high as 144 and 233 recorded in sunflower heads.Why? Because these configurations pack in the most seeds.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column 25","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 21/05/18, 3:33 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Some would argue it has been an eyesore that should have been knocked down long before now and replaced with a more modern building.But it\u0026#8217s sad to see the old Inveraray Community Hall crumble and rot with neglect.What makes the building\u0026#8217s current predicament all the more galling is that there was the chance, according to Inspire Inveraray, to make the building safe six years ago.

Entitled ‘Looking for Noah’ they stand, incongruously with a licence plate wedged in antlers.The walk takes the visitor past thought-provoking sculptures, including Lesley Burr’s beautifully-painted birdcages that could house fairies, to an opening at The Mill with its own maze and poetry carved into rock.The Artmap Argyll group brings together artists of different specialities to make for an intrigung walk through the woods.A highlight for many will be Melanie Chimelewska’s limestone seal pup, lying gleefully on the shore, but Andy McClintock’s dancing mermaids undoubtedly captured a feeling of eerie magic, as though having stepped into a Grimm brothers\u0026#8217 fairytale. The wire and cloth faceless mermaids dance on the surface of a pond but hide, too, under a running waterfall, washing the seaweed stuck to their scaled tails.Andy McClintock said: ‘I imagine water sprites dancing in the lagoon and disporting themselves in waterfalls.’Within The Mill itself, paintings are hung showing the allure of algae.Artist Lottie Goodlet said: ‘As a snorkeller and swimmer in the Sound of Jura, I am fascinated by seaweed beneath me.

As with other gull species which are opportunist in diet, junk food and bits of plastic provided by us humans can be inadvertently consumed.Over many years the Gleaner oil depot, which has a concrete bund in case of oil spillage, has provided a safe nesting site for around 20 pairs. The suggestion that this colony could easily find an alternative site is perhaps wishful thinking as suitable sites nearby in Mid Argyll are already occupied by other gull species or don’t have the required habitat features.Thankfully, however, this should not prove necessary. Following a productive on-site meeting last week with the Scottish Canals\u0026#8217 environmental scientist, the project architect and TSL contractors we noted 10-15 birds sitting on eggs and unaffected by the work going on around them.Planned works over the coming weeks should not affect these gulls, Oystercatchers or Black Guillemots from nesting and will also not impede the building work which is scheduled to be completed by next spring.The Mid Argyll hub project and new canal museum will largely reflect the social and cultural heritage of the Crinan Canal, but should also encompass the important and often decreasing natural history of the Crinan Canal corridor. These breeding birds are also a part of this and should not just be something to ‘chase off’ to somewhere else.Excellent viewing and educational opportunities from the new build will be possible to watch this colony raise their chicks as well as providing a point to lookout for other wildlife on the loch.Nearby, the tidal estuary of Loch Gilp provides us with an often highly under-valued unofficial nature reserve that links Ardrishaig with Lochgilphead, which in winter hosts important numbers of duck and waders, in summer includes breeding Eider ducks and Common Terns and during migration is a vital stopping off point during adverse weather for passage Whooper swans, Brent geese and Black-tailed Godwits to name a few.Increasingly good work is being undertaken by locals and the Phoenix Trust to help clear up some of the increasing amounts of shoreline rubbish.Keep up the good work!Jim Dickson, Argyll Bird Recorder, CairnbaanSir,I have been out and about Islay the past week speaking to my constituents, visiting local businesses and monitoring the roads department\u0026#8217s progress with road repairs.Unfortunately CalMac management\u0026#8217s shocking handling of our local ferry service is really taking it\u0026#8217s toll on many local businesses that depend heavily of Islay\u0026#8217s growing tourist trade. We simply cannot allow CalMac to continue to make the same errors every year without consequences.On another subject, I have been unimpressed with our local roads department management\u0026#8217s sluggish response to a large number of complaints from local residents and myself about the plague of potholes scattered across Islay.There are many roads across Islay that have some potholes marked to be filled while others remain unmarked despite them in many cases being side by side. This scattershot approach to pothole repairs is as random as it is ineffective.In the future we will need to see a more long term resurfacing solution to our local roads with less short term, random and piecemeal patchwork.Cllr Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,In the run up to National Volunteering Week (June 1- 7), Cats Protection would like to extend our thanks to the many thousands of volunteers throughout the country who offer their time and expertise to help cats and kittens across the UK.In 2017, our 10,200-strong volunteer network contributed an incredible 5.5 million hours, each volunteer gifting a wealth of expertise and immeasurable passion to the charity. Their dedication enabled Cats Protection to help around 200,000 cats and kittens nationwide.Cats Protection is always on the lookout for new volunteers to join the UK’s biggest cat community. Though a large part of our work is helping cats, through fostering and rehoming, our volunteers have the opportunity to become involved with a range of interesting activities such as organising fundraising events, helping with publicity or managing funds and resources to benefit the greatest amount of cats.Volunteering can offer the chance to develop skills such as time management, interpersonal skills and teamwork, making CVs much more attractive and, of course, helping cats.Anyone who is interested in becoming a volunteer can go to our website www.cats.org.uk/get- involved/volunteering  to find out more.Julie Meredith, head of volunteering development, Cats Protection,Sir,I really love being active, especially the feeling after and that’s why I’m supporting Bowel Cancer UK and Beating Bowel Cancer’s latest fundraising campaign to get sponsored to do 30 minutes of physical activity for 30 days in June.Step up for 30 is a fantastic way for you to be more physically active to reduce your risk of bowel cancer – the UK’s second biggest cancer killer.

Whitletts has landed an unenviable spot in the country’s top 10 road tests to avoid. The list, published by recovery firm 24/7 Vehicle Rescue, claims the “nerve-jangling lottery” has put Ayr on the map for all the wrong reasons. It follows a \u0026pound3.5m scheme to increase lanes and install traffic lights on the roundabout in 2006, which has sparked trouble for many trying to negotiate its contours ever since. Transport Scotland held a safety review in 2015 after stats showed Whitletts was more dangerous than the giant M8 roundabout at Hermiston Gait near Edinburgh.  Ranjen Gohri, spokesman for 24/7 Vehicle Rescue, said: “Britain is famed for its roundabouts, and being able to safely negotiate them is a major part of driving in this country. “Unfortunately, many motorists are terrified of them. “This is not helped by some of the cases we’ve gathered that have a fearsome reputation and seem to almost unnerve drivers before they even get to them. “With the volume of traffic and unavoidable problems such as breakdowns, driving in the UK is difficult enough without having to attempt some of these roundabouts from hell.” Also making the top ten is Sheriffhall, which sits on Edinburgh’s city bypass, and Haudagain in Aberdeen, which is due for a \u0026pound30m redesign later this year.

We moved in together early 2016 and then Stuart proposed whilst we were on holiday in Dubai in September 2016. “He bought me a pair of Valentino shoes and got down on one knee to put them on for me before pulling out my beautiful engagement ring that he’d designed himself and had made by a jeweller in Dubai.  The couple tied the knot on Saturday, February 24 this year, with the ceremony held at Glasgow University Memorial Chapel and the reception at Boclair House in Bearsden. Erin said: “It was a nice contrast of traditional and modern glam. “We were so lucky getting a beautiful crisp sunny day - right before the Beast from the East came later that week. “Stuart and I wrote our own ceremony and personalised vows. “We ended the night with [I want to spend my] Life with You by The Proclaimers. “It really was a perfect day and more than we could of dreamed of!

Making up the rest of the wedding party were best man Craig Marshall, ushers Les Lawrie, Dean Wear and Torin McKenzie, mother of the bride Una McKenzie and parents of the groom Yvonne and Fraser Murray. The couple celebrated being newlyweds with a trip to the sunshine. Erin said: “We squeezed in 10 nights in at the Centara Ras Fushi resort in the Maldives before Stuart went offshore again. “It was paradise!

Neighbours have slammed fast motorists in the Heathfield area and also in Whitletts Road. One resident claims an existing speed camera on Whitletts Road currently isn’t in operation and insist vehicles are zooming past her home at speeds of up to 50mph. She is calling for a speed camera further along the road to curb fast drivers. The concerned woman has called for the camera between Whitletts Road and Mainholm Road. Speaking at this month’s North Ayr Community Council, she said: “I am convinced the speed camera in Whitletts Road is not switched on. “I can hear cars at 6am or 7am travelling at more than 30mph coming into the town and the same going out.  “We need a speed camera.” Councillor Ian David said: “I am waiting for a response from the Partnership Panel as speeding in Whitletts Road was mentioned and it will be taken up with the police.” Speeding was also a hot topic discussed at last month’s Newton and Heathfield Community Council held in Newton Pavilion. Community councillors highlighted problems with speeding cars in Alderston Avenue and Northfield Avenue, and the problem of these streets being used by drivers as rat run to avoid the traffic lights in Prestwick Road. One woman said: “(There is) speeding in Alderston Avenue and there are a few children who stay in that street at the corner and the cars are turning right on to Northfield Avenue.” Police attending the meeting said they would do their best to monitor the situation. A council spokesman said Police Scotland/Safety Cameras Scotland administer speed cameras: “Safety cameras in Scotland are operated under the rules and guidelines of the Scottish Safety Camera Programme.”  A Police Scotland spokesman said: “The speed detection cameras are rotated around camera housing sites and have the ability to be used at any time. “You can find more information on the Scottish Safety Camera Programme and the location of camera sites by visiting www.safetycameras.gov.scot” In March, the Post reported that more than 13,000 speed offences have been captured on Ayrshire’s roads over the past three years Fast drivers were caught 13,103 times racing through the streets at breakneck speeds across the county from 2015 to 2017. And the highest clocked by a speed camera during that period was in 2016 at 140mph. Over last three years, a total of 715 speeding offences were detected in Ayr, 227 in Troon, 116 Prestwick, 32 in Maybole, 105 in Girvan and 88 in Cumnock.

Calls are mounting for civic head, Helen Moonie, to hold a bash at County Buildings, following Ayr’s first league title in 21 years. But the request could be snubbed in favour of a joint sporting celebration, the Post understands. A request for the engagement, lodged in the aftermath of Ayr’s success, is being considered by officials. Former cop Alasdair Malcolm, now a volunteer at Somerset Park, has called for the recognition. He said: “Every effort should be made to mark this fantastic achievement. “Ayr United are an integral part of the local community and, particularly through their Academy programme, have close working relationships throughout local schools and community groups. “The club, which has been a feature of the town since 1910, have had an outstanding season.” Ayr became the first club in the UK to score 100 goals in domestic competition en route to their title.  And their championship was the first to be clinched on home soil for 90 years. Mr Malcolm, secretary of the Ayrshire Golf Association, said: “It would be fitting if the local authority, by way of a civic reception or similar event, would mark the achievement of the management, players, officials and staff.” South Ayrshire Tory leader, Martin Dowey, added: “It is a wonderful achievement and one that is worthy of a civic reception. “A prosperous Ayr United is good for the town and we will be calling on all councillors to recognise the title win.” However, it’s believed there may be other invites on the guest list of any civic celebration. Carrick Rugby Club, three-time winners of the BT National Shield, and Commonwealth gold medallist Paul Foster, are among those in their thoughts. A council spokesman said: “A request has been received and will be considered in line with our civic hospitality guidelines.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"win a summer shopping spree","story":"NewsWin a summer shopping spreeTo help you get fashion and beauty- ready for summer, Debenhams at Ayr Central are hosting a fabulous VIP shopping event on Thursday June 7.\u0026nbspShareByAyrshire Post10:35, 30 MAY 2018Updated10:36, 30 MAY 2018NewsGet ready for summer and be in with a chance of winning a shopping spree\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailWIN A SUMMER SHOPPING SPREE!

Wren Kitchens will move into a 10,000sq ft unit at Heathfield this September, the Post can reveal. The firm, based in Lincolnshire, will make its first foray into Ayrshire when the store opens its doors. Its nearest outlet is currently more than 40 miles away at Abbotsinch, near Paisley. The addition comes as a welcome boost for park bosses, who are set to lose three retailers this year. Homebase will bow out on June 24, joining Carpetright and Maplin on the casualty list. The departures will see 50,000sq ft of trading space lost. However, Alastair Dickie, director at Heathfield’s developers Ediston Properties, said: “This is a positive piece of business. “Wren are an expanding company and this represents their first store in Ayrshire.  “They clearly view Ayr as a place to be and we are happy to have them on board. “It will mean jobs, not only in store but indirectly for fitters.” Wren will move into the unit vacated by the former PC World. The firm, which was founded in 2009, employs more than 4000 staff. It comes as park bosses prepare to seal a deal with another new name on site. Mr Dickie added: “Since acquiring the park we’ve let out ten units and don’t anticipate stopping there.” Ediston bought Heathfield in 2011 in a deal worth \u0026pound31.8 million. Retail giants such as M\u0026ampS, DFS and Costa have all moved in as part of the park’s overhaul in the intervening years.

This must have been a favoured site well-placed beside a coaching inn on the main road North.\nThe 1860s saw the further development of the railways begun five years previously.\nBefore this Peebles lived up to its reputation of being, \u0026ldquoAs quiet as the grave or as Peebles. With the railways came industry and people and money.\nCommercial Peebles began to develop and the Northgate was no exception. Up until then the Northgate was little more than the road out of town with several pastoral tofts strung out along it. Laird Girdwood, was a larger-than-life character and also one of the prominent proprietors. He was also a member of the Peeblesshire Rifle Volunteers.\nThen as now, such organisations accommodate a little social networking.\nIt is not surprising then that Charles Ker, also a Volunteer and his sister acquired one of these tofts from a comrade.
