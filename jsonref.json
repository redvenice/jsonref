For some reason you were left for 18 months with this hanging over your head fearing you could go to prison. For anyone, let alone a mother of three children, that is a sentence in and of itself.\u0027In another case of events, had you been leading the high life, you could still be going to prison. But you are devoted to your children.\u0027But in no small part due to the inexplicable delay in prosecution, the sentence is a community order. If you don\u0027t do these hours of unpaid work you go to prison. But if you do the hours then that\u0027ll be the end of this and you can get on with your life.\u0027The court heard she has paid back just £1,000 since she was caught more than 18 months ago.          At Bolton Crown Court (pictured), Meehan pleaded guilty to three charges of failing to notify the DWP of a change in circumstances between May 2015 and August 2017Earlier Helen Longworth, prosecuting, said the offences began after Meehan patched up her relationship with Mr Shuker in 2015.Miss Longworth added: \u0027She is the mother of three children, two of which are under 18. She had lived as a single parent and so made an appointment to apply for benefits and at that time there was no indication that was this incorrect.\u0027She was made aware that if her living circumstances changed she was to inform the DWP. Her circumstances did indeed change but she failed to inform the department. The father of her children, Mr Lee Shuker, moved into her house to be with her and the children. He was employed until February 2017, and then again from April 2017 onwards.\u0027There are several examples showing an awareness by the couple that changes of address must be registered, and that he was in fact living at the defendant\u0027s home.

To me if someone sends that in a first message it\u0027s a straight no.\u0027I said no to him in what I think was a polite way. I could have gone on a massive rant about how you shouldn\u0027t speak to women like that but it wasn\u0027t worth the argument.         But Miss Kerr refused to get upset by the fat-shaming messages or block Tom on the dating app         Tom started the exchange with a blunt message asking for a s**g but when Miss Kerr refused he launched into a vitriolic attack on her appearance\u0027Then I got all that abuse back. At first I was shocked. I\u0027ve been called boring or frigid before by people on Tinder but this is the first time someone has really tried to hurt me.\u0027But then I started picking up on all of his mistakes and it was making me laugh, like he called me the mad controller instead of the fat controller.\u0027I also found it funny that he compared me to a Fiat 500 because I own a Fiat 500.\u0027I tried to find the funny side. That\u0027s my coping mechanism.. And I wasn\u0027t going to give him the satisfaction of just blocking him and acting like he\u0027d hurt me.\u0027So I sent him a funny reply and it\u0027s not the response he wanted. I got loads more abuse back.\u0027After reading his angry rant, Miss Kerr replied to Tom awarding him 1010 for effort and highlighting how funny she found it that she owns a Fiat 500.Tom appeared to continue trying his luck, asking Miss Kerr to perform a sex act on his \u0027average size c**k\u0027 in exchange for the party drug ketamine which is also used as a horse tranquilizer.When Miss Kerr pointed out that she had no need for the drug as Tom had called her a hippo not a horse, he replied: \u0027Shut up you fat ugly horrible dirty obese t***e.         After being branded a \u0027hippo\u0027 Miss Kerr laughed off Tom\u0027s offer of ketamine, a party drug which is also used as a drug tranquiliser         Miss Kerr poked fun at Tom who continued to mock her appearance, saying she looked like Bruce the Shark from the Disney film Finding Nemo\u0027You look like a mix between Bruce the shark and Shrek you fat ugly b***h. You have more rolls than f***ing Greggs.\u0027She responded by telling Tom he \u0027can\u0027t handle rejection\u0027 and questioning his taste in women.But the baker, who compares dating a fat girl to opening a bag of crisps in church on her own Tinder profile, thinks taking Tom\u0027s cruelty on the chin only angered him more as he quickly unmatched her.She said: \u0027It didn\u0027t upset me because he had asked me to sleep with him before so I can\u0027t be that bad.\u0027It\u0027s purely because I said \u0027no\u0027 to him that he was then being so spiteful.\u0027He wasn\u0027t giving me abuse out of nowhere. He messaged me asking for a shag but I knew I was better than what he was offering and he just couldn\u0027t handle the rejection.\u0027He wanted me to argue back and get upset so he could think he was the big man upsetting a girl but I wasn\u0027t going to let him win.\u0027And he was really unimaginative. He just picked up on one thing, the fact that I\u0027m a big girl. But my whole bio is a jokey metaphor about dating a big girl. \u0027He thought he was being funny so I thought it would be entertaining to give him a funny response back and he just couldn\u0027t handle it. He ended up unmatching me.\u0027I think he was really offended that I was seeing the funny side.\u0027While she was able to laugh off Tom\u0027s \u0027shocking\u0027 behaviour, Miss Kerr feels this kind of abuse from the Tinder reject could seriously impact women struggling with their body image.         She said: \u0027He obviously has no respect for women whatsoever and will go around hurting people\u0027s feelings and not caring about the consequences\u0027She said: \u0027It\u0027s lucky it was me he was giving abuse to and not someone who\u0027s more insecure.\u0027It could have a really serious impact on some people.\u0027If someone was already feeling quite down and depressed or struggling with their body image that abuse could be their breaking point.\u0027A few of my friends who saw the messages told me they would have been raging or in tears. \u0027He obviously has no respect for women whatsoever and will go around hurting people\u0027s feelings and not caring about the consequences.\u0027It\u0027s just not right.

Most currently expect it to be held on Tuesday night but this is not fixed.Can she win? It looks unlikely. The prospect of No Deal on April 12 will encourage Brexiteers they should vote down the deal a third time. There is currently little sign the DUP are being won over by a political offensive behind the scenes. Mrs May also alienated Labour MPs with her angry speech on Wednesday night.  It seems possible she could end up losing the third vote by a bigger margin than the 149 votes she lost the second one.What if she does win? If the PM manages a great escape, then Britain will be on track to leave on May 22. The Government will move quickly to get the necessary laws in place.What if she loses?  The EU has made clear that if the deal goes down a third time, Britain must come back with a plan in time for the new deadline of April 12.Most urgently, a decision will have to be made on whether the UK takes part in European Parliament elections on May 23. If it does not, there will be No Deal - and Mrs May says electing MEPs would be the wrong thing to do.However, there is still a majority of MPs in Parliament against No Deal so the choice could be taken away from the PM. If elections are agreed in the UK there will probably be a new EU summit around April 10 to approve a much longer extension - perhaps to the end of 2019 or even longer.The UK will have to have a new plan for what to do with the time as Brussels has made clear it cannot keep going over the same deal.Will MPs vote on other options? Probably. Monday night\u0027s vote could setup a full-blown \u0027indicative vote\u0027 that would set all the options against each other. A defeated Government could stage the same procedure.The idea would be to find what kind of Brexit might be supported by Parliament or if there is none, see if there is support for a new public vote.   Will May resign? Nobody knows. No Prime Minister has ever soaked up so much humiliation and carried on and yet Mrs May is still in Downing Street.She suggested this week she would not accept a long delay beyond June 30, seen by many as a hint she would resign if it had to happen.A third defeat for the deal next week would also provoke huge calls for her to resign.A move to No Deal could also see some Tory MPs join with Labour to force the Government out with a vote of no confidence.  What happens to Brexit if May goes or the Government collapses? It is hard to know. Even with a tweak to the law to change the date, Brexit will still happen with No Deal on April 12 if other choices keep being rejected. But we also know there is a majority of MPs against a No Deal Brexit. It is possible there are enough Tory MPs prepared to remove the Government to stop No Deal by installing a Corbyn government ahead of a snap election. Only the Government can bring forward the necessary change in the law to change the Brexit date. What is Labour\u0027s position? Labour says no deal must be stopped - but also says it will not vote for Mrs May\u0027s deal.It wanted a three month delay to renegotiate the political declaration on the final UK-EU relationship but this would require it form a Government more or less immediately. Were it to do so, it would try pass the orce deal attached to a new political declaration that said the final relationship would be based on a permanent customs union. It has passed no comment on the actual proposed delay. Will there have to be a new election or a referendum? This falls into the anything is possible category. Parliament is deadlocked and has been for months - which suggests an election is necessary. And yet the governing Tory party clearly has little idea what it would put to the country or who would lead it into an election. An election can be forced without the consent of the Tories but it is very difficult. Similarly, it is far from clear there are the votes for a referendum in the Commons. The idea was crushed last week because Labour did not vote for it.Will Brexit ever happen? Almost three years after the referendum, this depends entirely on your view of events. The law says it will but there are enough MPs to at least change the date if given the chance to do so.It could now happen on April 12 or May 22. Or it could be delayed much further. "},{"url":null,"title":"Botswana baby buffalo comes seconds eaten lion","story":"Share this article          This snap shows the mother butting the smaller lioness with its horns as another buffalo joins her for the attack          Mr Cranke said: \u0027An elderly 18-year-old lioness lead the hunt but failed to catch the young calf and got butted by an older buffalo.

A primary school principal says he will not allow his staff and pupils return to “dire” classroom conditions after the Easter holidays unless the Department of Education provides plans for a replacement building.Michael O’ Sullivan, principal of Charleville CBS Primary, Co Cork, said its “dilapidated” school building was no longer fit for purpose and sanitary conditions were “dire and similar to those of a school in a developing country”.“Our roof is leaking. Our plumbing fixtures are falling to pieces. Our timber floors in the classroom are cracked and broken,” he said.“Our ‘terazo’ surface in our corridors is broken, chipped and cracked. We have no disabled toilet and we have a child in a wheelchair starting our school in September.”In addition, he said there was no hot water in the school and it was too cold to work in during winter due to single-glazed windows and an ineffective heating system.The school, which has 175 pupils and 25 members of staff, was founded more than 150 years ago by the Christian Brothers. Its current building was built in 1969 and has been unaltered since.ActionIn a recent letter to Minister for Education Joe McHugh, he wrote that the school has “had enough” and wants action.“I wish to inform that if no concrete plan is put in place before Easter, we will not return to this building after the Easter holidays. If necessary I can supply you with a letter condemning the building,” he wrote.“Therefore, I require you to source alternative accommodationschool for our 175 pupils and 25 members of staff.”A spokeswoman for the Department of Education said it had been “advised of the concerns raised and is in contact with the school to progress the matter”.While the school was successful in 2015 in its application for a major extension and renovation, Mr O’Sullivan said no work had begun on site.In the meantime, he said, enrolments had risen by 20 per cent and were due to rise further next September.This meant the school had outgrown the planned extension “even before it has been built”, he said.While the school applied for a larger extension six months ago, Mr O’Sullivan said no response had been received to date.“This consideration process, as I well know at this stage, takes years,” he said. “In the meantime I have just received a grant for an additional four classrooms to be housed in prefabs. I feel the attitude from the department is to give us prefabs and to forget about us.”The department had previously said it was investing record sums in delivering 23,000 permanent school places this year, while projects in a further 700 schools were taking place under “summer works” schemes."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3834358.1553195816!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"invasive rodent spotted along dublin s royal canal","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA coypu in a park in western Germany. The rodents carry several diseases harmful to humans and domestic animals. Photograph: Yann SchreiberAFPGetty Waterways Ireland has warned the public to be on the alert for a very “large invasive rodent” species which has been spotted along the Royal Canal in Dublin.Sightings of coypu, a semi-aquatic creature with bright orange teeth, a long cylindrical tail, and webbed back feet have been reported near the Ashtown area of the canal close to Castleknock.The rodents, which can be up to a metre long and weigh up to 9kg, carry a number of diseases harmful to humans and domestic animals.Waterways Ireland has issued an “invasive species alert” and warned the public “not to engage” the animals or make any attempt to trap them but to report any sightings, with photographs where possible.Coypu are “highly invasive impacting on wildlife, river and canal bank stability and is a pest of agriculture crops”, Waterways Ireland said.“Eradication programmes can cost several millions of euro and are not always successful.”“Its appearance is similar to a very large rat it could even be mistaken for a bulky otter at first sight,” Waterways Ireland said, but unlike an otter it does not have a fur tail but a “long rat-like tail”. Coypu are vegetarian, and particularly like carrots and parsnips.\u0026nbspThe “invasive alien species” originates from wetlands in South America, and is thought to have arrived in Ireland about five years ago.

Photograph Liam BurkePress 22A suspicious package that caused the evacuation of a Limerick postal sorting office on Friday morning may be linked to recent letter bomb incidents in the UK, Minister for Justice Charlie Flanagan has said.A group calling itself “the IRA” last week claimed responsibility for the four devices that were sent to the UK two weeks ago three to London transport hubs and one to a Scottish university.In that claim of responsibility, during which a recognised New IRA code word was used, the caller said while only four parcels had been found, five had been sent.The paramilitary group was behind a recent car bombing in Derry city and it has killed prison officers in Northern Ireland in the recent years.Mr Flanagan has suggested the device found in Limerick on Friday morning could be the last of the five parcels the New IRA claimed responsibility for. The Garda has said the parcel found in Limerick appears to be “identical” to those found in the UK. “This parcel appears to be identical to parcels - pending closer forensic and ballistic examination - discovered earlier this month in London and Glasgow. “An Garda Síochána continue to liaise with the UK Authorities in relation to these investigations.”The alarm was raised at the An Post sorting office off the Dock Road in Limerick shortly after 6am on Friday when gardaí received a report of a suspect package at the depot. The building was evacuated and the Explosives Ordnance Disposal team attended the scene. Mr Flanagan said there seemed to be a connection with the four letter bombs recently discovered in London and Glasgow and the device found Limerick.“This is a despicable act. The sending of incendiary devices like this is totally unacceptable. I hope the people responsible are brought to justice,” the Minister told RTÉ’s Today with Sean O’Rourke programme.Mr Flanagan said his assumption is based on the stamp which is the same as on the letters in the UK. He said that at the time, police in the UK said there was a fifth item and this could be the fifth. “We have reason to believe this could be the case,” he said.Three devicesOn March 5th, the London politan Police last Tuesday, confirmed a call had been made to the Irish News in Belfast claiming responsibility for the three devices on behalf of the IRA.Following that call, the Met also said the devices were similar to others used by dissidents in the past.The three small devices found in London on March 5th appeared designed to catch fire rather than explode. They were sent to Waterloo rail station and buildings on the Heathrow and London City airport campuses.The package sent to the Compass Centre offices at Heathrow was opened, causing the A4 envelope the device was in to catch fire. However, the other two London packages were not opened.The following day at Glasgow University in Scotland buildings were evacuated after a device was discovered in the college’s mail room. It was not opened and there were no injuries."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3835086.1553258228!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"scientologists carried out more than 70 clean ups in dublin in past year","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tVolunteers from A Way to Happiness carry out clean up work in the Guild Street area of Dublin’s north inner city. Photograph: Dublin City CouncilThe Church of Scientology has carried out more than 70 community clean-ups at various locations around Dublin over the past year in co-ordination with local councils.Dublin City Council’s Central Area Committee revealed recently that a community group called A Way to Happiness contacted it seeking to carry out a clean-up in the Guild Street area of the north inner city, including around Sheriff Street Bridge, on March 2nd. The area is one of the most deprived parts of the capital.“They cut back heavy buddleia and cleared hard-to-reach areas. Their efforts to improve the bridge and its environs have enhanced the area greatly,” the council said in a public domain report.The Way to Happiness is the title of a 1980 pamphlet by science fiction author and Scientology founder L Ron Hubbard, which lists 21 moral commandments. Hubbard founded the church in 1953. The US and Spain are among the countries that recognise it as a religion, while other governments have declared it a cult.In 2016 the Church of Scientology launched a “National Affairs Office” on Merrion Square in Dublin. In October 2017 it opened its European base at a large church and community centre in Firhouse, Dublin.Responding to queries from The , Dublin City Council said its Central Area Office “was first contacted in 2017 by A Way to Happiness. They informed us that they were Scientologists and that they were interested in carrying out a clean-up of the areas around the lifting bridge over the Royal Canal on Sheriff Street Upper.“The usual assistance, as with other groups or community clean ups, was offered to them and hence were supplied with gloves, litter pickers, bags. When the clean-up was completed. Dublin City Council collected and removed all the bags.”Asked whether any other religious groups seek permission to carry out clean-ups, the council said “it encourages all community, residential, business and environmental groups to get involved in community clean-ups”.The Church of Scientology said too many people leave the job of cleaning community areas to the council.“The Church of Scientology has always encouraged people, no matter whether they are members or not, to take care of their environment,” a spokeswoman said.“Our volunteers have done more than 70 clean-ups at different locations around Dublin over the last year in co-ordination with the respective councils.”She added that The Way to Happiness encourages people to safeguard and improve their environment and is used by groups and iniduals around the world to “bring about moral values in a fun and cool manner”."},{"url":null,"title":"juxtaposed jigsaw art pictures","story":"Tim Klein, from Washington, USA, has been creating his surreal mash-ups from jigsaw puzzles since 1993.

Idai produced nearly a year’s worth of rain in just a few days - more than two feet in parts of the region.Second, the region has been suffering from sustained drought in recent years, itself a problem associated with climate change. The hard, parched earth was unable to absorb water quickly, increasing the risk of flash flooding.Third, rising sea levels mean that storm surges are much more powerful, increasing the risk of the sort of inland flooding seen in the port city of Beira. Sea levels are about a foot higher than a century ago fed by melting ice at the poles.What do the experts say?“Cyclone Idai is a clear demonstration of the exposure and vulnerability of many low-lying cities and towns to sea-level rise as the impact of climate change continues to influence and disrupt normal weather patterns,” said Mami Mizutori, the UN’s Special Representative for Disaster Risk Reduction.What does the future look like for the region?Rebuilding with climate change in mind will be essential. This was not done after the last major cyclone 19 years ago. Roads, housing, utilities should all be built with future storms and flooding in mind.Sounds expensive, can this be done?Ironically, climate change makes future-proofing more difficult as the region’s economy, and therefore its capacity to rebuild, has already been depleted by rising temperatures, drought etc.At the Paris climate summit in 2015, then-prime minister of Mozambique, Carlos Agostinho do Rosario, said: “These weather phenomena affect the government’s efforts to meet national priorities, especially food security, that are critical to poverty reduction.”Secretary General of International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), Elhadj As Sy talks with a survivor of Cyclone Idai, at an evacuation centre in Beira, MozambiqueYes, developed nations, including the UK, are scrambling to send aid and disaster relief teams to the area.The rich nations also pledged in Paris 2015 to ramp up aid to $100 billion per year in restorative climate funding to poorer nations by 2020. This is because industrialisation in the west caused most of the current rise in global temperatures. But so far less than 10 per cent of this funding has been secured.Protect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health Security Please review our commenting policyBrexit latest news: Downing Street draws up plan which could lead to soft Brexit as it gives \u0026#39multiple choice\u0026#39 test to MPs Prince Charles, William and Harry take on rare engagement as a trio: a night out to watch Sir David Attenborough\u0026#39s new Netflix showFemale soldier to command infantry troops having passed Brecon courseHead of IRA \u0026#39gives permission for four men responsible for Birmingham pub bombings to be named\u0026#39Comment: Jeremy Corbyn\u0026#39s hypocrisy on Europe knows no boundsIs Emmanuel Macron Tony Blair\u0026#39s agent provocateur to ensure Brexit fails?Nigella says food pictures on Instagram are ruining aesthetic of dishes as she launches her own app\u0026#39Sacrificing May will not save the Conservative Party\u0026#39 -  readers on the week\u0026#39s top storiesDirty water kills thousands more children than bullets and bombs in war Easter 2019: Forbidden eggs, Eostre and how the date is decidedBusinessman ordered to pay back £21,000 to council after illegal tree pruning increased value of his homeChristopher Davies MP admits two false expenses chargesEurope\u0026#39s first underwater restaurant has opened in Norway – and is fully booked for six monthsUS ramps up pressure on North Korea with new sanctionsComment: The DUP wants to support a deal, but Mrs May\u0026#39s weakness gives it reason to be warySyria criticises US\u0026#39s \u0026#39blind bias\u0026#39 to Israel over Golan Heights decisionHow Emmanuel Macron seized control of the fate of Brexit from Theresa May\u0026#39s hands - as EU\u0026#39s facade of unity started to crackLibby Squire: Police confirm body found in Humber Estuary is missing studentWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/03/22/TELEMMGLPICT000189637015_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqXw_q8sP29F1hRGB6m7SSNffUWwcMnKWPu3WaWPvcxFA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"head ira gives permission member name four responsible birmingham","story":"Tavern in the Town the day after the bombingsThe head of the IRA has given permission for the 1974 Birmingham pub bombers to be named at an inquest, jurors have been told.The blasts at the Mulberry Bush in the base of the city\u0027s Rotunda, and the basement Tavern in the Town in nearby New Street, killed 21 people and injured 220 more.On Friday, in a dramatic turn, an anonymous ex-IRA volunteer giving evidence at inquests said he had been told by the current head of the IRA, six months ago in Dublin, that he could name those who he knew were involved.Bereaved families have waited 44 years for fresh inquests, which are now in their fourth week.In the biggest moment of the hearing so far, the man, identified only as Witness O, made the revelations over a secure video-link.The names given by Witness O:The man named the officer commanding (OC) the Birmingham IRA at the time as Seamus McLoughlan, as the person responsible for selecting the targets.He added that Mick Murray was one of the bombers and claimed he recalled how Murray told him there would be no harm if similar bombings had been repeated, because of the chaos caused.When pressed by a lawyer for the bereaved families, he said Michael Hayes and James Gavin were also part of the team.It is understood Mr Hayes is the only man still alive, which is why Witness O was reluctant to give up his name.Pressed by Lesley Thomas, the barrister representing nine of the bereaved families, that another member of the bombings team was Michael Hayes, he replied: Hayes, Hayes - I\u0027ll give it (the name) to you now.He added, in apparent reference to the Good Friday Agreement: But he can\u0027t be arrested.There is nobody going to be charged with this atrocity. The British Government have signed an agreement with the IRA.Inside the Mulberry Bush pub in Birmingham after the blastThen asked about James Gavin, he replied: Well he was (involved), I met him in Dublin and he said he was.All four men have been previously named in connection with the bombings, but not in a formal setting.Witness O, who described the bombings as an atrocity, said he had nothing to do with the attacks as he had been remanded to Winson Green jail some time before.He also claimed he had given McLoughlan\u0027s name to two police detectives while in HMP Winson Green just days after the bombings, but heard nothing more.He added that two other men, who he identified as Dublin Dave and Socks had also been involved, but that he did not know either man\u0027s name.Bereaved families have waited 44 years for fresh inquests, which are now in their fourth week.The wrecked interior of the Mulberry BushMr Thomas QC then asked about whether Michael Patrick Reilly had been involved.The witness, who told the jury he was a convicted IRA bomber who served a prison sentence in the 1970s, replied: No, I don\u0027t remember him at all. Reilly? I would remember that.The barrister then used an alleged reference to Mr Reilly, used in the book Error of Judgement by former MP and journalist Chris Mullin, when he asked the former IRA man: Michael Patrick Reilly, sometimes referred to as \u0027The Young Planter\u0027?You know who he is, don\u0027t you? He\u0027s the one you\u0027re protecting, isn\u0027t he?My situation was I was in Manchester, and I came to Birmingham and I was only in Birmingham a couple of weeks.Mr Reilly has always denied any involvement in the bombings.Cyclone Idai and climate change: The Key questionsBrexit latest news: Downing Street draws up plan which could lead to soft Brexit as it gives \u0026#39multiple choice\u0026#39 test to MPs Prince Charles, William and Harry take on rare engagement as a trio: a night out to watch Sir David Attenborough\u0026#39s new Netflix showFemale soldier to command infantry troops having passed Brecon courseComment: Jeremy Corbyn\u0026#39s hypocrisy on Europe knows no boundsIs Emmanuel Macron Tony Blair\u0026#39s agent provocateur to ensure Brexit fails?Nigella says food pictures on Instagram are ruining aesthetic of dishes as she launches her own app\u0026#39Sacrificing May will not save the Conservative Party\u0026#39 -  readers on the week\u0026#39s top storiesDirty water kills thousands more children than bullets and bombs in war Easter 2019: Forbidden eggs, Eostre and how the date is decidedBusinessman ordered to pay back £21,000 to council after illegal tree pruning increased value of his homeChristopher Davies MP admits two false expenses chargesEurope\u0026#39s first underwater restaurant has opened in Norway – and is fully booked for six monthsUS ramps up pressure on North Korea with new sanctionsComment: The DUP wants to support a deal, but Mrs May\u0026#39s weakness gives it reason to be warySyria criticises US\u0026#39s \u0026#39blind bias\u0026#39 to Israel over Golan Heights decisionHow Emmanuel Macron seized control of the fate of Brexit from Theresa May\u0026#39s hands - as EU\u0026#39s facade of unity started to crackLibby Squire: Police confirm body found in Humber Estuary is missing studentWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/03/22/TELEMMGLPICT000190599664_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq3sEH_yV4dXVk2s5XBlgFTRUKg3c_XqNfjbVbSnR_MM0.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"mystery ira letter bomb found sorting office weeks packages","story":"The letter bomb sent to HeathrowThe mystery fifth letter bomb sent by a group calling itself the IRA is believed to have been finally located at a sorting office in Limerick. A group calling itself the IRA claimed responsibility for sinister parcels sent to major transport hubs in London and a university in Glasgow earlier this month, one of which burst into flames when it was opened. The organisation, known to police as the New IRA, claimed one parcel, addressed to a British army recruitment officer, may not have been discovered yet.The group claimed it posted five devices to addresses in Britain, but only four had been discovered at the time the claim of responsibility was sent to a Belfast newsroom.Defence minister Charlie Flanagan said a stamp on the package found in a postal sorting office in Limerick had a similar stamp to those letter bombs sent to the UK.This is a despicable act, he told RTE.

Although at first some found them strange-looking or were convinced they would fall out of their ears, they quickly became the in-ear wireless headphone to aspire to.Rarely in the two years and three months since launch has demand eased off. As a result, the look has gone from curious to acceptable to – dare I say it\u0026nbsp– iconic. And certainly ubiquitous.Now, the second-generation AirPods have been announced, I talked to Greg Joswiak, Apple’s Vice President of Product Marketing and Kate Bergeron, Vice President of Hardware Engineering about the new arrivals.The new AirPods look, at first glance, like the older model, even down to the price, which remains the same at £159. There is no difference in the look or shape of the buds themselves and there is only one visible change to the case: a Wireless Charging Case is now available\u0026nbspfor an extra £40, allowing you to place the case on a compatible wireless charging pad instead of plugging it in with a Lightning cable.This means there’s a tiny LED on the outside of the case to show when it’s charging.\u0026nbspThe new\u0026nbspAirPods\u0026nbspare on sale online now and will be in Apple Stores next week.Created with Sketch.Apple unveils the iPhone X Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, introduces the iPhone x during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, introduces the iPhone X during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, introduces the iPhone X during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, introduces the iPhone x during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, introduces the iPhone x during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, introduces the iPhone x during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, shows Animoji during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, speaks during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, introduces the iPhone x during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017Tim Cook, CEO of Apple, speaks about the iPhone X during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, introduces the iPhone x during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, introduces the iPhone X during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, introduces the iPhone X during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, introduces the iPhone x during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, introduces the iPhone x during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, introduces the iPhone x during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, shows Animoji during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, speaks during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, introduces the iPhone x during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017Tim Cook, CEO of Apple, speaks about the iPhone X during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017So far, so good.“The bigger picture, though, is that AirPods simply deliver a magical wireless experience.”I’m not sure I like using the word magical, but I see what he’s saying. Pairing AirPods with an iPhone is exceptionally simple. As Joswiak explains, “As soon as you’ve pulled the AirPods out of the box and flipped open the lid on the case, there’s a simple one-tap set-up, they’re automatically paired and connected. Once you’ve done that, they’re immediately set up to work with all your Apple devices, including an Apple Watch, iPad or Mac that uses the same Apple ID. Once you’ve used AirPods, you never go back. They’re the most popular wireless headphones in the world. They’ve become a cultural phenomenon. For us, they’re the key ingredient to the wireless future. We designed them to be effortless to use.”Open the case near an iPhone and a screen will pop up showing the exact battery life. And there are other cool features, like the way when you’re talking to someone, and you naturally take one of the AirPods out your ear to do so, the music pauses, resuming when you put the bud back into your ear.All these features remain the same in the new version. By the way, you can use AirPods with Android phones, for instance, but the pairing is not as seamless.Kate Bergeron explains the new headphones in more detail:\u0026nbsp“When we were thinking about generation two, we really wanted to focus on this new H1 chip that was designed specifically for headphones. We’re combining wireless technology which is a hallmark of Apple’s and very highly customised audio. Together, these things create an amazing audio experience. Because the H1 chip is more powerful, it delivers some profound efficiencies, which means you can have Siri available all the time.”Ah, yes, I forgot to say, another AirPods feature is the way you can tap on either of the buds while they are in your ear and then ask Siri, Apple’s virtual personal assistant, to change the track, lift the volume or even give you spoken directions to wherever you’re going.AirPods 2 on Wednesday, 20 March (Apple)Now, with the new AirPods, you don’t need to tap. Just say, “Hey, Siri” and it will respond. This is made possible thanks to the H1 chip saving so much battery life that it can be listening for the magic wake words at all times.“So, we’re able to have \u0027Hey, Siri\u0027 listening enabled at all times and still keep the same battery life as before: five hours’ listening time is still achieved thanks to this new chip,” Bergeron says.“In addition, we’ve been able to deliver 50 per cent more talk time so when you’re on a call, you’ll have three hours of battery life, not two.”Leaving aside whether jabbering on for three hours is really desirable, this is quite a feat. So, how come more talk time but no extra battery life? That’s because when you’re talking, listening out for “Hey, Siri” is turned off.Switching between devices is up to twice as fast, now, too. “If you’re using your AirPods between your Mac, your iPhone and your iPad, switching is even more seamless and the connection to phone calls, when you’re pulling your AirPods out of your pocket to connect to a phone call, is up to 50 per cent faster than before,” Bergeron says. “In addition, for some casual gaming on your iPhone, for instance, we’re able to provide up to 30 per cent lower latency.”My experience of Apple’s stats in situations like this is that the figures don’t mean that much but the experience when you use them is noticeably different.Apple leak reveals bizarre new feature for 2019 iPhoneApple unveils brand new iPads in surprise announcementThe improved chip means improved audio in different ways, too. “The combination of the wireless changes we’ve made in the chip as well as the audio gives a more robust wireless connection, which turns into better audio quality in different conditions. When going outside, some people have found that in that environment there can be problems maintaining RF (radio frequency) links. Now, in all sorts of different conditions we find we’re able to have better audio quality all the time.”The LED on the new wireless charging case is the main visible difference compared to the previous case. “The cases are exactly the same size, there’s a slight increase in weight thanks to adding the wireless charging coil but it’s negligible.”Wireless charging is traditionally slower than through a Lightning cable. “It’s just over two hours to charge the case from zero to 100 per cent via Lightning,” Joswiak chips in, “and around three-and-a-half hours wirelessly. But realistically, customers rarely charge from zero, and the fast charge is the same as before – just put the AirPods themselves into the charging case for 15 minutes and you get three hours of listening time.”Apple is expected to release a new version of iOS, the operating software for iPhones and iPads, soon. I wonder if the new hands-free Siri feature will have to wait for that, but Joswiak’s reply is elegant rather than factually revealing: “We always recommend that for every new product that customers install the latest version of software that’s available at that time.”Reading the runes, I would imagine it means that by the time the new AirPods reach customers next week, that enhanced software will be available to make hands-free Siri work.The new AirPods are a big event because almost no product attracts the level of interest of these little in-ear wireless headphones.\u0026nbsp Next week, if they live up to Apple’s promises, they’ll be even more desirable.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The family Chung family is locked in a battle with Elliott over HyundaiHyundai Motor was celebrating victory this morning. Its investors rejected a demand for the appointment of several new directors and a huge special idend, tabled by the activist investor, Elliott Advisers, which has become a major thorn in the side of the South Korean conglomerate.\u0026nbspPaul Singer’s outfit may have pushed too hard when it came to the size of the Won7tn (£4.7bn) idend it wanted. Hyundai has vast reserves of cash, but its profits have been in decline and the global outlook is cloudy for the motor industry. Given the latter, it’s perhaps understandable that investors baulked and opted for the company’s offer, even though it is worth less than a sixth of what Elliott was proposing.It was on far firmer ground with its demand for a shake up in the boardroom to foster improved governance and greater accountability at the firm, one of the country’s famed family controlled Chaebol that have long dominated the South Asian nation’s vibrant economy. They have been facing criticism on a number of fronts, including the charge of taking minority investors for granted.\u0026nbspHyundai creates app to unlock and control vehicles with mobile phoneHyundai unveils walking car to help save livesHyundai to introduce new electric cars for 2022While this battle may have been lost Elliott’s war is far from over.\u0026nbspIt won a dust up\u0026nbspover a proposed\u0026nbspownership restructuring last year, which critics held was designed solely to benefit the Chung family, and cement its control.The next one will come when a revised plan is submitted later this year. Hyundai only needed the support of 50 per cent of its investors to knock Elliott back over the idend and board seats, and it was assisted by investors such as South Korea’s National Pension Service, the second biggest shareholder, falling in behind the Chung family.\u0026nbspA revised restructuring plan could require up to two thirds support to pass. Elliott should find that easier to win if it objects by aligning with other overseas investors. They hold about half the company.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Business news: in pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.110 No deal, no tariffsThe government has announced that it would slash almost all tariffs in the event of a no-deal Brexit.

But, inevitably, as he scrawls out his campaigning brainwaves on a whiteboard, there is a touch of that deductive maverick Sherlock in his portrayal of this scruffy, balding political saboteur.” 1618 The Paras: Men of War (ITV)“From the outset the production is elevated by its sensitive handling of the men – and the Paratroopers remain exclusively male – involved.

The character is as old as Daisy Buchanan or Lydia Bennett or Scarlett O’Hara. The best compliment to Waller-Bridge and her cast is that they find fresh clothes in which to dress these ancient monsters.It is sometimes remarked that the Troubles in Northern Ireland make for an unpromising backdrop for a sitcom about adolescent kids. Well, yer man’s wrong, as they might say. Derry Girls, returning for a triumphant and exuberant second run, proves that humour, dark or otherwise, can be quarried from even the most unlikely of locations.Home is a rather gentle, unobtrusive variation on the sitcom theme – but one that is built on a quite a bizarre premise. The twist is that a family who returns to Surrey from a holiday touring around France discover a Syrian refugee stuffed in the back of their SUV. Not only that, but, after a few moments of blind terrified panic about a suicide bombing, they eventually adopt him like he’s stray cat that’s just wandered in.Michael Jackson has long looked like a burning tire yard.

Are you kidding me? Give me a break! Everyone, including Facebook, have tech debt and security debt that piles up. But that\u0027s not an excuse any longer, Sam Curry, chief security officer at security firm Cybereason, told\u0026nbspThe Independent.Facebook is starting to look like critical social infrastructure, where there responsibility is to the public. It\u0027s past time to go back and clean the skeletons out of the closets. How can we trust this platform to get bigger and get more connected under the hood if they can\u0027t do the basis blocking and tackling right? Facebook needs a security strategy for the 21st century not the 20th century.

Then on 25 October a cow fell ill on a farm near the market town of Oswestry in Shropshire.That was the beginning of an epidemic that only ended five months later, with the farming business on its knees and huge areas of the country covered by overlapping five-mile exclusion zones.A total of 442,000 animals had been slaughtered in 2,364 separate outbreaks. Roughly £150m\u0026nbsp–\u0026nbspa huge amount at the time –\u0026nbspwas spent on slaughter costs and lost sales farmers received £27m in compensation.It became known as the Great Cattle Plague, and even today it is still the subject of angry discussion in rural circles.As outbreaks popped up around the country, triggered by the combination of the virus’s 14-day incubation period and its extreme infectiousness, the Ministry of Agriculture began imposing five-mile exclusion zones as new infections were identified animals could not be moved in or out.Created with Sketch.Looking back at Britain’s foot-and-mouth outbreaks: 1927-1967 Show all 25Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Two farmworkers read a notice declaring a footpath closed because of foot-and-mouthA man hoses down a car at Cockernach Farm, Barkway,  Hertfordshire, in an attempt to contain the spread of foot-and-mouth.

Entrances to fields and farms were blocked with disinfected straw members of the public were not allowed to enter them.Humans are usually safe from the disease, but at least one person died from the epidemic some of the worst outbreaks were in Cheshire, Shropshire and Wales.The disease was later reckoned to have been virtually eradicated throughout the European Union after a campaign of vaccination and slaughter. That makes yesterday’s action, in which the EU banned all meat, milk and livestock exports from the UK, understandable.After slaughter, farms had to be scrubbed twice a day with special disinfectant and animals were not allowed on to the land for at least six months. Restricted entry signs stood over the entrance to farmland, bearing warnings including: “You are now entering an infected area.”Horse racing was suspended in Britain after the 1967 outbreak and the official Shrovetide football game in Ashbourne, Derbyshire, was cancelled in 1968 because of continuing restrictions.The outbreak was finally linked to frozen lamb carcasses imported from Argentina.Although Britain did suffer another foot-and-mouth outbreak in 1981 on the Isle of Wight, it was easily isolated. A total of 200 cattle and 369 pigs were destroyed.This article first appeared in The Independent on 22 February 2001We’ll tell you what’s true.

In nine days, Scottish farmers and dealers reach the more important deadline when they can apply for a resumption of overseas exports, because then they will have been free of the disease for 90 days.The auction at Kirkwall, capital of the Orkneys six miles off the mainland, was seen as a trial run for the resumption of trade in other unaffected areas of the United Kingdom.Though no more than two dozen buyers, many of them mainland farmers from Aberdeenshire, made the ferry trip for yesterday’s sale, only auction and government veterinary officials, and representatives from the Scottish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, were allowed close contact with the livestock. The buyers, dressed from head-to-toe in hats, clean boiler suits, rubber boots and white plastic raincoats, had to forgo the usual close inspections of the cattle before the sale began.For the Orcadians, the resumption of the weekly cattle mart was more than just a lifeline for business. The social effect of the closure has been devastating. Since the beginning of the crisis, movement on the island has been curtailed because friends and neighbours fearful of spreading the disease kept their distance from other farms.Created with Sketch.How the 2001 foot-and-mouth outbreak brought Britain to a standstill Show all 26Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Around 150 dead cows that may have come in contact with foot-and-mouth disease are burnt on a funeral pyre at Great Warley Hall farm in Great Warley, Essex, 27 February 2001.

There’s much still to do to get out of the mess that foot-and-mouth has caused and get the farmers back to a kind of normality.”Steven Metcalf, chairman of Orkney Auction Mart, said: “The social effect of the mart reopening is good news. Early in the outbreak people were frightened to move around and weren’t visiting neighbours or friends. It is a good boost for the morale of agriculture and it is a step nearer to normal trading and normal life.”Although the slaughter of more than 800,000 animals north of the border has so far limited the number of confirmed cases to 187, Maria Limonci, spokeswoman for the NFUS, said Scottish farmers needed to see export bans lifted. “Around 40 per cent of the sheep produced in Scotland usually go out of the country and at present they have nowhere to go,” she said. “More farmers deal in sheep than cattle, and this was only one sale. It’s a huge step in the right direction but it doesn’t mean things are now OK.“We have to hope nothing goes wrong in next few days. Having 90 clear days would give Scotland grounds to put forward the proposal to Europe to allow exports to restart.”In England, continuing restrictions prompted 600 farmers yesterday to demand a public inquiry into the handling of the crisis.David Handley, head of the pressure group Farmers For Action who spearheaded last year’s fuel blockade, led a protest march from Hyde Park to Downing Street to hand in a petition condemning the government’s policy on dealing with the crisis and the failure to implement a vaccination strategy to prevent the spread of the disease.Although the turnout was lower than expected, protesters included farmers from foot-and-mouth hotspots in North Yorkshire, Cumbria and Devon and Cornwall.Up to 3,000 civil servants at the Department of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs held a one-day strike on 20 August 2001 over pay inequalities that followed formation of the new departmentThis article first appeared in The Independent on 21 August 2001We’ll tell you what’s true.

Nor is the belief that it remains one even now. Knowledgeable historians calculated that it was once the greatest empire in human history, if one takes into account both the territory it controlled and the time its\u0026nbspdomination lasted.\u0026nbspAdventurous political analysts have argued that in recent times Russia is inclined to regain its imperial powers. As Zbigniew Brzesinski, the former\u0026nbspnational security adviser to President Jimmy Carter, put it in 1997: “without Ukraine, Russia ceases to be a Eurasian empire … however, if Moscow regains control over Ukraine, Russia automatically again regains the wherewithal to become a powerful imperial state, ning Europe and Asia.”\u0026nbspThe annexation of Crimea is apparent evidence of this process.Yet many observers believe the present “empire” (ie the Russian Federation) might itself collapse once more, dissolving into different parts. Some politicians hope that it will.Very few, however, attempt to understand the nature of the Russian imperial project – and the similarities and differences between the Russian empire and the other European ones.The most striking similarity between the Russian and the western imperial histories – the one that is arguably critical to any European adventure of the kind – is the fact that they were clearly ided into two discrete, consecutive phases.\u0026nbspWhat the Roman empire can tell us about modern middle eastThe first was the period of settler colonisation, by which the applicable imperial power subjugates great landmasses either on its own continent or overseas, and relocates there significant numbers of people, to the point they are able to outnumber the indigenous tribes. This was the case for the Russians in Siberia, for the French in Louisiana and Canada, for the British in the Thirteen Colonies, Australia and New Zealand, as well as, in some senses, for the Spanish in Latin America.\u0026nbspAll these appropriations were made between the early 16th and mid-18th centuries and resulted in what Angus Maddison called “the western offshoots”.\u0026nbspThe second phase involved more straightforward military conquest this tended to see locals being dominated by relatively small regular armies and a complicated system of vassalage (like in the case of the British Raj in India). Here Russia followed the western path as well: just as the French conquered Indochina and west Africa and the British took huge parts of Asia, from modern Pakistan to Malaya, and of Africa, from Kenya to Rhodesia, so the Russians added to their empire both the Caucasus and parts of central Asia, confronting the British during the Pandjeh incident of 1885.In both phases, Russia was as European in its behaviour as either Great Britain or France: it built its empire directed by European logic and using European means of communication and warfare. Nevertheless, between the western method and the Russian approach there was one huge difference.Created with Sketch.Protests break out after Russia seize Ukraine warships Show all 32Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Activists of opposition parties burn flares during a rally demanding to break an agreement with Russia on the use of the Azov Sea and the Kerch Strait, in front of the parliament building in KievVolunteers with the right-wing paramilitary Azov National Corps light flares during a rally on the snowy streets in front of the Ukrainian parliament in Kiev after Russia seized two of their armored artillery vessels and a tug boat in the Black SeaUkrainian Nationalists demand to break the diplomatic relations with Russia and nationalization of Russian property in UkraineUkrainian activists burn flares during their rally in front of Russian Consulate in KharkivSeized Ukrainian ships, small armoured artillery ships and a tug boat, are seen anchored in a port of KerchThe President of Ukraine, Petro Poroshenko, announced, on 25 November, at a meeting of the National Security and Defense Council that they will introduce martial law in Ukraine for a period of 60 days and appeal to the Parliament to consider the moveRussia seized two small-sized \u0027Berdiansk\u0027 and \u0027Nikopol\u0027 armored artillery boats.

This forced the colonial powers to turn to military force effectively to create new, second empires – usually in different places.\u0026nbspIn Russia’s empire, meanwhile, neither its Siberian provinces nor the newly “reconciled” lands of today’s Ukraine and Belarus tried to secede.\u0026nbspTherefore, while Britain and France in fact possessed two different empires each, consecutively, the first and the second Russian empires (the first achieved through settler colonisation, the second through military action) were simply added to one another, rather like the traditional Russian matryoshka doll.\u0026nbspThis key difference between the imperial histories of Russia and the west helps to explain how the European powers have ended up where they are today.In particular, let’s consider the dissolution of the Soviet Union. With some minor exceptions, the borders of Russia now resemble those that existed in the mid-17th century, the time when the first empires of both Russia and the west powers were almost complete. Therefore, I would argue that the fall of the USSR was broadly the same process which evolved on a global scale between the end of the Second World War and the early 1970s and which is widely known as “decolonisation”\u0026nbsp(I dislike the word because I believe the European overseas appropriations of the time were not colonies, but rather military controlled possessions).\u0026nbspBut whereas this process ultimately left countries like Britain and France without empires at all, today’s Russia lost only its second – by retaining its first, it never lost its ambition for future re-expansion.For political elites in Russia and Ukraine, war still makes senseHere we should return to history.\u0026nbspThe Russian and the western empires were similar as it comes to the timings of their creation and to the methods of their construction – but they differ from each other in terms of the actors that stood behind the process.In western Europe the major nations (kingdoms then of course) had gained a clear national identity before they started their colonial adventures. Portugal, the oldest European nation state, fully sovereign since 1143, was the first to launch its overseas expansion. France emerged in full grandeur after peace with Britain in 1453 and the defeat of Burgundy in 1482 Spain became united in 1469 and Britain itself evolved as a single state after England was joined by Scotland and Ireland under James I in 1603.\u0026nbspWe can see this period as pre-imperial. By the time the Portuguese, the Spanish, the French, and the British sought to expand overseas, their own national unity was beyond question. This meant that when their first empires dissolved towards the end of the 18th and beginning of the 19th centuries, little damage was done to the sense of national identity of the imperial bases. As a consequence, the later, “second” empires appeared in the same sense British and French, as were the earlier ones.Contemporary Russia remains and will remain an empire since it simply has no place to retreat toIn Russia, things followed a different path. Moscow, a small settlement at the time when the Kievan Rus’ (the medieval alliance of Slavic and Finnic groups) reached its apex in the 11th and 12th centuries, became stronger when the separated Russian princedoms fought for their liberation from the Mongols.\u0026nbspTill that time, the vast country we call Russia today was united not so much by national or even quasi-national identity, as by its Orthodox faith as well as by the belief that it had become the beacon of the “true” Christian faith after the fall of Constantinople.\u0026nbspThe Muscovites overthrew the Mongol domination in 1480 and less than a century later ruined the Mongol khanates in the Volga region and started their expansion to the east. It took them another 100\u0026nbspyears to reach the Pacific shores – but in the west they weren’t able to advance further than the current border between Russia and Belarus.\u0026nbsp“Russia” as the country’s name became widespread in the mid-17th century as all the three major centres of Russian statehood – Novgorod, Kiev and Vladimir – started to be governed from Moscow. But the key point about this development is that the Russian state emerged as an empire, was administered as an empire, and possessed many other imperial elements. In other words, Russia itself arose as an empire – built not by Russia, but rather by Muscovy. Therefore the first Russian empire was actually the empire of Moscow, and not the empire of Russia.The Muscovy-built empire called Russia consolidated itself during the 17th and 18th century, strengthening its domination both in its settler colonies in the east and in the “original” “Russian” lands in the west.\u0026nbspOnly as this consolidation process was actually completed did Russia begin\u0026nbspto conquer militarily neighbouring lands – from Finland in the North to the Caucasus in the south from Poland in the west to Bukhara and Kokand in the southeast.\u0026nbspAs such, the second Russian empire became an empire built by Russia, not Muscovy and in a self-fulfilling cycle, bolstered the sense of a “Russian” national identity.\u0026nbspThe imperial core of all the western European examples remained the same from beginning to end (Britain, France, Spain etc) in the Russian case, it changed from Muscovy to Russia. Therefore, in the 20th century it was not only Stalin’s will that ided the Soviet Union into different “Socialist Republics”, but rather Russia’s entire history. The vast “country” of the USSR consisted of the Russian republic, which had boundaries similar to the first Russian empire, and all the other republics which replicated the second Russian empire’s military possessions.\u0026nbspIt should be noted that while in the USSR-era Russian republic Russians themselves accounted for 81.5 per cent of the population according to the 1989 census. In none of the other Soviet republics did they make even a simple majority.\u0026nbspThis history and these demographics were the two major factors that made the Soviet Union ready for speedy disintegration after 1989.From all this, three crucial conclusions can be drawn.First, contemporary Russia remains and will remain an empire since it simply has no place to retreat to. As Russia lost its possessions in 1991 it returned to an entity territorially similar to one that started the last wave of expansion in the late 18th century.\u0026nbspOn the face of it, it looks like all the other European empires which, during the “decolonisation” of the 20th century were pushed back to those territorial limits from which they began. But while the western imperial cores were and always had been nation states, (some of them democracies and even republics), Russia was itself an empire when it started to expand two and a half centuries ago.\u0026nbspA socially acceptable form of murderRussia detains two US Mormons as tensions flare US generals ‘thinking about possibility of nuclear war’Russia orders all orcas and belugas kept in \u0027whale prison\u0027 be set freeThe Russians are European people who share the major European values and principles – but nevertheless Russia as a country arose not as a nation based on these values but as an empire driven by a thirst for power and expansion.\u0026nbspIf a nation state builds an empire and fails, it comes back to being a (hopefully better) nation state, one which transcends imperial aspirations. But if an empire constructs an even bigger empire and fails, it reemerges as an offended, revanchist and aggressive empire – exactly as Russia now looks like.The second I draw is that we should not expect Russia to fall apart, as many current observers suggest. Even though the country remains multiethnic, the Russians make up the majority of the population in almost every part of the country. I cannot think of any cases in which truly consolidated, culturally homogenous country collapses and is ided into parts unless as the result of a war (a prospect for which there are no markers).\u0026nbspInstances of countries existing as ided entities but being inhabited by the same ethnic group or people were all caused by military conflicts (East and West Germany, South and North Korea, North\u0026nbspand South\u0026nbspVietnam, continental China and Taiwan).\u0026nbspNo foreign force could at present defeat Russia militarily and cut it into parts moreover, the fear of external powers is so huge in today’s Russia that those parts of the country that used to have some inclination for greater autonomy (like\u0026nbspeastern Siberia or the far\u0026nbspeast), no longer do.\u0026nbspAnxiety in those areas about the growing influence of China outweighs any concerns about growing pressure from and “exploitation” by the (imperial) centre. As Russia becomes weaker in the economic and political sense, any outsider hopes for its dismemberment actually fade.The final conclusion is the most important and it is this. There is, despite everything, a crucial weakness in the existing political construct of the Russian “Federation”. Inside this federation there are still several regions that look completely alien to it – those that were acquired not during the first wave of empire-building but during the second.\u0026nbspThese territories are the entire north Caucasus, which was attached to Russia as a result of bloody wars in the mid-19th century, and the Republic of Tuva at the border with Mongolia that first became part of the Soviet Union in 1944. The north Causasus lands are by no means “Russian”: today the complete share of the ethnic Russian, Ukrainian and Belarusian population in the “Russian” republic of Ingushetia is a mere 0.9 per cent. Compare this with\u0026nbspremote Kyrgyzstan, a sovereign nation in central Asia, where it accounts for close to 6 per cent.\u0026nbspThese parts of the current Russia are elements of the second empire which were incorporated into the first one due to a historical mistake. Things were nearly different: in early 1990s, as Chechnya revolted against the Russian rule, it was thought other regional republics were ready to follow – but it never happened. \u0026nbspNow, Russia claims it “re-established” its control over its former military possessions, although in reality it pays countless tribute to local “khans” and “emirs”. In the end though, these remnants of the second Russia empire will surely secede at some stage.\u0026nbspIn sum then, Russia is a unique creature: not so much superior to other European empires, but drastically different from them. These differences shouldn’t be either neglected or denied one should look on the country sine ira et studio for exploring its European nature and history and for understanding what might be expected from it in the future.\u0026nbspRussia is the last existing empire – and an empire that lasts, if not forever, than for longer than its western equivalents. It should not be criticised for this, but explored and investigated.Vladislav Inozemtsev’s new book, with Alexander Abalov, is ‘The Last Empire’, published\u0026nbspin Russian\u0026nbspby Alpina Publishing House.

The meth maker believes his days of cooking are long over. Having lunch with his family, everything seems perfect. And then everything goes wrong. So, so wrong. Hank (Dean Norris) goes to use the toilet and picks up a copy of Walt Whitman\u0027s Leaves of Grass – a gift from Gale to Walter White. “To my other favorited WW. It\u0027s an honour working with you. Fondly, GB.” And with that, as Hank realises Walt’s true identity, the end of Heisenberg’s empire begins.The debate over whether certain final scenes of television shows are actually good will rage on and on. The Sopranos remains front and centre of the conversation. It\u0027s a seemingly banal occasion – a restaurant dinner scene. We watch on as Tony sits there, observing other customers. Carmela arrives, then AJ and Meadow, who the last we see, is parking her car outside. A bell rings, Tony looks up and the screen cuts to black. It’s an ending that’s inspired essays offering varied interpretations but ultimately, it remains a beautifully-executed few minutes of television – and a cliffhanger that’ll never have a resolution.337 EastEnders – The Kat and Zoe revelation (2001)“You can’t tell me what to do ‘cause you ain’t my muvva”  “YES I AM!” - not the work of Shakespeare, granted, but surely one of the biggest moments in soap history. The nation’s jaws collectively dropped as they learned that Kat Slater (Jessie Wallace) wasn’t Zoe’s sister at all, but her mum.  437 Game of Thrones – The Rains of Castamere (2013)Game of Thrones knew George RR Martin was willing to kill off leading characters, but nothing prepared non-book readers for The Red Wedding. Robb Stark (Richard Madden), Talisa Stark (Oona Chaplin) and Catelyn Stark (Michelle Fairley) are attending the wedding of Roslin Frey (Alexandra Dowling) and Edmure Tully (Tobias Menzies) when things go terribly, terribly wrong for the Starks. The Freys turn on them, killing Robb, Talisa and their unborn child. Then, as the blood spills everywhere, Catelyn’s throat is slit. Cut to black. Devastating.The cliffhanger that kickstarted the end of season cliffhanger trend. Larry Hagman’s oil baron JR Ewing had made plenty of enemies in Dallas. By the end of season three, one of them took justice into their own hands, shooting JR in the back twice. However, rather than reveal the culprit, the team behind Dallas left the case unsolved. And over the next eight months – the time between seasons – the whole world was asking “Who shot JR?” Unsurprisingly, considering the hysteria around the mystery, 350 million people tuned in to watch the revelatory episode “Who Done It”.Showrunner Matt Groening had long wanted to do an episode where Mr Burns was shot, and the culprit was not revealed until the next episode. Taking inspiration from Dallas, the animation concluded Part One with the nuclear power plant owner being shot by an unknown assailant. Then, after a Summer of waiting, fans were finally treated to the answer. The two-part episode has gone down as a classic and is often heralded as the series’ best.737 Doctor Who – The Parting of the Ways (2005)Choosing one standout Doctor Who cliffhanger is almost impossible – especially when you consider that all 37 (and counting) seasons have frequently used the plot device. While the introduction of John Hurt’s Doctor certainly ranks among them, one of best came at the end of the rebooted first series. Having absorbed a bunch of vortexes, the Doctor is struggling and on the verge of regenerating. Turning to Rose (Billie Piper), Christopher Eccleston’s incarnation of the iconic character utters the timeless lines: “Before I go, I just want to tell you, you were fantastic. Absolutely fantastic. And you know what – so was I.” Queue shoddy CGI and the introduction of the soon-to-be nation’s favourite Doctor, David Tennant. “So, where was I? That’s it – Barcelona.”Gale (David Costabile) is one of the nicest characters on Breaking Bad. He is not interested in wealth or fame, but in science. However, niceties and a good cup of coffee are not enough to stop him getting in Walter White’s (Bryan Cranston) way. When the choice between their lives has to be made, Walter chooses his own and sends Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul) to do the dirty work. Season three ends with Jesse killing Gale – an incident that eventually brings down the drug kingpin Gus Fring.937 The West Wing – “What Kind of Day Has it Been” (2000)The West Wing’s biggest cliffhanger came in the season one finale. The episode works its way back from the beginning as we see a Secret Service Agent sense danger from a nearby window at a town hall meeting with the president in attendance. When the episode catches up, gunfire rings out and each member of his senior staff is thrown to the floor. Cut to black as we hear an agent ask over the radio: “Who’s been hit?”It wasn’t until the third season finale of Smallville that Superman fans’ patience was rewarded as viewers saw Clark (Tom Welling) appear naked in the middle of a Kryptonian symbol burned into the field of his family’s farm. “You shall be reborn,” Jor-El can be heard saying to Clark Kent, but he wasn’t the alone one the ending marked a radical turning point for the series.Twin Peaks’ season two finale – the mystery drama’s last episode for 27 years – may have featured the most chilling cliffhanger, but the biggest gasp of the series came at the end of season one as the seemingly untouchable Dale Cooper (Kyle MacLachlan) responds to a knock on his hotel room door, only to be gunned down by an unseen assailant.1237 Buffy the Vampire Slayer – The Gift (2001)The 100th episode of Buffy ended with one of the show’s most shocking moments (and no, we’re not talking about the musical episode). Season five concluded with the eponymous ass-kicker sacrificing herself to save the world by jumping into a demonic portal. The episode ends with a slow zoom onto Buffy’s tombstone, which reads: “Beloved sister. Devoted friend. She saved the world. A lot.“It\u0027s easy to forget that True Blood began life as an acclaimed Emmy-nominated drama, and it was a cliffhanger such as this that made it so: Sookie Stackhouse (Anna Paquin) falls asleep with the friendly neighbour dog Dean for company. Upon waking up, Dean is gone and in his place is local barman Sam Merlotte ( Sam Trammell). Turns out he\u0027s a shapeshifter.1437 The Walking Dead – Last Day on Earth (2016)After eight episodes of build-up, the comic book’s deadliest villain, Negan, reared his head in a scene fans were dreading. With the majority of the main cast lined up at his mercy, Negan – in retaliation for the death of one of his gang – decides which one to kill by using “Eeny Meeny Mino Moe”. After selecting his victim, the camera switches POV and Negan bludgeons the unseen character to death leaving fans with a six-month wait before finding out who had met their maker.Lost co-creator Damon Lindelof\u0027s HBO drama was set in a world that saw two per cent of the world’s population disappear into thin air during a tragic event known as the Sudden Departure. Season two presented an intriguing mystery: the disappearance of three teenage girls from a Texan town that nobody had vanished from. It was the season\u0027s penultimate episode that cleared up this plot line as Matt Garvey (Chris Zylka) breaks into a heavily-guarded trailer – only to be met with the three teenage girls staring back at him. What’s more is they’re dressed all in white, a callback to the disbanded cult from the first season.In episode 11, the writers had introduced a hatch buried underground and, week in week out, the fans waited patiently for any detail about the mysterious structure the writers were willing to give them. The end of episode 19 saw a desperate John Locke (Terry O’Quinn) banging on the door, just as desperate to get inside as the viewers were... only for a light to come on from within. This ending remains an unforgettable moment for those who watched it at the time of broadcast.1737 Lost – “Two for the Road” (2006)“I’m sorry.” “For what?” BANG. On paper, not so effective but on screen, it equated to one of Lost’s most gasp-inducing cliffhangers. Viewers watched behind their eyes as Michael (Harold Perrineau), desperate to save his son from the mysterious Others, shoots Ana-Lucia (Michelle Rodriguez) and, in a cruel twist, Libby (Cynthia Watros), who has accidentally stumbled upon the whole thing while looking for some blankets.1837 Lost - \u0027Through the Looking Glass – Part 2Whether you love or hate Lost, there’s no denying that the season three finale deployed one of the most breathtaking rug pulls in television history as writers Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse revealed a shake-up long in the running: flashbacks featuring a suicidal Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox) were, in fact, flashforwards to the future. The Oceanic Flight 815 plane crash survivor made it off the island he’d been so desperate to get off for three whole seasons, but was, disturbingly, desperate to get back. The ending set the benchmark for all future finale and was so huge it made newspaper headlines.1937 Line of Duty – Series four premiere (2018)The fourth series of Line of Duty didn’t hold back on the shocks. In fact, its first episode featured a cliffhanger ending to rival the best of them. With DCI Roz Huntley (Thandie Newton) dead on his floor, her murderer – Forensic Coordinator Tim Ifield (Jason Watkins) – sets about dispatching her body, but as his chainsaw nears her face, Roz’s eyes suddenly open.After season one, Heroes became pretty dreadful television. But this cliffhanger looms in the memory for being so left-field it warrants applaud: having captured serial killer Sylar, Angela Petrelli – parent to superheroes Nathan and Peter – tells him she can provide him with the love and guidance he needs. Angry, Sylar tells her she’s not his mother to which Angela drops the bombshell: “But I am dear, I am.” A head-scratching mid-season reveal that had fans chomping at the bit for the next episode.After spending an entire season watching the blossoming romance between medical intern Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo) and Dr Derek Shephard (Patrick Dempsey), the world of viewers was rocked upon discovering the shock revelation that Derek was married all along.Channel 4 sitcom Green Wing took the term “cliffhanger” quite literally for each finale of its two series. While it became a tad gimmicky the second time around, the first remained a genuinely surprising way for a comedy series to end: having discovered that the colleague he’d just slept with was his mother, drug-addled anaesthetist Guy Secretan (Stephen Mangan) steals an ambulance, drives it to the country and loses control. After crashing, the episode ends with Guy and several other characters dangling – you guessed it – off a cliff.A particularly nail-biting fourth season was shaping up to end well: after weeks of playing cat-and-mouse with the Trinity Killer (John Lithgow on Emmy-winning form), Dexter finally put an end to his murderous ways and returned home ready to pack up and join his wife Rita on their vacation. Only Rita’s still at home... dead in the bathtub. Trinity killed her before Dexter got to him. A heartbreaking end to a standout season.When things are going supremely well towards the end of a season finale, you know something big is about to go down. Battlestar Galactica proved no different. After destroying the Cylon Basestar – a warship belonging to the enemy – crew member Boomer, who viewers had learnt was a Cylon in the mini-series that aired the year before, fires a round into the chest of Commander Adama (Edward James Olmos), the show’s main character.Having been warned for two seasons that Z’ha’dum means death, fans expected big things from an episode called “Z’ha’dum”. They weren’t wrong. It ended with the show’s lead character jumping to his death. The episode was so big the episodes leading up to it teased “Z minus 14 days” and “Z minus 7 days.”24 was filled to the brim with huge cliffhangers, but this one – arriving at the 16 episode mark – stands out for sparking what would be the show’s best run of episodes. President Charles Logan (Gregory Itzin) is revealed to be the mastermind behind the shocking assassinations of David Palmer and Michelle Dessler, which kickstarted the season. And thus the show’s most memorable villain was born.2737 Friends – The One with Ross’s Wedding (1998)While Ross (David Schwimmer) and Rachel’s (Jennifer Aniston) “will they, won’t they” courtship arguably went on far too long, there was one moment during the season four finale that left fans with their jaws on the floor. Just after Rachel had accepted Ross was happy with fiancé Emily (Helen Baxendale), everything goes catastrophically wrong. Instead of saying Emily’s name during the wedding vows, Ross says the iconic line: “Take thee Rachel”. After the wedding, as the season finished, everyone was left wondering whether the pair would finally rekindle their romance for good.“I’m in a boxcar, buried inside a quarry, and there are bodies everywhere,” says Mulder to Scully during the season two finale. And just as Mulder solves the riddle of how those people died, the roof of the boxcar slams shut, trapping him inside. Worse still, the Smoking Man then arrives with a unit of soldiers. When they open the boxcar, Mulder’s somehow nowhere to be seen and they decide to blow the freight to smithereens. Did Mulder survive? Did he get away?2937 Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life – Fall (2016)“It certainly wasn\u0027t the ending I expected,” Rory Gilmore actor Alexis Bledel said of the finale. “Fitting but frustrating”, was how Vanity Fair referred to the episode. The Gilmore Girls sequel, A Year in the Life, concluded with a four-word exchange between Rory and her mother, Lorelai (Lauren Graham). “Mum”, the daughter says, sitting in a park’s bandstand. “Yeah”, she replies. “I’m pregnant,” Rory says. Queue hundreds of fans wanting more from the story, which had, ultimately, come full circle.3037 Star Trek: The Next Generation – Best of Both Worlds (1990)Another science fiction show filled to the brim with cliffhangers. Star Trek: The Next Generation had many, but few can measure up to Picard (Patrick Stewart) becoming a Borg. The season three finale sees the Enterprise’s crew having no choice but to turn on their former captain, with Riker (Jonathan Frakes) ordering Worf (Michael Dorn) to open fire on Picard’s Borg ship. Fans had to wait three months to discover whether Picard could be saved – and the fandom almost imploded in the meantime.Marissa Cooper (Mischa Barton) and Ryan Atwood (Benjamin McKenzie) would have done anything for each other. When Ryan’s brother Trey (Logan Marshall-Green) gets in the way, attacking Marissa, Ryan has no other course of action but to settle things “once and for all” between them. As the brawl ensues, Marissa somehow ends up shooting Trey. And as the bullet goes through him, Imogen Heap’s song “Hide and Seek” – AKA the “Mmmmh, what you say?” song – suddenly starts playing. It’s hard not to laugh. The pop song cuts through the scene, completely at odds with what’s happening on screen. No wonder, then, that Saturday Night Live famously parodied the scene in one of their most-beloved skits of all time.Jim (John Krasinski) and Pam (Jenna Fischer) were the ultimate “will they, won’t they” couple, their chemistry electrifying the early seasons of The Office. Things peaked for the first time during the season two finale. Following Casino Night at Dunder Mifflin, Jim finally takes Pam aside to reveal his true feelings, telling her: “I’m in love with you.” She is, at the time, engaged to Roy (David Denman), and decides to reply to Jim: “What are you doing?” While all hope for the pair seems lost, Jim finds Pam (calling her mother) before the episode’s end and kisses her. Cruelly, the showrunners decided to cut to black after the moment, leaving fans wondering for months whether the couple would return to screens happily together (spoiler: they do not).JJ Abrams loves ending things on a twist. Before creating the mystery-box filled Lost, the filmmaker created Alias, and the season two finale marks one the show’s greatest endings. The episode sees Sydney (Jennifer Garner) discover that Francie (Merrin Dungey) is not Francie at all, but a duplicate. The two then brawl, ending with Sydney shooting Francie and then collapsing due to exhaustion. We immediately jump to Sydney waking up in Hong Kong. After reuniting with her lover Michael Vaughn (Michael Vartan), Sydney realises things are amiss as Michael is wearing a wedding ring. Turns out, she has been missing for almost two years. Cut to black, and the world asking “What just happened?”3437 Spooks – Smoke and Mirrors (2003)The season two finale of Spooks shocked the nation. While the episode begins with the CIA taking on a seemingly straightforward mission – to prevent a member of the Cabinet being assassinated – we soon discover that everything’s not as it seems. The formerly-presumed dead Herman Joyce (Tomas Arana) is still alive and masquerading as Herb Zeigler. Not only that, but the villain has masterminded an elaborate plan to make it seem as if Tom (Matthew Macfadyen) has assassinated the Chief of the Defence Staff. With everything working against Tom, the agent finds himself backed into a corner. And when Harry (Peter Firth) loses faith, Tom decides to shoot Harry with his shotgun. Does Harry die? Will Tom ever be found innocent? The questions were many.3537 Dragon Ball Z – Next time on Dragon Ball ZThere’s really no definitive Dragon Ball Z cliffhanger, as almost every single episode in the series finishes with one. From Vegeta staring menacingly at the camera to the villainous Cell launching a deadline attack on Goku, the series leaves you anywhere and everywhere. When that voice-over comes in with “Next time on Dragon Ball Z”, you can guarantee any child watching will be hooked and instantly wanting to watch the next episode.Pushing Up Daisies was unceremoniously brought to an end after just two seasons, with showrunner Bryan Fuller having to quickly conclude the whimsical series with very little notice. The epilogue was added late into the writing process and sees the narrator offer some closure to each characters’ story. Yet, with Ned (Lee Pace) and Chuck (Anna Friel) standing on her aunts’ doorstep, waiting to finally reveal that she’s alive, fans could see that there were originally supposed to be many more seasons to come – and they still want them desperately.Following a war of words with Jim Moriarty (Andrew Scott) on the roof of a building (in which Moriarty shoots himself in the head), Sherlock (Benedict Cumberbatch) decides to seemingly commit suicide by jumping off the building. However, not all is at it seems, as Sherlock is seen alive before the episode end. Fans of the series – plus Martin Freeman’s Watson – were left questioning what exactly happened to Sherlock, with all being revealed in the following special.Karma for killing Gale comes for Walter White in season five. The meth maker believes his days of cooking are long over. Having lunch with his family, everything seems perfect. And then everything goes wrong. So, so wrong. Hank (Dean Norris) goes to use the toilet and picks up a copy of Walt Whitman\u0027s Leaves of Grass – a gift from Gale to Walter White. “To my other favorited WW. It\u0027s an honour working with you. Fondly, GB.” And with that, as Hank realises Walt’s true identity, the end of Heisenberg’s empire begins.The debate over whether certain final scenes of television shows are actually good will rage on and on. The Sopranos remains front and centre of the conversation. It\u0027s a seemingly banal occasion – a restaurant dinner scene. We watch on as Tony sits there, observing other customers. Carmela arrives, then AJ and Meadow, who the last we see, is parking her car outside. A bell rings, Tony looks up and the screen cuts to black. It’s an ending that’s inspired essays offering varied interpretations but ultimately, it remains a beautifully-executed few minutes of television – and a cliffhanger that’ll never have a resolution.337 EastEnders – The Kat and Zoe revelation (2001)“You can’t tell me what to do ‘cause you ain’t my muvva”  “YES I AM!” - not the work of Shakespeare, granted, but surely one of the biggest moments in soap history. The nation’s jaws collectively dropped as they learned that Kat Slater (Jessie Wallace) wasn’t Zoe’s sister at all, but her mum.  437 Game of Thrones – The Rains of Castamere (2013)Game of Thrones knew George RR Martin was willing to kill off leading characters, but nothing prepared non-book readers for The Red Wedding. Robb Stark (Richard Madden), Talisa Stark (Oona Chaplin) and Catelyn Stark (Michelle Fairley) are attending the wedding of Roslin Frey (Alexandra Dowling) and Edmure Tully (Tobias Menzies) when things go terribly, terribly wrong for the Starks. The Freys turn on them, killing Robb, Talisa and their unborn child. Then, as the blood spills everywhere, Catelyn’s throat is slit. Cut to black.

Turning to Rose (Billie Piper), Christopher Eccleston’s incarnation of the iconic character utters the timeless lines: “Before I go, I just want to tell you, you were fantastic. Absolutely fantastic. And you know what – so was I.” Queue shoddy CGI and the introduction of the soon-to-be nation’s favourite Doctor, David Tennant. “So, where was I? That’s it – Barcelona.”Gale (David Costabile) is one of the nicest characters on Breaking Bad. He is not interested in wealth or fame, but in science. However, niceties and a good cup of coffee are not enough to stop him getting in Walter White’s (Bryan Cranston) way. When the choice between their lives has to be made, Walter chooses his own and sends Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul) to do the dirty work.

Season five concluded with the eponymous ass-kicker sacrificing herself to save the world by jumping into a demonic portal. The episode ends with a slow zoom onto Buffy’s tombstone, which reads: “Beloved sister. Devoted friend. She saved the world. A lot.“It\u0027s easy to forget that True Blood began life as an acclaimed Emmy-nominated drama, and it was a cliffhanger such as this that made it so: Sookie Stackhouse (Anna Paquin) falls asleep with the friendly neighbour dog Dean for company. Upon waking up, Dean is gone and in his place is local barman Sam Merlotte ( Sam Trammell). Turns out he\u0027s a shapeshifter.1437 The Walking Dead – Last Day on Earth (2016)After eight episodes of build-up, the comic book’s deadliest villain, Negan, reared his head in a scene fans were dreading. With the majority of the main cast lined up at his mercy, Negan – in retaliation for the death of one of his gang – decides which one to kill by using “Eeny Meeny Mino Moe”. After selecting his victim, the camera switches POV and Negan bludgeons the unseen character to death leaving fans with a six-month wait before finding out who had met their maker.Lost co-creator Damon Lindelof\u0027s HBO drama was set in a world that saw two per cent of the world’s population disappear into thin air during a tragic event known as the Sudden Departure. Season two presented an intriguing mystery: the disappearance of three teenage girls from a Texan town that nobody had vanished from. It was the season\u0027s penultimate episode that cleared up this plot line as Matt Garvey (Chris Zylka) breaks into a heavily-guarded trailer – only to be met with the three teenage girls staring back at him. What’s more is they’re dressed all in white, a callback to the disbanded cult from the first season.In episode 11, the writers had introduced a hatch buried underground and, week in week out, the fans waited patiently for any detail about the mysterious structure the writers were willing to give them. The end of episode 19 saw a desperate John Locke (Terry O’Quinn) banging on the door, just as desperate to get inside as the viewers were... only for a light to come on from within. This ending remains an unforgettable moment for those who watched it at the time of broadcast.1737 Lost – “Two for the Road” (2006)“I’m sorry.” “For what?” BANG. On paper, not so effective but on screen, it equated to one of Lost’s most gasp-inducing cliffhangers. Viewers watched behind their eyes as Michael (Harold Perrineau), desperate to save his son from the mysterious Others, shoots Ana-Lucia (Michelle Rodriguez) and, in a cruel twist, Libby (Cynthia Watros), who has accidentally stumbled upon the whole thing while looking for some blankets.1837 Lost - \u0027Through the Looking Glass – Part 2Whether you love or hate Lost, there’s no denying that the season three finale deployed one of the most breathtaking rug pulls in television history as writers Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse revealed a shake-up long in the running: flashbacks featuring a suicidal Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox) were, in fact, flashforwards to the future. The Oceanic Flight 815 plane crash survivor made it off the island he’d been so desperate to get off for three whole seasons, but was, disturbingly, desperate to get back. The ending set the benchmark for all future finale and was so huge it made newspaper headlines.1937 Line of Duty – Series four premiere (2018)The fourth series of Line of Duty didn’t hold back on the shocks. In fact, its first episode featured a cliffhanger ending to rival the best of them. With DCI Roz Huntley (Thandie Newton) dead on his floor, her murderer – Forensic Coordinator Tim Ifield (Jason Watkins) – sets about dispatching her body, but as his chainsaw nears her face, Roz’s eyes suddenly open.After season one, Heroes became pretty dreadful television. But this cliffhanger looms in the memory for being so left-field it warrants applaud: having captured serial killer Sylar, Angela Petrelli – parent to superheroes Nathan and Peter – tells him she can provide him with the love and guidance he needs. Angry, Sylar tells her she’s not his mother to which Angela drops the bombshell: “But I am dear, I am.” A head-scratching mid-season reveal that had fans chomping at the bit for the next episode.After spending an entire season watching the blossoming romance between medical intern Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo) and Dr Derek Shephard (Patrick Dempsey), the world of viewers was rocked upon discovering the shock revelation that Derek was married all along.Channel 4 sitcom Green Wing took the term “cliffhanger” quite literally for each finale of its two series. While it became a tad gimmicky the second time around, the first remained a genuinely surprising way for a comedy series to end: having discovered that the colleague he’d just slept with was his mother, drug-addled anaesthetist Guy Secretan (Stephen Mangan) steals an ambulance, drives it to the country and loses control. After crashing, the episode ends with Guy and several other characters dangling – you guessed it – off a cliff.A particularly nail-biting fourth season was shaping up to end well: after weeks of playing cat-and-mouse with the Trinity Killer (John Lithgow on Emmy-winning form), Dexter finally put an end to his murderous ways and returned home ready to pack up and join his wife Rita on their vacation. Only Rita’s still at home... dead in the bathtub. Trinity killed her before Dexter got to him. A heartbreaking end to a standout season.When things are going supremely well towards the end of a season finale, you know something big is about to go down. Battlestar Galactica proved no different. After destroying the Cylon Basestar – a warship belonging to the enemy – crew member Boomer, who viewers had learnt was a Cylon in the mini-series that aired the year before, fires a round into the chest of Commander Adama (Edward James Olmos), the show’s main character.Having been warned for two seasons that Z’ha’dum means death, fans expected big things from an episode called “Z’ha’dum”. They weren’t wrong. It ended with the show’s lead character jumping to his death. The episode was so big the episodes leading up to it teased “Z minus 14 days” and “Z minus 7 days.”24 was filled to the brim with huge cliffhangers, but this one – arriving at the 16 episode mark – stands out for sparking what would be the show’s best run of episodes. President Charles Logan (Gregory Itzin) is revealed to be the mastermind behind the shocking assassinations of David Palmer and Michelle Dessler, which kickstarted the season. And thus the show’s most memorable villain was born.2737 Friends – The One with Ross’s Wedding (1998)While Ross (David Schwimmer) and Rachel’s (Jennifer Aniston) “will they, won’t they” courtship arguably went on far too long, there was one moment during the season four finale that left fans with their jaws on the floor. Just after Rachel had accepted Ross was happy with fiancé Emily (Helen Baxendale), everything goes catastrophically wrong. Instead of saying Emily’s name during the wedding vows, Ross says the iconic line: “Take thee Rachel”. After the wedding, as the season finished, everyone was left wondering whether the pair would finally rekindle their romance for good.“I’m in a boxcar, buried inside a quarry, and there are bodies everywhere,” says Mulder to Scully during the season two finale. And just as Mulder solves the riddle of how those people died, the roof of the boxcar slams shut, trapping him inside. Worse still, the Smoking Man then arrives with a unit of soldiers. When they open the boxcar, Mulder’s somehow nowhere to be seen and they decide to blow the freight to smithereens. Did Mulder survive? Did he get away?2937 Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life – Fall (2016)“It certainly wasn\u0027t the ending I expected,” Rory Gilmore actor Alexis Bledel said of the finale. “Fitting but frustrating”, was how Vanity Fair referred to the episode. The Gilmore Girls sequel, A Year in the Life, concluded with a four-word exchange between Rory and her mother, Lorelai (Lauren Graham). “Mum”, the daughter says, sitting in a park’s bandstand. “Yeah”, she replies. “I’m pregnant,” Rory says. Queue hundreds of fans wanting more from the story, which had, ultimately, come full circle.3037 Star Trek: The Next Generation – Best of Both Worlds (1990)Another science fiction show filled to the brim with cliffhangers. Star Trek: The Next Generation had many, but few can measure up to Picard (Patrick Stewart) becoming a Borg. The season three finale sees the Enterprise’s crew having no choice but to turn on their former captain, with Riker (Jonathan Frakes) ordering Worf (Michael Dorn) to open fire on Picard’s Borg ship. Fans had to wait three months to discover whether Picard could be saved – and the fandom almost imploded in the meantime.Marissa Cooper (Mischa Barton) and Ryan Atwood (Benjamin McKenzie) would have done anything for each other. When Ryan’s brother Trey (Logan Marshall-Green) gets in the way, attacking Marissa, Ryan has no other course of action but to settle things “once and for all” between them. As the brawl ensues, Marissa somehow ends up shooting Trey. And as the bullet goes through him, Imogen Heap’s song “Hide and Seek” – AKA the “Mmmmh, what you say?” song – suddenly starts playing. It’s hard not to laugh. The pop song cuts through the scene, completely at odds with what’s happening on screen. No wonder, then, that Saturday Night Live famously parodied the scene in one of their most-beloved skits of all time.Jim (John Krasinski) and Pam (Jenna Fischer) were the ultimate “will they, won’t they” couple, their chemistry electrifying the early seasons of The Office. Things peaked for the first time during the season two finale. Following Casino Night at Dunder Mifflin, Jim finally takes Pam aside to reveal his true feelings, telling her: “I’m in love with you.” She is, at the time, engaged to Roy (David Denman), and decides to reply to Jim: “What are you doing?” While all hope for the pair seems lost, Jim finds Pam (calling her mother) before the episode’s end and kisses her. Cruelly, the showrunners decided to cut to black after the moment, leaving fans wondering for months whether the couple would return to screens happily together (spoiler: they do not).JJ Abrams loves ending things on a twist. Before creating the mystery-box filled Lost, the filmmaker created Alias, and the season two finale marks one the show’s greatest endings. The episode sees Sydney (Jennifer Garner) discover that Francie (Merrin Dungey) is not Francie at all, but a duplicate. The two then brawl, ending with Sydney shooting Francie and then collapsing due to exhaustion. We immediately jump to Sydney waking up in Hong Kong. After reuniting with her lover Michael Vaughn (Michael Vartan), Sydney realises things are amiss as Michael is wearing a wedding ring. Turns out, she has been missing for almost two years. Cut to black, and the world asking “What just happened?”3437 Spooks – Smoke and Mirrors (2003)The season two finale of Spooks shocked the nation. While the episode begins with the CIA taking on a seemingly straightforward mission – to prevent a member of the Cabinet being assassinated – we soon discover that everything’s not as it seems. The formerly-presumed dead Herman Joyce (Tomas Arana) is still alive and masquerading as Herb Zeigler. Not only that, but the villain has masterminded an elaborate plan to make it seem as if Tom (Matthew Macfadyen) has assassinated the Chief of the Defence Staff. With everything working against Tom, the agent finds himself backed into a corner. And when Harry (Peter Firth) loses faith, Tom decides to shoot Harry with his shotgun. Does Harry die? Will Tom ever be found innocent? The questions were many.3537 Dragon Ball Z – Next time on Dragon Ball ZThere’s really no definitive Dragon Ball Z cliffhanger, as almost every single episode in the series finishes with one. From Vegeta staring menacingly at the camera to the villainous Cell launching a deadline attack on Goku, the series leaves you anywhere and everywhere. When that voice-over comes in with “Next time on Dragon Ball Z”, you can guarantee any child watching will be hooked and instantly wanting to watch the next episode.Pushing Up Daisies was unceremoniously brought to an end after just two seasons, with showrunner Bryan Fuller having to quickly conclude the whimsical series with very little notice. The epilogue was added late into the writing process and sees the narrator offer some closure to each characters’ story. Yet, with Ned (Lee Pace) and Chuck (Anna Friel) standing on her aunts’ doorstep, waiting to finally reveal that she’s alive, fans could see that there were originally supposed to be many more seasons to come – and they still want them desperately.Following a war of words with Jim Moriarty (Andrew Scott) on the roof of a building (in which Moriarty shoots himself in the head), Sherlock (Benedict Cumberbatch) decides to seemingly commit suicide by jumping off the building. However, not all is at it seems, as Sherlock is seen alive before the episode end. Fans of the series – plus Martin Freeman’s Watson – were left questioning what exactly happened to Sherlock, with all being revealed in the following special.Parks and Recreation began on the 9 April 2009 and concluded on the 24 February 2015.\u0026nbspParks and RecreationThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This, however, needs to be further investigated.”Humans share almost all of our DNA with cats, cattle and miceResearcher Derry Taylor monitored 22 of the animals –\u0026nbspnative to southeast Asia –\u0026nbspin\u0026nbspspontaneous social play sessions.The bears, aged up to 12, were housed in Bornean Sun Bear Conservation Centre in Malaysia in which enclosures were large enough to allow bears to choose whether to interact or not.During hundreds of play bouts, two distinct expressions were coded – one involving a display of the upper incisor teeth, and one without.\u0026nbspThe bears were most likely to show precise facial mimicry during gentle play.Mr Taylor said such subtle mimicking could be to help two bears signal that they are ready to play more roughly, or to strengthen social bonds.He said: “It is widely believed that we only find complex forms of communication in species with complex social systems.“As sun bears are a largely solitary species, our study of their facial communication questions this belief, because it shows a complex form of facial communication that until now was known only in more social species.”The results were published on Thursday in the online journal Scientific Reports.We’ll tell you what’s true.

Not all companies are prepared for the worstWith a week to go, the prime minister has finally sought to delay Brexit. As things stand, however, there is no formal agreement between the government and the EU about the length of any Article 50 extension.So, what\u0026nbspwould\u0026nbspa Brexit delay do to inidual businesses in terms of\u0026nbspcontingency planning?Not much, is the answer.\u0026nbspOne thing to understand is that a lot of businesses simply haven’t done any.When the Institute of Directors (IoD) looked at this question earlier in the year it found 40 per cent of its members had taken no steps at all to prepare for a sudden no-deal situation.Created with Sketch.Tariffs in the event of a no-deal Brexit  Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.There will be tariffs on pork in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs in place on some cheeses including €22.10100kg of cheddar, €19.10100kg of processed cheese and €18.60100kg on some blue cheesesThere will be no tariffs in place on milkThere will be no tariffs on car parts imported from EuropeThere will be no tariffs on alcoholic drinks - except on some rums due to ingredients used in their distilling processThere will be tariffs on beef in order to protect British farmersThere will be no tariffs on many types of fish including cod, haddock, salmon and sea bass915 Fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on almost all fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on chocolate or other cocoa productsThere will be tariffs on poultry in order to protect British farmersThere will be some tariffs in place on ceramisThere will be no tariffs on steelThere will be no tariffs on coalThere will be tariffs on the meat of sheep in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs on pork in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs in place on some cheeses including €22.10100kg of cheddar, €19.10100kg of processed cheese and €18.60100kg on some blue cheesesThere will be no tariffs in place on milkThere will be no tariffs on car parts imported from EuropeThere will be no tariffs on alcoholic drinks - except on some rums due to ingredients used in their distilling processThere will be tariffs on beef in order to protect British farmersThere will be no tariffs on many types of fish including cod, haddock, salmon and sea bass915 Fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on almost all fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on chocolate or other cocoa productsThere will be tariffs on poultry in order to protect British farmersThere will be some tariffs in place on ceramisThere will be no tariffs on steelThere will be no tariffs on coalThere will be tariffs on the meat of sheep in order to protect British farmersThat may seem like extraordinary complacency, given the wretched state of a\u0026nbspUK government\u0026nbspled by arguably the worst prime minister in history. And in some cases, that’s probably true. (There is still the feeling that “it just won’t happen” in some quarters.)\u0026nbspBut there is a much larger slate of smaller firms that simply lack the resources to be able to plan effectively\u0026nbspfor the\u0026nbsplooming earthquake.\u0026nbspWatchdog bans advert encouraging loans to fund Brexit food stockpilesWe’re just over a week away from the notional exit date and it’s still the case that no one really\u0026nbsphas the faintest idea how (or when) this will end, and what the impact will be. That being the case, small firms have opted to take a wait and see approach. They will react to what emerges, because they don’t have much of a choice.\u0026nbspThe IoD, and the Scottish National Party, have called for businesses to be issued with prep vouchers, along the lines of\u0026nbspthe\u0026nbspschemes the Irish and Dutch governments have put into operation.\u0026nbspThese, the IoD says, could persuade some to act in the event of a short delay by incentivising them to take preparatory measures.\u0026nbspWhatever is agreed, those businesses that are prepping will continue to do so. Those that aren’t will carry on crossing their fingersBut that looks unlikely at present. For a start, the EU doesn’t seem minded to agree to a short extension\u0026nbspand such a scheme would be an example of something the current government seems allergic to: forward-thinking policy-making.Suren Thiru, from the British Chambers of Commerce, says those that have been preparing for no deal will continue to do so if a delay is secured. That means a continuation of the weak investment that is slowing the UK economy to a crawl as resources are erted to emergency planning.\u0026nbspThe problem for all businesses, as he points out, is that there are just “so many key questions to which we don’t have answers”. How will trade work, how will customs work, how will\u0026nbspfirms lay their hands on the staff they need?The prospect of a “rolling”, non-date-specific delay fills businesses with almost as much horror as no deal (which\u0026nbspmost regard as the equivalent of Hereditary, The Exorcist\u0026nbspand Children of the Corn all merged into one).\u0026nbspSo whatever is agreed, those businesses that are prepping will keep doing so. Those that aren’t will carry on crossing their fingers in the hope of Westminster coming to its senses.\u0026nbspThey’d probably best cross their toes, and anything else they can lay their hands on while they’re at it.\u0026nbspGot an unanswered question about Brexit?

I couldn’t do very much.\u0026nbspIt was a really difficult time, and all the while his visa was getting refused.“Right now I’m just sitting at home, and I’m desperate to go back to work. Childcare costs almost £1,000 each per month,\u0026nbspso it’s not worth me working part-time. I’m having to rely on benefits, which is not what I want.“If he were here and we were a unit, everything would be consolidated. We would be able to support each other. But right now our life is on hold. If I’d have known things would be this complicated, I would have had an abortion.”If she were able to go back to work, Ms\u0026nbspMettle-Olympio\u0026nbspwould be able to sponsor a visa for\u0026nbspMr\u0026nbspKponouglo, which carries a minimum income requirement of £18,600 a year. But without childcare, it is impossible for her to meet this threshold.Families forced to spend Christmas apart due to UK immigration rules“I’m in a catch-22 situation,” she said. “And it’s been very difficult for my partner. He feels incompetent and almost useless. I have to tell him this is beyond our control. We’re doing\u0026nbspall we can do.”The\u0026nbspJoint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants (JCWI) said at the “very least”\u0026nbsp15,000 British children were living without one of their parents because of family visa restrictions. When asked to provide a more\u0026nbspaccurate figure in a recent parliamentary question, immigration minister Caroline Nokes refused.Mary Atkinson, family reunion campaigner at the JCWI, said: “In 2019, we can and should do better than forcing young mothers into a\u0026nbspsituation like this, making them raise their children alone and give up on their careers simply because of who they have chosen to build a life with.A Home Office spokesperson said: “All UK visa applications are considered on their inidual merits, on the basis of the evidence available and in line with UK immigration rules.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

The letter focuses on overshooting a March deadline for re-opening the seaside attraction. The work and pensions secretary\u0026nbspsaid she “can’t support any scenario” in which the pier remains closed indefinitely.While she is the MP for the area, Ms Rudd has little power to intervene as the pier is privately owned. The letter has prompted numerous comparisons to the torturous Brexit negotiations between Theresa May, the European Union, and parliament.Here is the letter:It was described as “an ill-disguised jibe about Mrs May\u0027s habit of keeping her cabinet in the dark about her plans for Brexit” by one newspaper.\u0026nbspOn Twitter many have expressed similar views. “This entire letter is an absolutely masterful trolling of Theresa May,” journalist Thomas Colson wrote.A genuine row has been unfolding in Hastings in recent months after the purchase of the pier which underwent a £14m lottery-funded facelift in 2017 and won it the prestigious Stirling Prize for architecture.Created with Sketch.Who could succeed Theresa May as Conservative leader? Show all 9Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Former foreign secretary Boris Johnson has long been hopeful, he previously ran in the leadership contest that followed the Brexit vote and has at many times since been thought to be maneuvering himself towards the goal. He has kept a lower profile since resigning from the cabinet last year and is seen by many as a highly isive figure due to his role in Brexit but he remains a darling of the party\u0027s right wing, particularly those in the ERG, and is the most popular choice among Tory votersFormer Brexit secretary Dominic Raab has emerged as a favourite to be the Brexiteer candidate in a contest to succeed to Ms May. When asked recently if he would like to become prime minister he replied never say neverHome secretary Sajid Javid is said to have a plan in place for a leadership race. He made headlines over Christmas when he declared that people smuggling over the English channel was a major incident and more recently when he revoked the citizenship of ISIS bride Shamima Begum. He wants the Conservatives to be seen as the party of social mobilityWork and pensions secretary Amber Rudd is a leading contender from the moderate wing of the party. She showed off her leadership credentials in the 2017 election campaign, appearing in the televised debate in place of the Prime Minister, who had refused. She returned to the cabinet in November 2018 after resigning as Home Secretary over the handling of the Windrush scandal Foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt was recently thought to be the favourite in the event of a leadership race. He has reportedly been holding meetings with Tory MPs over breakfast to promote his leadershipFollowing the Prime Minister\u0027s second defeat over her Brexit deal, Leader of the house Andrea Leadsom hosted a dinner party at which leadership was the only topic of conversation, The Times heard. Leadsom ran against Theresa May in the 2016 leadership election before dropping out, allowing May to become Prime MinisterEnvironment secretary Michael Gove is another member who has long wanted to be leader. He famously ruined the chances of Brexit campaign ally Boris Johnson in the 2016 leadership election by running against him. He has impressed the parliamentary party and Tory members since returning to the cabinet as Environment Secretary in 2017 and has supported the Prime Minister and her Brexit deal Former international development secretary Priti Patel is thought to be positioning herself as a contender. One MP told The Independent she knows she\u0027s from the right of the party, the part which is going to choose the next leader, so she\u0027s reminding everyone she\u0027s there.

When asked about her desire to be leader, she replied it’s never wise to rule anything out in politics but I’m absolutely not thinking about itFormer foreign secretary Boris Johnson has long been hopeful, he previously ran in the leadership contest that followed the Brexit vote and has at many times since been thought to be maneuvering himself towards the goal. He has kept a lower profile since resigning from the cabinet last year and is seen by many as a highly isive figure due to his role in Brexit but he remains a darling of the party\u0027s right wing, particularly those in the ERG, and is the most popular choice among Tory votersFormer Brexit secretary Dominic Raab has emerged as a favourite to be the Brexiteer candidate in a contest to succeed to Ms May. When asked recently if he would like to become prime minister he replied never say neverHome secretary Sajid Javid is said to have a plan in place for a leadership race. He made headlines over Christmas when he declared that people smuggling over the English channel was a major incident and more recently when he revoked the citizenship of ISIS bride Shamima Begum. He wants the Conservatives to be seen as the party of social mobilityWork and pensions secretary Amber Rudd is a leading contender from the moderate wing of the party. She showed off her leadership credentials in the 2017 election campaign, appearing in the televised debate in place of the Prime Minister, who had refused. She returned to the cabinet in November 2018 after resigning as Home Secretary over the handling of the Windrush scandal Foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt was recently thought to be the favourite in the event of a leadership race. He has reportedly been holding meetings with Tory MPs over breakfast to promote his leadershipFollowing the Prime Minister\u0027s second defeat over her Brexit deal, Leader of the house Andrea Leadsom hosted a dinner party at which leadership was the only topic of conversation, The Times heard. Leadsom ran against Theresa May in the 2016 leadership election before dropping out, allowing May to become Prime MinisterEnvironment secretary Michael Gove is another member who has long wanted to be leader. He famously ruined the chances of Brexit campaign ally Boris Johnson in the 2016 leadership election by running against him. He has impressed the parliamentary party and Tory members since returning to the cabinet as Environment Secretary in 2017 and has supported the Prime Minister and her Brexit deal Former international development secretary Priti Patel is thought to be positioning herself as a contender. One MP told The Independent she knows she\u0027s from the right of the party, the part which is going to choose the next leader, so she\u0027s reminding everyone she\u0027s there.

As you know, hope dies last,\u0027 Tusk saysClick to followIndy PoliticsThe agreement to extend Article 50 struck by EU leaders in Brussels on Thursday night means that “anything is possible” for Brexit, Donald Tusk has said.The president of the European Council said the UK would have time to change its strategy or even\u0026nbspcancel Brexit, “which is the prerogative of the UK government”.His comments come after millions of people signed an official parliamentary petition calling for the UK to revoke Article 50 to avoid a no-deal Brexit“The fate of Brexit is in the hands of our British friends.

As you know, hope dies last.”EU leaders decide Brexit fate in private as May secures deal extensionHe was speaking the morning after a late night negotiating session where EU leaders thrashed out the future of the UK over dinner.Leaders agreed that Britain would get an unconditional Brexit delay until 12 April – less than the 30 June date Theresa May had asked for.But the UK will also get an additional delay until May 22 if MPs approve the withdrawal agreement next week, and the door has been left open for a longer extension if the UK participates in European Parliament\u0026nbspelections in May.Theresa May made her case to EU leaders last night but fled the summit\u0026nbspthis morning, missing a planned discussion about Europe-China relations.Also speaking after the meeting concluded, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said leaders had\u0026nbsp“a very candid talk with the prime minister” who has “put a lot of her efforts into defending British interests”.Jean-Claude Juncker, the European Commission president, put less of a gloss on the conversation, telling reporters:\u0026nbsp”It was much easier to talk about China than it was to about the United Kingdom.”EU leaders put the chance of the UK ratifying the withdrawal agreement from about five per cent – Emmanuel Macron’s estimate – to 5050 –\u0026nbsp a guess favoured by Dutch PM Mark Rutte and his Luxembourgish counterpart Xavier Bettel.Belgian prime minister Charles Michel told reporters:\u0026nbsp”I believe in miracles, but they are not frequent.

back\u0026nbspher Brexit deal by staging repeat votes are in tatters, after speaker\u0026nbspJohn Bercow dramatically blocked the tactic, citing rules dating back to before the Gunpowder Plot.The prime minister was left stunned by the shock announcement – which torpedoed her hopes of a third “meaningful vote” while threatening MPs with a long delay to leaving the EU if they refused to give way.The dramatic twist, outlawing fresh votes without substantial changes, left ministers scrabbling for solutions – including an extraordinary proposal to suspend parliament and start a new session.It also achieved the remarkable feat of uniting supporters of a no-deal Brexit and a second referendum, who both believed it made their favoured option more likely.The solicitor general, who warned of “a constitutional crisis”, put forward the escape route of ending the current parliamentary session early to get around the 1604 convention invoked by the speaker, which lapses after a fresh Queen’s Speech.Here’s how Theresa May can get around Bercow’s dramatic Brexit ruling“There are ways around this – a prorogation of parliament and a new session,” said Robert Buckland.Created with

surrenders in reference to the likelihood of Brexit being delayed after the vote Experts pointed to a possible precedent from 1948, when Attlee’s Labour government prorogued parliament for a new 12-day session to pass legislation to reduce the power\u0026nbspof the House of Lords.No 10 is also mulling a possible vote to overturn the speaker’s ruling – but this seemed only likely to succeed if there are enough supporters of the deal in the first place.There was no immediate official response from Downing Street, other than to express its fury that Mr Bercow gave no warning of his bombshell announcement, made in the Commons chamber.The speaker said a further meaningful vote\u0026nbspwould be ruled out of order if the motion was “the same or substantially the same” – under a 1604 convention to stop the government bullying parliament on issues MPs have rejected.Ms May has already admitted that the negotiations with the EU are over, making it hard for her to argue that a further meaningful vote will be on a different question.Crucially, the speaker suggested something would have to be renegotiated with the EU to constitute a “change”, rather than, for example, a clarification of legal advice by the attorney general.Is Matteo Salvini going to veto a Brexit extension?French EU minister names cat ‘Brexit’ because of its indecisive natureMr Bercow told MPs: “What the government cannot legitimately do is resubmit to the house the same proposition – or substantially the same proposition – as that of last week, which was rejected by 149 votes.”The Independent revealed in January that pro-EU MPs believed that Ms May’s tactic to bludgeon her deal through, despite heavy defeats, was barred by parliamentary rules.Senior Tories were livid, believing the speaker had once again laid bare his anti-Brexit bias while twisting constitutional rules to suit his purpose.Rory Stewart, the prisons minister, taunted Mr Bercow by tweeting: “‘When I use a word,’\u0026nbspHumpty Dumpty said, in rather a scornful tone, ‘it means just what I choose it to mean.’”He added: “In the normal course of events, as the speaker says, parliament says no, and the issue is dropped.“But in this case, this is not an option, because these votes respond to an instruction in a referendum, endorsed by parliament, which rules out dropping back to the status quo.”Supporters of a Final Say referendum were delighted, with former Tory MP Anna Soubry telling\u0026nbspThe Independent: “It puts a second referendum very firmly at the top of the agenda –\u0026nbspit must do. We need a way out of this and this is the only way out.”Guto Bebb, a former Tory minister and People’s Vote supporter, said: “It is inconceivable now for ministers to carry on trying to force this broken Brexit deal on the people of the United Kingdom.”And David Lammy, a Labour supporter of the anti-Brexit Best for Britain group, said: “If the prime minister wants us to vote on her deal again, she should add an amendment allowing for her deal to be put to the people.”In the short term, the speaker’s intervention killed off any prospect of a third meaningful vote this week – already in doubt as the Democratic Unionist Party failed to switch sides.It appears certain that Ms May will have to ask EU leaders for a long\u0026nbspextension – anything between nine\u0026nbspand 21 months – to the Article 50 process at a summit in Brussels on Thursday.The new departure date will then be put to a “take-it-or-leave-it vote” in the Commons and Lords next week, just days before the 29 March Brexit day.For that reason, it increases the chances of a crash-out Brexit, which the Treasury has predicted could\u0026nbsptrigger a near 10 per cent GDP decline.However, a long extension could also open up the space for a further referendum, which some believe the prime minister might yet embrace if it is the only hope of passing her agreement.Speaking to a silent Commons, Mr Bercow said repeat votes had been blocked on 12 occasions up until 1920 – a situation only not repeated since because of “general compliance”.“This convention is very strong and longstanding, dating back to 2 April 1604,” the speaker said.“It’s a necessary rule to ensure the sensible use of house time and the proper respect for the decision which it takes.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

It is quite scathing.\u0026nbsp“The Prime Minister missed an opportunity at the EU Council to put forward proposals which could have improved the prospects of an acceptable Withdrawal Agreement and help unite the country.\u0026nbspThat failure is all the more disappointing and inexcusable given the clear isions and arguments which became evident amongst EU member states when faced with outcomes they don’t like.\u0026nbspAs we have always said, negotiations with the EU inevitably go down to the wire and the Government has been far too willing to capitulate before securing the necessary changes which would get an agreement through the House of Commons.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThe Government has consistently settled for inferior compromises when they didn’t need to and when there was, and is, more negotiating with the EU to be done.\u0026nbspLectures by the Prime Minister putting the blame on others cannot disguise the responsibility her government bears for the current debacle and the fact that her agreement has been twice overwhelmingly rejected in Parliament.\u0026nbspThe Prime Minister has now agreed with the EU to kick the can down the road for another two weeks and humiliatingly revoke her oft-stated pledge that the U.K. would leave the EU on 29th March.\u0026nbspNothing has changed as far as the Withdrawal Agreement is concerned. Nothing fundamentally turns on the formal ratification of documents which the Attorney General has already said do not change the risk of the U.K. being trapped in the backstop.\u0026nbspThe DUP has been very clear throughout that we want a deal which delivers on the referendum result and which works for all parts of the U.K. and for the EU as well.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBut it must be a deal that protects the Union. That remains our abiding principle. We will not accept any deal which poses a long term risk to the constitutional and economic integrity of the United Kingdom.”Speaking in Brussels at the close of the EU council summit,\u0026nbspthe French president Emmanuel Macron, says a no-deal scenario is in no one\u0027s interests, but the EU is “prepared” for such a route.Here and now, provisional conclusion would be Brexit, to me, is not a technical negotiation at this state. It is a political lesson to us all: a proposed rejection of the EU with no plan can only ever lead to a stalemate and that is what we are seeing currently with the situation in the UK.\u0026nbspThis is something we should all realise especially now. But if we are to ignore the fears and anger of European citizens it will only lead to a disaster.\u0026nbspAsked whether the chances of a no-deal scenario were still high, and whether the UK would be part of the EU next year, Mr Tusk avoided the question.\u0026nbspHe said: We will be determined to achieve the best possible deal, but almost everything now is in the hands of the British parliament and Theresa May’s government.Donald Tusk and Jean-Claude Juncker are giving their latest press conference at the EU 27 summit in Brussels.Tusk says the the leaders discussed cyber security, relationships with China, and tackling climate change with “urgency” under the Paris agreement.In regards to Brexit, the leaders formalised the agreement to “delay the cliff-edge” and agree an extension.\u0026nbspUntil the 12 April anything is possible,” he says.\u0026nbsp“The fate of Brexit is in the hands of our British friends.\u0026nbspWe prepare for the worst and hope for the best. As you know, hope dies last.”Theresa May has returned to London after a tumultuous summit in Brussels, where she is expected to spend the day at Downing Street hammering out her strategy for next week, writes political correspondent Lizzy Buchan.The prime minister’s spokesman was clear that she would only bring her deal back to the Commons for a third meaningful vote when there was a “realistic prospect of success” but it is understood that No10 is gearing up to bring the vote back on Tuesday or Wednesday.\u0026nbspPeers and MPs must pass legislation to change the date of Brexit by Friday, in order to prevent the UK crashing out of the bloc without a deal.The PM’s spokesman told a regular Westminster briefing that it was up to Commons Speaker John Bercow whether he will allow a further vote - after Mr Bercow ruled the PM could not bring back the deal without substantial changes.But he added: “There is now European Council approval of the legally binding assurances she negotiated with President Juncker in Strasbourg.“One should give extra assurance to parliament in the event the backstop is ever used that it will only be temporary.“The second aspect that the UK and the EU will begin work immediately to replace the backstop with alternative arrangements by the end of 2020. I would point to those as significant issues.”Ms May is expected to continue discussions with ministers and MPs across the house, before spending the weekend working at Chequers, her country retreat.Brexiteer Conservative MP Mark Francois said: Can I remind the minister of Denis Healey\u0027s first rule of politics: When you are in a hole, stop digging.Whenever the meaningful vote is tabled, if you, Mr Speaker, allow it, I believe this house will vote it down, not least because of the rather hubristic speech the PM made when she effectively attacked members of this house for having the temerity to vote with their consciences. So, I think it won\u0027t go through.Mr Kwarteng replied: The government\u0027s focus at the moment is to make sure we can potentially get a meaningful vote and actually secure the deal on the table, that is what I have always maintained.If the meaningful vote doesn\u0027t get through, we will have to look at alternatives.Kwarteng adds that\u0026nbspit would be “surprising” if the prime minister\u0026nbspdoes not offer free votes on any indicative votes in the House of Commons, should MPs reject the meaningful vote.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspIndicative votes allow MPs to vote on a series of Brexit plans, including a second referendum.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspIf the House is being asked to decide a way forward, it would be surprising if those votes were not free votes.Kwarteng provides a pretty dire response to Pennycook, and the only question he does engage with\u0026nbsp(when will the next meaningful vote be), he fails to answer, simply saying it is the government\u0027s intention to bring the vote back.\u0026nbspIn respect to his question about the meaningful vote, it is the Government\u0027s full intention, I think, to bring this meaningful vote to the House, he says.Matthew Pennycook - Labour’s shadow Brexit minister - is now asking an urgent question on the Article 50 extension.\u0026nbspResponding for the government Kwasi Kwarteng outlines the conclusions of the EU Council summit last night.\u0026nbspHe says any extension of Article 50 beyond May 2019 will require the UK to take part in European elections later this year - something the PM will not countenance.\u0026nbspPennycook says given the significance of the summit yesterday, a statement should have been made to parliament, rather than opposition MPs “dragging” ministers to the chamber.We’ll tell you what’s true.

A People’s Vote may not happen – so vote now.”The petition has eclipsed the nearly 400,000\u0026nbspsignatures attracted on a petition started in November calling for Britain to leave the EU without a deal.Asked about the growing number of signatories,\u0026nbspMs May said she did not believe in halting the deadline after the EU offered a delay plan.She added: I do not believe that we should be revoking Article 50.We’ll tell you what’s true.

The month of May – at 52 – is deemed the most likely time it could take place.Jessica Bridge of Ladbrokes said: “If the odds are to be believed, May’s speech doesn’t seem to have done the trick.”The odds of Ms May being replaced at No.10 this year have been cut by Ladbrokes to 16. “As far as the odds are concerned things are going from bad to worse for the prime minister,” Ms Bridge added.Betfair has the Labour leader as 41 favourite to be the next prime minister, compared with 61 odds for Mr Johnson, while William Hill has Mr Gove\u0026nbspas 41 favourite\u0026nbspahead of Mr Corbyn and Mr Johnson on 51.\u0026nbspKeir Starmer leave the European Commission headquarters in Brussels after a meeting (Reuters)Although Ms May won a\u0026nbspConservative party\u0026nbspno-confidence vote in December, preventing\u0026nbspher opponents from bringing the formal process again until the end of 2019, Tory MPs\u0026nbspcould put pressure on her to resign.Another route to Ms May’s exit comes from the opposition. The Labour leader has threatened to call a fresh confidence vote in the government if Ms May’s deal fails to pass the Commons a third time – although such a move is unlikely to win backing from Tory MPs.“At that point the confidence motion would be appropriate,” Mr Corbyn told Sky News’ Sophy Ridge on Sunday ahead of another meaningful vote. “I think at that point we should say there has to be a general election.”Editor of The Spectator Fraser Nelson has suggested an offer by Ms May to stand down soon might\u0026nbspbe enough to get her deal through,\u0026nbspdescribing\u0026nbspresignation as “her most powerful card”.Goldman Sachs analysts have increased their estimated likelihood of the UK crashing out of the EU without a deal to 15 per cent from 5 per cent.We’ll tell you what’s true.

It happens when it rains hard.But this spring, the poppies have been so abundant and so strikingly coloured – orange peel, marigold and burned copper – that the number of people coming to walk among them has simply been too many.\u0026nbspAs a result, the city was forced to say “no” to visitors, after what some officials termed a “super bloom apocalypse”.“The city has expended all available resources to address the #SuperBloom,” they wrote on the the city’s Instagram page. “We have brought in all available staff, as many outside traffic controllers that we could, more shuttles, and our small city can not sustain crowds of this magnitude – our city is not made for Disneyland-size crowds.”It urged residents: “Please, we need your help and understanding.

Residents have complained about traffic jams, as visitors have arrived as early as 5.30am to visit the wildflowers, whose burst of growth was triggered by recent record-breaking rainfall. One person was reportedly hurt in a traffic accident.For the last few weeks, crowds have swarmed onto the fields, many ignoring\u0026nbsp instructions that they stay on the designated path. Some have even picked the flowers to take home.\u0026nbspMayor Steve Manos told The Independent he had never known a\u0026nbspbloom as spectacular as the one this year. “It only happens when it rains hard,” he said. “The last one was 2017, and before that it was 2010.”“People were pulled over on the side of the road to see the flowers as we drove here,” she said. “It was amazing to see the number of flowers grow as we got closer.”Mr Manos, mayor of the city located 70 miles to the south east of Los Angeles, posted videos of himself helping direct traffic on Facebook, to try and give an insight into how bad the situation was.\u0026nbspOn Monday morning, amid some criticism over the shutdown, the city said access to Walker Canyon had been reopened, though parking was extremely limited.\u0026nbspMr Manos appeared in another brief video, standing in front of people walking through the footpaths amid the flowers.REDIRECT Nature Studies by Michael McCarthy: A Western Isles idyllWild flowers are overpowered by exhaust fumesBritain’s most common wild flowers are latest species to disappearThe last stand of the wild flower“As you can see, there are a number of people behind me here to experience the bloom.\u0026nbspBut we are full.

And crucially, under the new army-backed constitution, every member of the Senate is appointed by the military.\u0026nbspIt makes for a unique election where the magic number of seats needed to form a government will be a huge majority in the lower house - 376 out of 500 available constituencies.By contrast, the proxy party formed by the military with the aim of continuing junta leader and 2014 coup General Prayuth Chan-ocha’s premiership, Palang Pracharat, need only win 126 seats.Pheu Thai party leader Sudarat Keyuraphan said the rules laid out by the junta meant the election was, from the outset, anything but free and fair.She nonetheless urged the Thai public to turn out in force if they want any chance at removing the military junta from office.Court bans party that nominated princess for prime ministerBusinesswoman aims to become Thailand\u0027s first transgender PMThailand set to hold first general election since 2014 military coup We have to tell the people that it\u0027s the only day that we can stop Prayuth extending his power, Sudarat said on Friday, as her party held its largest rally yet in Bangkok before the official close of campaigning. Therefore we need many people to go vote. I believe the power they have is not any bigger than the power of the people.\u0026nbspPheu Thai remains affiliated with former prime minister Thaksin, the controversial telecoms tycoon who won a landslide in 2001 before going on to become the first prime minister in history to complete a full term in office.Thaksin was ousted by a coup in 2006 amid accusations of corruption. He denied the charges as politically motivated but was forced to leave the country into exile.And while the new army-backed constitution makes external involvement in Thai politics - particularly from one who has been exiled like Thaksin - illegal, Pheu Thai insists he remains the “ideological leader”.We use his principles, Sudarat said. But using Thaksin\u0027s ideas doesn\u0027t mean he owns the party because Thaksin is not involved with the party\u0027s administration anymore.\u0026nbspSudarat said the party\u0027s supporters remain loyal to Thaksin because his policies were able to improve their lives. They love Thaksin because Thaksin was able to solve their problems, she said.Backers of the junta have warned that a return to Pheu Thai leadership would be a return to the political unrest that has dogged the country for more than two decades.Supporters of Prayut and his Palang Pracharat party also gathered for their largest rally yet on Friday. Asked if another coup was possible in the event of a landslide victory for the “democratic front”, deputy junta leader Prawit Wongsuwan told the Reuters news agency: “No, no, no.”\u0026nbspPheu Thai\u0027s long-time rival, the Democrat Party, is the other major player in the election. Though not a military proxy, it does lean towards the establishment and a pro-business approach, and hopes to position itself as a king-maker in the event of an inconclusive election.In doing so, it hopes to return its leader, Abhisit Vejjajiva, to the prime minister\u0027s office he held unelected from 2008 to 2011 after yet another coup, that time by the judiciary.Abhisit told Al Jazeera he believed his party could take as many as 150 seats, and that it could be willing to work Palang Pracharat as long as former general Prayut is “removed from the equation”.“We want to be at the core of the next government,” he said. “We want to lead the country out of the current economic situation and into a new political era.”Parties are allowed to keep campaigning until 6pm (11am UK time) on Saturday. At 8am on Sunday morning, 93,200 polling stations will open and voting runs to 5pm at night.The election commission has said unofficial results will be available within three hours of the close of voting on Sunday.\u0026nbspWe’ll tell you what’s true.

It would be an Establishment stitch-up, with serious consequences for the public’s faith in democracy for decades to come.For those Labour supporters who voted to leave, it’s a reminder that the party’s MPs are desperate to overturn the result of the ‘People’s Vote’ in June .There are some notable exceptions. But the vast majority are determined to frustrate Brexit, regardless of the result of our biggest ever democratic exercise.Labour is now far more interested in north London than the north of England.The threat of Remainers wrecking our departure gets more pressing by the day.Brexiteers must accept reality and back the best Brexit possible: the PM’s deal.MIKE Thalassitis’ suicide is a wake-up call for Britain’s TV companies — and the country at large.Suicide is the single biggest killer of men under  in the UK.

Run for your lives.“But it really isn’t like that.”Oh, OK, you could maybe take your chances listening to her Fanny impression then. Talking of which, This Morning’s Martin Lewis. There’s a strong argument to say he should have been made to do If I Were A Rich Man, from Fiddler On The Roof. And an equally strong one to say he really shouldn’t. But he ended up doing Any Dream Will Do, from Joseph, and oh-my-s**tting dachshund he was bad. Talking point of the night, evenCorrie’s Daniel Brocklebank won, was Alan Titch-marsh singing Some Enchanted Evening, from South Pacic, on a stretch of thoughtfully placed decking.A man overcome with emotion. The main one being anger by the look on his face.Like next door’s kids had just punted their football straight into his prize begonias, it was.The audience went nuts for it, though, the judges were in floods of overwhelmed tears and, must admit, even I was aware I was watching something that would be played again and again, for both good and bad reasons.But I must urge caution here. Antony Cotton got his own ITV chat show after winning Soapstar Superstar.It just needed Simon Cowell tuning in on Sunday, and, before you know it, he’s got Titchmarsh back in the white blazer trying to Dream The Impossible Dream for the Christmas No.Still, we have to look for the positives, and what I’ll ultimately take from All Star Musicals is the fact John Barrowman appeared on telly, for two entire hours, and didn’t shout: “FAB-U-LOUS!” once.Progress. FRIDAY. This Morning’s Eamonn “Rip Van Winkle” Holmes: “If I eat before I go to bed I stand a better chance of falling into a deep sleep. Or am I just odd ”No, you’re corpulent as well.ROMESH Ranganathan broke with  years of Red Nose Day tradition and said something vaguely funny about Four Weddings And A Funeral on Friday night.“As a young Asian kid growing up in Crawley that film really spoke to me.”OK, not belly  laughs, but an acknowledgement that some of us don’t get Four Weddings and think we need a charity sequel about as much as Gregg Wallace needs a hairnet on Inside The Factory.Still, it was a chance to see what the ravages of time have done to almost everyone except Andie MacDowell, who certainly hasn’t spent the past  years taking acting lessons.The lesbian wedding plot was also entirely in keeping with the right-on tone of an event that’s so self-satisfied, starstruck and preachy you can understand why some people think Africa should go it alone rather than submit to Comic Relief’s condescension for all eternity.You’ll have to make your own judgment call on the true value of Red Nose Day, where the night’s grand total has been dropping ever since  and civilians have been almost vanished from the process entirely.Personally, I took inspiration from Sir Lenny Henry’s final words of the night: “See you in two years’ time maybe.”’Cos I heard that “maybe” and thought, “maybe not”. Channel ’s  Hours In Police ­Custody.The “fat ginger” ­playground line on Ricky ­Gervais’ new Netflix ­comedy After Le.Goggleboxer Lee dipping his Doritos in Jenny’s face pack.Scotland’s Finn Russell suddenly deciding he’d given England enough of a head start at - in an enthralling Calcutta Cup match.And Celebs Go Dating civilian Joe asking Love Island’s Georgia Steel, “What do you actually do ” and getting the perfect response  from narrator Rob Beckett: “In summary, f*** all.”b “Down Royal and Downpatrick in Northern Ireland host the racing of what animals ”Matt: “Cows.”Bradley Walsh: “What flying animal is the slang term for doing time in prison ”Rachel: “Monkey.”Bradley Walsh: “The hymn Guide Me, O Thou Great Jehovah is most associated with which sport ”Shirley: “Fishing.”Tipping Point, Ben Shephard: “Colloquially known as ‘Dubya’, President George Bush used which middle initial to distinguish himself from his father ”Jacob: “J.” .CHANNEL ’s hugely entertaining series The Bachelor UK was further proof that men are  from Mars and women are from an as-yet- undiscovered galaxy many thousands of light years away.They seemed surprisingly keen to mate with Alex Marks, though, considering he looked like Captain Haddock with a man-bun, below, and would’ve been the most vacant lot on any planetit wasn’t for the presence of host Mark Wright.He had only one tactic with all of the women as well: Tell them “You’re beautul,” ask for “a hug,” then move in for the kill with Reanne, Robyn, Charlotte T, Charlotte E, mad Georgie the circus performer, and even shark-eyed Essex nightmare Alicia.It was working a treat as well, until Tuesday’s episode, when Alicia found Alex snogging Charlotte T and it all kicked off massively.Reanne took the smartest option available, in the circumstances, by immediately quitting  the show.Alicia  took the dumbest option available, by locking herself in the South African mansion’s bathroom.So she can probably be thankful it wasn’t a celebrity version of the show and Alex is hardly the sharpest tool in  the box.Because the gormless, great oaf  only went and ruined everything by picking Alicia ahead of talented, beautul and much nicer Charlotte T on Thursday night’s final.I’d give it until the end of the credits.INCIDENTALLY,you’re still trying to decide whether Baptiste is great TV or not, it’s not.Andyou don’t believe me, watch next Sunday’s far-fetched finale and try to avoid replying: “Not bloody soon enough” when Stratton screams: “God, when does it end ”Bet you can’t. SORRY. Kazakhstan away.

Then MPs backed a Brexit delay.It’s asthe House of Commons is ­following Tony Blair’s step-by-step guide to overturning the  referendum.A No Deal Brexit will only happen in nine days’ timethe EU refuses an ­extension. That is unlikely.Theresa May will beg for a delay, whatever the conditions.EU members will not want to be blamed for a messy No Deal outcome.From next week, MPs could start voting on their preferred Brexit options through so-called indicative votes. Spoiler alert — they will not end up backing a harder exit.I know there are Leave voters who do not like Theresa May’s Brexit deal.Butyou do not like her deal, look at the alternative options for softer Brexits, which would be far worse for the country.If you think this deal risks the UK ­getting stuck in a customs union, just wait till you see what the deal would look like with Labour’s “permanent” customs union glued on top.Better to have an imperfect route to controlling our own trade policy than no route at all.If you do not like the fact that, under the PM’s deal, we would have to keep existing EU goods and agricultural rules, imagine staying in the Single Market or, as it is rebranded, Common Market .. We would lose the veto over goods rules which we have in the backstop, and be forced to follow rules on services too.Even in a worst-case scenario, Theresa May’s deal lets us escape the EU’s “ever closer union” political project and seize control of our own immigration policy.We would be in control of almost all our economy and not have to pay a penny for it on an ongoing basis.It is far better than most critics will admit. Thanks to changes secured at Strasbourg last week, we have new protections.The EU can no longer do what French President Macron arrogantly threatened. It will not be able to use the backstop as a “trap” to demand access to UK fishing waters.The EU cannot just say “non” to every sensible idea for resolving the Irish border issues. The so-called Star Chamber of MPs were quick to reject the Strasbourg changes.But they should listen to the Irish opposition party.Their Brexit spokesperson said: “We have come a long way” from a “bullet-proof, rock-solid, cast-iron backstop”.Or how about top barrister Lord ­Pannick  He is the QC who won the case for Gina Miller against the Government.He argues that in some circumstances the UK could terminate the deal through the so-called Vienna Convention.Conservative Eurosceptic big beasts, from ex-leader Michael Howard to former Chancellor Norman Lamont, have all weighed in behind the deal.David Davis, who resigned over ­Chequers, is now onside.Lord Trimble, who won the Nobel Peace Prize for the Good Friday Agreement, has backed it. If he can live with the backstop, that should count for something.But some Eurosceptic back- benchers still refuse to support the PM’s deal.Led by Jacob Rees-Mogg, they would prefer a harder deal. But face facts. There is no harder Brexit on offer.With No Deal out of reach, there is no incentive for the EU to provide any more concessions.That means the choices are this deal or a softer Brexit. Or no Brexit at all.And be sure that the Speaker, John Bercow, will bend every possible rule to frustrate Brexit.So, do not expect a long delay to offer a better answer.Anyway, the choice on our future could be made soon.There is no time to lose to save Brexit. Even a snap General Election offers no easy salvation. It would mean Theresa May leading the Tories into another campaign on a manesto of her deal — precisely what her critics want to avoid.

Maybe to keep up levels of national happiness we should leave horrible, authoritarian bureaucracies every year. Just to put a grin on our faces. I mean, the French don’t seem very happy, do they But here’s the bad news. Theresa May is still Prime Minister and we’re currently heading for a Brexit which would be a travesty of the one we voted for in . If we get Brexit at all.Some of the Brexiteers in Parliament think we might still be able to escape the EU with a No Deal, on World Trade Organisation terms. I think they are deluding themselves.Parliament, which is two to one in favour of NOT leaving the EU, simply will not let it happen.And the EU, desperate to retain its market for goods in the UK, will make sure it doesn’t happen, too.Our Brexiteers are right that Theresa May’s deal is awful. Butthey get a chance to vote on it again, they should hold their noses and vote in favour.Because I reckon it’s that or nothing. We will have a delay, the EU may insist we hold a second referendum as a condition of that delay.And trust me, the second referendum will be rigged in favour of remaining in the EU. It will not be a straightforward in or out option. There will be three options, to split the Leave vote down the middle.In this fight to leave the EU, the British people have had everything against them. The EU, obvs. But also the House of Commons and the puffed-up, ludicrous, pro-Remain speaker John Bercow. And the House of Lords, the civil service and the BBC.The lesson for us low-born, powerless Leavers is to take what we can and scarper before the whole idea is killed stone dead. Which I fear it may be.And now Mrs May is heading back to Brussels to plead for a delay in triggering Article .All along she has been too obsessed with the process of leaving the EU, rather than the clear imperative as demanded by the British people — to simply LEAVE the EU, all of it.She has followed Brussels’ agenda at every twist and turn. And she’ll be following it now. She’ll do what the EU wants.So here’s the deal, as I see it. Give her hopeless proposal one more chance and this time vote for it.We will have been cheated, but not as badly aswe do not leave at all.Because the longer this goes on, the more likely that outcome will be.THIS country becomes more deranged by the very hour.A Roman Catholic journalist claims she may face JAIL because she referred to a transgendered person by the sex assigned at birth, rather than the one she now identies as.Caroline Farrow has been told she must attend a police station for a taped interview.She said: “I have pointed out to police that I am a Catholic journalist commentator and it is my religious belief that a person cannot change sex.”Quite.

I quickly came to learn that, in relation to Brexit, nothing could be further from the truth.Unfortunately, I must remain anonymous for fear of the backlash I would receive at my place of work.However, I can reveal I am a senior policy professional within the service and work closely with a number of government departments.There are a number of extremely dangerous myths regarding civil servants that I must dispel because of the impact they are having on the Brexit process.MYTH : The civil service is independent. The civil service was founded on the pillars of political neutrality.Civil servants are meant to ensure that their own political persuasions do not affect their work. Crucially, they should accept those from all political leanings and points of view.It has become clear to me that the vast majority of civil servants support Remain.From my observations I would estimate this number to be well over  per cent.This is worrying in itself and far from representative of the  per cent of the people who voted for Brexit.Most horrying, however, is the sheer disdain and utter contempt that my colleagues display towards people who voted to Leave.I have lost count of the number of insulting and derogatory terms that are used in my own department and where to refer to the .million people who voted for Brexit: “Racist”, “stupid”, “uneducated”.Anti-Brexit jokes and snide remarks are dropped casually into everyday office con-versations. I live in fear that my colleagues will discover through a slip of my tongue that I am a Brexiteer.Were this to happen, I believe that most would refuse to talk to me again and I might even lose my job.This entire culture creates a thickening cloud of negativity towards Brexit that shades all areas of the civil service. I have witnessed first-hand civil servants doing everything within their power, subtly and under the surface, to frustrate Brexit and talk it down at every opportunity.This can only seriously undermine our efforts to be in the strongest position possible on leaving the EU.MYTH : Civil servants are experts in their field.One would like to think the iniduals making decisions that affect our entire nation would have some level of skill or experience.If only that were true.For example, I know of one stand-alone “expert” policy team leading our preparations for Brexit.You can imagine my disbelief when I discovered none of its members had worked on anything remotely related to the EU before. In fact, I have discovered over time that the vast majority of “experts” within the service have no expertise whatsoever.In many cases the “portfolio” you take on when you join the service is dictated by the one held by your predecessor.As a result, you have new civil servants inheriting politically sensitive and highly important work without the faintest clue about what they are dealing with.Civil servants who are seriously underperforming will usually have a new job title and position created for them somewhere  in the organisation instead of being sacked or performance-managed — they become someone ’s problem then.Given the influence that civil servants are exerting over the Brexit process, this is truly concerning.MYTH : The civil service does not engage in scaremongering.I had hoped that civil servants, even in times of crisis, would be able to remain calm and level-headed in pursuit of ensuring the best outcomes for our country.And yet it is not uncommon for me to receive emails from colleagues promoting Brexit scare stories that are nothing more than lies and speculation. Recently, things have become so panicked that ious “Brexit contingency” plans have been set up throughout the organisation. This is to prepare for the “national public transport breakdown”, “surge in criminality” and “widespread public unrest” that is going to follow after we leave.These plans also involve collecting the personal details of certain civil servants to put in place a -hour, on-call rota for the “emergency” that is looming. This scare-mongering, created and whipped up by civil servants, is having a marked impact on the confidence and well-being of ordinary citizens.For example, one acquain-tance of mine is so terried by the speculative threats put out by the service they have started to stockpile large quantities of their medication. This needs to stop.MYTH : Ministers are in charge.When I was outside the civil service looking in, I always believed civil servants were there simply to advise their ministers, who, as elected representatives of the people, would make the ultimate decision. However, I have come to realise that ministers are often mere puppets, with civil servants pulling ferociously at their strings.The level of bureaucracy is unimaginable.In my experience parlia-mentary briefings go through — at a minimum — five stages of internal clearance, with crucial information being amended or deleted at every stage on the whim of that inidual civil servant.The power and competence of our ministers is, I’m afraid, a facade.They are nothing more than a megaphone for the views of biased civil servants who lurk behind them in the shadows.I am a supporter of the Leave campaign.To go against the will of the people expressed in the  referendum would be the ultimate act of betrayal.The Government MUST allow us to take back control by leaving the EU on World Trade Organisation terms. If the people are betrayed, I may have no choice but to resign.Honesty, impartiality, integrity and objectivity. We will soon discover, once and for all, whether our politicians embody these values.©The Sunday Times News Licensing Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But its a loan which means the repayments will be automatically deducted from your future Universal Credit pay out.Alternative Payment Arrangements- If youre falling behind on rent, you or your landlord may be able to apply for an APA which will get your payment sent directly to your landlord. You might also be able to change your payments to get them more frequently, or you can split the paymentsyoure part of a couple.Budgeting Advance - You may be able to get help from the government to help with emergency household costs of up to £youre single, £youre part of a couple or £you have children. These are only in cases like your cooker breaking down or for help getting a job. Youll have to repay the advance through your regular Universal Credit payments. Youll still have to repay the loan, evenyou stop claiming for Universal Credit.Cut your Council Tax - You might be able to get a discount on your Council Tax or be entitled to Discretionary Housing Paymentsyour payments arent enough to cover your rent.Foodbanks - If youre really hard up and struggling to buy food and toiletries, you can find your local foodbank who will provide you with help for free. You can find your nearest one on the Trussel Trust website.Some Brits are also stung for previous over payments on the old system - many of whom are totally unaware that they owed money until its taken off their Universal Credit payment.A DWP spokeswoman said: When claimants have housing or utility arrears, we make deductions from their benefits to help pay off debts and keep them in their homes.Safeguards are in place to ensure that deductions are affordable.Earlier this week MPs revealed they will look into whether Brits are being forced into prostitution because of Universal Credit."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/NINTCHDBPICT000477482246.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"it may take you a while to work out whats going on in these mind bending photos","story":"From a cat that’s morphed into a Barbie doll, to a bloke who appears to have melted into his ironing board, these photos will make you look twice.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It can cause tiredness and sometimes breathlessness.In some cases bowel cancer can block the bowel, this is known as a bowel obstruction.Irrespective of whether these sweeteners are having a direct effect on tumour development and growth, people wishing to reduce their likelihood of developing cancer should limit their intake.It comes after experts warned that drinking Coke or even Diet Coke could increase your risk of dying young.Research found that two cans of regular Coke increases the risk of early death from heart disease by a third.The move could save more than , lives a year, experts say.Bowel cancer is the second deadliest form of the disease, but it can be curedits caught early - or better still prevented.Caught at stage  - the earliest stage - patients have a  per cent chance of living for five years or longer.But catch it at stage  - when its already spread - and that chance plummets to just seven per cent.In April, Lauren Backler, whose mum died of the disease at the age of , joined forces with The Sun to launch the No Time  Lose campaign, also supported by Bowel Cancer UK and Beating Bowel Cancer.

Insiders claimed Sir Graham Brady, the Tory kingpin backbencher, had been to see the PM on Monday to tell her a growing number of MPs believe she should quit.Arch Brexiteer MP Nigel Evans said the PM would be a heroineshe took the country out on No Deal. But the move would risk exploding the Conservative Party in two.Some  Remain Ministers have already threatened to resign en masse over a No Deal.Eight mid-ranking Ministers went to see Tory chief whip Julian Smith yesterday to demand the freedom to vote for a longer extension of the Article  negotiating deadline in the Commons next weekthe PMs deal is voted down.In a startling volte face late last night in Brussels, Mrs May took a No Deal exit for March  off the table.Vowing to introduce legislation next week to formally delay the UK’s exit date, the PM still claimed No Deal was still an option for April her deal isn’t passed.That was despite insisting to MPs on Wednesday that she wouldnt allow the UK to remain in the EU beyond June .Quizzed by The Sun last nightshe will agree to be bound by whatever MPs decide to do next, the PM said: “I am very clear we will need to work with house how to proceed.“The council has tonight clearly framed the choices open to people”.Speaking just before her at midnight, EU Council boss Donald Tusk outlined four choices open to MPs – Mrs May’s deal, no deal, a long extension or cancelling Brexit altogether.The only one of the four that the PM ruled out was the last one, an Article  revocation.BUSINESS bosses and union chiefs appealed to Theresa May to come up with a Plan B.Leaders of the CBI and the TUC joined forces to warn that a No Deal would be a wrecking ball to the economy.They urged the PM to seek a longer Brexit delayshe lost the third meaningful vote.Their joint statement said: “Our country is facing a national emergency.”Earlier, the Mr May was forced to endure the humiliation of waiting outside a summit room for hours as feuding EU leaders carved up Brexit’s timetable without her.The PM went to Brussels to issue a plea for a three month Brexit delay to June  to give her a final chance to pass her exit deal next week.After grilling her for  minutes, Europe’s  leaders then asked her to leave.A massive row then ignited among them over what to do, as dferent national bosses pitched dferent ideas and ripped up Mrs May’s - with all fearing her third and final ultimatum to MPs would fail.In an embarrassment to her, Britain’s PM was left having to wait nervously for more than five hours in a nearby room with no windows, with only her No officials for company.An EU official told The Sun: When leaders asked her what she was going to do, PM May would only say she was still pursuing Plan A of getting the deal through.It was then they decided that she didnt have a plan so decided they would need to come up with one for her.Another EU source told The Sun it was “lively in the room” of the  leaders as a battle royal raged late into the night.EU Council chief Donald Tusk initially proposed offering the UK an extension until at least May , regardless of whether or not she gets her deal through Parliament.At the insistence of the rooms doves - Germany, the Netherlands and Poland - another plan was then pitched to offer a long delay with no final limit on it.Instead, they vented the possibility of two dferent delays – dubbed a Flextension – a short one of a few monthsthe deal is passed by MPs on Tuesday, and a longer one of nine monthsit falls.But Emmanuel Macron lead another group of leaders including Belgium who insisted on a harder line, saying Britain should be made to leave the club by May  no matter what.The French president picked the date because it would mean the UK being out before the EU holds a crucial summit on its future direction in Romania on May .With still no agreement by pm, the talks – which started at .pm - spilled into dinner, which had previously been earmarked for a major discussion about strategic relations with China.It meant leaders dined on green lentil terrine with langoustine, roast duckling à lorange with parsnip mousseline and glazed carrots and chocolate iations, again without the PM who was initially due to join them.As the EU leaders tucked into their three course dinner, some took pity on hungry Mrs May and sent out her servings to her on a silver service tray.Her No aides had to resort to ordering in pizza.An EU diplomat told The Sun: The unity of the  was broken for the very first time.Earlier Mrs May had addressed her fellow leaders for over an hour in a performance that diplomats panned as unconvincing.One EU source said: It wasn’t clearshe has a plan B,she has a plan at all.She’s still convinced she can get this vote through. No leaders believe that because the conditions aren’t dferent.The PM was also repeatedly asked by several leaders what she would doMPs voted the deal down.But she was described as “evasive” and “tight-lipped”.Another diplomat added: We’re running out of time and it’s not clear what’s going to happen next.Its % sure leaders will need to come back next week. That will be the real Council. Today is just an appetiser.The two-day leaders’ meeting was supposed to be the last EU summit for Britain in its  years as an EU member – but even that remained unclear.Earlier on arriving in Brussels, Mr Macron turned the screw on MPs to declare there will be “No Deal for sure” in seven days timethey torpedo it for the third and final time on Tuesday.Mr Macron also said a short delayMrs May’s deal passes to give Commons the time to push through all the necessary laws “must be as short as possible”.He added: “In case of a negative British vote, we would go to a No Deal for sure.“We cannot have an excessive extension because it affects our ability to decide and act.“We are ready for Brexit. France didn’t chose this.

Either weaposll leave on May we have a deal, orwe donapost, delay to just April  when we face another clf-edge choice. It’s the latest step in the saga but leaves us no closer to actually working out what to do. And once again everyone’s eyes will be on the fractious House of Commons for a vote next Tuesday. Here are the  biggest things you need to know as you wake up this morning.  After almost  hours of gruelling talks, the EU and UK have reached a deal to delay Brexit . We definitely won’t leave on March , whether or not MPs back Theresa May ’s agreement next week. Donapost worry, youaposre not the only one.

Click here to visit Paddy Poweraposs Brexit Bunker and you might soon be packing your bags!   In a midnight press conference after furious behind-the-scenes wrangling - and the rare sight of hot disagreement within the EU - European Council President Donald Tusk said he is “much more optimistic” about the future.  But the EU has now made clear there is absolutely no more change to the Brexit deal. And there are still huge unanswered questions and a political crisis in the UK. . We have two dates - and MPs get to choose  If MPs AGREE a Brexit deal by March , there will be an extension of Brexit until May . The two-month extension will give enough time to pass the hundreds of laws necessary in the UK to leave the EU in an orderly, managed way. If MPs DO NOT AGREE a Brexit deal by March  - seen as far more likely - there will be a tiny extension of Brexit until just April . In this short time the UK faces an emergency European Council summit - and an incredibly hard set of choices.  In this situation, according to EU chief Donald Tusk, the UK has four choices: It agrees the deal after all It leaves the EU with No Deal It revokes Article  to cancel Brexit Or it puts forward a dferent plan to get a “long extension” - which would mean taking part in EU elections. Theresa May says she doesn’t want the first two but bizarrely did NOT rule out a long extension - despite, erm, doing just that on Wednesday. . Theresa May was left impotent and humiliated  The PM wanted a delay until June  -MPs approved her deal. But she said nothing about what would happenthey didn’t. So after an address to EU leaders brutally described as “ minutes of nothing”, they took the decision out of her hands. With May out the room, EU leaders thrashed out their own two-way plan for a conditional delay.  The Prime Minister was told directly by Tory MPs’ envoy THIS WEEK that they want her to quit, it’s been revealed. According to the Daily , Sir Graham Brady had been “bombarded” with texts from MPs pleading with him to confront their own leader. The leader of the backbench  Committee duly conveyed their message during a face to face meeting in Downing Street on Monday, it is reported. Despite the threat Mrs May cannot be forced out by a leadership vote until December because she has a year’s grace after winning the last one. . She was forced to U-turn on her threats to MPs  The PM climbed down after furious claims she had “fuelled the far right” with a vicious attack on MPs. Speaking on Wednesday night, she put the entire blame on Parliament for refusing twice to vote for her failed deal. It emerged she made her speech just hours after being asked to dial down the rhetoric by Labour MP Paula Sherrf - who received a beheading threat.  And Labour MP Lloyd Russell-Moyle revealed he was assaulted hours after the PM’s address. Last night Mrs May said: “I know MPs on all sides of the debate have passionate views, and I respect those dferent positions.  “Last night I expressed my frustration. I know that MPs are frustrated too. They have dficult jobs to do. I hope we can all agree, we are now at the moment of decision.” . The EU had a massive disagreement  Usually the views of the other  EU countries are stitched up in advance at the big Brussels summits. But in a sign of just how chaotic Brexit has got the talks ran over by about  hours. Frances’s Emmanuel Macron went in with a much harder line than the other leaders, demanding that a ‘no’ vote by MPs would “guide everyone to no deal”. But his hardline stance was clearly outgunned in the final deal. . Hell is filling up with Brexiteers  There is still “a lot of space” in hell for Brexiteers who campaigned with no plan, EU chief Donald Tusk declared. The European Council president doubled down on his claim that there’d be a “special place in hell” for Leaver politicians in a bizarre midnight exchange. Askedthe special place in hell should be extended to include more members of the commons, Tusk said: “According to our pope, hell is still empty… it means there’s a lot of space [in it].” As journalists burst out laughing an aide said awkwardly: “I think this is the right moment to conclude the press conference.” To cap it all, EU chief Jean-Claude Juncker then shouted at the world’s press: “Don’t go to hell!”  Yes, this is all really, actually happening, in real le.

Click here to visit Paddy Poweraposs Brexit Bunker and you might soon be packing your bags!   It all hinges on whether or not MPs back Theresa May’s Brexit deal in the House of Commons next week.  There will be an extension of Brexit until May . This date is signicant because it is just before the European Parliament holds its elections. .  The idea is the two-month extension will give enough time to pass the hundreds of laws necessary in the UK to leave the EU in an orderly, managed way. The dealgives us a “transition period” where EU laws carry over much as they do now until  December . During that time, we would negotiate a future trade relationship.  In this situation - seen as far more likely - there will be a tiny extension of Brexit until just April . This date is signicant because it’s the deadline to start the paperwork for entering European Parliament elections. In this short time the UK faces an emergency European Council summit - and an incredibly hard set of choices. In this situation, according to EU chief Donald Tusk, the UK has four choices:It agrees the deal after all It leaves the EU with No Deal It revokes Article  to cancel Brexit Or it puts forward a dferent plan to get a “long extension” - which would mean taking part in EU elections.  Theresa May essentially backs options  or . She said she does not support revoking Article , an idea backed by more than million people in a petition.  And said “it would be wrong” to take part in EU elections required by a long extension, though she did not rule them out. There has been speculation she could resign in a long extension. And tonight Juncker warned that extension would be “to the very end” a phrase that will leave Brexiteer Tories enraged. She said there was a “clear choice” open to MPs to pass her deal and ensure Brexit happens.  The summit rubber-stamped the so-called ‘Strasbourg Agreement’ - the deal from earlier this month giving “legally binding assurances” that the Irish backstop, a clause in the -page deal that could trap the UK under EU customs rules, will not be permanent. However, those same assurances were labelled as not a legal guarantee by the Attorney General. They’ve already been defeated by  votes. So they’re unlikely to win MPs round next week.  No. She wanted a delay until June  -MPs approved her deal. But said nothing about what would happenthey didn’t. After an address to EU leaders brutally described as “ minutes of nothing”, they took the decision out of her hands. With May out the room, EU leaders thrashed out their own two-way plan for a conditional delay.  They disagreed and the negotiation took many twists and turns, but eventually the plan above was agreed. What happens now   MPs are set to vote probably on Tuesday on the Brexit deal - for the third time.  If it’s voted down expect a furious series of events to unfold in Parliament and between Britain and the EU. There will be an emergency EU summit and possible “indicative votes” for the House of Commons to find the way forward. The EU has insisted it will not give any more on its deal - and “emergency plans” are in place for a No Deal Brexit . Juncker said: “This closes and completes the full package. There is no more we can give. “We’re ready for every eventuality including No Deal. We’re ready and we’ve been ready since . “Emergency measures are in place and we’re continuing to prepare.” "},{"url":null,"title":"brexit minister suggests mps free","story":"NewsBrexit minister suggests MPs will get FREE VOTE on the way out of the crisisKwasi Kwarteng raised eyebrows with his candid comments about \"indicative votes\", where MPs can plot the way forwardShareCommentsByJenner McKiernanDan BloomOnline Political Editor:,  MAR Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news politics video brexit-theresa-said-people-voted-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : # , title : Mirror Politics ,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : # , title : Mirror Politics ,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true\"\"Get the biggest politics stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailTory MPs will be given a FREE VOTE to plot Britainaposs course out of the Brexit chaos, a Tory minister has suggested.Brexit Minister Kwasi Kwarteng said he would be surprisedthe Government did not allow MPs to vote without whippingso-called indicative votes are brought forward.The multiple-choice votes are expected in the coming weeks to weed out the least unpopular option after EU chiefs challenged the UK to either pass a deal, or come up with an alternative plan by April .

Tory Brexiteer Mark Francois, of the European Research Group, said he did not believe a third meaningful vote would be successful and urged the Government to change tack. He said: Can I remind the minister of Denis Healeyaposs first rule of politics: When you are in a hole, stop digging. Whenever the meaningful vote is tabled... I believe this House will vote it down, not least because of the rather hubristic speech the Prime Minister made when she effectively attacked members of this house for having the temerity to vote with their consciences. So, I think it wonapost go through. Mr Kwarteng said: The Governmentaposs focus at the moment is to make sure we can potentially get a meaningful vote and actually secure the deal on the table, that is what I have always maintained.

New Zealand’s Labour prime minister rose magnicently to the occasion when a hate-crazed assassin struck in Christchurch, killing  Muslim worshippers. Straight into the thick of it, taking charge and bringing the people with her, Jacinda Ardern was all that a democratic leader should be. This slightly-built, witheringly articulate woman who was only named her party’s leader the month before becoming PM in , spoke for her nation asshe had been born for such a challenge.    Compare her handling of a national crisis with Theresa May’s ham-fisted, ­incoherent command of Brexit. The contrast is embarrassing. Mrs May is a politician’s politician: more than two decades as an MP, chairwoman of the Tory Party, holder of a string of ministerial offices and six years as Home Secretary, before taking over from David Cameron as PM in . But she’s not a natural leader. Jacinda is, and it shows. A one-time policy adviser to Tony Blair, this -year-old starter-premier could tell veteran Theresa a thing or two about doing the job. Like how to conduct ­yourself with people.    Mrs May is gauche, wooden and lacking in empathy. She came late to the Grenfell fire tragedy, and failed to win hearts and minds. Mrs Kiwi gets in there, talks the talk with victims’ families, and then walks the walk with tough new curbs on gun ownership. You can tell she gets it.

As Georgina Lochrane locked eyes with Aaron Campbell for the first time in court, she couldnapost believe the -year-old schoolboy was capable of the brutality inflicted upon her six-year-old daughter, whose tiny naked body was found face down in woodland with  injuries. “I thought it would have been a grown man or someone who Alesha knew, admitted heartbroken Georgina, . “It never crossed my mind it could be a -year-old. I was his age when I had Alesha. He had his school, his friends, he clearly had a le ahead of him. I just don’t get it.    Campbell was yesterday locked up for at least  years for his sickening crimes. But even as he gave evidence at the High Court last month, his cocktail of deception had Georgina hoodwinked for a short time and she contemplated the idea he may be telling the truth. “To start with, it was that bizarre it was believable. We all believed it, Georgina told the Daily Record. The conniving thug tried to frame Toni McLachlan,  - the girlfriend of Aleshaaposs father, whom Georgina split with in . He claimed they had been having an affair and Ms McLachlan was jealous of Aleshaaposs relationship with father Rab so killed the smiley little girl.  The cannabis-smoking sicko concocted a far-fetched story for the jury in which he said he and Ms McLachlan had sex on the night Alesha was taken and he accused her of killing the youngster and planting his DNA on her body. “I wasn’t shocked he tried to blame someone  but I was shocked by who, said Georgina. For those charges, I presumed it was going to be a\u2028 male – it would have to be. Campbellaposs lawyer accused Ms McLachlan of taking Alesha to the site of an abandoned hotel where the child was murdered and “brutalised” with an “implement”. He then said she had “planted” the condom with Campbellaposs semen to implicate him, something she denied.  Georgina continued: “I think Campbell’s story had a lot of people doubting to start with. But when he took the stand, everything completely changed. “The way he was talking, it was like he was describing exactly what he’d done to Alesha but through Toni. “He said she must have thought about it and really planned it. But then his mask slipped and Georgina says his lack of emotion was the biggest tell-tale sign he was guilty. She said: There was no emotion from him. That’s when I thought, ‘No, it’s you’.” I came to believe she was innocent after a few days. I had seen Toni and Alesha together. Alesha really liked her.   “Toni was one of the only girls Rab had introduced to Alesha that I liked. I remembered how good Toni was with her. That’s when I realised, ‘No, it’s a sin.’ It’s\u2028 just not what Alesha would have wanted. Georgina has also told of how Campbell turned to her and smiled when he was found guilty of raping and murdering her girl. When the verdict was read out and he was walking down the stairs, he smiled at us, at our full family, she said. If he is  and has committed a crime which the pathologist said is the worst he has ever seen, imagine what he can do in  years’ time. He’s in a cell and has time to plot. He has clearly thought it out. That does not deserve to ever be released back into society. That thing is an animal.

Straight from spending  days sleeping rough on UK streets, Stafford will have to use all his survival skills learned from previous experiences to keep his family safe. Ed and his fellow explorer we Laura Bingham will have to go back to basics when they are left on the Indonesian island with their toddler son, Ran, with just the clothes they are standing in next month. Speaking exclusively to the Mirror about the Discovery TV show, Ed said: Itaposs not without its risks but I think it will be a really positive thing. “Surviving on your own is one thing but in real le you would have dependents. So, the concept we pitched to Discovery was to do a show with Laura and Ran.  “When you have a baby youaposre told you need so much stuff - this type of stroller, this type of teat for your dummy, this type of toy.  Butyou were living in an indigenous tribe you wouldnapost have any of these trappings of the western world.  So the concept of what weaposre about to do as a family is plonk ourselves on an island and seewe can live without everything, literally start from scratch, so no water, no kne, no food, go literally in the clothes weaposre standing up in. Iaposm confident that I have enough survival skills to look after a little baby, and Lauraaposs more than capable of handling herself. And it will be an amazing opportunity for all of us as a family to take the survival genre on.   I donapost think it is realistic for one man to be on TV beating his chest saying aposlook how tough I amapos. In a real survival situation you would have people who were dependent on you.  Laura, , is no stranger herself to surviving in extreme conditions after leading the first ever expedition to navigate Guyanaaposs  mile Essequibo river from source to sea just eight months after giving birth to Ran. Speaking about the familyaposs new challenge she added: Itaposs going to be an extreme test on us and our strength and itaposs going to be an extreme test of our inidual skills and it will really take us back to basics. Hopefully I can hold my own and do the hand drilland be an independent woman. It will be interesting to see how that evolution goes, who takes more of the childcare role or whether weaposre very equal with it all. “It will be like Swiss Family Robinson,” she said with a grin.  I met up with Laura at her family home just weeks before Edaposs latest TV challenge -  Nights on the Streets - aired on Channel .  Smiling, she swings open the heavy studded door to her home as two shaggy dogs the size of ponies push against her legs. Itaposs her birthday, but the intrepid explorer, world record setter, budding childrenaposs book author and mum agreed to an interview today anyway - pencilled in between hand drill fire lighting and fitness classes. And learning to light fires with nothing but scavenged sticks may be a very important skill to master for Laura and Edaposs new TV show. Butanyone can successfully take on such a challenge, they can. Last February, Laura led the first ever expedition to navigate Guyanaaposs  mile Essequibo river from source to sea just eight months after giving birth to Ran.  And despite the physical pain of missing him , she successfully completed her mission with fellow explorers Ness Knight and Pip Stewart. Her husband Ed, , shot to fame when he became the first person to walk across the Amazon, filming the gruelling trip in which he had to contend with an inhospitable environment and occasionally hostile locals who held him up with guns and bows and arrows.  He has since filmed multiple TV series with Discovery Channel, including Naked and Marooned and First Man Out.  The couple already have some experience of bringing up baby in the wild. When Ran was  months old he had already been to  countries, including the remote jungles of Guyana when Ed brought him to visit Laura on her expedition there. And while they believe that wilderness can be a statistically safer place to raise a child than driving him around British roads, even some brushes with nature are too close for comfort for the family. Ed pales a little as he remembers how a jaguar strolled through their camp in Guyana – straight over the area where Ran would have slept in a cot on the forest floorthey had not left just hours earlier. Ed had decided to move him away from the expedition to wait out the next leg in a nearby settlement with better shelter and shade when the large cat joined camp.]  Our baby was almost eaten by a jaguar. We can laugh now but it was scary, he said. As Laura offers drinks in their charming country kitchen, where trussed up plants cascade from the ceiling and plant cuttings jostle towards the light on deep stone windowsills, a tall man with bright blue eyes swings open the back door. With a shy smile he wishes Laura a happy birthday and hands her a box of chocolates. This is aposMikeapos, she says. Ed met him filming in London and invited him back to help with our house painting. Ed is just back from filming Channel  documentary,  Days on the Streets, where he lived rough with no food, water or shelter in Manchester, Glasgow and London for  days. The three-part C documentary examines the homelessness epidemic currently sweeping Britain. Laura said: “Edaposs a very good judge of character, so when he texted saying aposdo you mindI bring someone back apos I was like, aposyes, yes you can.apos “He met aposMikeapos on the first or second day, they struck up a conversation and Lee took him under his wing. He was essentially his aposinapos, his tour guide to the streets. So when they finished filming, Ed asked him to come here to help us with the house painting.  aposMikeapossapos amazing. Heaposs really, really respectful, really non-imposing, he just gets on and does the painting stuff for us. Heaposs a really nice, unimposing chap. Ed added: “I told him the house was like a nursing home and thereaposd be lots of space.” But after just  days on the streets eating fast food and sleeping rough, a previously healthy Ed has suffered heart, thyroid and gut problems. Laura said: aposEd is an extremely amazing man. Heaposs like an emotional sponge, he feels pain a lot and I donapost knowheaposs absorbed a lot of pain from the streets. Heaposs got a leaky gut after eating two months of pure junk food. So health-wise he needs to pick himself back up and heaposs on a health mission. Edaposs working with a vegetable protein company called Nuzest to fix his leaky gut. All of his levels were off, he was % on the road to cardiovascular disease, his thyroidaposs not working and all his blood tests showed everything you do not want in your body.  And he has all that from eating junk food for two months. We were talking to youafter getting the results and you were like aposI donapost want those blood teststhataposs what happens in two months.apos aposMikeapos, who did not wish to be identied by his real name, said: Yeah, mine would be through the roof! Then, ason cue, a courier calls to the door to collect a machete for a photoshoot to accompany a magazine article about Edaposs favourite item - which of course is a very large, al blade which he said cost about  in Brazil. Itaposs very rusty, he says, as he checks that tape is covering the blade to avoid cutting any future, less kne-practiced, handlers. More guests then call to the door laden with flowers, craft gin and a little silver bee keyring. “I love bees,” said Laura smiling at it, before the avid gardener and bee keeper retrieved her precious seed box to share her plans for planting more bee-friendly flowers across their garden this year. “I call Ed my Honeybee,” Laura said with a grin. The couple met while Laura was planning to cycle across South America with no money. “I emailed him for advice, he Googled me and said aposIaposll meet up with you.apos”  Ed smiled: “You happened to mention in first line of your email that you were a former model so thataposs why I Googled you.” “My greatest campaign was genital psoriasis in case youaposre wondering,” Laura said smiling broadly. “They said they wanted to book me because I had aposgreat facial expressions.apos They only told me what it was for after I turned up so it was too late then. “I mostly just did real le modelling jobs. “I was told thatwanted to book proper stuff I needed to lose a lot of weight to compensate for not being pretty enough. “I was a size eight but I was told to lose three inches from everywhere. Bulemia and drugs and are the only ways to do that so I chose to quit and be healthy instead. “Now I punish myself in expeditions instead,” she joked. The couple lived in London before selling their Battersea pad and moved to a big old country house in the pretty village of Hallaton, Leicestershire, near Edaposs parents. Ed wanted to move, and Laura “had never been a dream crusher” so she acquiesced. Born in Stoke Charity, a small village outside Winchester, country le has not been too dficult an adaptation for her and she has filled any precious spare time with raising her chickens and bees and growing her garden. “Iaposm much happier around plants and chickens, growing vegetables,” she said.  “If the apocalypse happens everyone can come here. I’ll grow the vegetables and Ed can teach survival skills.” The couple bought their country pile after falling in love with itaposs rangy rooms and giant garden which stretches down to a lake and woodland. The houseaposs previous owners lived there happily for  years, until when aged  and , they died within months of each other. So the houseaposs history seemed a good omen for a new couple. Months later, Laura gave birth to Ran in their bedroom, after having the two floors below her reinforced with steel joists to make sure her birthing pool did not plunge through the floor boards in the throes of labour. “Ran is now the only person with Hallaton on his passport,” she said. “And he’s the dictator of the house,” Ed said laughing. But despite the happy, vibrant hive of activity that their home is, the last few months have not been entirely easy. Laura suffered a miscarriage last year when she was three and a half months pregnant with twin girls. She said: “It was a molar pregnancy where two sperm fertilise one egg so there are an extra set of chromosomes and I had eclampsia in early September. “My body didn’t recognize that the babies had died, and the placenta grew like a tumour.  “If I did not have medical help, like so many of the women I’ve met on my travels don’t,  it would have been fatal. One in seven women die in pregnancy or childbirth worldwide. It makes you hugely thankful to have western medicine. “I felt awful with that pregnancy. I could barely get up off the couch, I started bleeding at  weeks and I was completely vulgar to Ed. “I think he was relieved to go filming. He was like “Bye, I’ll go be homeless for two months instead of being here,apos Laura said jokingly. “I’m almost in a good place now again after it. “I’m not a patient person and I hate having to wait to get pregnant again but we have to wait until my hormone levels are back to normal. “So we’ll go on our adventure in a month or so, and after that we’ll try again. Laura is friendly but focused, occasionally slipping into a charming goofiness or cracking self-deprecating jokes. She is beautul, wearing no make-up on a face that nature made so perfectly it needs no further enhancement.Her husband is unusually open for a TV personality, with the light and shade of unrepressed emotion and thought brightening and clouding his face like a shting weather pattern. That openness and ability to connect with people is one of the things that makes him so likeable on screen.Laura has been working on her first series of childrenaposs books based on ‘real adventures by real people’, which is due to be published by Award in June. “I hate the idea of children growing up thinking that their self-worth comes from how big your cleavage is, or how short your skirt is, or how many guys stare at you in a day. I want the books to teach little girls and boys that self-worth comes from within, from what you can achieve in le and the goodness you can give to others.  "},{"url":null,"title":"grandma 71 becomes oldest burlesque","story":"NewsGrandma, , becomes oldest burlesque dancer in UK and has never felt sexierMarilyn Bersey, , from the Isle of Wight, who performs as Foxy La Mer, has lost seven stone in weight after taking up the hobby last yearShareCommentsByHarriet Whitehead:,  MAR Updated:,  MAR NewsThe dancer says she is fitter than ever \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email A bad grandma has found a new lease of le after taking up burlesque dancing - and she could be the oldest performer in the UKSeptuagenarian Marilyn Bersey, from the Isle of Wight, took up the racy hobby just after her th birthday last year and said sheaposs never felt sexier. The -year-old felt sheaposd lost her identity after her husband died and children moved away but is now loving performing after losing seven stone in weight - and claims it makes her aposthe coolest gran everapos. The gran-of-two now regularly takes to the stage as her alter-ego Foxy La Mer, complete with corset and nipple tassles - and even reckons burlesque should be on prescription for fellow OAPs. Retired outreach worker Marilyn said: Burlesque encompasses everything I want to do. From the first day I was hooked. I suddenly felt feminine and so glamorous.    Before, Iaposd felt like Iaposd lost all my femininity. Since my husband was ill there was nothing to make me feel glam. Iaposd lost that we role. Sex was out of the window, there was nothing making me feel sexy. It was like I was just existing. I felt very alone. I felt there was something missing. At  years old people have this idea that youaposre old and should just sit at home but thataposs not me.    I wanted something to make me feel like a woman, to feel glamourous and to feel desired. I say itaposs apostease without the sleazeapos. Thereaposs nothing sleazy about what we do. It should be on prescription. At ft in, Marilyn had always been big and was bullied at school by a girl who poured salt on her and called her a aposbig fat slugapos. Turning to drama and acting as a way of escape, she gave up performing when she got married at the age of  and had her children Cymon Hulmes, , and Rachael Knight, .  But her marriage broke down after  years while her confidence had plummeted as her weight crept up to  stone. Marilyn found love again with second husband David Bersey but the pair were devastated when he was diagnosed with Parkinsonaposs Disease shortly after they married in . He died four years ago. Marilyn said: The we role had gone and I had become more of a carer. I felt Iaposd lost my identity - as a we and a mother, my children were all grown up. I was thinking aposwho am I apos My weight was up and down and Iaposd been suffering from high blood pressure for years. I started to steadily lose weight.I lost three stone then another three stone after I retired and joined Slimming World. Another stone fell off after my husband died. I now maintain my weight of st lbs.I was scrolling through Facebook and saw this burlesque group pop up and I thought it sounded interesting.I was very tentative at first. There were a lot of younger ladies and I was the oldest by a long way. They were in their twenties up to their forties.    But I loved it and now go once a week. We learn a routine for four weeks and in the last week we dress up in burlesque and perform it. Theyaposre a fantastic group of girls. Marilyn quickly took on the persona Foxy La Mer and now has two comedy burlesque chair routines that she does at charity events and parties - where she strips down to a sexy corset and nipple tassels which she makes herself. Marilyn, who has a grandson Brandon Hanmore, , and step-grandson Aaron Knight, , said: One is to the ghostbuster tune where, as sexily as I can, I take off a bit of clothing and strip down to my burlesque outfit.  The other routine is the Burlesque Granny. Iaposm an old lady with a walking frame and do part of the routine as a grandma then the music changes and I take off my wig and glasses and strip down to my stockings and corset for the burlesque routine using the walking frame. Then I rip my bra off and reveal the nipple tassels. I love performing because Iaposm not being somebody  - Foxy La Mer is an extension of me rather than a character. Itaposs not important how old I am. I prefer itthey donapost say my age when they introduce me on stage. I want them to clap me because Iaposm doing well and they like it.  Itaposs also toned me up. When I first started I couldnapost get my leg over the chair but itaposs built up my stamina and strength and I can do everything that the others can do now. My daughter will come and watch me. She thinks itaposs fantastic and my son is really proud. My grandson thinks Iaposm the coolest gran ever. Although not looking for a relationship Marilyn said burlesque has given her the confidence to flirt and look men in the eye. She added: Itaposs made me feel sexy again. Iaposm quite happy doing what Iaposm doing andit met someone Iaposd feel confident enough to go for it. I would say to anyone just to try it. Weaposre all living longer and should be out there doing things not staying at home feeling miserable.

The aposManchester SRE Educationapos group, which has  members, is being used to fume about the new curriculum, which could see children being taught about LGBT rights from the age of four. Derogatory and homophobic messages are being exchanged, including criticism of gay teachers.It comes after a nationwide row, following a government overhaul of sex and relationships lessons which says that going forward, children must be taught about LGBT issues, reports Manchester Evening News.   Headlines about the aposNo Outsiderapos programme rolled out at schools in Birmingham, sparked anger and concern for some Manchester parents who are anxious about what the government guidance will mean for their kids. An academy trust in Birmingham has suspended the lessons after scores of parents staged protests claiming they apospromoted homosexual behaviourapos. Now a WhatsApp group has been formed by parents in Manchester, who say they will continue to aposapply pressureapos to prevent their children being taught about LGBT rights. Some of the messages, seen by the Manchester Evening News, are derogatory and homophobic in nature. One parent wrote: Plus couple teachers are gay in the school as it is and they frequently talk to kids... whataposs the need  Indirect manipulation.    Teachers are getting away with pep classroom talk. This needs to be addressed but said that, focus should be on lessons NOT the teacheraposs bloody personal gay lives. These are implored tactics. Another said: There [sic] personal agendas and ideas pushed on children regardless of their faith. ITaposS WRONG. Schools including Claremont primary in Rusholme and Plymouth Grove in Longsight, William Hulme in Whalley Range and MEA Central in Levenshulme, have been contacted by parents. One parent posted on the group: My sonaposs teacher is gay. And has been talking about his views to  year olds. He has made his views clear even on social media. Another wrote: I spoke to my child how did schola [sic] go he was not happy he told me that there [sic] teacher have been talking about gays and lesbians in year five.    Government guidance issued in February, states that aposat the point where schools consider it appropriate,apos they can teach pupils about LGBT equality and rights. They should ensure that this content is fully integrated into their programmes of study for this area of the curriculum, rather than delivered as a standalone unit or lesson, it says. The guidance also states that inidual schools are required to make a statement of policy on their provision of relationships education and sex and relationship education, and set out the circumstances in which a pupil can be excused. Councillor Luthfur Rahman, executive member for schools, culture and leisure, Manchester City Council, said: Weaposre aware of the existence of WhatsApp groups and the misinformation that is being circulated through them.    We would encourage any parent who has concerns about the curriculum to talk to their school first of all and to hear directly from them whataposs involved. The vast majority of Manchester schools have been successfully teaching relationship education for some time and continue to do so. Manchester is a erse and welcoming city that embraces many dferent faiths and cultures. We want all our children and young people to grow up understanding and respecting dferences between people and to recognise their own role in responding positively to that ersity.

Wherever the chosen destination, the former actress is said to want to make a hasty retreat home within hours, the source added. Meghan and husband Harry will be living with the new tot at their renovated home, Frogmore Cottage , in Windsor.

It also said the unit responsible for dealing with threats to the Royal Family and politicians - the Fixated Threat Assessment Center- does not hold any such list of aposfixatedapos persons.  Ms Markle, who uses a wheelchair, says that she was relieved over the findings and was pretty sure that Meghan knew she was not fixated on her. She told DailyMailTV: Any suggestion that I am fixated on my sister is crazy.

It was a horrible thing to do. It was a horrible PR strategy - people have to be responsible and accountable, she said. A feud between the pair - who have not spoken since  - escalated last year when Samantha branded her sister a social climber and a Duch-a** on social media.But earlier this month it was reported that Meghan could invite her dad and step-sister to the UK after the birth of her child in a bid to bring the family back together.An unnamed pal claims the Duchess of Sussex plans to extend an olive branch to her family after a very public feud which has kept them in the limelight.    Meghan, , is said to be desperate to bury the hatchet, having been left aposbaffledapos by the constant attacks on her. A source told the Daily Mail: She plans to extend an olive branch to the family and invite them to visit after the baby is born – her sister [Samantha Markle] included.

To put it into context, this person existed at least a century before Tutankhamun was buried,” said Mr Miket, who worked on the discovery with the Northumberland County Council archaeology team. “It was a great discovery, these cists are essentially time capsules.  The body was placed into a crouching position to fit them in, almost a sleeping position. They put a lovely little flint kne in the grave with this person for their use in the after-le.” It is understood the woman would have been much loved because a lot of effort was put into creating her final resting place. Charlotte Lowery, manager of Tankerville Arms Hotel, said the find was a “huge shock”. Itaposs absolutely amazing. Especially to know itaposs been there all that time.

Before eczema took over Laurie Williamsapos le, she could treat minor flare-ups with E cream and summer sunshine, but it got increasingly worse spreading to around  per cent of her body, including her face. The events planner from Birmingham ended up being prescribed steroid cream to use twice a day, and was later given antihistamines as she was losing sleep due to her scratching.  Iaposve had eczema since I was little, but itaposs always been manageable with flare ups mostly in winter, said Laurie. The furthest back I can remember is when I was about eight years old and I just had it in the creases of my arms and legs.    I now have small scars all over my body from where Iaposve scratched, and the cut has been so deep and was scratched so many times in the same spot that Iaposve scarred my skin. After not seeing much improvement by the end of last summer, the -year-old started researching topical steroid withdrawalafter spotting people on Instagram warning others of the dangers of what she was applying. In January  Laurie stopped using all steroids and creams in favour of treating her skin naturally. The withdrawal caused Laurieaposs skin to become broken and flaky, leading her to cancel social engagements out of fear of people seeing her skin. Iaposve stripped everything back to basics and Iaposve been vegan since the new year, I have oat baths every two days and no longer slather my body with moisturiser, she continued.    I am also taking daily vitamins, D, zinc, selenium and acidophilus and drinking lots of juice. I actively avoid taking any paracetamol, which seems drastic, but Iaposd rather find the underlying cause of my problems and treat it myself rather than masking the symptoms. My sleep was disrupted every night without doubt as Iaposd wake up and scratch for about  minutes, five times a night. I have never been a sweater, but I am sweating like mad through the night because of TSW. When I first came off steroids, I couldnapost get warm. Iaposd sit at work with a cup of tea, my coat on all day and a heater by me and Iaposd still be cold and shivering. My skin was so broken, so it wasnapost retaining heat. Iaposd also feel weak and my legs would shake.    People double take when they see me now, but thataposs only natural, and some ask me whataposs happened to my face and skin. I was a lot more self-conscious at the beginning than I am now, partly because my face is better and partly because Iaposm so used to looking the way I do. I want to raise awareness for TSW and urge anyone who thinks they may be experiencing it to look into it. Thereaposs a huge support network for everyone going through it. Itaposs been great to hear people say they used to look like me because it means thereaposs hope I can one day have skin like them. Iaposve learned that time is the biggest healer.

He then began to apply lotion, massaging a breast, pinching a nipple and asking “Does that feel good ” He then allegedly tried to slip his hand inside her pants but was unable to. The woman told police the priest’s actions left her in shock, uncomfortable, confused and feeling like a “nasty, dirty piece of meat.” Police in Texas have charged the priest with a string of sex offences, and assault by contact.  It is claimed the assault happened on October  last year. The police say the -year-old priest went to see the woman in hospice care for complications from diabetes. An arrest affidavit says Langsch went to her home to administer the sacrament of anointing the sick, a sacrament of absolution, also known as the last rites. It is usually done when someone is suspected of being on their deathbed. The Catholic Diocese of Austin said Langsch had been pastor of St Paul Catholic Church in Austin. That was until last month when the diocese “received an unrelated report that he had failed to maintain proper boundaries with an adult”, but this did not involve any physical contact. The diocese has removed Langsch from his post and deemed him no longer able to serve in the area. The diocese is helping the police with the investigation and there is even an appeal for anyone  who knows anything about the priest’s actions in this case or any other potential cases to get in touch with officers.

More than  others were injured when the blast sent a huge fireball into the air and shattered windows several miles away. There were apocalyptic scenes on Friday as crews went through burned-out buildings and charred rubble looking for more victims. Smoke continued to pour from the industrial site, in Chinaaposs eastern city of Yancheng,  hours after the explosion at the pesticide plant.    Residents were repairing homes and businesses that were damaged by the blast, which blew out windows in nearby towns and shook homes at least  miles away. Chinese state media said  people were killed and  others, including children from a nearby kindergarten, were injured. Distressing footage taken in the aftermath showed bodies on the floor around the blast site. Video also showed bloodied children who were cut when they were sprayed by shards of glass from broken windows.  Thirty-two people were still fighting for their lives after the survivors of Thursdayaposs explosion were rushed to  hospitals in Jiangsu province. The blast sent a massive fireball and toxic mushroom cloud into the air above the plant owned by the Tianjiayi Chemical Company. Chinese media said the blast was suspected to have triggered a . magnitude earthquake.  A man who lives in Wangshang, about a mile away from the industrial site, told Reuters: There was one loud bang followed by a long rumble. All the windows were smashed. I went to have a look. Near the site there was blood everywhere. People were crushed. A witness told Chinese media: At the time of the explosion, it was almost like an earthquake.  It was very loud. A man who lives  miles from the blast site told a reporter that the explosion shook his windows. The man said: It was thought to be caused by wind. A woman who lives about a mile from the explosion told the South China Morning Post that all her windows were shattered by the blast.  She said the local hospital was packed with injured people. Another resident about  miles from the factory said she heard a loud boom and felt the explosion at her home. Many buildings in the village had broken windows and structural damage. Dozens of the plantaposs workers live in Wangshang, and many did not come home after the explosion.  The village was built in  for people displaced by construction of the industrial park. In the aftermath of the blast, the village was not evacuated and residents had not been advised to wear masks like the ones worn by police who were blocking roads to the site. A massive cloud of black smoke drted through the area as the inferno spread to neighbouring factories. Jiangsuaposs environmental protection bureau said it found no abnormal concentrations of chemicals such as toluene, xylene or benzene.  Concentrations of acetone and chloroform outside the blast zone were also within normal limits, it said. It took about  hours for fire crews to bring the inferno under control, state media said. About  firefighters were involved in the response after local authorities declared an emergency. The cause of the explosion is under investigation.  State media said President Xi Jinping, who is in Italy for a state visit, ordered all-out efforts to care for the injured and to earnestly maintain social stability. Thursdayaposs explosion is the latest in a series of industrial accidents that has caused outrage in China. The president said authorities must increase efforts to determine the cause and prevent similar incidents. He added: There has recently been a series of major accidents, and all places and relevant departments must fully learn the lessons from these.  Jiangsu authorities vowed to carry out inspections on chemical producers and warehouses, and shut down any that are not in compliance with regulations on dangerous chemicals. Tianjiayi Chemical Company, which produces more than  organic chemical compounds, some highly flammable, has been cited and fined for work safety violations in the past, the China Daily reported. Public anger over safety standards has grown in China over industrial accidents that have marred three decades of swt economic growth.  The accidents have ranged from mining disasters to factory fires, In ,  people were killed in explosions at a chemical warehouse in the northern city of Tianjin, one of the worldaposs busiest ports, which is not far from the capital, Beijing. Those blasts were big enough to be seen by satellites and register on earthquake sensors. Despite repeated government pledges to tighten safety, disasters have hit chemical plants in particular. Twenty-three people were killed in November in a series of blasts during the delivery of a flammable gas at a chemical maker.  "},{"url":null,"title":"christchurch newspapers beautiful front page","story":"NewsChristchurch newspapers beautul front page tribute has moved people to tearsOne week after the horric terrorist attack, The Press has paid a fitting and moving tribute to the  victimsShareCommentsByZahra MulroySocial Audience Editor:,  MAR Updated:,  MAR NewsHagley Park in Christchurch where flowers and tributes have been left in honour of the dead \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailSeven days have elapsed since the devastating terrorist attacks on two Christchurch mosques which saw  people lose their lives.In the aftermath, New Zealandaposs response to the atrocities has won admiration on the international stage - particularly PM Jacinda Ardernaposs compassion and her decisive banning of semi-automatic weapons .Now, a week later, the newspaper from the city that has been shaken by the attacks has paid its own tribute to the victims.The front page of daily paper  The Press , which is distributed in the region, showed a simple but moving headline: the word Peace in Arabic script above the names of the  people who lost their lives .

The society board have now informed Dens financial director David Gray and their own members of the decision to hang on to all their shares.Given there’s no provision in society rules for the sale of any shares and their rejection of the original attempt to get their veto-holding shares, this latest move comes as no surprise, particularly as even an improved offer of £, for the ordinary shares was viewed as derisory by many members.Dundee are now likely to undertake a full share issue that would allow Keyes to break through the % barrier but is likely to entail administrative costs running into five figures."},{"url":null,"title":"dundee united confirm departure of laurie ellis","story":"Dundee United have confirmed former assistant boss Laurie Ellis’ departure from Tannadice.As the Tele revealed at the time, the former Raith Rovers stalwart was put on gardening leave back in January.United made no comment at the time but, in a statement today, announced the -year-old is no longer their employee.“As we continue to review all areas of the club and put in place our plans for the long-term vision we have for Dundee United, Laurie leaves with our thanks for his effort and commitment during his near-three seasons at Tannadice and our best wishes for his future coaching career,” said sporting director Tony Asghar.Ellis arrived at Tannadice as No  when Ray McKinnon was appointed manager in .He continued in that role under Csaba Laszo and for the first three-and-a-bit months of Robbie Neilson’s reign.“I am proud and honoured to have played a role at Dundee United,” he said today.“This is a fantastic club that has the potential to be in the Premiership and, while I wish that could have been achieved in my time here, I wish everyone at United all the best in their pursuit of promotion.“I now look forward to the next stage in my career.”Earlier this month reserve team manager Craig Easton and U  coach Scott Robertson were also stood down from their duties.To date, United have not commented on their situations."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/03/18763375-821x564.jpg ","title":"dundee united hope to have pawlett and connolly fit to take on alloa","story":"Dundee United boss Robbie Neilson is hopeful quick decisions to get injury doubts off in midweek will see two key men available for the clash with Alloa this afternoon.Peter Pawlett and Mark Connolly were both subbed early in the second half of Tuesday’s win over Ross County because of muscle tightness and Robbie revealed that was done with an eye on this weekend and beyond.“If you push them too hard you end up with tears and they could be out for the season. That’s why we took Pawlett and Connolly off as soon as possible,” he said.“They’ve both been feeling tight but it’s nothing serious and we think they’ve a chance of making Alloa.”Longer-term injury Freddy Frans is back from a trip home in Belgium for treatment on his groin tear.

They’ve managed just one win in four games.And as well as a dip in performance over that period, United have struggled to find the back of the net from open play.In the last five games, only Cammy Smith’s close-range opener in the draw at Falkirk was not from a set-piece and the four other efforts to hit the mark have all been from the boot of Nicky Clark, either from the penalty spot or free-kicks.The effort to improve on that will not be helped by the absence of main striker Pavol Safranko tonight and again when Alloa visit on Saturday, because he is now away on international duty with Slovakia.The other experienced No  in the squad, Osman Sow, would not have been fit for the weekend after aggravating a troublesome calf problem early on in the last outing down at Partick Thistle.Sow was being checked in training yesterday but the chances are he will not make tonight and will even be a major doubt for this weekend.That being the case, Robbie has a big call to make when it comes to how he sets up his attack for the next couple of outings.He does at least have Peter Pawlett back available after the one-game suspension he picked up for his red card in the league win over Inverness. Theof the former Aberdeen man could see Clark pushed right up top and him used in a supporting role.Another option would be to use Matty Smith as the main striker but given the young attacker has not started since the Tannadice win over Dunfermline back on January , that would be a big ask.Whatever way he decides to go, tonight and in the coming games, the boss will be looking for both more chances to be created and a much better conversation rate.That will be a challenge against a County team that have hit league-winning form since mid-January.Their only defeat in  games in all competitions was when they went down to Inverness on penalties in a Scottish Cup replay."},{"url":null,"title":"mcdonalds-launches-veggie-happy-meals-as-greggs-sells-vegan-sausage-rolls","story":"MCDONALDrsquoS restaurants across Glasgow have launched their first-ever vegetarian Happy Meal for children from today."},{"url":null,"title":"richard-madden-flashback-to-when-rising-actor-spoke-to-the-evening-times","story":"RENFREWSHIRE actor Richard Madden has picked up a Golden Globe for his role in gripping BBC drama Bodyguard."},{"url":null,"title":"hugh-jackman-in-glasgow-how-to-get-tickets-without-using-ticketmaster","story":"AS is usually the norm when big acts announce gigs, music fans have been unable to buy tickets to see Hugh Jackman in Glasgow through Ticketmaster, despite him having announced a staggering three-night run in May."},{"url":null,"title":"taking-your-car-abroad-after-brexit-looks-like-youll-be-needing-a-green-card","story":"THE prospect of a no-deal Brexit, meaning no transition period, will mean insurance lsquogreen cardsrsquo will be required for UK drivers venturing across the Channel or into the Republic of Ireland from March , ."},{"url":null,"title":"princes-street-evacuation-suspicious-package-found-day-after-glasgow-university-on-lockdown","story":"BREAKING:Glasgow Universityrsquos Dumfries campus evacuated after lsquosuspicious packagersquo found.

This area of Argyll is the most fragile in the region. The people of Argyll, businesses and visitors deserve no less.Forget the squandering of £m on unreliable, mitigation measures trying to justy a flawed decision made many years ago to use the Old Military Road as a ersion which has failed on many occasions and now has a landslip between the two roads. Forget the expensive excavation of pits by the A rather use the cuttings into the hillside to form a two lane road protected with a flow over canopy with closed outer edges at the four problems gullies. If the contractors on the present scheme can work without any road closures then the flow over canopy option would not lead to closures as many officials and some politicians claim.This is a red herring postponing #a proper solution#. When this is option is completed it will save on the expense of manning the ersion route involving - personnel and - vehicles, replacing expensive nettings, delays whilst the farmer clears his animals and collect his fees. A scandalous waste of public money. Solve The Rest Landslides and stop wasting on mitigating measures.Like Brendan O#Hara I#m neither an engineer or geologist but both of us are blessed with plain common sense. If the Faroese can build a tunnel at £.m per kilometre surely a simple open sided m canopy would cost considerably less. In  at Dawlish .km of double tracked railway and .km of sturdy seawall was built at a cost of £m in eight weeks.

Transport Minister Michael Matheson, Transport Scotland and our Government must abandon their obsession with mitigation measures and fund a permanent solution. We demand no less.Sir,Calls for assurances that the Rest and Be Thankful section of the A will be improved to resist future landslides were made during a session of Transport, Infrastructure and Connectivity questions in the Scottish Parliament.I quizzed transport secretary Michael Matheson, about what was discussed at the last meeting of the A Taskforce in November , and asked what assurances the Cabinet Secretary could give to local residents and businesses who rely on the A being open at all times.The Rest and Be Thankful was closed off for nine days in October  following the largest landslide in a decade, forcing road users to either take a major ersion, or to use the Old Military Road during certain hours of the day.A number of petitions were created during the period of the incident, including one by myself, calling for a permanent solution to the Rest and Be Thankful.The transport secretary said that the meeting was #full and frank#, and that there would be a #review of the potential for additional landslide mitigation measures at the Rest and Be Thankful#, and that this would be discussed at the next A Taskforce meeting in March .There was also a commitment that Argyll and Bute would be #prioritised# in the next Strategic Transport Projects Review.I welcome the assurances by the transport secretary that there will be a review of any additional measures for the Rest and Be Thankful, and that Argyll and Bute will receive priority at the next Strategic Transport Projects Review.Donald Cameron, MSPReserve forcesSir,Last issue#sletter raising concerns about the UK government’s proposed use of the army’s reserve force in the event of a no-deal Brexit is timely.In case anyone out there still thinks a no-deal Brexit is a good idea it’s worth noting that the legal authorityof Reserve Forces Act  allowing the Secretary of State to take this step requires him to establish that it is necessary #for the alleviation of distress or the preservation of le or property in time of disaster or apprehended disaster#.Enough said.Frances Roberts, Ardrishaig"},{"url":null,"title":"honours even for red star in argyll derby","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe Ropework played host to this keenly contested local derby which was watched by a healthy crowd on Saturday February .And for the second time this season, Red Star and Campbeltown Pupils shared the points in a match both sides will feel they could have won.Both sides were struggling for fluency in the opening stages but Red Star settled first and grabbed the opening goal after  minutes. A long ball to the right hand side was met by Ryan Caskie who cut the ball back to Stuart McLean. The youngster took a touch before slotting past the Pupils# goalkeeper to give Star a - lead.Star continued to press and doubled their lead when Coll McCallum robbed the Pupils# defender on the edge of the box before cutting the ball across goal.

The game continued at a frantic pace, however, there was no further scoring in the first half and Star went in with a - advantage.Pupils came out with purpose in the second half as they looked to force themselves back into the game, however, it was a howler from Red Star which allowed them back into the match.A square ball across the back resulted in a mix-up between Star keeper Luke Kalache and defender Ben Forbes which allowed Donald McCallum to prod the ball home from just inside the box and Pupils were back in the game at - with eight second half minutes gone.The home side didn’t recover from this and you could sense a nervousness that gave the visitors plenty encouragement. The equaliser arrived with  minutes remaining when good play from Pupils down the right by Soudan saw him get a low cross in which was met by the on-rushing run of Ryan Deans and he finished well to level the score at -.This set up a frantic finish and both sides could have nicked it towards the end. Pupils went close with a headed effort which was clawed to safety while at the other end there was a goalmouth scramble which Star couldn’t convert and both sides had to settle for a draw in the end as referee Jimmy Litster blew for full time.Red Star were dealt a blow as it emerged that captain Aaron Moore suffered a dislocated shoulder.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a £, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":null,"title":"eyesore burns house knocked down","story":"South Ayrshire Councils Burns House, Burns Statue Square.\"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailEyesore Burns House is set to be torn down this upcoming year.

The cost to flatten the office block is estimated to be £. million. Council leader, the SNP’s Douglas Campbell said: “We will relocate staff from Burns House into properties already owned by the council in Ayr and other town centres to continue to support the local day time economy.” Speaking during his budget speech, he added:”This will result in the demolishing of Burns House commencing during this financial year.” Meanwhile across the road the crumbling Station Hotel remains covered over as question marks hang over its future.

Police objected to McLelland getting a personal licence at the council’s licensing board meeting heard last week, McLelland, , of Main Street, Auchinleck carried out the crime in November . Police Sergeant David Dougan told councillors McLelland was sentenced to a community payback order at Ayr Sherf Court last year as punishment. But McLelland said she was plagued by anti-social behaviour outside at her home in Main Street. She told the board: “I love kids. I regret it.” She claims she has had problems with people “chapping her door” and urinating in her garden. She rushed out to the nearby bus shelter during one incident, she told the meeting.. McLelland said: “I went out. It wasn’t even raw bleach. It is not an excuse. I shouldn’t have done it.” She claimed the bottle was kicked out of her hand and spilled over the victim. But the meeting heard McLelland pled guilty in court. The shop worker said: “I am not in the habit of going out and fighting with kids. “I am a -year-old woman.” She added: “Everybody in this le makes mistakes. Nobody in this world is perfect.” She told the meeting she had phoned the police numerous times to report anti-social behaviour at her property. Councillors adjourned the meeting to discuss whether she should be handed a licence. Ontheir opinion was split with three councillors voting to grant her application and the same number against. Board Chair Councillor Tom Cook had the ruling say and decided to grant McLelland’s licence. He said giving her the licence would not increase her chances of committing a similar offence in the future. Councillors George Mair, John Campbell and Fiona Campbell voted to refuse the licence. Councilors Drew Filson, Lillian Jones supported Councillor Cook’s view to grant it.

The consultation and engagement exercise – approved by Councillors last year – gives tenants the chance to choose their preferred option for the long-term future of the flats: Refurbish  – this means the Council would keep the flats, decant tenants, carry out identied refurbishment works, and thentenants to their refurbished flats. Rehouse  – this means tenants would be rehoused permanently in suitable alternative accommodation and the flats would be demolished. Rebuild  – this means tenants would be decanted to temporary accommodation and the flats would be demolished before some tenantsto a new-build housing development on the Riverside Place site. The detailed consultation, which is based around inidual one-to-one meetings with more than  tenants, has been planned in conjunction with the River Ayr Tenants Association, which represents tenants in the three blocks. The Council has communicated regularly with tenants in the lead-up to the consultation to ensure they have all the information they need to take part. A further letter has now been distributed to homes in Riverside Place following queries and concerns raised by tenants regarding a letter sent to them by Fort, Seafield  Wallacetown Community Council. The community council’s letter appears to query the three consultation options being discussed with tenants and questions South Ayrshire Council’s interpretation of the expert report approved last year regarding the “essential and advisable” works required to the flats. Councillor Philip Saxton, South Ayrshire Council’s Portfolio Holder for Housing and Community Wellbeing, said: “We are committed to ensuring that our tenants are fully involved in the discussions about the future of their flats, which is why we’re taking such a detailed approach to this consultation. “It’s vital that tenants understand all the facts so they can form their own views about the option that is best for them. That is why we have gone back out to them to respond to the queries and confusion that have been generated by the community council’s letter. “We fully appreciate that the community council may have a view on the consultation, which is why colleagues are meeting with them next week and we’re happy to keep them informed about the consultation and engagement process. “However, our focus – which was clearly expressed by tenants at the recent River Ayr Tenants Association meeting – has to be on hearing the views of those who will be directly affected by Councillors’ decisions later this year: the tenants of Riverside Place. “We thank them for their participation in the consultation and I can reassure them that their views will be taken into account before any decisions are taken about the future of Riverside Place.” Joe Lafferty, Chair of the River Ayr Tenants Association, said: “We have worked closely with the Council over the last couple of years as discussions around the future of the flats have moved forward – and we very much appreciate the approach the Council has taken. “It is for every tenant to consider what is the best option for them and to ensure their voice is heard by those who will be making the decisions about what happens next. Clear facts, easy to understand information and answers to the questions tenants have is what’s needed and that’s exactly what we have got from the Council.”   Feedback from the consultation will be considered by Councillors in June this year.Full details of the Riverside Place consultation are available at  www.south-ayrshire.gov.uk riverside-place .

The Post can exclusively reveal that the developers McCarthy  Stone have thrown in the towel and withdrawn their multi-million pound proposals. Major question marks hang over the building’s future following the bombshell announcement. The news prompted an angry backlash from Derek Hart, chair of Prestwick North Community Council. In an extraordinary outburst he claimed the building has been “plundered and left to rot.” The building provided a retreat for children battling cancer for more than  years. It was opened by Princess Diana in . In  it was sold by owners Clic Sargent after claims of a “challenging fundraising environment”. They sold it to McCarthy  Stone and trousered £.m from the deal. However, since McCarthy  Stone took ownership and unveiled their luxury flat plans they have been embroiled in a bitter fight with neighbours Prestwick Golf Club. The club was opposed to the development on the basis of its scale and design. Other objections included the potential impact it would have had on their historic course and the surrounding conservation area. In addition, there were fears that errant balls could smash into residents’ properties. Plans involved building  flats for people aged over , spread out in a T-shape over four floors. Many would have had sea views and balconies. The proposals were approved by South Ayrshire Council but last year Prestwick Golf Club successfully petitioned for a judicial review, meaning demolition work on the former retreat had to stop. It was estimated that  jobs would be created between the construction phase and posts at the new development. Despite a PR charm offensive from McCarthy  Stone throughout the process and a public exhibition of plans at the  Club in Prestwick’s Main Street, the developers pulled the plug on the project. A spokesperson said: “Following a strategic review last year we are no longer pursuing any new developments within Scotland and have withdrawn our plans for Prestwick.” Derek Hart reckons the decision is a kick in the teeth for all the campaigners who fought to retain the presence of a sick children’s home in Prestwick.

A statement by the club said: “While we welcome this news we hope that, should a new development proposal for the site be put forward in the future, the design and scale will be more sympathetic to the surrounding area.” The statement said the club was not against the principle of redeveloping the site but was “disappointed” at the scale and design of the proposed development.

Super-fit Fiona McBlane was , practised yoga and cycled and was in London lapping up a glamorous working le in the music industry for companies such as EMI and Smash Hits. But during a Christmas visit home to Ayrshire she fell unwell with leg, arm and head pain. Such was her distress she admitted herself to hospital. First the minor stroke hit - on January ,  - and then the searing biggie nine days later. It left her semi-paralysed in hospital for  months, unable to speak, hardly walking and retaining very limited brain capacity. That was when Clan McBlane rallied round to give her the best future they could. They had been advised the best place for her was an old folks home but they stood firm. Once Fiona was fit enough to leave hospital she was brought into the bosom of the family in Prestwick. Twelve years on at the age of , Fiona is battling away and has got to the stage where she has joined the gym at Prestwick Tennis Club. Her loving older sisters Gillian McBlane, , and -year-old Gaenor Hardy have just pounded round the Stroke Association’s Resolution Run with Gillian’s -year-old son Graham to continue raising money for the charity. That added £ to a total now of about £. Gillian, a top civil lawyer in Ayr, and Gaenor, headmistress at Heathfield Primary, assist their parents Jean and Ian who are Fiona’s full-time carers. And Gillian is helped by the other legal eagle in the family, Ayr criminal defence agent Steven Maxwell. Gillian said: “She loved her work and was a real high flier. “People were drawn to Fiona’s fun-loving nature and her great big heart. “Never for a minute did we think she would have a stroke. “At  years old she had lost everything she loved.” Fiona is prone to falling and choking, often passing out. Sometimes the enormity of what has happened becomes too much for her and she struggles emotionally. But Gillian said: “Our parents taught us to look for the positive things in le and not to feel sorry for ourselves. We spend time together and Fiona enjoys the company. “Despite the extent of her disability, she does brilliantly. “Doctors told us that her friends would eventually tail off but Fiona’s haven’t . They keep in contact with her and visit when they can. “People have shown us great kindness over the years in so many ways and this means a lot, helping us immensely. We don’t know what the future will hold for Fiona but we do know that whatever it is we will face it together.” There are , strokes in Scotland every year. Angela Macleod at the Stroke Association said: “Our latest research shows that by training and taking part in a Resolution Run you are helping to lower your stroke risk. “The funds raised by each runner means we can reach out to more stroke survivors and their families to offer the support that they may need to rebuild their lives.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnstrokeAyrAyr NewsPrestwickRunningCharity"},{"url":null,"title":"upper crust roost alloway","story":"NewsAn Upper Crust roost in AllowayAyrshire Post Property of the WeekShareByStephen Houston:,  MAR Updated:,  MAR News\"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThere are few better places to bring up a family than the secluded suburban streets of Alloway.

Craig Galbraith worked well playing with, eventual man of the match, Calum Johnson for the first time.In the th minute there was a skirmish in the box after a corner, Johnson cleared the ball but it ricocheted off the incoming player into the net.The Glasgow students had more possession with the wind advantage. With  minutes left, a tremendous fingertip save, by Neil McMillan, pushed the ball over the bar.With four minutes left the away side put the game beyond #Dale#s reach when Matthew Lamont tried to clear a corner shot but unforunately scored an own goal.In high winds and driving rain the game fizzled out.Both sides had played well in the conditions and kept the ball on the deck in addition, referee, Archie Mitchell said it was an easy game to ref with no bad tackles.The match ball was sponsored by Wee Toon Sports and a Carradale spokesperson thanked Food for Thought for the post match hospitality.Tomorrow Carradale travels to Helensburgh for an early kick off at noon."},{"url":null,"title":"machrihanish bay is britains second best beach","story":"The bay, which is the beginning of the longest continuous stretch of sand in Argyll, extending all the way to Westport, was second only to Sandown Bay on the Isle of White in the BBC Countryfile Magazine Awards .After a long and detailed judging process to determine the shortlist for each category, the magazine#s readers and website visitors were given a month to vote for their favourites, with winners announced last week.The magazine#s editor, Fergus Collins, said: #Congratulations to each of the winners – and all the people and places who were shortlisted.#The aim of our awards is to celebrate the best of the British countryside and shine a light on lesser known places, projects and people who are doing great work.#Westport beach looking towards Machrihanish Bay. _cwestport"},{"url":null,"title":"down memory lane march 15 2019","story":"Peter Docherty, born and brought up in the Wee Toon, lives in a first floor flat, in Tangy Place tenement, at the end of the High Street, with a #marvellous# view of all the comings and goings on Campbeltown Loch.Back in , aged , he was an apprentice painter and decorator for a town firm, which he thinks might have been Galbraith and Cochrane.Mr Docherty#s son, also Peter, , talked to the Courier on Monday and said: #Dad told me that the young apprentices were always given the awkward, high up places to paint.#Back then this wall must have been under a ceiling as now the graffiti chipped into the plaster is at waist height.#Painters always used to leave their mark on a building, many will be painted over in people#s houses.#They often wonderedtheir #marks# would be uncovered in the future.#On this wall they could see the names of people who had painted it in the past.#When he saw Down Memory Lane last week dad said he was the only P Docherty in the town at the time.#Peter junior, who visits two to three times a year, said: #I was born in Craigard.

which the papers were presented this year which made alternative motions possible.However what did this year yield The main dferences in the budget came down to the administration of the council proposing £, more for winter gritting, outwith the A which is covered by the contract with BEAR.This was against cuts in the road safety unit, an award-winning safety programme for young children, a cut in youth and adult learning, a cut in environmental warden services, which means a focus on more fines but less time for fly tipping and dog fouling and a cut to music tuition in schools.There were amendments lodged by Councillor Donald Kelly and myself, the SNP group and councillors George Freeman and Jean Moffat.While gritting our roads is important Councillor Kelly and I, along with other council opposition groups, thought the other considerations were important to our communities which strangely enough is also supported by our corporate plan.Alas the gritting won the day.Full motions and votes can be found on the council website.However it was more disappointing that Councillor Kelly and I included in our motion a scheme to change funding due for Helensburgh and Dunoon.Just more than £ million would be moved to the regeneration project of Tarbert Lochgilphead Ardrishaig.This was defeated by the rest of the council which was particularly galling.Money for Helensburgh had been questioned by its community council which felt that too much had already been spent.The money for Dunoon was because of poor procurement processes and a general #I want syndrome#

Lauder, it is said, was the first place he stopped after fleeing from the Battle of Prestonpans.ldquoI suppose we kind of followed in his footsteps, said my friend, ldquoalthough in a very dferent way and totally dferent circumstances of course. Folk round here donrsquot really know the story, but coming from the Pans it gave us an immediate connection.The actual house on Lauder High Street that Johnnie Cope arrived at is now gone, replaced over  years ago. But Lauder must look much as it did on that fateful day when Cope arrived, with his horse close to collapse with exhaustion.Johnnie Cope was the general commanding the British Army at Prestonpans on that fateful day, September , . The battle was a major victory for the Jacobites. Cope fled the scene of battle, but only when it was clearly lost. He eventually arrived at Berwick-upon-Tweed to give news of his own defeat. Ever since, popular tradition has mocked Cope for running away and not standing his ground and dying lsquohonourablyrsquo, as Colonel Gardiner of Bankton House did.This ridicule was encapsulated in a traditional popular song, and the chorus remains well-known:Hey, Johnnie Cope, are ye wauking yet Or are your drums a-beating yet If ye were wauking I wad waitTae gang to the coals irsquo the morning.The song pokes fun at Cope and concludes with a harsh indictment:Now Johnnie, troth, ye were na blateTae come wirsquo news orsquo your ain defeat,And leave your men in sic a straitSae early in the morning.There are earlier versions with slightly dferent words, but the sentiment remains the same: Johnnie Cope ran away and should be ashamed of himself for leaving his men. However, he was later found to have done his duty, and this reputation deemed unfair. But mud sticks, especially when a catchy tune is added to it.This popular song is believed to have been written by Adam Skirving, a farmer at Garleton in East Lothian. There is a story that he visited the battle site a few hours after the fighting. Perhaps he spoke to some eyewitnesses who saw Cope flee up the road to Birsley Brae, and therefore got the idea for the song. The road Cope took as he fled from the battle has ever after been called Johnnie Copersquos Road.Lauder is a short journey from Prestonpansgoing by car. It had been a while since I had last ventured over Soutra Hill and into the border country and I enjoyed the drive despite the wild weather, or perhaps partly because of it.But what was Copersquos journey like as he galloped over Soutra Hill with some of his dragoons  He must have paused at the summit and cast a glance at the view over East Lothian and screwed his eyes to find Prestonpans. The panic and terror by this time would have given way to dferent feelings, I suspect.He rode more or less the same way I took to Lauder but it would have taken him much longer with very dferent emotions. His arrival in the town would have been a bewildering spectacle for the locals. He later continued his flight to Coldstream, which he reached by nightfall.All this was in my head as we headed home to Prestonpans from Lauder the next day. I could almost see the ghosts of Cope and his dragoons gallop past us as we ventured over Soutra.As we drove, I re-told the story to my kids and we sang the song in the car. They know the story and the chorus well, as we have many times ventured along Johnnie Cope Road on the way to the rail station.By the road is Bankton House, once the home of Colonel Gardiner, who did not run but stood his ground, and paid the ultimate price with brutal death.There is a small doorsquocot by the house, and inside you will find a free but almost secret visitor centre created with the support of the Battle of Prestonpans Heritage Trust.The doorsquocot can only be reached via a walkway through the wood from the rail station during the day, and inside lsquoAuld Archiersquo tells the tale of the battle, and the le and death of Colonel Gardiner. On the wall is a model map of how the area looked at the time of the battle, with the route taken by Johnnie Cope clearly marked.Itrsquos all fascinating stuff which had been unexpectedly brought to my mind by the visit to Lauder to see old friends.But it was the emotions rather than the events that I reflected on most. The hatred caused by this civil war , the loss, suffering and misery of conflict which is so often hidden by a cloak of romanticism.Adam Watters, a Panner who lives and breathes local history, and re-enacts it for children and visitors alike, is clear on this. It is a fascinating period to study, and to have the history on our doorstep brings it alive. But as Adam has said, letrsquos enjoy that sense of history on our doorstep and have fun with it, but let us not glory battle, rather learn from it.I think Johnnie Cope, even though he was a military man, may well have agreed with Adam."},{"url":null,"title":"east-lothian-council-cockenzie-revised-plan","story":"Inch Cape Offshore Ltd has been given approval to site the building ndash which will bring energy ashore from an offshore wind farm ndash on land at the former Cockenzie Power Station by Scottish Ministers.A planning application was initially lodged with East Lothian Council but was called in by the Scottish Government before a decision was made.That decision sparked anger after it was announced as First Minister Nicola Sturgeon was on an official visit to China, where she met representatives of Chinese state owned Red Rock, which owns Inch Cape.Now the company has presented a revised plan of the space it intends to use to Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council.The community council posted the new design on social media and revealed plans were under way for Inch Cape to host workshops in the local communities in the coming months.The image shows the substation on about a third of the original .-hectare footprint applied for.One of the biggest concerns raised by communities and the local authority, which owns the land, was that a substation dominating the old power station site would make it a no-go area for other developments.The new plans were welcomed by many on the community councilrsquos Facebook page, with one person saying: ldquoGood news, less sterilisation of the site.Ian Johnson, Inch Capersquos project manager, said: ldquoWe are continuing to engage with East Lothian Council and local community councils on options to signicantly reduce the footprint of the onshore transmission works and moving this to the west of the site.ldquoWhile this detailed design plan is subject to further technical assessments, consultation and approval from the council, we are taking steps to ensure remaining land is available for other developments."},{"url":null,"title":"east-lothian-school-pupils-to-take-part-in-strike-against-climate-change","story":"The NBHS Eco Committee have encouraged students to travel by public transport to attend the rally campaigning for stronger government action to combat climate change.The Edinburgh protest is one of many around the world that are happening tomorrow morning, where school children are walking out of classes to protest climate change.The protest starts at am outside the Scottish Parliament.An East Lothian Council spokesperson said: ldquoWe want to support our young people as global citizens to have their voice and to be able to express their views on important matters such as climate change.\"The safety and wellbeing of our young people is of paramount importance to us.

ldquothat he knew to be  or misleading in April .The court heard how the two charges relate to around the time when he was setting up his constituency office following the  snap general election.He had contacted a photographer in his constituency and purchased nine images from him to decorate and display in his constituency office, using his own money to pay the pound for them initially.There were two budgets available to him, the Start Up Costs Budget ndash for office furniture and IT equipment ndash and the Office Costs Budget, both of which he could claim the full amount from.But Philip Stott, prosecuting, revealed Mr Davies found in February  that only pound. was left in the Start Up Costs Budget, with pound,. remaining in the other.He then proceeded to create two fake invoices, so the pound cost could be split between the two budgets ndash pound to the Start Up and pound for the other.The court heard he could have claimed the full amount from the budget with the larger amount available, or had the photographer create new legitimate invoices to split the cost that way.Davies highlighted in a letter to the Party Investigating Officer sent in February , in which he responded to the allegations against him, that he had been ldquotold in a conversation by a more experienced MP that you could lsquosplitrsquo expenses and therefore attempted to do so.Davies has since repaid the pound, with the pound claim never submitted.Mr Forster told the court Davies accepts his responsibility and expresses his ldquosincere and unreserved apology for what he has done.Mr Forster said of the -year-old: ldquoA disastrous accounting episode, as far as he is concerned.ldquoHe recognises he is the author of his own misfortune, all of this has to be laid at his door and blames no-one  but himself.The court heard Davies had already informed Commons Speaker John Bercow of his intention to plead guilty.Mr Forster said his client, who was seated in the dock wearing a grey suit and pink shirt, is a ldquofamily man with two children who is local to his constituency.ldquoIt took courage to plead guilty and face the music, Mr Forster added.ldquoHe has not shied away from that responsibility and he should be given credit.District Judge Zani said he noted that Davies was a man of good character who has shown ldquoconsiderable remorse.ldquoHowever, in my view, these are two very serious offences to which you have pleaded guilty, he said.ldquoThe documents you created are troublesome in that they carried a deal of information that you put together which absolutely intended to deceive.He said as an MP, a position of considerable responsibility and trust, there is a need to be ldquometiculous in your claims.The judge said he did not consider the sentencing power of Westminster Magistratesrsquo Court to be sufficient and sent the case to crown court.Davies served as a councillor in Powys before he was elected as MP for Brecon and Radnorshire at the  general election, beating incumbent Liberal Democrat Roger Williams with the seatrsquos largest majority since . He served as Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Wales Office from January to July .Before entering politics he worked as a rural auctioneer, an estate agent and also managed a mixed veterinary practice in Hay-on-Wye.A Welsh Liberal Democrat spokesman said Davies should resign.He said: ldquoRepresenting his constituents in these circumstances is untenable.ldquoBrecon and Radnorshire deserves better from its MP.ldquoChris Davies should do the honourable thing and immediately resign.Labour Party chairman Ian Lavery, MP for Northumberland, also called on Davies to quit.He said: ldquoTrust in politics and politicians is essential to our democracy.ldquoChris Davies cannot remain a Tory MP after admitting to this offence.A Conservative Party spokesman said:ldquoAs this is an ongoing legal matter, we will not be commenting."},{"url":null,"title":"in-pictures-flying-scotsman-steams-into-swanage","story":"The world-famous locomotive arrived on Friday, and will run five services a day each way between Swanage and Norden, up until Tuesday."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.comource srcset=/resources/images/9200240.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"call-to-crack-down-on-unqualified-scots-identifying-as-electricians","story":"Tory Jamie Halcro Johnston described the lack of regulation in the profession as an ldquoanomaly and has urged the Scottish Government to take action to ensure the title of electrician is protected in law.Over  professions are currently protected in law, including registered gas engineers, but not electricians.Mr Halcro Johnston said that he will introduce a membersrsquo bill to the Scottish Parliament aiming to address the issue.In a debate on the subject in October, MSPs from across the parties at Holyrood gave their support for providing protection of title.Mr Halcro Johnston said: ldquoFor too long, the Scottish Government has dithered around the regulation of electricians.ldquoIt has been discussed and discussed again, without any real commitments ever seeing the light of day.ldquoWhen I speak to people about this campaign, the first reaction is usually surprise that anyone can call themselves an electrician without any qualication.ldquoWhen so many other trades and professions are regulated, it seems the position of electricians is more of an anomaly than anything .ldquoMost people donrsquot consult electricians on a regular basis and arenrsquot always confident about the qualications of people they employ.

One case Chinese visitor is said to have set aside pound. million for a three-day tour of the Highlands.While that is at the extreme end of the scale, insiders say itrsquos not unusual for ldquoaverage visitors to spend pound, per person for a week, while others can easily spend double that on a single shopping spree at the House of Bruar.One luxury tour operator said: ldquoThe sky is the limit. A lot of whatrsquos going on is very discreet ndash most people donrsquot realise the amount of money flowing through the country.In many cases the millionaire tourist is looking to pay top dollar to share a dram with a whisky expert, play golf on a remote Hebridean course that most Scots have never heard of, or join scallop ers and fishermen off the west coast, rather than rub shoulders with the hoi polloi at the usual tourist haunts.According to a report from Allied Market Research, the global luxury market is projected to be the fastest-growing area of the tourism sector, expected to be worth ,bn by .A key element is said to be demand from high-end travellers to gain deeper experiences of the places they visit, avoiding tourist hotspots in favour of highly-personalised trips.VisitScotland has suggested income from ldquohigh-net-worth iniduals is forecast to rise by around % a year.

That novel was widely lambasted for its so-called profanity, which so shocked one judge, Rabbi Julia Neuberger, she stormed out of the meeting. ldquoOver my dead body was the mildest of her comments.About a year ago, Kelman finished a new novel which, he revealed, has still to find a publisher. After a long period with Secker  Warburg and Hamish Hamilton, he moved to Canongate with his last two books, That Was a Shiver, and Dirt Road, both of which were well received. But this new manuscript languishes, untouched and apparently unloved. Nobody, it seems, even in his own heath, is willing to make a decent offer for it.With some writers, you could understand. Thanks to technology that registers every sale, publisherscan see exactly how bankable their books are. When approached by a writer, they can track their performance at the click of a mouse. If this is healthy, they are far more likely to pounce on them thanthe novelistrsquos sales have not even covered their advance, leaving a publisher effectively in the red.This does not, of course, mean the novelist is no good. Sometimes it indicates the reverse. Literary fiction is a highly raried taste ndash as it always was. Only the most fortunate of such writers make a good living from the proceeds of books alone. For most it is a struggle to get by, hence the number finding shelter teaching on creative writing courses. Kelman himself went down that route for a time, but you can be fairly sure thathis books had sold like airport bestsellers, there would have been no need to find a financial cushion.In what you can only call the good old days, a young writer like Graham Greene would be given considerable leeway with his early books by a publisher confident that one day he would reward their patience. Today, there is no slack in the system, no time to nurture or take the long view. You are only as good as your last book. And in the case of someone like Kelman, whose readership is a mere fraction of those interested in serious fiction, that spells trouble.Why do most of those who leap on every title by Julian Barnes or Rose Tremain often not bother with Kelman  Undoubtedly, the furore over his Booker winner damaged his reputation, not only in the rest of the UK, but also here. Kelman, however, suspects there is a more fundamental and disturbing reason. He believes that English publishers are ldquokeeping a lid on Scottish writers, by dismissing them as a genre. They would rather publish mediocre English novelists, he says, than good Scottish ones.Read more: Kelman: British establishment is keeping a lid on Scottish writingThere are enough excellent Scottish novelists reaching print to argue that point, but for me this is a distraction from the main issue. EvenKelman is right and there is anti-Scottish bias among literary publishers, that still does not explain why no Scottish publisher is willing to take him on.Could his new book be too dficult, or tricky  It would seem strangethat were the case, given his long and distinguished backlist in which there is rarely a misfire. The answer is far more likely to be about money, and the state of the book trade in general. In other words, there is no publisher able or prepared to offer a fee commensurate with what a Kelman book is worth. Thatrsquos worth in artistic terms, you understand, not sales. I do not doubt it would be a better investment to publish Diana Gabaldonfilling the coffers is the main objective.But while the kind of books Kelman writes are unlikely to shower a publisher in gold, they would add immeasurably to its lustre. Here is a novelist who has been shortlisted for the Man Booker International Prize, and is a worthy Nobel contender. Indeed, consider this my official plea to the Nobel Prize Literature Committee to read everything Kelman has written and tell us his oeuvre does not equal or surpass many of their laureates.Yet, nobody on his doorstep wants to take his new book. Itrsquos hard to think of another country where its foremost living writer would be treated like this. The only conclusion you can come to is that the world of books has lost it.

forget.A -hour ldquomarathon of dance and memory is being staged in Findhorn, Moray, between the hours of midday and midnight in the first ever performance of its kind.Wallflower is a production from Manchester-based performance company Quarantine, which sees dancers share their personal recollections of music, fashion, culture, politics and love, from their own le experiences through the form of dance, whether dancing alone in a nightclub, dancing at the Paris Opera Ballet or dancing with a dog across a beach.First staged in Wales four years ago, the production, which features a live DJ, has

Still,you want to offer reassurance that yoursquore well-intentioned and plain-dealing, it doesnrsquot seem sensible to branch out as a bogus psychic, one of the few lines of work that people distrust even more. Yet that was the Prime Ministerrsquos strategy on Wednesday evening, when she revealed herself in a public address as Mystic May, Mindreader.Like the late Doris Stokes communing with the aether and askingthe name Chris rings a bell with anyone in the audience, Mrs May revealed a series of revelations and occult certainties that had presumably been ulged to her by Higher Powers. MPs, she disclosed, are unworthy of your trust. ldquoAll [they] have been willing to say, she explained, ldquois what they do not want. She, by contrast, is ldquoabsolutely sure: You, the public, have had enough. Shersquos also had a ine revelation that what we donrsquot want is a second referendum, or a long delay in leaving.Some of us, blessed with extensive experience reading the newspapers, watching Sir John Curtice on the telly, and talking to people in pubs, have a dim sense that the matter is a little more complicated. Even the election of these MPs, after all, was an exercise in trying to find out what the public wants their inability to agree ndash in many cases, even with people in their own party ndash is a fair indication that the public does not possess a single view of Brexit that just happens to be identical to that of Mrs May, seer and Sybil. If you cast your mind back to the referendum, you may recall that there was a dference of opinion on whether we should leave or remain.Mrs Mayrsquos speech was, in at least one respect, illuminating. It presented in their shining glory all the characteristics that have made her one of the worst Prime Ministers ever. As well as the delusional psychic powers, it illustrated her intransigence, her authoritarian tendencies, her utter contempt for her Parliamentary colleagues, a naked populism that Pierre Poujade would have thought de trop, and total disdain for trivial obstacles such as objective reality or telling the truth.Read more: Alison Rowat: Mother of Parliaments is unfitIt may be true that therersquos precious little popular or parliamentary appetite, and no majority, for the Withdrawal Agreement, no deal, y delay, a second referendum or reversing the vote. But it is a flat lie to say MPs have been willing to say only what they donrsquot want. Theyrsquove been clamouring to say just that, and attempting to get indicative votes that might narrow the options down to what might actually get through the Commons. But theyrsquove been constantly frustrated by Mrs Mayrsquos refusal to acknowledge that anything other than her proposals should be considered.Mrs May said that she was elected to deliver what the people had decided on in the referendum. But she wasnrsquot actually elected , having thrown away the majority she inherited in what must be the most inept campaign ever staged. Only the fact that Jeremy Corbyn is even more useless than she is kept her in the job, with a majorityof precisely zero. But leave that aside.The more puzzling question is why she, a Remain voter, should think she possesses unique insight into what those who voted to leave the EU want. The options, which she refused to let anyone, evenher own Brexit secretaries, discuss or explore, were legion. Many of those who campaigned for Leave wanted, for instance, to remain in the single market ndash pointing to the Efta countries, such as Norway, or to Switzerland, with its comprehensive free trade and movement arrangements. The fact that some may now have hardened their position to argue that that is not ldquoreal Brexit is irrelevant itrsquos still leaving the EU.Instead of giving this any consideration, Mrs May set out a series of ldquored lines plucked from her own imagination, though we are now apparently expected to regard them as something along the lines of the golden tablets and rock spectacles delivered to the prophet Joseph Smith.Unsurprisingly, these did not correspond with the views of most Leave voters, who ndash despite attempts to characterise them as unormly bigoted and xenophobic ndash never once listed immigration as their first priority in any poll conducted before or after the referendum. They did, however, resemble Mrs Mayrsquos track record at the Home Office, when she was responsible for such measures as the ldquoHostile Environment and attempted to deport members of the Windrush generation who were perfectly entitled to live in the UK.Another of her priorities was the European arrest warrant and security co-operation, though she seems not to have considered the security implications for the Irish border, despite it having been the single greatest security issue for the UK for the past half-century.She has given no evidence that she understood the opportunities Brexit afforded for free trade, something which should have been given a high priority,only because of the possibility of a no-deal Brexit. Indeed, on trade issues the only impulse she has demonstrated is a willingness to cave in to rent-seekers amongst the large corporations and special interest groups.But then that is of a piece with Mrs Mayrsquos political philosophy, profoundly illiberal when it comes to regulation, immigration and human rights, and essentially left-wing on economic issues.She is a disastrous failure, not just as a Prime Minister, but as a Conservative leader. Her efforts to keep the party together have left it split more than at any time since the arguments over the repeal of the Corn Laws. Her professed Unionism has threatened both Ireland and Scotlandrsquos future in the UK.The tragedy is that,her deal goes through, it will be worse than all the other possible outcomes, andshe resigns because it fails to go through, the damage will already have been done. She may yet go down in history as an even worse PM than Lord North, who lost America. She could lose not just Europe, but the UK."},{"url":null,"title":"is-o2-down-mobile-network-investigate-uk-service-outages","story":"\"Were aware of an issue,\" the companys coverage status page reads.\"Our technical teams are investigating.

known as consequentials - to universities.She said: \"We are calling on the Scottish Government to confirm that it will pass on consequentials from the Treasury to universities, to avoid the need to cut staff and mitigate the impact on the sector."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/9608105.jpg?type=article-full","title":"three-east-dunbartonshire-libraries-saved-after-new-funding-is-found","story":"The fate of the libraries -

We are now engaging with the treasury on the issue of revenue support for the sector, and any support she can give to that would be very welcome. In the meantime, we have the prospect of the Energy White Paper coming up.

We remain interested in marine and tidal as the Rt. Hon. Gentleman knows. Of course we need to discuss with the Treasury any support mechanisms, but I do want to continue to engage with the sector on a long term basis.#Speaking after the exchange, Mr Carmichael added: “White papers outline government’s thinking on policy areas, and are a key stage in influencing decisions made by ministers. Getting something in the white paper on support for the wave and tidal energy would be a huge coup for the industry which is big in the Northern Isles.“The marine energy industry is an innovative area of research, with the potential to add even more to our ability to export renewable energy to mainland Scotland.

However, Prospect has indicated that this would not be its members’ preferred option and it does not believe it would address their underlying pay issues.“As it stands the claim from the trade union remains a minimum of a double-digit increase effective from April , . A report compiled jointly between HIAL and Prospect on air traffic controller pay at non-HIAL airports found no evidence of a signicant pay dferential with other comparable airports.“At this point, it has not been possible to reach an agreement with the trade union on their pay dispute. Therefore, HIAL and Prospect have agreed to refer the matter to ACAS in a bid to resolve the matter.”However, David Avery, Prospect negotiations officer replied: #Members demands are reasonable and they need to be addressed. They are not seeking parity with Heathrow or Gatwick but other smaller airports.#“They have received a decade of below inflation pay rises while the rest of the industry, in response to a global shortage of controllers, has moved ahead. The company already struggles to recruit controllers and this is having an impact on services at some airports.“By asking for support from ACAS we hope to find a way forward in these talks. However ministers’ instructions to HIAL severely limit the companies negotiating position, so we also need to see these revoked.”As it stands, controllers at seven of HIAL’s eleven sites, including Kirkwall Airport, are due to take strike action on Friday, April .Industrial action short of a strike was also likely to start in April and continue through until August, and include instruction to work to rosters, refusal of non-medical extensions, an overtime ban, and withdrawal of goodwill.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

He set out that, between -, tourism numbers have increased by an impressive  per cent to almost , people with an estimated value of nearly £m.Mr McArthur warned that this success could not be taken for granted and presented its own challenges. As well as urging ministers to resolve the stand-off over RET and provide support for the replacement Orkney’s ageing internal ferry fleet, the Orkney MSP also repeated his call for Orkney’s world-class heritage sites to be backed by world-class infrastructure.Speaking after the debate, he said: #Tourism is one of the few sectors that touches almost every part of the country and it is one where Orkney has been punching above its weight over recent years.#With the natural assets we have and a lot of hard work by those involved in all aspects of the tourism sector locally, Orkney has seen visitor numbers and income increase signicantly over recent years. This success has brought awards and recognition, but it also brings with it challenges.#Everyone knows that Orkney’s reputation for quality requires the tourist experience to be managed carefully. This will involve taking pressure off key sites as well as making more of what Orkney has to offer.#It also needs Scottish Government to step up to the plate, not least when it comes to transport links. The long-overdue introduction of RET would help Orkney remain competitive as a destination, while replacement of the ageing internal ferry fleet is not only vital for the islands they serve but a means of encouraging visitors to explore more widely once they get here.“Ministers also have a role to play, through Historic Environment Scotland, in helping ensure that Orkney’s world-class heritage sites are supported by high-quality infrastructure. Local partners, including Destination Orkney and the Council, must be closely involved but investment through HES is crucial to making this happen.“There is good reason to believe that Orkney can continue playing to its strengths when it comes to tourism and there will be plenty of opportunities over the years ahead showcase our islands.  However, we cannot be complacent about what it will take to maintain and enhance Orkney’s reputation for good quality”.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

But when the guy propping up the bar is Theresa May’s top Europe advisor, Olly Robbins – the architect of her strategy in Brussels and the ERG’s favourite hate figure – you should safely be able to draw your Brexit roadmap from it.When ITV reported a second-hand overheard conversation in a Brussels bar where Robbins described how MPs would end up being presented with the option of May’s Brexit deal or a long delay, it seemed to offer a key that would unlock the whole process of leaving the EU.After MPs voted against no-deal last week and for an extension to Article , events appeared to be following Robbins’ script perfectly. The Government had hoped to bring the deal back for a third vote this week, with the threat of ­staying in the EU for anywhere between nine and  months looming over Brexiteers, forcing them to fall into line. Personally, I admit to breathing a sigh of relief at the end of last week’s chaos, thinking that a plan was coming together.But nothing has been more corrosive over the past three years than the illusion of government ­control, and some forces are beyond even Robbins’ reckoning. The fact that his plan was so dramatically derailed this week means that a no-deal Brexit – always the legal default – could now happen by ­accident, unless there is an even ­bigger twist in the week ahead.Rather than taking back control, the events of the past week put May’s fate in the hands of either the EU, or pro-EU Tories who could oust her to defeat her Brexit vision.: No-deal Brexit would place food banks in ‘dangerous position’, warns Ian BlackfordNo one in Government predicted John Bercow’s intervention ­ruling out a third vote on the Brexit deal unless there was a signicant change in content or circumstances. That in itself is worrying – the convention that motions can’t be voted on twice in the parliamentary session isn’t an obscure one. No one needs more evidence that Downing Street is floundering, but there it is.His critics say Bercow’s intervention was an attempt to block Brexit and allow the second EU referendum he really wants, or at least rule out a no-deal scenario. By ruling out a vote before yesterday’s EU Council summit, the ­Commons Speaker certainly denied the ­Government its best chance of ­getting the deal through.Bercow’s statement forced the EU Commission’s chief Brexit ­negotiator Michel Barnier to come out the following day and say a long extension needed a “clear purpose”. It also gave time for ­Brexiteers in the Cabinet to ambush May and force her to take a request for a long extension off the table.The spectre aimed at scaring Brexiteers was vanquished, ­leaving opposition MPs as the only pool of votes to pass the deal. May’s extraordinary statement in Downing Street, shting the blame onto parliament, burnt that bridge, too.With ious extension plans being discussed during intense talks in Brussels last night, EU leaders appear to have come to the conclusion that May, and her deal, are finished.If she isn’t in control, to avoid a no-deal Brexit the UK is now in the hands of two groups: Remainers in the Cabinet, and the  governments of the EU.A group of pro-EU Cabinet ­ministers have insisted they would do whatever it takes to stop no-deal. They may now have the time to show they mean it.Both Barnier and French president Emmanuel Macron have said there is a way back,the UK is ready for “deep political change”.This could be a general election or a second EU referendum, but what the EU really wants to hear is that the red lines that have made a deal so dficultare going to be jettisoned, either by May, or her successor.The Remain group in Cabinet includes Scottish Secretary David Mundell, who joined Amber Rudd, Greg Clarke and David Gauke in breaking a three-line whip to abstain on a motion to extend Article  last week. With so little time left, resignation isn’t enough. They would have to become the ‘men and women in grey suits’, insisting the Prime Minister abandons her red lines, or ushering her out of ­Downing Street.The likes of David Lidington would need to lead a government of national unity in all but name, getting a Brexit deal through with Labour and SNP votes that keeps the UK in the single market and customs union. It would likely mean the end of the Conservative Party as we know it at the very least, it would leave it to the next Tory leader to put its surviving pieces back together.: Jeremy Corbyn won’t rule out stopping Brexit as PM arrives in BrusselsEven in Brexit Britain, a week can’t possibly hold that much drama, but a longer extension offers the opportunity.Still, EU leaders can’t give the UK something it isn’t prepared to ask for itself. Conservative MPs lost the chance to push May from office when they failed to do the job before Christmas. The UK’s venerable ­parliamentary democracy has shown itself not to be nimble enough for the last-minute pivot needed, and evenit could, its leaders command too little confidence to bring the public along with them.In EU capitals, an election or a new EU referendum looks like a leap into more uncertainty, which the ­continent scarcely needs. Leaders and officials gathered in Brussels spoke openly about the “crisis” in the UK, and don’t want their fragile politics infected by the febrile mood around Westminster.A no deal Brexit could still happen by accident. The only thing that’s certain is that Bercow and the EU have called time on Robbins’ pub blueprint.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"why scotland s roads aren t ready for electric scooters alastair dalton","story":"Electric scooters are common in parts of Europe and the US and the UK Government is considering whether to allow them on British roads. Alastair Dalton explains why that would be a mistake.They offer a potentially attractive new way of getting about – but also threaten chaos on Scotland’s car-centric road networks.Electric scooters are commonplace in some European countries and US states, and the UK Government is now considering whether to allow them here too.Ministers announced this week they will “consider options for appropriate testing regimes to ensure any such vehicles on the road are safe and fit for purpose”, which could be followed by localised trials.On the face of it, being able to hop on and effortlessly zip about our towns and cities has obvious appeal – especially to non-cyclists.It is hardly “active travel”, like walking and cycling, but could encourage some to switch from cars or taxis on short journeys.Anything electrically powered, which has no emissions on the street, also has to be a positive as part of efforts to cut urban air pollution.However, letting loose a new form of transport on roads still woefully unsuited for cycles could just make things worse for everyone.That’s not to say there’s not a case for them – but the radical redrawing of road space away from the car should be accelerated first.The brave would take their chances scooting among other traffic, though many are likely to be deterred from sharing roads with lorries, buses and taxis, let alone the cars who already pass cyclists intimidatingly close.: Electric scooters on British roads would create ‘dangerous cocktail’There’s also the small matter of scooters’ in wheels not being pothole friendly, causing discomfortnot danger, as shared transport group Comouk has highlighted.Most who scoot are likely to want to stick to the relative safety of pavements and cycle lanes –that is permitted. But here, a dferent risk is created, of scooters colliding with pedestrians.There are far too few cycle lanes they could use, on roads or pavements, and even fewer segregated lanes, albeit cities like Glasgow are adding more.In addition, there is already potential conflict between walkers and cyclists on shared paths, some of which would struggle to cope with more riders, let alone scooters too.Another concern is street clutter. Recent visitors to Berlin and Brussels tell me of large numbers of scooters strewn across pavements.Technology may now enable scooters to be left “dockless”, but this has caused a big problem in places like San Diego.It’s bad enough trying to negotiate pavements already littered with advertising A-boards, so this could cause another hazard.Karen Millhouse, a resident of the Calornian city, emailed me this week: “I think we have more than , dockless scooters in our fair city, and they just keep coming. It is a nightmare, especially for pedestrians and the disabled.”She said Disability Rights Calornia had even filed a class action against scooters blocking pavements.: Alastair Dalton: The ‘electric-bike smile’ is now officialA better plan for Scotland – and the UK – would be to focus on electric bikes first. The main rental schemes in Edinburgh and Glasgow are due to add them later this year, along with other parts of Scotland such as Stirling.Electric bikes are equally effortless to ride, but unlike scooters provide nearly as much exercise as traditional cycling, so have much more to commend them.They also encourage people to cycle further, and have a similar topspeed – mph – as has been proposed for scooters.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"brexit how the flextension deal was reached and what happens now","story":"EU leaders stepped in to tell Theresa May what would happenher own MPs voted against her Brexit deal, explains Paris Gourtsoyannis. But what happens next is still up in the airThe UK may have just taken part in its last EU Council summit, and the symbolism was inflicted on the British press pack. Its usual seats at the heart of the summit press hall were snapped up by Chinese journalists in Brussels as Xi Jinping tours Europe. The EU wanted to talk about its bright future - those writing about the awkward present were shunted into a hot, stuffy side room.Right up to the moment Theresa May sat down to ask them for a Brexit extension, EU leaders had talked tough: any delay would have conditions, and would be final. Take it or leave it - we’re washing our hands.But during a  minute grilling, the Prime Minister failed to convince them she had any clear plan of what to doher deal was voted down by MPs again next week. So EU leaders stepped in and wrote one for her.: Brexit: Theresa May’s ‘job on the line’ as Tories lose patienceThe EU took another five hours to hammer out the ‘flextension’ agreed late on Thursday night, with leaders tearing up their own proposal and getting stuck into the drafting of a new one. In the back and forth, several dferent suggestions leaked out over the course of the evening.In the end, it was Brexit that pushed China off the agenda, with talks over dinner replaced by more wrangling about Article . May had been due to eat with fellow leaders instead, summit organisers offered to send the menu of lentil and langoustine terrine and roasted duckling over for her to eat alone.The UK’s future was set without its Prime Minister in the room, not because EU bureaucrats wanted it that way, but because its own government offered no alternative.A no deal Brexit remains a strong possibility, and the EU has designed a scheme that seeks to leave it out of the blame game that would follow. It gives pro-EU forces in parliament two extra weeks to mobilise, and left the door open to a long delaythey can agree on a clear alternative to the Prime Minister’s deal.One of the most signicant things to emerge overnight was how open EU Council President Donald Tusk was about his desire to see the UK change its mind on Brexit.“I am very satisfied, especially that we still have so many options open,” he said in a midnight press conference, adding with a smile: “You know what my personal view is on this.” He later went even further in a briefing with Polish media, saying he wanted the UK to “consider all possible options” - which include revoking Article .The question now is what parliament does with its two week window. Next week, MPs will mount yet another bid to take control of the order paper, so that they can finally vote on alternatives to the government’s Brexit deal. A softer exit inside the single market and customs union, and a second EU referendum are likely to feature. The government will try to bring back its deal, but few have any expectation it will succeed.Meanwhile at Westminster, calls from her own party for the Prime Minister to step aside continue to grow. It may have only been Theresa May’s last Brussels summit.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"brexit theresa may s job on the line as tories lose patience","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Theresa May is ing from another tumultuous Brussels summit amid warnings that her premiership is on the line.But she faces a Tory Party losing patience with her leadership and threats that MPs could now seize control of the withdrawal process.Sir Graham Brady, the chairman of the backbench  committee, was reported to have met Mrs May to tell her that most Conservative MPs now want her to quit.The Dailysaid that Sir Graham visited her in Downing Street on Monday after being “bombarded” with text messages from MPs demanding she should go.The paper said that it was one of a series of direct confrontations with Conservative MPs in the run-up to the summit.Mrs May was said to have been challenged by a group of  whips just before last week’s meaningful vote - which she lost by  votes - with one directly calling on her to quit, while others warned that the trust of backbenchers had been lost.And there was said to have been a further confrontation with Eurosceptic MPs on Wednesday when Nigel Evans, the executive secretary of the , told her: “It’s not that people don’t believe what you say, it’s that people don’t believe you can deliver.”Stewart Jackson, who was David Davis’s chief of staff when he was Brexit secretary, said she should “stand down immediately”she loses next week’s vote.“Conservative members will no longer tolerate her grovelling to the EU and national humiliation,” said the former Conservative MP for Peterborough. “I suspect the Whips, and Cabinet will help the process.”Mrs May’s former policy adviser George Freeman said thatshe lost the vote, Parliament would “take control and “switch to Plan B” to join the European Free Trade Association “with or without this PM”.At a late night press conference, the Prime Minister made clear that she intended to make another attempt to get her Brexit deal through the Commons.If she succeeds, the EU leaders agreed to extend the Article  withdrawal process until May  to enable the Government get the necessary legislation through Parliament.Butshe fails to do so, the UK will have until April  to set out its next steps, with a longer extension on offer onlyBritain takes part in European Parliament elections in May.The Prime Minister told reporters the “flextension” plan offered MPs a clear choice.“We can leave with a deal in an orderly manner, have that extension until May , orwe don’t get that deal, that vote, through, then we have to come forward with another plan, andthat plan means another extension, it means standing in those European elections,” she said.However, the chairman of the Commons Brexit Committee, Labour MP Hilary Benn, warned that he will table an amendment enabling MPs to hold a series of “indicative votes” on alternatives to Mrs May’s plan.“This won’t workthe Prime Minister is not prepared to move an inch,” he told the BBC Radio  Today programme.“We need to open up this process because we have rejected her deal, we’ve rejected no-deal, the EU has decided to give us a little more time, and we’ve really got to get on with it.”The amendment is backed by a cross-party group of MPs including Tory former ministers Sir Oliver Letwin and Dominic Grieve.Aides confirmed that Thursday’s agreement means that a no-deal Brexit is no longer a possibility on March , but stressed that it remains on the tableMPs have not approved the Withdrawal Agreement by April .The format increases pressure on Leave-backing MPs to row in behind Mrs May’s deal, for fear thatit falls the UK could find itself electing new MEPs and remaining for month or years within the EU.It also creates a fortnight’s breathing spaceMrs May reaches the end of next week without securing agreement for her package, orSpeaker John Bercow prevents her from tabling a motion which he regards as a repeat of those already defeated by  votes in January and  votes last week.Downing Street was unable to say which day the Government would seek to bring back the Withdrawal Agreement for a third “meaningful vote” - known in Westminster as MV.But sources confirmed that Mrs May will table secondary legislation to remove the date March  from Brexit laws.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"royal mile treasure trove of mary queen of scots documents found","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...A treasure trove of documents signed by Mary Queen of Scots and revealing the #everyday reality of ruling the country# in the th century has been unearthed in a council storage facility on the Royal Mile.A haul of handwritten papers is said to show the doomed monarch “carefully managing the busy commercial le of Edinburgh”, as well as authorising the building of new defences for the city in Leith.The documents, which are set to be the centrepiece of a new exhibition in Edinburgh on Mary’s short-lived rule, have already been conserved and digitised to allow them to be viewed publicly on the council’s online archive. They were discovered by staff in a store at the Museum of Edinburgh, just a few hundred yards away from the Palace of Holyroodhouse, where Mary ruled for six years after ing from France in . The  documents, which are inidually dated, numbered and signed, relate to the rights of deacons and tradesmen in the city, the selling of meat at the Tolbooth and the making of salt in Newhaven.Early conservation work on the documents, which were recently discovered in the Museum of Edinburgh’s own storage facility off the Canongate, has revealed watermarks – one of a goat and another of a flower – which can only been seen when held up to light.It is thought the papers entered the archives of the local authority in the s, but were then “lost” before being rediscovered nearly a century later during conservation work. Intriguingly, some of the documents signed by Mary date from when she was still in France.Experts in the council’s museums and galleries service, which is responsible for the official archives of the city, said the recently unearthed documents revealed an “often overlooked “ aspect of her le.History curator Vicky Garrington said: “Together, the documents shed light on a key part of Scotland’s past. We all know the tragic story of Mary Queen of Scots, her eventful le and eventual execution in , but in these documents we see a dferent side to Mary.“Here, she can be seen carefully managing the everyday affairs of Edinburgh, both from France and Scotland. It’s fascinating to think of her reading through these official papers before carefully applying her signature.“They are staying in storage at the museum for now. But we hope to have them assessed by a conservator and for further research to be done on them by experts on Mary, after which we hope to exhibit them, which will be hugely exciting.”Museums and galleries manager Frank Little said: “We’re constantly reviewing, caring for and researching our collections, and look forward to sharing more of the city’s rich heritage with residents and visitors through our programme of exhibitions and online activities.” Council culture convener Donald Wilson said: “Our museums and galleries hold thousands of historic treasures, many of which are on display in our venues.

They then went on to highlight some of the key tenets underpinning the debate such as trade agreements, law and immigration, before making their concluding statements.In the opening gambit for the pro-Brexit team, S pupil Abbi Morgan argued that leaving the EU #would be a hugely positive thing for the UK# and would allow the country to #take control of borders and create worldwide trade agreements#.She went on to add that it would put the UK in a position to #take back its sovereignty# and make its own decisions on important matters. She stated that as a net contributor to the EU, the UK would be better off by £. billion.In the opening address for the pro-EU team, Lois Langlandssaid that #history and past experience as a member of the EU# gave the UK a more secure position for the future and that, in leaving the European Union, the UK would #enter the unknown# and #walk into the future blindfolded#.She said that outside the EU the UK was a #small fish in a big pond# and asked why any country would be interested in providing a free trade agreement with the UK.#The EU as an organisation is extremely wasteful#, he said. #Every  days the European Parliament moves from Brussels to Strasbourg, where it sits for four days # this is estimated to cost nearly £ million a year.#Touching on the issues of freedom of movement as part of the remain team, Chiara MacLeansaid: #Once the UK leaves the EU, British citizens will become third-party nationals, with no automatic right of admission.# She added that, through the new European travel information and authorisation system, all UK nationals over  years of age #would have to pay money to go somewhere they had a free right to go now#.Seth Bennettook up the reins for the pro-Brexit side, arguing that in terms of laws and immigration the EU could pass any laws they wanted and in by doing so #strip Britain of its sovereignty# # which he described as #one of its driving forces#.He believed that Brexit would offer the UK the chance to #increase its spending in education and housing# which could perhaps lead to a #revival of the nation#s once-thriving industries#.Speaking for the pro-EU team, Gracie Buchan said that leaving the European Union would lead to a trade deficit and result in a shortage of daily supplies such as fruit and vegetables.#Keeping food shop shelves full and prices down will be one of the biggest challenges when Brexit comes around,# she said. #Failure to reach some sort of an agreement could see retailers face an average increase of  per cent, particularly in dairy, meat, veg, and fruit.#Closing for the Brexit side, S pupil Joseph Moller said the EU favoured its own agenda and that in terms of per head of population Maltese citizens had  times more representation than UK nationals.He added that, rather than the , jobs that were cited as potentially being lost due to Brexit, the level of employment had in fact risen by one per cent since the referendum and unemployment was at its lowest level since the s.Summing up for remain, S pupil Innes MacNeil said: #Latest reports suggest that deals have been struck with just seven out of  countries, we have gained a lot more than we have spent on the EU, and multinational companies are threatening to relocate overseas, affecting jobs and investments.#Exiting in less than  days# time without any sound withdrawal agreement and just a few trade relationships will result in uncertainty and chaos.#The judges said they were impressed by how confident and informed the pupils were. They also felt the pupils were cohesive as a team and said that they saw some future MSPs and MPs.In the end, the judges awarded the team speaking against Brexit  points while the side advocating Brexit received  to claim victory.Skye, Lochaber, and Badenoch MSP Kate Forbes and Highland and Islands MSP Edward Mountain both fielded questions on Brexit after the debate and were quick to praise the pupils for their efforts.Ms Forbes said: #I certainly think they could have resolved Brexit faster than some of the politicians today # an absolutely fantastic debate based on fact, evidence, respect for each other, lots of confidence. I think I have left with a few top tips for my next debate in parliament!#Mr Mountain added: #I thought it was quite excellent # there#s obviously a lot of research gone into it. I thought they were extremely confident # I would have been much more nervous than that speaking at their age. As I said to Kate Forbes today, she should be worried because there are a few challenges for her position.#"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/001WH1503NCA-crop.jpg","title":"lewis and harris womens football team kick off new league in","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine with a barnstorming - away win over Nairn Ladies FC.The long trip to Nairn for their league opener on Saturday proved to be one to remember for the islanders as they enjoyed a resounding victory to get their league campaign up and running in emphatic fashion.Played in freezing conditions on Nairn showfield, the Lewis and Harris club fielded a young side made up largely of - and -year-olds # with just three non-pupil players included in the squad.After missing a penalty, Ann-Mairi Macleod made history by becoming the scorer of the first goal in the newly-formed Highlands and Islands league.Macleod#s goal opened the floodgates as the visitors went on to score five more in the first period # thanks to a goal apiece from Jessica Macleod and Hollie Martin, and a hat-trick from Mary Macleod.Lewis and Harris were in dreamland in the second half as they proceeded to score a further  goals.

From pizza to pasta, Italian food is right up there with so many people’s tastebuds.As a lover of all things Italian, I was hugely excited when the Balmoral Hotel recently started their ‘Italian Night’, available every Tuesday night from -pm. I am no stranger to the thriving Black’s Road establishment and given the quality of food available in the Lady Anne Bistro and the conjoining Stix # Stones, the special-themed night attracted me to pay a visit once again to the Balmoral last Tuesday night.As ever, we were greeted by a polite and accommodating member of staff on arrival and shown to our table. I was immediately drawn by the décor – a number of Italian flags scattered around the restaurant and a huge blazing fire which was the perfect welcoming as Storm Gareth continued to rage outside.The themed-menu consists of a range of dishes sought to bring out the authentic taste of Italy and I couldn’t wait to peruse my choices. From pizzas to lasagne and pasta, there looked to be something for everyone, with gluten-free options also available.Before we had made our choice, we were presented with a large plate of Italian antipasti – basically a mixture of famous Italian nibbles. Much to my surprise, this is a complimentary touch from the Balmoral on the Italian night, designed to delve you into the full authentic Italian experience straight away.I gazed excitedly at my partner across the table. Where would we start  There were sticks of garlic bread, doughballs, pepperoni, olives and a pasta salad. Add in some jalapenos, peppers with a mouth-watering vinaigrette and mozzarella, it was a sublime clash of flavours which made me feel right in… well Italy! It reminded me much like a version of Spanish Tapas or Chinese Dim Sum which allows for iety and quantity of dferent options. With quality too, the night was off to a flyer with this beautul antipasti starter.On to the main course and after the wonderful starter, me and my partner could not wait for it to arrive. We both went for pizza, and to be honest it would be hard not to given the mouth-watering choices on the menu. A superb handcrafted gourmet pizza range, inidually designed with the finest ingredients for your own authentic taste of Italy – it was simply a no-brainer.After much deliberation, I opted for the BBQ Pizza, which consisted of a BBQ sauce base, mozzarella, chorizo, peri-peri chicken, jalapenos, onions and sweetcorn. Drizzled with just amount the peri-peri sauce, it was a concoction of flavours. A thin-base is always a must for me in order to properly enjoy what is actually on the pizza, instead of having to chew excessive amounts of pizza dough and again this pizza ticked all the right boxes. A BBQ-base and chicken on a pizza is nothing out of the ordinary on a pizza menu but this one was unique, given the intense flavour from the peri-peri sauce. This pizza would put some “Italian” pizza takeaways to shame, quite frankly. It was that good.Across the table, my partner, who is a vegetarian is no stranger to a good old pizza, after all it is entirely possible to enjoy the classic Italian dish without any meat at all. The menu includes a fantastic make-your-own option from an ingredient list with everything you can think of on it, allowing you to be as adventurous as you like. She went for a classic tomato base complete with mozzarella and a generous helping of sweetcorn, peppers and jalapenos. The pizza looked like a veggie’s delight and again it could not be faulted. Not too heavy on the stomach and full of flavour, it was little surprise she deliberately wanted to keep a few slices to take home.The pizzas also allow for additional sides, and it wouldn’t be an Italian night without some Garlic Bread. I simply adore anything garlic and this was what garlic bread should be like – oozing with garlic butter as it was torn apart, you could tell it was handcrafted and homemade to perfection. Our additional side of garlic potatoes also trumped the other side options of skinny fries or a tossed salad. It was a carbs heaven evening overall but worth it for the quality and taste of the food we enjoyed.A packed Tuesday night in the Lady Anne Bistro could only mean other diners, like ourselves, were enjoying the authentic Italian-themed menu on offer. It was something very unique and to their credit, the wonderful team of chefs and staff at the Balmoral are pulling it off to perfection. Most of the pizzas are priced around the £ mark which is more than worth it, just think how expensive it can be to order a takeaway from some well-known establishments. The Balmoral Hotel is excelling and the Italian-themed night is just the latest incentive to what is a fantastic establishment. Warm and friendly staff, quality food and best of all, it’s right on your doorstep. I could not recommend the Italian night anymore. Go and check it out for yourself and tell me you don’t feel like you have been to Italy for the night. I cannot wait to plan my next Tuesday nightvisit.Balmoral Hotel,Blacks Road, Dunmurry, Belfast BT NFTel:    balmoralhotelbelfast.co.u"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"butsy was larger than life and loved by many","story":"BORN on September   the late Pat ‘Butsy’ Butler has been described as a “larger than le figure” and“someone who was known and loved by many”.Pat, who passed away on December  , was educated at St Teresa’s Primary School on the Glen Road, before moving to St Malachy’s College where he completed his secondary education. The Glen Road man’s first job was as a compositor printer with Pitman’s University Press. However, during these early working days, he undertook voluntary youth work within the greater West Belfast area and soon realised that this was where his future lay. Eventually Pat left Belfast for Leicester University where he achieved his degree in youth and social care, following this up with a Master’s degree from the Ulster University. Pat eventually became a youth worker in charge at St Michael’s Youth Club, Finaghy Road North, where he spent many happy years. During this time, Pat managed a number of the youth football teams, with home games being played at Woodlands playing fields. Pat’s brothers commented that to say he was “vocerous” in his coaching would be an “understatement”. “In fact the story goes that at this time, house prices in Orchardville depreciated by  per cent!”At a time when West Belfast was often in turmoil, the youth club was a haven for young people a place where parents knew their children would be safe. Pat took this onboard and enabled the young people in his care to reach their full potential. Pat developed an insatiable love for sport from a very early age. He joined Davitt’s GAC for a short time before transferring to St Agnes’ where he spent many happy years as both a player and manager. In the course of his time with the ‘Aggies’ Pat, along with many of the players, made those never to be forgotten trips to the continent and of course Shannon events that proved to be hugely enjoyable and deeply spitural ventures. A serious arm break when he was  curtailed Pat’s playing career but he had much success in his managerial roles. Pat, affectionately known as Butsy, also loved soccer and had a long and enjoyable time playing for and supporting Dominic Savio. During the ’s, Pat embraced the basketball scene and in particular St Gall’s basketball club. Pat was committed totally to this new undertaking. In fact, his brother Gerard remembers ing back to Denewood one day and discovering a very large American making himself a cup of tea. Of course Pat had not told Gerard that ‘Soupy’ Campbell would be staying for a few days – a bit of a shock. As a commentator and administrator Pat gave  per cent to this new venture. His famous commentary during lives games in the Andersonstown Leisure Centre is still talked about.On the sporting front, Pat finally finished up as a member of Falls Bowling Club where he spent many happy years as a player, administrator and advisor to the long suffering groundsman. Pat eventually became the club president, something of which he was particular proud of. He also became president of the private greens – a role which again Pat embraced with diligence and total commitment. A spokesperson for Falls Bowling Club described Pat, their th President, as someone with a personality that “could fill the Waterfront Hall”. “His passing has left a gap that we will not attempt to fill.”Married to Shelia since August  , Pat lived le to the full, had a hugely positive influence on many and ultimately made a dference. He will be sorely missed by all who knew him."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"history man joes lifetime in community","story":"HAVING been involved in community development for the best part of three decades, Joe Baker is a familiar face to many in North Belfast, but he is probably most recognised as one of the city’s leading resident historians.Joe has been involved with the Ashton Community Trust virtually since its inception in the early-s and now sits on its board. It was also during that time that he became involved in the Belfast History Project.Throughout his career, Joe has written, and published, books, magazines and newspaper articles for a range of media outlets during his career but, unlike some historians, his expertise grew outside the confines of traditional academia.By his own admission, he didn’t do too well at school, often “forgetting” to get off the bus at the gate. However, after ing to education at the Belfast College of Business Studies in the late s, he enrolled in history classes, which he would go on to utilise with the fledgling Belfast History Project.“I came back from college and started to get people involved in learning about the history of the area,” he explained.“From that, we discussed a number of dferent ideas. One idea we had worked on before that was cleaning up Clton Street Cemetery – which was where we used to drink our cider. It was all overgrown and wrecked at the time, but we all got together to fix it up. We tied in with people like Enterprise Ulster, and then Belfast City Council took it over and a number of volunteers came on board. Through that we developed this interest in local history.“Once the ball started rolling that was it. We started doing dferent educational projects. One of the things we started to discuss was putting a magazine together, which sounds very easy, but at that time there was this new thing coming out called a computer that you had to learn to use. Then you had to learn the computer programmes, which in those days was Pagemaker. Then you had to learn about printing and all the rest of it. Once we go up and running everything just fell into place.”The Belfast History Project has been exemplary in its endeavours, setting up groundbreaking publications and establishing history tours in long-unexplored areas of the city.“One of the good things is that when you look in Belfast city centre now and you see all the tours done here and there – blue badge this, white badge that – we get to look at it and say we did it first,” said Joe with a smile.“We did a walking tour in the Half Bap area and one of the very first tours was cancelled because of a bomb scare – not many tour operators can claim that.”The end of the conflict has ushered in a new age of competition as ious operators compete to sell tours of the ever-developing city of Belfast. While Joe believes the growing interest in local history is “brilliant” he insists branding and profits have often got in the way of fact.“People are trying to put these brands on things,” he said.“At my last count Belfast has nine-quarters. When I was at school,I was asked how many quarters there were andI had said nine I know what would’ve happened.“There is a lot of  stuff like this Tribeca development, which is a lot of nonsense.“They should do the names to reflect the history of the area. It annoys me when people try to put a  history on an area or say things that just aren’t true. We’ve always argued thatyou’re going to do history you should tell the truth. I love to see the tourism industry grow and change, but as long as they stick to a principle of truth.”Having started as a small local initiative, the Belfast History Project has flourished over the years, and now provides tours all over Europe, with their Russian tours booked up for nearly two years in advance. However, with all of its wider triumphs, the Belfast History Project remains a social enterprise, whose key aim is to give back to the community. Local tours and events still run regularly, such as the highly successful historical photographic exhibiton, which recently appeared in the New Lodge – and, as Joe explained, “It’s all about education”.“If we get people into history we can get them into education and guide them along their own path,” he said.“For example, we had a group of kids studying the history of the New Lodge, which grew to Belfast, Ireland and then Europe. They might be kids at the time, and they’ll mess about, but about tenyears later they’ll come back to us and say ‘That was the best project I was ever part of’ and that gives us a buzz.”Joe continued: “I remember years ago that the Barrack area in the New Lodge was just called the Barrack, but younger people didn’t know why it was called that. If you ask them now they’ll tell you it’s because there used to be an army barracks there.“Whenever you do a photographic exhibition and people are learning about their own area, then that’s the start of an educational journey.“As we always say, there is no more fruitful form of education than to raise the interest of people in their own surroundings.“Once you do that it can open up countless other opportunities.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"priceless 1916 artefacts to go on show at opening of new james","story":"AN ORIGINAL  Proclamation along with the printing blocks used to create the document are among the historically invaluable artacts to go on display for the first time ever together when Áras Uí Chonghaile opens its doors next month. The Gaeltacht Quarter-based £. million three-storey building is set to welcome tourists and visitors from Saturday, April  when the centre opens to offer an interactive exhibition, study area, a fascinating library of Connolly’s writings, café and conference facility. The opening of Áras Uí Chonghaile comes three years after a statue of James Connolly was unveiled outside the Falls Community Council to commemorate the th year of the Easter Rising. The bronze statue was unveiled by a great-grandson of the  hero, James Connolly Heron, who described West Belfast as Connolly’s “spiritual home”.The ambitious project, led by Fáilte Feirste Thiar, will host a pageant parade on April , Good Friday, and will leave from Conway Mill, a site where James Connolly organised mill workers during the time he made West Belfast his home. “Aras Uí Chonghaile is designed to celebrate everything James Connolly contributed to Belfast, Ireland and beyond,” explained Fáilte Feirste Director Harry Connolly. “There are five core elements to the centre, starting with the ground floor, world-class visitor exhibition. The first floor of the centre will house the Connolly Library and will consist of the world’s finest collection of writings including books we have secured from when James Connolly spent his time in Kilmainham Gaol. The fourth element of the centre will be an event and conference space, with all the first class facilities you would expect.”Harry told the Andersonstown News that a year-long events programme has also been planned with folk sessions, film club meetings held once a month in conjunction with Sean Murray’s Respect film company, and a series of seminars and lectures.“We are also delighted to announce that Hatch Café will take up residence in the centre as our hospitality partners and will be open to the public,” he said. Áras Uí Chonghaile centre manger Séanna Walsh spoke of how the centre will host a programme of events that will try to emphasise that “It’s not just about Connolly the Irish rebel, it’s as much about Connolly the trade unionist, the guy who organised the mill workers in Conway Street, the guy who went to the States and organised several trade unions there, who all take their lineage right back that far.” Séanna continued: “There will be a major educational element to the centre, we want schools, colleges, universities coming to see the project.“It’s ground-breaking the things we will have on display for the first time: an original Proclamation and also a half Proclamation which was actually produced by the British to use in evidence during the court martial.“Having the seven signatories at the bottom was all they needed, those along with the original printing blocks will be displayed for the first time ever together. “At the end of the day, the centre has to be Connolly in the round. Not the one-dimensional Connolly – the Irish rebel. It’s important to the legacy of the man this centre is seen as a resource by the trade unions right across the island.”Harry said that there is no doubt Áras Uí Chonghaile will become a key part of the city’s tourism trail. “We want to thank our funders Belfast City Council and the wide range of sponsoring trade unions from the States that have pledged and delivered key financial resources which haveallowed the centre to become a reality.” "},{"url":null,"title":"eu leaders offer uk brexit delay until may 22 after","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsLocal Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide March Spring EditionCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Photo credit: ec.europa.eu PA WireAsked how long the “long extension” eventually on offer to the UK could be, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker replied: “Until the very end.”Mr Juncker said: “Since the day of the referendum the position of the  members of the European Commission has been united and unequivocal.“We have worked tirelessly to negotiate the Withdrawal Agreement.  “We have done everything we could to get it over the finishing line.“We were asked for clarications in December, we gave it to them. “We were asked for assurances in January, we gave it to them.“I was asked for further reassurances last Monday in Strasbourg, notably with regard to the backstop, I gave it to them.“So I have to welcome that today, the  leaders endorsed the legally bonding clarications and assurances that Prime Minister May and I agreed in Strasbourg.“This closes and completes the full package. There is no more that we can have.”I hope we can all agree that we are now at the moment of decision and I will make every effort to make sure we can leave with a deal and move our country forward.Theresa MayFacebookTwitterSpeaking at a Brussels press conference after the announcement Mrs May said: \"Firstly I welcome the Councils approval of the legally-binding assurances in relation to the Northern Ireland backstop, which I negotiated with President Juncker last week.\"This should give extra assurance to Parliament that in the unlikely event that the backstop is ever used it will only be temporary and that the UK and EU will begin work immediately to replace the backstop with alternative arrangements by the end of December .\"Mrs May saidParliament does not pass her deal next week the European Council will extend Article  to April  when the UK would have the choice of no deal or to put forward an alternative plan.She saidthis involved another extension then the country will have to take part in the European Parliament elections.Mrs May added: \"I believe strongly it would be wrong to ask people in the UK to participate in these elections three years after voting to leave the EU.\"Mrs May said she would be doing her utmost to ensure her deal was passed next week.\"What the decision today underlines is the importance of the House of Commons passing a Brexit deal next week so that we can bring an end to the uncertainty and leave in a smooth and orderly manner,\" she said.\"Tomorrow morning I will be ing to the UK and working hard to build support for getting the deal through.\"The so-called “flextension” plan was drawn up in a meeting stretching over eight hours at an EU summit in Brussels, as EU leaders wrangled over possible final cut-off dates for Brexit.The format increases pressure on Leave-backing MPs to row in behind Mrs May’s deal, for fear thatit falls the UK could find itself electing new MEPs and remaining for month or years within the EU.But it also creates a breathing space of a fortnightMrs May reaches the end of next week without securing agreement for her package – orSpeaker John Bercow prevents her from tabling a motion which he regards as a repeat of those already defeated by  votes in January and  votes last week.Parliament could use that time to try to take control of the process and force Mrs May towards a softer Brexit stance or second referendum.The bulk of the meeting took place behind closed doors in Mrs May’s absence, after her plea for a longer extension to June  fell on deaf ears.Mrs May had to leave the room after making her case in a -minute presentation to her European counterparts.The Prime Minister was reportedly pressed on what she will doMPs reject her deal for a third time but did not commit herself to a Plan B or rule out a no-deal Brexit."},{"url":null,"title":"alevel northern ireland school league table","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsLocal Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide March Spring EditionCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Bereaved families have waited  years for fresh inquests, which are now in their fourth week.

He added that Mick Murray was \"one of the bombers\", and claimed he recalled Murray telling him there would be \"no harm\"similar bombings had been repeated, because of the \"chaos\" caused. Pressed by Lesley Thomas, the barrister representing nine of the bereaved families, that another member of the bombings team was Michael Hayes, he replied: \"Hayes, Hayes - Ill give itto you now.\" He added, in apparent reference to the Good Friday Agreement: \"But he cant be arrested. \"There is nobody going to be charged with this atrocity. \"The British Government have signed an agreement with the IRA.\" Then asked about \"James Gavin\", he replied: \"Well he was , I met him in Dublin and he said he was.\" All the men have been named before in connection with the bombings, but not in a formal setting. Witness O, who was in jail at the time of the bomb attacks, described the bombings as \"an atrocity\". He also claimed he had given McLoughlans name to two police detectives while in HMP Winson Green just days after the bombings, but heard nothing more. He added that two other men, who he identied as \"Dublin Dave\" and \"Socks\" had also been involved, but that he did not know either mans name."},{"url":null,"title":"new 208m belfast transport hub given green light by","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsLocal Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide March Spring EditionCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

This means that teachers are working twice as hard with less resources, and its just a very unfair playing field that educationalists are working in at the moment.\"Every year we seem to be asked to do more with less.

The big focus in our school is on values, shared values, and doing what is right and the whole idea that they have a God-given talent and its up to them to make the best and for us to bring out the best in the children,\" she said.\"In our school we have a big focus on girl power, thatyou work hard enough you can be whatever you want to be.\"The Department of Education said that the information contained in the table relating to A-level results \"does not provide a valid basis for comparing performance between schools, since it takes no account of intakes of the schools or of any other factors that may affect pupil performance\".It added: \"No single measurement can constitute a fair or accurate evaluation of a school, and the figures should be considered in the context of other information about schools and their pupils.\"The Belfastobtained data from the Department of Education for A-levels sat in the   academic year and compiled the figures into easy-to-read tables, ordered top to bottom.

plannersrsquo recommendation to refuse permission to develop Northern Irelandrsquos first woodland graveyard outside Downpatrick.The decision to allow those behind the controversial proposal for a -acre site at Loughmoney more time to provide additional information was taken at last weekrsquos meeting of Newry, Mourne and Down Councilsrsquo Planning Committee.Plans for the graveyard, which has split public opinion, were unveiled in September  by Down to Earth Ltd, which hosted a series of public consultation meetings to outline the detail of its proposal.Those behind the lsquogreen graveyardrsquo project, which would be sited off the Ballyculter Road and contain parking provision for  cars, say they are confident that the proposal would have a low environmental impact and offer an alternative to those seeking an environmentally-friendly approach to burial.They argue there are no designations that would preclude a development of this nature and that the proposal will enhance the location by creating and enhancing shared space, supporting good design and improving the built and natural environment.Supporters of the project also contend that the project will ldquopreserve restore and enhance ecosystems, turning an arable field into a nature reserve.In papers submitted ahead of last weekrsquos meeting, planners confirmed they had representations in support and opposition to the proposal, with the planned burial site having no headstones, with all burials recorded on a map.Signicantly, planners confirmed that while there can be no objections in principle to the proposal, those behind the project had not provided the requested additional information.They revealed that while extra time was allowed to comply with the request, no further extension was being afforded with the recommendation to refuse the application now being made.Planners added: ldquoWhile it is considered that the proposal will not create any unacceptable visual or residential impact due to its nature, it is considered further information is required for the consultees which also encompasses a number of concerns raised from interested parties.Planners confirmed Environment and Rivers Agencies are among those who still require further information to enable them to fully assess the planning application and provide detailed comment.Planners had described the information they required as ldquocrucial and pertinent to the application and that it was most unfortunate that it has not been provided.They said while there may be no objection in principle to the proposal ldquoit is not possible to fully consider the merits of the case at this time..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Down in pole position  ","story":"DOWN had to dig deep mdash and then some mdash to come away from Netwatch Cullen Park on Saturday with two more precious points.A win or draw for Paddy Tallyrsquos this Sunday against Louth at Pairc Esler would be enough to send Down into a Division  final at Croke Park at the end of the month and secure promotion back into Division .However, Down left it extremely late before securing the spoils and it took a point in added time from Donal OrsquoHare to kill off a game Carlow offering in a controversial conclusion to the game.Three minutes injury-time had been played when Diarmuid Walshe converted a free to tie the game for the home side.With the home fans waiting on the final whistle, play was allowed to continue and OrsquoHare was again Downrsquos saviour with a last-gasp winner.The game was far from being a classic with referee, James Bermingham, booking five Carlow players and seven from Down before issuing red to Shane Redmond from the home county and Kevin McKiernan and Paul Devlin from Down.Carlow led - to - at the interval with Darragh Foley using the wind well in the half landing six points from placed balls.Down used the elements to their advantage after the break and points from Paul Devlin, Conor Poland, Darren OrsquoHagan and OrsquoHare had the visitors in the ascendancy.Carlow then hit back with Eoghan Ruth pouncing on a loose ball in the square before beating an exposed Rory Burns up breaking ball in the big square and eased the ball home to level at - to -.Caolan Mooney restored Downrsquos lead with a point, but Carlow refused to go away. Devlin picked up his red card after a second yellow and Diarmuid Walsh levelled with a free three minutes into added time.That seemed to be it, but the referee let play continue and OrsquoHare showed great composure to send the winning point over the bar from quite a way out.Carlow: Robert Sansom, Chris Crowley, Shane Redmond, Conor Lawlor, Benny Kavanagh, Eoghan Ruth , Ciaran Moran, Brendan Murphy , Sean Murphy, Jordan Morrissey , Sean Gannon, Darragh OrsquoBrien, Conor Crowley, Darragh Foley , Daniel St Ledger.

He is also receiving a gelatin diet, full of calcium, vitamins and minerals, which is important for the development of his shell.ldquoAs JC has taken well to rehabilitation we have decided that it is best for him to be moved to a larger space as he will have more room to swim and e.ldquoLuckily he has responded well to treatment and is currently settling in to his new home where visitors to the aquarium will be able to get a glimpse of the vulnerable species as he continues to recover.The future is looking bright for JC as the team at Exploris will continue to monitor his weight over the coming months. They plan to release him back to his natural environment when he has fully recovered.Loggerhead turtles like JC can live to about  years of age in the wild and usually reach about three feet in shell .Mr Williams says the ultimate goal is to release the reptile back into the wild in warmer waters.This is not the first time Exploris has tried to nurse a lost loggerhead turtle back to health.In January , another loggerhead was found washed up on a Co Donegal beach and was also taken to Exploris suffering from hypothermia.Staff named that male turtle Columba, but sadly it died a short time later, making JCrsquos recovery all the more remarkable..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"McKinstry is on the mark at Jimmy’s 10  ","story":"THE Beast from the East was well and truly caged this year as the day dawned bright and sunny, although with a noticeable frosty nip to awaken unsuspecting toes and fingers of the small army of East Down clubmen and their cons which descended on the sleeping streets of the county town on Jimmyrsquos Ten Sunday.Their mission was to display the necessary Kilometre markers and warning signs around the soon to be crowded route.Time was of the essence as upwards of , runners and walkers had signed up for the biggest participation sporting event in the district and with the start brought forward to am, to facilitate the festival paradersquos new start time of pm, it was going to be a tight run affair to have all in place before the runners took over.But, as ever, the super team managed it with a bit to spare.It should be pointed out that at am the pathway at the Quoile was water free.

There will also be a dedicated parking area for coaches.Original plans for the new hotel described finishing the exterior of the building in stone slate, with the accommodation centred around a landscaped courtyard.

He could be shot dead.”He also claimed to have given McLoughlin’s name to two detectives while in HMP Winson Green just days after the bombings, but heard nothing more.Counsel to the coroner Peter Skelton asked: “Was it the OC of Birmingham who would take decisions about which places to target for the bombs “Yes,” Witness O replied.All the men have been named before in connection with the bombings, but never in a formal setting.Mr Reilly and Mr Hayes have always denied any involvement in the blasts, though Mr Hayes has said he took “collective responsibility” for all IRA attacks in England, including the pub bombings.Six men, known as the Birmingham Six, were jailed in  for the double bomb attacks, but their convictions were quashed by the Court of Appeal in .Their case remains one of the most infamous miscarriages of justice in English legal history.An shocked UUP Justice Spokesman, Doug Beattie, said that the events confirmed that the IRA is still active.“This is staggering,” he said. “Not only are the IRA still active and giving orders but such is their confidence that they have a deal with the UK Govt they are happy to name names.”Mr Beattie called on the PSNI, Garda and West Midlands Police to examine claims made by a witness at the inquest into the  Birmingham pub bombings.“The evidence from ‘Witness O’ was very interesting on a number of fronts,” he said.“Firstly, he said that the ‘head of the IRA’ in Dublin has given him permission to name names.“Given that numerous Sinn Fein politicians have claimed that there is no IRA, you wonder just who is in sitting Dublin, claiming to be the head of it  Bobby Storey said it had become a butterfly and flown away. So who exactly is at the head of what some claim is a ‘non-existent’ organisation “The PSNI and the Garda need to give an assessment of this claim as a matter of urgency.“Secondly,any of these people named are still alive - and I understand at least one is - then they are liable to prosecution. If Soldier F can be lined up for prosecution for alleged offences in Londonderry in  then so can alleged IRA members for alleged offences in Birmingham in . That’s what is meant by equality before the law.”DUP MP Jeffrey Donaldson also called for evidence given by ‘Witness O’ to be pursued by police.He noted that yesterday, former IRA member Kieran Conway stated that the attacks were “not sanctioned” by the IRA but that the deaths were not murder because they were “an IRA operation that went badly wrong”.Commenting on the evidence the Lagan Valley MP said: “One of the iniduals named today has previously admitted involvement in the Birmingham pub bombings. This further evidence demands a proper police investigation into his involvement in the murder of  people.“Questions were previously raised as to whether this person was in receipt of an On The Run letter. Those letters are no barrier to prosecution. He was reported as living in Dublin. There is a clear challenge for the authorities in the Republic of Ireland whether they are prepared to pursue justice for the victims of republican terrorism with the same vigour as they demand the pursuit of those who were acting on behalf of the state in Northern Ireland.”Mr Donaldson also said that evidence given to the inquest posed major questions for Sinn Fein.“There are two very clear questions which Mary Lou McDonald and the Sinn Fein leadership need to answer.“The PSNI have previously indicated that the IRA exists but is not involved in paramilitary activity. That stands in stark contrast to the assertions of Sinn Fein. Mary Lou McDonald needs to explain how the head of the IRA in Dublin can give “permission” for an inidual to be named, when she tells us the IRA doesn’t exist.“Secondly, does Sinn Fein agree with the assessment of Kieran Conway that the Birmingham pub bombings were not murder simply because the IRA were involved. Sinn Fein were very quick to jump on comments made by the Secretary of State that were later claried.“Mary Lou McDonald should step forward and state clearly whether she believes the actions of the IRA in Birmingham and where were criminal.”try catch  TrendingGreenvale Hotel owner Michael McElhatton: Police have blackened my name over  drugs claimHotel owner arrested over St Patricks Day disco

That being the case, this council, like many others in Wales, is unable to continue to provide the level of subsidy to outdoor sports provision that it has in the past.ldquoExploring dferent ways of working, including the transfer of responsibilities in appropriate circumstances to community groups is a key element of the councilrsquos strategy moving forward as it addresses dficult budget priorities.ldquoFollowing the successful transfer of responsibilities for five libraries to community-based organisations and looking at a number of successful sports clubs across the Vale of Glamorgan who operate without any subsidy from the Council, it is hoped that the majority of clubs currently using council facilities will be able to continue to provide opportunities for all to participate in sports activities. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The event ran from Saturday March  to Tuesday March .The Vale brewery Tomos and Lilford produced a special beer called ldquoCarnival - Penarth Pale Ale.Meanwhile the two Penarth butchers, Thompson Family Butchers and David Lush Butchers, both created their own special Penarth carnival sausages.The organisers estimated that more than  people took part in costume in the walk through town on Saturday, which saw the coronation of the lsquoFirst Foolrsquo at am. The procession marched from Sully Terrace through town.At .am in Penarth Library, there was a presentation of the head of Bendigeidfran, from The Mabinogion. The head was made by children from Cogan and Penygarth schools.The lsquoFirst Foolrsquo was then sent by train to the Tower of London to bring news of the Carnival to the traditional resting place of the head of Bendigeidfran, where he met the Raven Master.Long distance cyclist Dave Hann was due to cycle to Harlech, north Wales to raise money for the RNLI Penarth, and bring news to Harlech that Carnival had broken out in Penarth.Unfortunately Mr Hann only got as far as Cardigan before Storm Freya made it too dangerous to continue. Organisers have one barrel of carnival ale left and will take it to Harlech by train in the next few weeks to share it and the storybook of the carnival.On Sunday, two rugby teams took part in a ldquotug-o-sausage to decide which butcherrsquos sausage was better. Congratulations were extended to the winners, Team Thompson.Congratulations were also extended to the traders Ener-chi and Lilypad by the organisers, for having the best-dressed shop windows. Particular praise was singled out for the carnival flowers at Holm House Hotel created by Lilypad.Further nights of partying, songs and dancing were spotted in the Albion, St Faganrsquos Castle, and other pubs, bars and venues across Penarth. There were also celebrations on the Penarth Pier on Tuesday night following a Pancake Day event, while wandering bands of musicians like Wonderbrass kept spirits high.The festival culminated in a grand Mardis Gras party on Tuesday, which saw crowds of costumed residents dance the night away.Richard Parry, one of the carnival organisers, said: ldquoToday is Ash Wednesday, the beginning of Lent. Carnival finished last night on Mardi Gras.ldquoThanks to everyone who took part, contributed, encouraged, sponsored, smiled and partied, especially those people who took a carnival Bank Holiday Monday.ldquoIt was fabulous to hear your Carnival Bank Holiday stories, and to all those people who have had little private carnival moments of joy over the festival, thatrsquos what it has all been about.ldquoAnd some people have already said, lsquosee you next year!rsquoldquoThere were lots of people laughing and smiling on the sidelines, telling me they wanted to take part next year ndash just with a little more notice next time. But now itrsquos established, wersquoll be back next year and ready for even more people to join in the fun! article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Wersquore creating work which is not really necessary.If we want to improve the gateway there are other ways of doing it.ldquoIt really doesnrsquot begin to tackle the active travel . I do feel this is about spending the money before next February.Councillors were told the widened roundabout was one part of a wider strategy for transport improvements in Penarth.Charlotte Pugh, senior planner for the council, said the new scheme would transform the area.She said: ldquoThis whole are is going to be completely transformed. At the moment it is not very welcoming to pedestrians.ldquoI think it will go some way to transforming this gateway into Penarth and make it a safer environment.Previous plans to make part of Plassey Street one-way to incoming traffic, and removing the roundabout altogether, were dropped following opposition from the public.The committee agreed to endorse the transport scheme but requested regular updates on the wider transport plans for Penarth. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This fantastic choir is run by The Aloud Charity, which is based here in the constituency, and is doing incredible work all around Wales, involving young people in music and teamwork and giving them the confidence to not only succeed in music but in their lives more generally.It was a real honour to host them in Parliament, where they sang for the Speaker, for MPs, and during the St Davidrsquos Day Service in the Chapel, before heading to the Public Gallery of the Commons to watch the St Davidrsquos Day debate.This annual debate is an important one for Wales, allowing MPs to talk about all sorts of issues. I spoke about transport and train services ndash a long running campaign of mine as you will know.I then spoke in the crucial debate on climate change. Believe it or not, itrsquos been far too long since wersquove had a debate on this issue in Parliament, and I spoke about the importance of our investments and pensions going into renewable sources, not into fossil fuels.I also pointed out my support for the young people across the UK who went on a climate strike the week before. Itrsquos their futures that wersquore concerned about here and they were absolutely right to do what they did.And then of course the Brexit shambles continues ndash we cannot escape it ndash but we were debating it again last week, with hugely important votes to come next week.But last week was a signicant one. The PM was forced into a corner, forced to concede that she might have to rule out No Deal and extend Article , and the Labour Party came out decisively for putting this issue back to the people.And this week we saw the Government attempt to win over MPs with a fund it claims will boost less well-off towns after Brexit ndash but in another shambolic aspect to this hapless attempt to bribe MPs into voting for Theresa Mayrsquos so-called deal, there is no cash for Welsh towns.Another example of the Tories letting Wales down, and yet further reason to support the push for a final say on Brexit for the public through a Peoplersquos Vote. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Last month I met with constituents over disruption to local rail services. I know that many of you will have experienced delays and cancellations to services in the weeks following the handover of the Wales Rail Franchise. I understand and share the frustration that these delays have caused. There has been a shortage of rolling stock as a result of a large maintenance backlog following the handover of the franchise together with planned changes to rail services. This has led to a signicant reduction in services and replacement bus services. I have been in contact with the Minister for Transport and Transport for Wales to raise the concerns of constituents. I have been assured that service levels are now back to normal and they do not anticipate any restrictions to services in the coming year. I will of course maintain my interest to see that those assurances are kept. I will update residents again on future plans to deliver improved station facilities, trains and more regular services.As many of you are aware Cardf Bus has recently announced changes to bus services across Cardf and the Vale. A number of bus routes are at risk as part of these changes. The removal of bus links for work, social links and public services, including hospital routes, would have a signicant impact on my constituents.Cardf Bus are not acting to deliberately hurt our communities. Far from being an uncaring organisation Cardf Bus are stuck with a legal framework that stops them from operating on the same basis as commercial competitors. Competitors can cherry pick and target single profitable routes that undermine the wider social propose that most of us want from local bus services. Cardf Councilrsquos Labour leadership has committed to supporting at risk bus services for  years. Unless the Conservative leadership of the Vale Council agrees to Labour councillors amendments to the budget and protects local bus services in the Vale then bus routes will go. The Vale Council leadership could and should act. If they donrsquot then my constituents will suffer.In future, the regulation of buses is the answer. London was the only part of the UK that was allowed to keep a regulated bus service. It is no mistake that it has the best and most coherent service. We now have the legislative powers to regulate bus services here in Wales. The Welsh Government is currently consulting on proposals to reform bus and taxi services in Wales. More information on the consultation can be found at: https:beta.gov.wales improving-public-transport. The consultation closes on th March ndash please do get in touch and take part. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

More than  dferent nationalities take the opportunity to board in the area.Westbourne are rightly proud of this international aspect.ldquoEveryone here mixes in together, said Marie de Tito Mount, the schoolrsquos director of marketing. ldquoWe have children studying from Russia, China, the US, Poland, India, and theyrsquore all friends.ldquoTherersquos no cliques or groups, and wersquore proud of the international aspect this is giving our children.ldquoWe feel like wersquore making them citizens of the world.Ranked st in Wales by The Sunday Times Schools Guide and st in the UK by The DailyLeague Tables,  per cent of Westbourne graduates go to Russell Group universities or equivalently elite international institutions.The school points to two factors for this ndash the small number of pupils, and the highly trained staff.With a class size of just eight students per teacher on average, every student gets full and unided attention.The children clearly thrive from this, building confidence and passion for their work.In reception, there was a palpable excitement to show off their handmade vegetable dolls.A Year Five jumped at the chance to read out her ndash impressively well-written ndash poem.In the senior school, a young man attacked a maths problem on a board with gusto. He was animated and passionate, and had clearly forged a close bond with his teacher.The head of Westbourne Prep School, Joanne Chinnock, said: ldquoOur school is a happy place, and wersquove long held the philosophy happy children learn well.       ,params: .pushldquoOur lsquosecretrsquo is the very close bond between the children, from Nursery and Reception classes all the way to the top of the school and the staff, who know each child very well indeed.There are a huge number of after school clubs on offer. Children have the opportunity to learn a wide range of instruments, including the harp, trumpet, piano, violin, drums, guitar and organ.A large set of sports clubs stake full advantage of the the Welsh coast, with frequent use of Penarth Pier, the beach and natural beauty spot Cosmeston Lakes. Sports on offer include swimming, yoga, basketball, touch rugby, dodge ball, gymnastics, cross country, and football.There are even more opportunities to excel in other areas, with offerings including Young Journalists, Nature Club, Art Club, Chess and ldquoMad Science.Westbourne offers the InternationalDiploma Programme in sixth form and GCSEs and IGCSEs for its secondary pupils.Their IB average is - points, high enough to qualy for Oxford University, with two-thirds of all Higher Level grades being s and s, and two-thirds of students receiving a Bilingual Diploma.The GCSE results are equally impressive with  per cent of all grades being s and s per cent the new, harder, grade  and a further  per cent grade s. This is up to five times the UK average.The academic rigour extends to the staff too. More than  per cent of teachers at Westbourne have a PhD or masters and more than  per cent have taught internationally.Westbourne School has cultivated a warm and highly supportive culture one in which students and teachers truly support each other.For more information, visit:https:www.westbourneschool Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He served as Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Wales Office from January to July .Before entering politics he worked as a rural auctioneer, an estate agent and also managed a mixed veterinary practice in Hay-on-Wye.A Welsh Liberal Democrat spokesman said Davies should resign.He said: ldquoRepresenting his constituents in these circumstances is untenable.ldquoBrecon and Radnorshire deserves better from its MP.ldquoChris Davies should do the honourable thing and immediately resign.Labour Party chairman Ian Lavery, MP for Northumberland, also called on Davies to quit.He said: ldquoTrust in politics and politicians is essential to our democracy.ldquoChris Davies cannot remain a Tory MP after admitting to this offence.A Conservative Party spokesman said:ldquoAs this is an ongoing legal matter, we will not be commenting..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: Tory MP admits submitting  expense invoices article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"Comments are closed on this article. -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The Department of the Economy’s Strategic Energy Framework, which was endorsed by the Executive in , has over the last nine years, led to some very positive changes to the energy generation and supply mix, particularly from renewable sources.However the  year framework is nearing its end and needs to be replaced. The Department is making such preparations as it can on a draft Strategic Energy Framework across the areas of heat, electricity, transport and energy efficiency which it aims to make public some time in the spring. Whether or not this region has its Assembly back to adopt such a framework will remain to be seen, but in the meantime it will ensure the subject remains live and high on the agenda.Brexit and I-SEMThe new wholesale electricity market known as the Integrated Single Electricity Marketwent live on October , . It is designed to deliver increased levels of competition which, it is hoped, will help put downward pressure on prices as well as encouraging greater levels of security of supply and transparency. While the island of Ireland is now integrated more closely with European markets, there is a risk that Brexit could halt this integration. British and Irish business groups and energy trade associations such as the CBI, IBEC, Electricity Association of Ireland, RenewableUK, British Irish Chamber of Commerce and EnergyUK all refer to the delivery of I-SEM, or to the UK’s continued access to the IEM, as post-Brexit priorities for security of supply and or consumer protection. I-SEM is clearly a priority that must be preserved.While Brexit may present challenges and continuing uncertainty, there are certainly opportunities for investment and acquisition in the electricity market as more complex, specialist expertise will be required to effectively trade power on the I-SEM. Policy barriers or inaction cannot be allowed to prevent I-SEM from realising its potential of fully integrating the market by efficiently moving energy from producer to demand.Renewable incentive schemesDespite being on track to hit its target of % of electricity generation from renewables, Northern Ireland risks being left behind. The lack of a replacement for the development support mechanism, Renewables Obligations Certicateafter its closure in April , means Northern Ireland is lagging behind Great Britain which has established the Contract for Dference regime and Ireland, which has started work on its Renewable Electricity Support Scheme . While neither scheme is perfect, doing nothing is not an option. The devolution of energy presented Northern Ireland with the opportunity to shape its own policy but without a government, will the sector and the infrastructure be able to remain fit for purpose GasWith its development over the last  years, the gas network in Northern Ireland, with its low population density, must be seen as a success story. Consumers and businesses have been offered greater choice in terms of price and security of supply. Nevertheless there are certainly further opportunities for gas distributors and suppliers to expand the natural gas network, particularly in the west of the country and east Co Down. So despite the apparent obstacles and challenges, there is opportunity for development and progress in Northern Ireland’s energy sector. The benefits for Northern Ireland will be in terms of security of supply, price and environmental sustainability. Cleaver Fulton Rankin,  Bedford Street, Belfast BT FW.

Since I took on the Northern Ireland role six years ago, we’ve doubled the workforce, become the fastest-growing UK region and are now the biggest office outside London with just over , people,” he says. “Our strategy was to be the leading provider of professional services in the Northern Ireland market but there’s no way we’d be the size we are now had we only focused on that.”Instead Paul built on the legacy of his predecessors and accelerated growth in new, technology solutions, while retaining the traditional accounting, tax and consulting services. Today PwC remains the leading provider of advisory services to the region’s family-owned and owner-managed businesses and multinationals, but has also built an impressive portfolio of cutting-edge technologies, opened the door to signicant export markets and is tackling some of society’s most challenging issues. “We’ve grown in many new areas – blockchain, cyber, cloud-based accounting services – but the single biggest impact has come from developing our distinctive ‘Operate’ ision,” Paul says. ”Operate is our service delivery business, which supports and delivers technology and people solutions to large, often regulated organisations. So instead of just advising clients how to solve their problems, we now do the heavy lting for them.”Run by Ian McConnell, a partner who’s been with the firm for  years, Operate is already attracting global attention. “Clients increasingly don’t want a consulting firm just to tell them what to do: they want a problem-solving partnership.” he says. “In its first year of operation, Operate earned over £m, now has , people and is still growing.”Reinforcing Paul’s confidence to invest in Northern Ireland as a strategic location is a  forecast from TheCityUK that it could become the second fastest-growing financial services region outside London by , helping deliver £bn of additional gross value-addedto the UK economy. But that depends on the ability to recruit the right talent, and he says the challenge now is finding and retaining the skills.That’s an issue that particularly concerns Paul as he looks ahead at the economic picture with Brexit and lack of an Assembly to the fore.“The business community wants clarity and certainty. Ideally we want to see a Brexit withdrawal agreement that then gives the scope for a trade deal that offers Northern Ireland the capacity to trade both with the EU and as part of the UK. The potential competitive advantages and ability to attract investment would be terric and the kind of economic accelerator which we have sought for years, but never managed to gain.“However I do worry about the impact of political stalemate on our long term future. Failure to invest, particularly in education and skills, will impair our competitiveness and make this a less attractive place for business.The decreasing effectiveness of health, environment and infrastructure will mean that talented people will opt to make choices to live their lives where.“In my national role, I see other parts of the country fusing partnerships in innovative and exciting ways between business,education and government. Compared to that, we are already getting left behind. We should be moving forward.”Which brings us to Merchant Square, the £m, , sq ft office development which PwC takes over in . “We have great people and one reason why we’re moving to the city centre is because that’s where they want to be. By the time we’re ready to relocate towards the end of , we will have at least , people moving in to the heart of Belfast.“That makes it important for Belfast too and not just because it’s the city’s biggest-ever private sector office deal. As we were making our decision, the whole Bank Buildings issue was at its height, and we wanted to show our support for the city and its future.” The Merchant Square relocation project is led by Kieragh Nelson, a director who joined the firm in . “We’ve got serious ambitions for Merchant Square,” she says. ”There’s a sense of ‘OK, we’ve just opened flagship offices in London, and Manchester – what more can we do in Belfast how can we make it even better ’ And the vast majority of decisions on how it will look, feel and work are made by the team here. Our goal is to create the most technologically-advanced, innovative and collaborative space for ourselves, our clients, and also for the communities around us.”Doing the right thing is a maxim often repeated in PwC, but it gets backed up. On the morning of our interview, a large group of people from the firm, including Paul, took part in one of their regular ‘Darkness Into Light’ walks to raise awareness of mental health. The firm’s commitment to social mobility has seen a number of employment programmes launched, notably the UK’s first technology degree apprenticeships, with Queen’s University one of five universities selected to run the programme. And it’s expanding its Hive Academy programme, which delivers free technology education to primary and secondary schools, to the Channel Islands.This year the firm challenged itself and created a unique charity partnership – the PwC Challenge – to create innovative suicide prevention programmes.“Our purpose is to build trust in society and solve important problems, and it really does feature in how we look at what we do. We strive to celebrate and share our knowledge widely and unselfishly with our people and communities and not be afraid to take a stand and do the right thing. And we put it at the heart of what we do every day. “Take the PwC Challenge: more people in Northern Ireland have died by suicide since the signing of the Good Friday Agreement than from the violence in the years before. This is a crisis, and it’s one which affects our people, and our communities. So we asked local charities in north and west Belfast, the worst affected areas in the UK, to collaborate and devise really innovative approaches programmes to give opportunities to young people and their families through education, technology, sports, and mental health coaching.“As well as the clubs in PwC which fundraise every year for the challenge, our own people are volunteering every week in ious projects – particularly with our Hive Academy. We want to ensure that people, who are high achievers in many dferent fields, are supported to play their fullest part in society.” For Paul, it’s all about the people. Last year PwC invested around £m on staff development here, and this year, a number of people have begun the first Masters in Operation service delivery, run by Ulster University. “It’s important to support people to develop their careers in ways they mightn’t have considered when they joined. That’s a key building block of our purpose – it drives social mobility, equality and ersity.“It’s true thatsomeone decides they want to head off and join PwC Australia or New York, they can. That’s the beauty of working for a global firm – those opportunities are there. But what I really want to make sure is that you don’t have to leave:you want to live and work in Belfast, and have global clients, work with cutting-edge technology and be part of a firm that’s engaged in society, you can do that too.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/eopen_1.jpg","title":"the open its the biggest thing since sliced bread","story":"Posted on Wednesday March  by Ulster Business With just  weeks until Northern Ireland hosts the biggest sporting event in its history, John Mulgrew speaks to the bosses tasked with organising the legendary Open Championship We’ve come a long way in just a short few years. Despite its huge golfing credentials, especially in the modern game, it had been more than  years since Northern Ireland played host to the Irish Open.That all changed in , when it ed north to Royal Portrush. And that, buoyed on a refreshed and renewed interest in both the tournament, and the sport itself.Now, in  weeks, that same links course will see more than , people flock to arguably the world’s greatest golf tournament and the largest sporting event ever hosted on these shores – The Open – transforming a small Co Antrim town for a handful of summer days.“There is a buzz with everyone at the RA,” Johnnie Cole-Hamilton tells Ulster Business. He’s executive director of championships at the RA – the ruling authority of golf throughout the world, aside from areas such as the US, and organisation responsible for organising The Open.“This will be my th Open Championship, and one reason I continue to be involved is that it’s a challenge every time.”It will see Irish golfing greats, including Open winners Rory McIlroy and Darren Clarke, Graeme McDowelland Padraig Harrington – among others – join the biggest name in sport, Tiger Woods.“One of big drivers to ing to Royal Portrush was the success of the Northern Irish and Irish golfers. They have raised the profile of golf immeasurably. “We are absolutely delighted with the response so far – % of tickets sold in  hours, and sold out within a record-breaking eight weeks.”Johnnie says the decision to choose Portrush, bringing it back to the course after a  year hiatus, was the correct one – buoyed by the support from the community, agencies and organisations. The th Open will be held at Royal Portrush from July -.“In my career, we had a similar scenario, ing to Liverpool for the first time in  years, and we had a very similar response. It ed in , and now Royal Liverpool is firmly on the rota, and I hope that Royal Portrush is similar.”Of course, aside from the golf, both the short-term and long-term economic benefits will trickle down and benefit, not on the surrounding areas, but prop Northern Ireland up on yet another global .According to Tourism NI chief executive John McGrillen that longer-term benefit could be worth up to £m for the wider economy.“There will be , tickets sold for championship days, and % of those sold to people out of state, outside Northern Ireland,” he tells Ulster Business.“It allows us to present an extremely positive image for Northern Ireland, and into key markets across the globe. We will never have experienced the opportunity to provide such a positive image of Northern Ireland. Despite what we might think, there are perception issues.“Northern Ireland has a normalised society and some of the most dramatic golf courses, scenery and landscape to see.“More specically, the fact that the Open will have been here, as one of the world’s top golf courses, will drive up the amount of spend, especially from golf tourism.”That alone makes up around % of Northern Ireland’s tourism intake. John says he wants that to grow to £m by . He says golfing visitors spend around four times that of an average tourist.Johnnie says all signs so far suggest that the Open in Portrush is “going to be an enormous” success. But the process hasn’t come without its challenges – namely theIrish Sea.“This is the first Open Championship we have hosted in my time, in which we have a body of water between our base and our contractor base. There’s getting things across water, and an enormous amount of work on the golf course – new holes, a new road system around the course and a tunnel for the players from one of the new greens to tee. You can’t do that without support from the golf club“The members have been hugely supportive, turning the course upside down, but maintaining integrity and enhancing .”He said, along with the blue light services, local authorities, council and tourism groups, the community in and around Portrush “understands that this will bring great benefits” to the area and Northern Ireland as a whole. “You can overcome dficulties with support,” he says.“Royal Portrush has never had more than , people drive to it, or get the train to it, at the same time. It’s a challenge to make sure we deliver a wonderful Open Championship and a spectator experience.”John McGrillen says the triumph in landing the Open itself was down to the success of the Irish Open in the last few years. “You had more than , people turning out at Portrush… visitor numbers had been dwindling.“That allows us to demonstrate that the course can deal with that many people. Everyoneworked very well, collectively, and that gave confidence to the RA that we would have the capacity to deliver it. The risk factors they had were eliminated because of the success of the Irish Open, and that was very critical.”As for boosting many of the hundreds of businesses in and around the area, John said: “It will do, as it’s showing off Northern Ireland… we have seen a big boost in the number of Americans playing golf. We don’t have to wait until after the event. “The visibility the Irish Open has given us. We have Royal County Down, Royal Portrush and Portstewart – that’s increased signicantly. It’s not just those courses which are benefiting – it’s being spread. People will typically stay in Belfast and travel around.”For John, the best outcome is, of course, an Irish winner. Oh, and clear skies. “A local winner would be phenomenal. It would be fantastic to see Rory win, or Tiger Woods.“If Tiger Woods won the Open in Portrush, that would remain in peoples’ memories forever. While we would love Rory or other locals to win, I would not be disappointed in Tiger winning it.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/west.jpg","title":"major ni firms in eleventh hour westminster plea to avoid no deal brexit","story":"Posted on Friday March  by John Mulgrew More than  of Northern Ireland’s biggest businesses – employing tens of thousands of workers here – have written to MPs in an eleventh hour plea to avoid a ‘no deal’ Brexit.  As Theresa May is due to bring her withdrawal deal back to Parliament next week, with less than a month to go before the March  deadline, a letter from the CBI, signed by  firms, calls on MPs to unite behind a way forward that avoids a hard border and protects peace and economic progress in Northern Ireland.  It says that “local businesses believe that the failure to approve a deal with Europe on the UK’s withdrawal from the EU will have signicant repercussions for the local economy\". “Such a scenario will both hinder indigenous and foreign direct investment, it would result in signicant job losses and will stle opportunities for the next generation across Northern Ireland.  “We therefore urge MPs across the UK to consider the damaging impact on Northern Ireland’s economy and political stability in the event of a no-deal Brexit.  “The peace and economic progress that flowed from the Belfast  Good Friday Agreement cannot be overlooked at this critical time in the UK’s history. All Members of Parliament must consider the burden of responsibility that they now carry for this region’s future.” Those putting their names to the open letter include aerospace giant Bombardier, which employs around , staff here, Danske Bank and First Trust, along with agribusinesses such as Devenish Nutrition, Fane Valley and Linden Foods.

For some there will be little or no change to their daily lives after the UK leaves the EU. But for others, Brexit may have an impact on some aspects of their day-to-day lives. To provide as much practical information for people across Northern Ireland that is currently available, a Brexit section has been created on the nidirect website. Useful public information is being published on www.nidirect.gov.uk brexit on a regular basis. You may have also seen some of the digital advertisements across Northern Ireland or on your social media channels asking you to visit the nidirect website for the most up to date information. The nidirect Brexit section also points to information being published by the UK Government to give people as much information as possible. At this stage, it won’t answer every question that people will have. But it serves as a useful tool to get people to start thinking about what they may need to do dferently once the UK leaves the EU. Included in the www.nidirect.gov.uk brexit is a section on travelling, which includes the most up to date information for motorists. Depending on how the UK leaves the EU, motorists in Northern Ireland may need a Green Card to drive across the border. A Green Card is an international certicate of insurance issued by insurance providers in the UK, guaranteeing that the driver has the necessary third-party motor insurance cover for driving in the country being travelled to. In the event of a no deal Brexit, motorists in Northern Ireland travelling to the Republic of Ireland will need a Green Card as proof of insurance. There’s also the most up-to-date information from the Department of Health on prescriptions, medicines and medical supplies. The Department of Health has already said that there is enough medicines and medical products to meet current needs. Therefore people should not ask for longer prescriptions and should continue to follow their GP’s advice. Likewise, arrangements for the provision of specic cross border healthcare services made between the Department of Health in Northern Ireland and the Department of Health in Dublinshould not be affected by EU Exit as they are not based on EU legislation.
