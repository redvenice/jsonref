But in fairness, I wasn\u0027t alone.What strikes me now, in fact, is how consistently wrong our political and intellectual elites have been.Shocked and outraged by the 2016 referendum result, many self-consciously liberal, high-minded types insisted it must have been a fluke, even a freak.The vote was rigged, they said. It was a short-term reaction to austerity. It was a protest of those dubbed \u0027the left-behinds\u0027. It was a racist spasm, a terrifying lurch into xenophobia, a self-deluding effort to recapture a vanished empire.You probably don\u0027t need me to tell you what rubbish this was. And now, looking back at the past 50 years, I wonder whether Brexit was inevitable all along.When France and West Germany came together in the 1950s to set up the ancestor of today\u0027s EU, Britain wanted no part of it. There was no significant pro-European lobby in this country, and the idea of plunging into a Continental federal union struck most people, Labour and Tories alike, as fundamentally un-British.It was only after the shock of the Suez Crisis in 1956, and the rapid collapse of our empire in Africa and Asia, that political and business elites decided Britain needed to \u0027find a role\u0027.Put simply, they panicked, convincing themselves that unless we joined our neighbours\u0027 club, we would become a fading backwater, known only for making abysmal cars and going on strike.But while they may have convinced themselves, they never convinced the public. Polls in the 1960s consistently found that most people either disliked the thought of European membership or were completely indifferent to it.And when we did join under Ted Heath in 1973, the planned national celebrations were a very damp squib. Polls found that four out of ten people were still against it.Indeed, nothing captured the mood better than the shambolic \u0027celebrations\u0027 in Ivybridge, Devon, where the pro-European mayor organised a parade led by a teenager dressed as Britannia, and invited bewildered townsfolk to line the streets and wave European flags.As the odd-job man who put out flags along the route remarked, most people \u0027didn\u0027t know what they were doing. They didn\u0027t know what was going on. It was a big con-job\u0027.It\u0027s true, of course, that when Heath\u0027s successor Harold Wilson held a referendum two years later, people voted by two to one to stay in. But I think that result was an aberration, which has misled and blinded our political elite ever since.It took place at the nadir of our post-Suez crisis of confidence, with IRA bombs in London, politics in turmoil and inflation at almost 30 per cent. And even at the time, there was no real evidence of pro-European enthusiasm.Soon public opinion reverted to its natural scepticism. Indeed, when Margaret Thatcher became Prime Minister in 1979, polling data showed that at least half the electorate already wanted to leave.Mrs Thatcher didn\u0027t create popular Euroscepticism, in other words. She simply reflected it.Today you sometimes hear ultra-Remainers lamenting that things could have been different, and that if it hadn\u0027t been for the wicked witch of Grantham, the British people might have learned to become good little Europeans.I don\u0027t find that convincing at all.To turn ordinary Britons into good Europeans would have required a cultural revolution. Ordinary people would have had to forget Elizabeth defying the Armada, Nelson on the deck of the Victory, the little ships at Dunkirk, the heroes of the Battle of Britain, even things like Dad\u0027s Army and The Dam Busters.Patriotic myths? Perhaps. But what is any national story, if not a collection of deeply rooted and hugely emotive patriotic myths?Yet from Ted Heath to Tony Blair, too many national politicians consistently misunderstood their own country. They insisted that Britain was now part of a homogenised European story, but completely underestimated how attached ordinary people were to their old, patriotic one.They ignored polls showing that people were stubbornly resistant to the European project. Instead, they continued down the path towards ever-closer union. The only thing that changed was the speed of the journey, never the direction.But it speaks volumes about the weakness of the European project that when, in 2016, the long decades of argument came to the crunch, the Remainers had almost nothing positive to say.Set against the old story of a free, independent Britain, their cliches about world peace and continental brotherhood looked pious and flimsy, like the kind of thing an earnest headmaster trots out for his weekly school assembly.So instead they fell back on Project Fear, insisting on the dire economic consequences if we left the EU.In truth, that was probably their best card. It resonated with cautious, risk-averse people who were worried about the lack of a strategy for when we left.That\u0027s why I voted Remain — not because I have any fondness for Brussels or any great affection for the European project, but because I instinctively dislike the thought of change.But the fact that, after almost half a century, this was the Establishment\u0027s only card speaks volumes.For the fundamental truth, obscured by all the years of hysterical argument, is that a very large proportion of the British people have never seen themselves as European and have never been reconciled to the European project.So where does all this leave us? Is Britain back in the 1960s, reeling from the loss of empire, confused and alone in an increasingly competitive world, a sadly deluded has-been riding for a fall?I don\u0027t think so. The 50-year experiment with European unity may have proved a red herring, but there is little doubt we are much better placed to thrive in the world than we were before 1973.We are more confident, more creative and more dynamic.In London we have the greatest city on earth. In science and technology, as well as music and entertainment, we are genuine world leaders. There is no reason, in other words, why we shouldn\u0027t flourish after Brexit.And although I didn\u0027t vote for it, I\u0027m not sorry we are out.There is something invigorating about standing on your own two feet, rather than huddling in a group for protection. I like the thought that our children and grandchildren will grow up in a proudly independent country, making its own way in the world.I won\u0027t miss the European Parliament, the ultimate pointless talking-shop. I won\u0027t miss Brussels and Strasbourg with their unaudited accounts, their sclerosis and stagnation. And I definitely won\u0027t miss that wretched European flag.For the first time in half a century, we\u0027re on our own. Yes, there will be challenges ahead, as there always are when you set out on a great adventure.But if we make it work, as I believe we will, then history will reward us.And one day, when our successors look back, the real mystery will be that we ever doubted ourselves."},{"url":null,"title":"Nebraska teacher left tears students chip 100 buy Nike sneakers","story":"Share this article On TikTok, the video has been viewed more than a million times.

Of these, there were eight institutions where more than 50 per cent of offers were of this type.

It has been plagued by compromises since architect Jørn Utzon’s walkout in 1966Significant buildings generate their own mythology. For the Sydney Opera House, the story that the Unesco world heritage-listed design was fished out of a rejection pile before being declared a work of genius is a pleasing fable, despite its dubious origins.What is not in dispute is that the clashes that plagued the Opera House’s origins have reverberated – not always pleasingly – down the decades. The ambition of the Danish architect Jørn Utzon’s design, his walkout mid-project, and Peter Hall’s subsequent takeover in 1966 resulted in compromises that have bedevilled the building ever since.Now, as part of a five-year program in which the Opera House has been progressively upgrading its core infrastructure, construction is about to begin on a $150m revamp of its largest performance space, the 2,500-seat concert hall, designed to remedy the shortcomings born of the project’s messy origins.The irony of the Sydney Opera House is that it has become an international cultural landmark for the way it looks, rather than for being “the best opera house that can be built”, as the New South Wales premier Joe Cahill hoped when he launched the design competition in 1954.It is very far from the best in the eyes, and ears, of some who have experienced it at close quarters. The actor John Malkovich once said the acoustics in the concert hall “would do an aeroplane hangar a disservice”. Members of the resident Sydney Symphony Orchestra have long complained that they cannot hear their fellow musicians on stage. And the rise of the rock concert has further challenged the venue, with amplified music and electronic sets being precisely the opposite of what the hall’s infrastructure was built to accommodate.That concept was thrown out midway through construction – after Utzon’s enraged departure – and the objectives of the building’s two main venues were switched. Operas and plays were moved to the smaller Joan Sutherland theatre, where rigging was installed to support theatrical performances, and the concert hall was decked out for classical music instead, the justification being that symphonies would be more popular.But, at 45 metres, the concert hall is at least 10 metres longer than most acoustic-oriented spaces, and double the optimum height. As a consequence, much effort has gone into compensating for its cavernous proportions, including wood-panelled walls to aid reverberation, and fibreglass acoustic reflectors hung from the roof to create a sonic ceiling.But in the years since it was built interest in symphonies has been challenged by the ubiquity of pop, hip-hop and rock. While rock bands – including Massive Attack and the National – are often set up in the outdoor forecourt, acts including Lizzo, Interpol, Nick Cave, Iggy Pop, the Wu-Tang Clan, José González and Hot Chip have played the concert hall.They take some wrangling.“The shows that we currently put in there were never in the initial scope for the hall,” says Andrew Mackonis, Sydney Opera House’s production manager. He leads a team of nine.“Essentially it’s designed to be a big echo chamber, and that’s the opposite of what you want when you’re doing an amplified event,” he says. “You want the space to be as dead as possible. You have these two diametrically opposed ideals.”The space has had multiple smaller upgrades along the way to help it cope, including a high-quality PA system being installed and heavy drapery created to hang over the wood panelling. But the process of getting the hall ready for an amplified show is cumbersome – the drapes alone take hours to install – and the PA system is long past its prime.The other problem is weight. Contemporary musicians, especially dance acts, will often tour with complicated sets – big LED walls and lots of light production, in addition to their sound requirements. That all has to hang off the roof – which at the moment can only support 10 tonnes.“You could say we are the masters of the compromise,” Mackonis says. “Between budget, safety, timeline and the artistic values of the show that we’re putting in there, we are the ones who have to find the compromise.”He hopes the increased weight capacity of the roof – up to 38 tonnes when completed – will mean compromising fewer artistic visions, and that the new automatic drape system will cut down on pre-show manual labour.But that’s not all. The stage, which is now flat and fixed in height, obscuring the view from the stalls in favour of the boxes, will be put on multiple hydraulics. This will allow it to be elevated in sections, to give it the traditional orchestral horseshoe shape – helping the musicians to hear one another – or raised or lowered entirely if required. The boxes will be reoriented to reduce competition with the sightlines from the stalls, and more accessible seating and passageways will be installed.In measures aimed at further improving sound for classical performances, the fibreglass acoustic reflectors on the roof will be upgraded, and new wood panelling with a rippled surface will replace the flat timber walls, to give what Herron calls “a softer, more surrounding sound – a truer sound”.The singer Solange will perform the last concerts in the space this year on 31 January, though her health has reportedly reduced what was originally a four-night residency to two. Once the show is bumped out, the concert hall and sections of the viewing deck will be boarded up for a full two years while the work takes place.While some sections of the community may balk at the idea of a heritage venue hosting hip-hop artists and electronic dance acts – especially given the scale of the works required to accommodate them – Herron is firm about the necessity of the Opera House moving with the times.“The Opera House belongs to everyone,” she says. “The Opera House needs to cater to all of the community, not just certain sections of the community.”“We need to not only maintain our fabulous heritage but we need to be as prepared as we possibly can be for the next 50 years. What is it that audiences of now and the future are going to want and how can we best prepare the Concert Hall for that? That’s been the driving force behind our approach.”Herron says she expects the Opera House to take a $20m hit to its revenue during the concert hall’s closure, but believes that – as when its smaller venue, the Joan Sutherland theatre, closed for eight months for renewal works in 2017 – audiences will ultimately reap the rewards.“The Sydney Symphony Orchestra has wanted the concert hall acoustics to be improved since it opened,” she says. “You could say it’s a project that’s been in the works for 47 years.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/08099cdbf03cb1f27a8cf0226d2123b958d0cf46/0_65_3024_1814/master/3024.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c4bc6646050f46483ca32b76e2f4f024","title":"american dirt jeanine cummins tour canceled","story":"The book gained praise before its release, but was panned by Mexican American writers for its stereotypical depictions The publisher of Jeanine Cummins’ controversial novel American Dirt has cancelled the remainder of her promotional tour, citing concerns for her safety.The novel about a Mexican mother and her young son fleeing to the US border had been praised widely before its 21 January release and was chosen by Oprah Winfrey for her book club. But Mexican American writers have been among those criticizing American Dirt for stereotypical depictions of Mexicans and the large profit she stands to make from the story. Cummins is of Irish and Puerto Rican background.“Jeanine Cummins spent five years of her life writing this book with the intent to shine a spotlight on tragedies facing immigrants,” said Bob Miller, president and publisher of Flatiron Books, in a statement on Wednesday. “We are saddened that a work of fiction that was well-intentioned has led to such vitriolic rancor.”“Unfortunately, our concerns about safety have led us to the difficult decision to cancel the book tour.”American Dirt, Cummins’ third novel, had been met with massive pre-publication praise and had been selected for Oprah Winfrey’s book club. But, following its release, Cummins and Flatiron Books quickly drew fire for positioning the novel as a seminal book about Mexican immigrants. Julissa Arce Raya, the author of My (Underground) American Dream, argued American Dirt was not representative of her experience as an undocumented immigrant in America. Author Celeste Ng shared a review calling Cummins’ depictions of Mexico “laughably inaccurate”. Roxane Gray deplored Oprah’s decision to elevate the novel.“I hope this makes people realize how conservative publishing really is,” Myriam Gurba, a Mexican American writer, told the .Amid the controversy, Flatiron Books and Headline, the book’s British publisher, kept up support for the author. On Wednesday, Miller did appear to recognize missteps by the company in a statement. “We should never have claimed that it was a novel that defined the migrant experience we should not have said that Jeanine’s husband was an undocumented immigrant while not specifying that he was from Ireland we should not have had a centerpiece at our bookseller dinner last May that replicated the book jacket so tastelessly. We can now see how insensitive those and other decisions were, and we regret them,” he wrote.Cummins spoke about the doubts she had about writing the book at a 22 January event in Baltimore. “I lived in fear of this moment, of being called to account for myself: ‘Who do you think you are?’” she told bookshop manager Javier Ramirez. “And, in the end, the people who I met along the way, the migrants who I spoke to, the people who have put themselves in harm’s way to protect vulnerable people, they showed me what real courage looks like. They made me recognize my own cowardice. When people are really putting their lives on the line, to be afraid of writing a book felt like cowardice.”About the seven-figure advance she reportedly earned, she said: “I was never going to turn down money that someone offered me for something that took me seven years to write. I acknowledge that there is tremendous inequity in the industry, about who gets attention for writing what books.”Cummins had made a handful of promotional appearances since the book was released, but over the past few days the St Louis-based Left Bank Books had called off an event and Flatiron had cancelled interviews in a pair of California stores. The tour for her heavily promoted book had been scheduled to last at least through mid-February, with planned stops everywhere from Seattle to Oxford, Mississippi.Flatiron now plans to send Cummins to town-hall style events, where the author will be joined by “some of the groups who have raised objections to the book”.And on Tuesday, Oprah announced she’ll meet with Cummins and their conversation will be broadcast in an upcoming Apple TV special. “Now, it has become clear to me from the outpouring of, may I say, of very passionate opinions that this selection has struck an emotional chord and created a need for a deeper, more substantive discussion,” Winfrey said.Flatiron Books did not immediately respond to the ’s request for comment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b9d5e0acbe9a8d9e42fb37f0b03e81f5aca8e848/1205_714_5054_3033/master/5054.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8e6078b965437bcc1735d73527345f48","title":"costa winner auschwitz book witold pilecki jack fairweather the volunteer","story":"Jack Fairweather reveals the extraordinary story behind The Volunteer, his book about a Polish resistance hero who infiltrated the Nazi death campOne spring day in 1948, two children were sitting at their school desks in Poland when the tannoy crackled into life to announce that their father had just been executed as an enemy of the state. Andrzej and Zofia Pilecki knew nothing about the mission that had taken their father away from them for most of their childhood. It was only when they were in their 60s, as the iron curtain fell, that the details of Witold Pilecki’s extraordinary second world war mission began to emerge.Then, in 2012, a British war correspondent who was looking for a new subject after covering wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, stumbled across the story. He discovered that Pilecki, a former cavalry officer, had become a leading member of the Polish resistance – and deliberately got himself interned in Auschwitz so that he could send intelligence to London. He survived that ordeal only to fall into the hands of the Soviet regime, who took possession of Poland in the postwar carve-up of Europe.Jack Fairweather was in his late 30s and the father of two young children when he began work on the book. When The Volunteer was crowned Costa book of the year this week, Fairweather paid an emotional tribute to Andrzej and Zofia, who were among hundreds of survivors who helped him piece together their father’s story.In undertaking the task, Fairweather knew he would have to honour Pilecki’s own insistence that “any falsehood would profane the memory of my fallen colleagues”. Every single word of the book is either from Pilecki’s own writing, from interviews Fairweather conducted, or from first-hand accounts by people who lived alongside Pilecki, drawn from the many thousands of testimonies held in the Auschwitz museum.Sitting in his publisher’s office the day after his win, Fairweather sums up the five years he spent on the book: “Years of always chasing your quarry and looking for a glimpse – for one of those very special moments when you suddenly see the full man. It can be a story detail or a snippet you find in the archive.”One such nugget popped up when he took Pilecki’s octogenarian nephew back to the Warsaw flat the nephew’s family had lived in when he was a toddler. The nephew was just three the night his uncle was taken away. He remembered that his teddy bear had just fallen out of his cot. Pilecki, writes Fairweather, “quickly picks up the bear and hands it to the boy and the mother lets the Germans in. ‘See you soon,’ he whispers to the child. Then, against every instinct he must have had, he steps into captivity.”The story must have become a family anecdote, Fairweather says. “For me, it really spoke of one of his great characteristics: at times of greatest stress, when you’d expect him to be thinking of himself, he was always able to reach out and engage with other people.” Part of the puzzle, adds the 41-year-old author, lay in working out what drove “this apparently ordinary man, with no great record of service, to expand his empathy, his moral capacity, to piece together the Nazis’ greatest crimes when others looked away”.Pilecki managed to get 10 reports smuggled out of the death camp during his two and a half years there, but they fell on deaf ears and were forgotten. Their significance only began to emerge in the early 90s, when Polish archives – sealed by the Soviets – were opened to Polish historians. But one important piece of the jigsaw was missing: the testimony Pilecki was known to have written during a spell in Italy after he escaped from Auschwitz by using a duplicate key made by a metalworker friend in the camp.“The goosebumps moment,” says Fairweather, “was when my researcher phoned me from the Polish Underground Study Trust in London saying it had been found.” The document – entrusted to a colleague when Pilecki made the fatal decision to return to his homeland under the Soviets – had been handed over to the Polish government in exile in the 60s, but had been kept secret for fear of reprisals against people it named. “There it was in his loopy blue handwriting,” says Fairweather, “still in a little beige folder.”One of the most poignant discoveries for Fairweather was that the second world war didn’t end in May 1945 for Poland and a lot of Europe. “For us, it was victory parades and celebrations. But for them, it marked the transition to the brutality of Stalin, when more than 80,000 people who had resisted the Nazis were arrested and tortured. Hundreds were shot and thousands more deported to the gulag.”Growing up in Wales, the eldest of four children born to teacher parents, Fairweather was steeped in a war history that made little mention of the Polish resistance. “We always think of the French,” he says, “but Polish intelligence was much bigger and more sophisticated.”Pilecki survived in the camp by using his underground contacts to wangle the relatively easy jobs of carpenter and hospital block handyman, though they did not shield him from witnessing Auschwitz’s horrors. “One day while scratching in the frozen earth for roots,” writes Fairweather, “he had the grim thought that they’d be better off if the British simply bombed the camp and brought an end to the suffering.” Pilecki developed this thought in one of his reports, reasoning that nobody would die in vain if Auschwitz was obliterated, because it would expose what was going on, while ending the “monstrous suffering”.Fairweather arrived at the book via an Oxford degree followed by a career as a war correspondent, which began when his tutor suggested him for a job at a Kolkata newspaper. While working there as a copy editor on the letters page, he took himself off to report on the 2002 terrorist attack on the US cultural centrein the city, selling it to the Daily  in the UK “for three months of my salary at the paper”. He was given a break as a stringer in Kuwait where, “by a bizarre coincidence”, a former schoolfriend of his mother’s turned out to be a member of the Kuwaiti royal family and head of the civil service. His first big scoop was an interview in which, contrary to official briefings, the Kuwaiti foreign minister said the country would be happy to be the launchpad for an attack on Iraq aimed at toppling Saddam Hussein.Stints in Afghanistan and Iraq followed, resulting in two books. He talks of “the heroism of ordinary people” – in particular, the Iraqi driver who, with Fairweather typing out the story of an attempted suicide bombing in the back seat, managed to outrun a Shia squad who had been sent to kidnap him. “We were bouncing all over the place for 45 minutes. I was saying, ‘Please drive more carefully. I’m trying to write a piece.” Only when they’d arrived back in Baghdad and he had filed his story did his driver tell him exactly what had been going on.It’s a great tale but, he says, it is nothing compared with what Pilecki lived through. “To be able to get this man’s story was the greatest honour of my career. My books about Iraq and Afghanistan were attempts to understand what I’d experienced. But in this case, I was trying to follow in the footsteps of this man – and be confronted by history as it confronted him.” He adds: “When we think of western war heroes, they give us solace and a story about our experience. But Poland wasn’t ever able to commemorate its heroes because for decades they were ‘enemies of the people’.”Fairweather – who now lives between London and Vermont with his American wife, the journalist Christina Asquith – is well aware that The Volunteer owes part of its power to the fact that Auschwitz is now passing out of living human memory. “I wanted to speak to as many people who had witnessed Pilecki in action – and many of the people I interviewed are now dead.”He pauses. “We’re living in a time of turmoil, with resurgent nationalism and rising antisemitism. That’s why Pilecki’s story is so important. I find it really inspiring. He immersed himself in the darkest moment of human history and somehow found the courage to rise above it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d9f76db75df69099889a3b4d13f6ab60afaf26ca/0_117_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ebbe079cfdb9fa37f9400d1200a47273","title":"africa coloniasation english language oxford dictionary nigerian","story":"The British empire forced its colonies to abandon their own languages. Now they are making English their ownThere is one expression I have grown up hearing from relatives of a certain age, but never been able to accept. It’s the description of Twi – the Akan language spoken by my family – as “the vernacular”, a term which implicitly compares it with the colonial language, English, and somehow finds it wanting. The word itself is a revealing symptom of the colonial project. Just as nations like the Yoruba, with a population of more than 40 million, were patronisingly described as “tribes”, when in fact they were substantial nations, African languages were downgraded to “the vernacular”. It’s a term more befitting of a regional dialect than a nation’s language, with its own history, politics and literature.The attempt to discourage Africans from speaking our own languages not only failed, but has had the glorious result of backfiring, to the extent that now Britain’s own inhabitants are officially adopting African vocab. This month the Oxford English Dictionary (OED) added Nigeria’s first entries to already recognised gems like “howzit” from South Africa. Other Africans will recognise lots of the latest lingo to get the OED stamp – “chop”, to eat or to misappropriate funds “next tomorrow”, the day after tomorrow “sef”, a great Pidgin flourish for emphasis.Nigerian pre-eminence in the English language is nothing new. One of the first global literary successes by a black author was The Interesting Narrative, by the Igbo writer Olaudah Equiano, the beautifully written 1789 account of his enslavement and subsequent freedom.English was imposed on Africans by force. “In Kenya, English became more than a language: it was the language, and all the others had to bow before it in deference,” wrote the great Kenyan novelist Ngũgĩ wa Thiong’o. In his seminal book Decolonising the Mind, he described children at his English-speaking school in Nairobi being beaten if they were caught speaking Gĩkũyũ.One of my favourite grievances with that colonial legacy, and the ongoing failure to give the descendants of empire equal status, came via the unlikely topic of weather systems. “Yo why storm Brendan?” wrote the doctor and TV presenter Dr Ronx earlier this month, “I’m out here waiting to be blown away by storm Oluwatunde! We need to decolonise storm names!” Why storms always have European names can be added to a growing list of questions: why don’t British schools teach the history of empire why does it have no national museum why do we glorify colonial violence as personified by figures like Cecil Rhodes why do we know the name of William Wilberforce but not Equiano, a key abolitionist as well as celebrated author?The great thing about language though, is that it waits for no one. While calls to decolonise curricula – and weather – seem likely to continue falling on deaf ears, culture moves on. Several years ago I wrote about how the situation of “the Queen’s English” in Ghana – once associated with superior education and intelligence – has become more perilous, with the potential to attract derision under the acronym LAFA – locally acquired foreign accent.The paradox of empire is perhaps most visible in its legacy of language. The psychology of colonisation could not have worked without suppressing expressions of existing culture, and “educating” its subjects to believe in their own inferiority. But the independence of the African continent in the 20th century could not have come about when it did without the unity that was forged out of common languages brought by colonisers – English, French and Portuguese. The resulting ambivalence towards English is shared not just on the African continent but in the diaspora as well. As the great African-American writer James Baldwin once wrote, “my quarrel with the English language has been that the language reflected none of my experience”. But, Baldwin conceded, “it might be made to bear the burden of my experience, if I could find the stamina to challenge it.”His words reflect a fatigue with the colonial story, which I often share. But at the same time, we always did find the stamina to challenge it, whether or not that was recognised by dictionaries."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/29f77d66d24a6e1f0470e59ae0bae1c5e999a588/0_0_4984_2991/master/4984.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2466c660510833a8138d18dd387a13a5","title":"brexit britain hard line immigration openness","story":"New proposals won’t mean restricting the numbers of people coming to the UK – just a new form of opennessBrexit will be “done” by 31 January, except little will change. What the Brexiteers have mistaken for a single moment will in reality be a lengthy and painful process. In most policy areas shaped by EU influence, post-Brexit changes will be slow and incremental. There is, however, one exception to this rule: immigration.After 1 January 2021, free movement will end and EU and non-EU citizens wishing to move to the UK will (unless they are Irish citizens) be treated the same. Despite this shake-up, it’s still unclear what Britain’s new immigration system will look like.When Boris Johnson and Priti Patel promised an “Australian-style points system” last year, their plans were largely vacuous. The Conservative government subsequently commissioned the independent Migration Advisory Committee (MAC) to advise on the shape that Britain’s future immigration system should take. Johnson and Patel probably didn’t expect the MAC’s outgoing chair, Professor Alan Manning, to dismiss talk of their Australian-style points system as, aptly, “pointless”. For good measure, the report also notes that the UK has far more to learn from Austria – where skilled migrants are generally required to have a job offer – than it does from Australia, where many are not.Whether or not the MAC recommendations are adopted in full, big changes are on the way. Theresa May’s 2018 white paper recommended a salary threshold of £30,000 for skilled migrants with a job offer. Businesses – in sectors such as fashion, technology and research, all of which employ EU nationals who, while far from unskilled, earn less than £30,000 – argued for a reduced threshold of £20,000 or £22,000. The MAC report has split the difference, proposing a £25,600 threshold, higher in some better-paid occupations, with special rules applying to NHS and education sectors. Crucially, the report also argues that if the government really wants to adopt a “points-based system” for the most highly skilled migrants, it will need to be far more flexible about the sorts of people it admits – and recognise that not everyone who arrives in Britain will succeed, at least not necessarily in material terms.These proposals should please businesses, although some in lower-paying sectors such as hospitality and food processing, especially outside London, will still face a big shock. The NHS should be able to live with the new arrangements, which essentially say that not just doctors and nurses, but people working in lower-paid positions, will be eligible under the new rules. It will be far harder for social care to adapt to the changes, where the MAC – as it did in its last major report – argues that the problem is that care workers aren’t paid enough because the care system has been persistently underfunded and that the government shouldn’t use immigration as a way of dodging these issues. Their point is valid but it will be of little comfort to those who rely on Britain’s care system now.All this will amount to rapid change. There will need to be consultation, particularly with employers, if not on the big decisions then on a host of second-order questions and then there will need to be time for business to get used to the new system, which will be considerably more costly and burdensome than freedom of movement.For many employers that depend on immigrant workers from the EU, and therefore don’t need to interact with the immigration system at all under the current arrangements, this is not simply a matter of extending and tweaking existing processes and procedures. Businesses (particularly small ones) will suddenly find there are Home Office forms to fill in, fees to pay, and time-consuming bureaucracy to navigate. Time is short – by the summer, employers will want to know what to say when making job offers to EU nationals. The most important immediate impact of Brexit for business will be lots more red tape.So will post-Brexit Britain, without free movement, become closed to all except the “brightest and best”, vindicating Brexiteers who voted to restrict immigration and slow the pace of demographic and social change? Or will we move into a new era, in which global Britain will benefit from skills and talent from all over the world, rather than simply sucking in cheap labour from the rest of Europe?The answer is likely to be somewhere in between. What is certain is that these proposals are far more liberal than anything we could have expected from Theresa May. Immigration-bashers and nativists in the Conservative party and beyond will find this uncomfortable – particularly the resulting increase in immigration from outside the EU. But immigration is a less salient issue among the electorate than it was in 2016, and public perceptions of the economic and social impact of immigration on the UK are far more positive than they were at the time of the referendum. For some people, at least, ending freedom of movement - and hence restoring “control” over immigration - may be more important than guaranteeing lower numbers of migrants.So there are grounds for at least cautious optimism. Contrary to the hopes and fears of many, Brexit looks less like it will make a decisive turn towards restricting immigration. Instead, consistent with the more benign aspects of our history, it may signal a different form of openness.• Jonathan Portes is professor of economics and public policy at King’s College London, and is a senior fellow at UK in a Changing Europe"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c73ff24059f9694ae812d84af8d6b57589973c17/0_0_941_573/master/941.jpg?width=940\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=00b1d6b3332c7f19e55b86861bffc55b 1880w","title":"teachers tell us if you think the planned pay rise is enough","story":"If you are a teacher working in England we would like to hear your thoughts on salaries in the profession In light of the government announcing plans to raise salaries for teachers in England, we’d like to find out whether this measure is enough to stop teachers leaving the profession.

Arriving at the festival with A24 and Brad Pitt’s Moonlight-backing production company Plan B attached, the Korean American coming-of-age tale already had considerable steam but it’s now been unofficially – and deservedly – crowned the year’s first truly great movie, one we’ll be talking about for quite some time.It’s the fifth film from Lee Isaac Chung, using his own childhood as inspiration, telling a story specific in detail and universal in emotion. It’s the early 1980s and Korean parents Jacob (Steven Yeun) and Monica (Yeri Han) have decided to move their American-born children out of the city to live in rural Arkansas. Jacob has a plan to turn a large chunk of remote land into a farm, growing Korean vegetables to sell to other immigrant families. But Monica is unsure, wary of his lofty ambitions and concerned for what it might mean for their family. Their son David (Alan S Kim) has a heart murmur but is too preoccupied with causing mischief to care, while their daughter Anne (Noel Cho) is restless, with little to do in their country setting.It’s a delicately told tale, quietly engaging us with the day-to-day minutiae of the family without coercing them into a more traditionally dramatic structure. Chung is focused on the small things, and it’s in these moments that Minari (named after a plant otherwise known as Chinese celery) really comes to life, whether it’s the kids making paper aeroplanes with the words “Don’t fight” as their parents quarrel, or the excitable squeal of Monica as her mother arrives from South Korea, having packed giant bags of chilli powder and anchovies. There’s authenticity at the heart of it all, and never once do we not believe in what we’re seeing.A recent bugbear of mine is that too many artfully composed indies rely heavily, and sometimes exclusively, on grand music to sell emotion that might be lacking elsewhere. At last year’s Sundance, Emile Mosseri’s heart-grabbing score for The Last Black Man in San Francisco did far too much of the heavy lifting for a film that couldn’t match its epic feel. Later in the year, Trey Edward Shults used a stellar soundtrack in Waves to move us further than the film deserved. As Minari begins, so does a similarly hair-raising score, also from Mosseri, and it’s one that only increases in stature as the film progresses. But it’s not working in isolation: it reinforces and deepens the story, and as the finale arrives, its grandiosity suddenly matches what we see on screen.It’s not as if the majority of the film is lacking in emotion, exactly. It’s just a quiet story, at times almost whispered to us. It’s richly textured yet restrained, and I was always engrossed, but it wasn’t until the last 15 minutes, as tragedy strikes, that I suddenly understood how attached I was to the characters, and how ingenious Chung’s slow build was, subtly enveloping us into the fold without us fully realising. It’s one of those masterfully structured endings that harkens back to so many of the film’s smaller moments, gently tugging at our hearts without relying on manipulation. At the screening I attended, there were few dry eyes.Yeun, an always magnetic presence on The Walking Dead, has now become the show’s most successful breakout after his chilling turn in 2018’s Burning and an understated lead performance here. Like the film around him, it’s in the quieter interludes where he reveals himself, but the actor we’ll be talking about once the credits roll is seven-year-old Kim, a rare natural, mischievous and sweet, carrying a great deal of the story on his small shoulders. There’s also a strong, mostly comic role for Yuh-Jung Youn as the equally mischievous grandmother, a refreshingly unexpected character who delivers most of the film’s biggest laughs.Minari offers an encouraging and engaging view of the immigrant experience while also recognising the hardships that go alongside. Chung’s nuanced portrait of a family figuring out their place in the world is both small and somehow rather grand, and after it continues to win over the remaining crowds here at Sundance, it’ll soon be winning you over as well."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6583cc8bcca356591a6cb0ff2be706e9837099fc/0_219_6570_3942/master/6570.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5b2489e5ff877a6a066b393e004409d3","title":"kim joy recipe blueberry frangipane cream mini mug tarts","story":"Crisp pastry, plus a tiny bit of jam and sweet and nutty frangipane, topped with a swirl of whipped cream all the elements of a delectable dessert in miniature mug form.Makes: 24 mini-tarts (or about 12 larger tarts)For the pastry225g plain flour155g salted butter, at room temperature 40g caster sugar 1 medium eggFor the frangipane 100g salted butter100g caster sugar1 medium egg34 tsp almond extract100g ground almonds For the whipped cream topping 130g double cream20g icing sugar12 tsp vanilla bean pastePlus Strawberry jam 24 frozen blueberriesIcing sugar and waterHard pretzels Cocoa powderPut the flour in a mixing bowl chop and add the butter.

Sadly for him, Gemma Bonner’s second-half header from a corner failed to launch a much needed comeback against a side they will face for the second time in five days on Sunday.“We made sloppy mistakes and gave away goals and it’s always going to be difficult if you give away goals to Arsenal,” said Cushing. The Gunners will play Chelsea in the final at the City Ground, Nottingham, on 29 February after Maren Mjelde beat Manchester United’s Mary Earps from a tight angle to win the other semi-final. It will be Arsenal’s eighth final in nine editions of this cup. “It’s cup football, playing against a very good team, already with Sunday in the back of our minds. I credit the girls, they were strong mentally and got through it,” said the Gunners’ manager, Joe Montemurro, of the scrappy encounter.After Arsenal’s defeat of West Ham on Sunday, Montemurro had defended his small squad: “I’ve said this many times – there’s no use me holding on to players when they can play elsewhere. I’m probably a little bit stubborn and hardheaded with that. You run the risk of injury but we’ve got really good quality back-up.”Three days later and his philosophy was being tested. The official line from the club was that his captain, Kim Little, was being rested, but with just three senior players on the bench alongside two 17-year-olds and a 16-year-old, if the line was true, he was definitely taking a risk.Luckily for him, the Gunners did their best to make impact substitutes unnecessary. Just six minutes in the Manchester City centre-back Bonner gifted the ball to Beth Mead. The England winger played it to Miedema who cut on to her left and fired low into the far corner. It was a goal to end not quite a drought but the Dutch centre-forward was, until then, yet to score in 2020. It takes her season tally to 17 in all competitions.On the stroke of half-time Arsenal doubled their lead – a run from deep by Miedema saw her snake into the box on the right before switching the ball back for Van de Donk, whose shot slipped under Ellie Roebuck. The goalkeeper did well to save from Miedema in the second half and minutes later City were thrown a lifeline when Leonie Maier tripped Lauren Hemp in the penalty box. Manuela Zinsberger ed low to her left to turn the tame spot-kick from Ellen White around the post, but Bonner headed in from the resulting corner to reduce the deficit.“I always think you shouldn’t lose twice across the two games really,” Cushing had said in the week. When reminded of his words, he countered: “There’s always a reason why you lose. Today we lost because of mistakes. These games are so tight, they are on a knife edge.”On the prospect of ruining Cushing’s leaving party, Montemurro was diplomatic. “Nick’s a fantastic coach and a fantastic guy,” he said. “He’s done some great work at City and he deserves the credit he gets.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/db4ed8c168996f30a4006293c29823ba6f713044/96_486_2951_1771/master/2951.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b1c041cffaf26cf09aec4c2fb24b1aac","title":"manchester city manchester united carabao cup semi final second leg match report","story":"Remember Paris, Pep Guardiola had cautioned after his Manchester City team’s 3-1 first-leg victory at Old Trafford in this Carabao Cup semi-final. Remember Paris, Ole Gunnar Solskjær had trumpeted in the countdown to the second leg. It could be done. His Manchester United had done it before – in last season’s Champions League last 16 when they overturned a two-goal deficit from the home leg to upset Paris Saint-Germain in frankly ludicrous fashion.This game should not have been close. City’s superiority was plain for so long but a combination of United’s doggedness and their own profligacy ensured that it went down to the wire. City had two goals ruled out for offside and some of their misses had Guardiola and the home support contorting in agony.The most ridiculous one came in the 73rd minute when Sergio Agüero robbed Harry Maguire inside the United six-yard box and the substitute, David Silva, opted not to shoot but to pass to Ilkay Gündogan. He then tried to run through two United defenders rather than passing or shooting and the chance went begging. It was not the only example of City’s infuriating habit of wanting to walk the ball into the net and failing.Nemanja Matic’s bolt from the blue on 35 minutes had advertised a United comeback to rival the one in Paris and when Fred and the substitute Andreas Pereira stood over an 87th-minute free-kick on the edge of the City area, following a reckless foul by Nicolás Otamendi on Maguire, Guardiola and everybody in sky blue felt theirhearts thump.Matic had been sent off by then for checking Gündogan – a second bookable offence – but here was the chance to take the tie to penalties. Where was Juan Mata, another substitute? According to Solskjær, he had deferred to Fred, who had been on fire in free-kick practice on Tuesday. Up stepped Fred and into the wall the shot went. Really, it would have been too much.And so City advanced to the final against Aston Villa and Guardiola could contemplate the chance to win this competition for a third season in succession. He has only lost one tiein it – coincidentally to United in October 2016.Nobody could say that City did not deserve it, particularly after the way they had dominated the first half of the first leg when they streaked into a three-goal lead, but Solskjær was in a position to take the positives.Even though the gulf in quality between the teams was pronounced on the night United defended well, they showed a steely attitude and they gave themselves a puncher’s chance of getting to penalties.It was the second time in as many months that United had won here, following the 2-1 Premier League victory on 7 December and, although it did not feel like a victory, Solskjær was quick to point out that it showed what could be achieved when his players executed a gameplan. United’s record against Guardiola’s City at the Etihad now reads W3 D1 L1.Guardiola wanted to guard against United’s pace up front and, moreover, he wanted to hog the ball, to control the occasion. His 3-2-4-1 formation was innovative, featuring two full-backs, Kyle Walker and João Cancelo, in the back three and, further forward, Kevin De Bruyne and Bernardo Silva in the spaces behind Agüero.City dominated the opening half-hour and, were it not for David de Gea, they would have been in front within 10 minutes. First the United goalkeeper sprang to his right to keep out an Agüero header following Bernardo Silva’s dinked ball over the top and then he blocked Riyad Mahrez’s deflected shot with his legs. There was more. De Gea turned away an Agüero shot that was bound for the top corner and Maguire had to stretch into a saving challenge on Raheem Sterling after De Bruyne’s beautifully curled through-ball.United survived. And then they prospered. They knew they had to score the opening goal and, when they did, it was quite the strike from Matic. He got his body shape right in a heartbeat after Fred’s free-kick had flicked off Bernardo Silva’s head to steer a side-on, first-time effort inside the near corner from just inside the area. Game on.Sterling had a goal ruled out for offside in the 42nd minute following a De Bruyne cross but, by then, City could feel the nerves jangling. Sterling had allowed a pass to slide under his studs and trickle out for a throw-in. The home crowd howled.United worked their way through the City press a couple of times in the first half without finding a final pass but they sensed that their rivals could be vulnerable.Guardiola’s team defended best when they dominated the ball and kept it a long way from their goal. When they actually had to defend they looked jittery. A case in point came early in the second half from another United set piece. Maguire rose high only to thump a header off-target – a fine chance wasted.City needed the soothing balm of a goal and Sterling should have scored it when he raced on to the outstanding De Bruyne’s pass. Yet he dallied, skated square, away from challenges, before blasting high.Agüero had a goal chalked off for a hairline offside call on 84 minutes as United clung on. This time, though, there would be no miracle endingfor them."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c7347091d35be9e47925453fb75b84f01d661f1c/10_117_3493_2096/master/3493.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8296f8f18490a6ce42ede9b91b6edf84","title":"west ham united liverpool premier league match report","story":"The day is nearing when, if he were so minded, Jürgen Klopp could copy his strategy for FA Cup replays and hand the rest of Liverpool’s league season to their second string. Games in hand are only an advantage if you win them and this one was ultimately negotiated in comfort, confirming a 19-point lead that only a wild-eyed fantasist would deem surmountable.Nineteen points ahead 23 wins from 24 all 19 Premier League teams defeated at least once. They are statistics that will swill around for the rest of this week but they should not dull in the telling, even if the figures are likely to grow yet more jawdropping in the months to come. Liverpool did not please Klopp with this display and they certainly laboured in the 35 minutes before Mohamed Salah put them ahead from the penalty spot. The number of mistakes that crept in, even once Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain had doubled the lead, was enough to afford Alisson the platform to remind everyone that his excellence underpins the imperturbable machine that ploughs on in front of him. But none of it mattered too much: West Ham were allowed their moments, but this is emphatically Liverpool’s season.“I’m only happy about the three points,” Klopp said. “We could have done a lot of things better. We could have passed better and defended better. These boys have played outstanding football throughout the season. Tonight was a normal performance.”Liverpool’s version of normal tends to be enough. They took time to find their bearings, with Klopp admitting that West Ham’s 5-4-1 setup made life awkward. “A very important element of football is countering the counter but for that you need the other team to have counterattacks,” was how he put it. They had come particularly close only through Andy Robertson, whose clipped effort was chaperoned away from goal by Issa Diop, in the opening half-hour but then Salah was granted the chance to hold his nerve.The opportunity arose when Roberto Firmino, finding the elements of time and space that had hitherto been lacking, did admirably to keep Trent Alexander-Arnold’s near-post cross alive. He duly threaded the ball across to Divock Origi, who had come in for the injured Sadio Mané, but the forward still had plenty to do given Diop and the 19-year-old debutant, Jeremy Ngakia, both stood in his way.Origi attempted to wriggle between them and was stopped when Diop, wafting out a leg, tripped him on the six-yard line. It seemed needless in such a tight area but Jonathan Moss’s award of a penalty was confirmed at length by VAR, which decided Firmino should not be penalised for what appeared to be a touch with his hand in the buildup. Salah sent Lukasz Fabianski the wrong way and the die was cast.Seven minutes after half-time, Salah delightfully assisted Oxlade-Chamberlain. Much to David Moyes’s frustration, the move came about when a West Ham corner landed straight on to the head of Virgil van Dijk.They were unable to deal with the second ball in midfield and this time Liverpool had their counter. The home side were caught ahead of the play and Salah, weighting a sublime pass with the outside of his left foot, sent his teammate bursting through. Oxlade-Chamberlain shrugged off the attentions of Manuel Lanzini and finished slickly. Sorry your browser does not support audio - but you can download here and listen https:audio.guim20200127-57121-gnl.fw.20200127.sj.fw2701.mp3 It was a particularly grim night for Lanzini, who should have equalised several minutes earlier but instead scuffed Robert Snodgrass’s cross weakly at Alisson. The Argentinian’s substitution, in the 69th minute, was cheered. Dispiriting moments like that have become this stadium’s stock in trade but Moyes knows West Ham, who face a potentially far more telling assignment against Brighton here on Saturday, need all the help they can get at this point.Even if Lanzini could not extend Alisson, a first-time effort from Snodgrass drew a fine one-handed stop and, towards the end, a tip-over from Declan Rice’s header was genuinely breathtaking. There was also a moment of slapstick when Alexander-Arnold hammered against his own upright fortunately for Liverpool, they could afford to get those moments out of their system.Salah clipped the woodwork himself in those dying moments one of the night’s more obscure statistics was that he had not scored in his previous nine games in London, but he grew stronger as this one progressed. Those who had travelled in support are well used, by now, to success in the capital and virtually everywhere else. “We’re going to win the league, and now you’re going to believe us,” they sang, but any moment of epiphany came long ago."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8a2ce6b36832ba0073e274e1d304d9c799009550/0_162_3733_2239/master/3733.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2afc771b1eb699334494320c9d27168b","title":"dream job what happened next","story":"Caretaker on a remote Irish island is the latest viral posting to attract thousands of applicants. But what’s it like to bag a job in a million?As another year of environmental turmoil and political upheaval loomed at the start of 2020, thousands of people – from Alaska to South Africa – turned their sights to the peace and tranquility of Great Blasket, a remote island a mile off the west coast of Ireland. There are no other residents, no electricity, wifi or hot water, but droves of would-be-caretakers were charmed by the idea of looking after a cafe and three cottages there.The posting, which has so far received more than 23,000 applications, is the latest “dream job” opportunity to go viral, following vacancies for a barefoot bookseller in the Males and a cat sanctuary manager on the Greek island of Syros. But do these dream jobs ever live up to expectations? And what of the one-of-a-kind jobs that never hit the headlines?We asked some lucky candidates to find out.It’s somewhat serendipitous that Mari Huws and Emyr Glyn Owen became the new wardens of Ynys Enlli. The couple met on the island on “a perfect summer afternoon” two years ago, so when they spotted the vacancy to run the place on Facebook, “we shared one of those looks between us – the looks that speak louder than words. We had to go for it,” says Huws. “Many people assume that people who want to live on an island are escaping from something, but for us it was more about realising a dream.”The pair quit their jobs, packed up their homes in north Wales and have hit the ground running since arriving in September 2019.The job involves manual labour: digging drains, building fences, mixing cement and fixing broken tractors. But no matter how tough the work, the pair can always end their day with a walk through the fields and a swim in the Irish Sea at sunset.“There aren’t many aspects of mainland life that we miss,” says Huws. “The boatman once told me that ‘the world comes to Enlli’ – and he’s right.”The posting had already gone international by the time the couple applied, but they managed to beat more than 10,000 other applicants to become the new keepers in May 2019.On a typical day, they wake up around 5.45am to prepare breakfast for 10 guests. Coffee is served at 7am, hot breakfast at 9am. There’s a history talk and demonstration of the antique foghorn equipment before guests are shuttled back to the mainland. Beds are remade, bathrooms cleaned and lunch is hastily eaten before the next guests arrive. Appetisers and sparkling wine are served, followed by a four-course meal, often using herbs and vegetables from the island’s garden. Danse and Waterson clock off around 10pm. “It’s definitely a full-time-plus job,” he says.Even “non-guest days” are busy with laundry, buying gasoline and groceries, and prepping food. “It’s easy to allow this to become your whole world,” says Danse. To enjoy a proper day off, the pair disappear away from the island, somewhere without cellphone reception. But they’re learning to carve out time for themselves on the island, too.“We’ll pull out our lawn chairs and look out at the city, maybe have a glass of wine,” says Waterson. “It’s rare that we sit and enjoy it but when we do, it’s amazing that we have this to ourselves – at least for a couple nights a week.”When the New York Times announced it wanted to send a journalist to every location on its list of 52 Places to Go in 2018, a cultural phenomenon ensued. The posting went viral, memes were generated and 13,000 people applied. Jada Yuan, then a staff writer at New York Magazine, was chosen as the lucky writer and soon embarked on a whistlestop tour covering 38 countries over six continents.“I knew I was going to have to take every moment I could to stop and enjoy it, but I also knew it was going to be a ton of work,” says Yuan. As well as pumping out Instagram updates, photographs and a print column each week, Yuan learned last-minute that she’d be organising most of the transport and accommodation herself. “It wasn’t until two days before I left that I realised that would mostly be on me,” she says. “I was constantly trying to get to the next place but also writing about the previous place.”Despite missing trains in India, running out of money in São Tomé and Príncipe, and battling an ever-growing list of articles to file, Yuan found ways to overcome the “travel rage” and enjoy the small wins.“There wasn’t really an average day on St Kilda, it’s a pretty wild place,” says Craig Stanford who, from April 2017 to November 2019, worked as the National Trust for Scotland’s resident archaeologist on the isolated archipelago.The post is a “semi-legendary job in Scottish archaeology”, says Stanford, who spent six months each year conserving, promoting and protecting the archipelago’s cultural heritage, including some of the 1,260 unique stone huts known as cleitean.“Food is probably the most challenging part of the job – you really have to plan it quite carefully,” says Stanford. A helicopter will try to deliver food twice a week, but in a place where “every hour of your day is defined by nature”, the archipelago is impenetrable most of the time. “You end up eating some weird things from the back of the cupboard.”The first time Karen Aspen set foot on a boat, she ended up on an eight-month adventure sailing around the Caribbean. As a temp for an Edinburgh catering company, she was sent to work as the onboard cook for a group of businessmen on a weekend sailing trip around Scotland’s west coast.Without a job to return to, she stayed with the 60ft yacht as it travelled down to Portsmouth on England’s south coast, helping out with a two-month renovation before joining its next voyage across the Atlantic. “I just said: ‘I could do that,’ as you do when you’re 19,” laughs Aspen. Once in Antigua, she cooked for wealthy tourists who chartered the yacht before it was hired by the Canadian film-maker Gregory Colbert to track sperm whales for his film Ashes and Snow.“I was one of those girls who had dolphins on her pencil case,” says Aspen. She never thought she’d see a whale or dolphin in real life, let alone learn to listen out for them on a hydrophone or have a job “where you could walk up on deck and there’d be a whale 10 feet from you”.And despite the complete lack of time off or personal space out on the water, she returned to the Caribbean several times after her spontaneous adventure to continue work on the film.“It was a real turning point for me in my life,” says Aspen. “I was meeting all these people who were following their passions and doing what they really wanted with their lives ... it’s something I would aspire to do – to live life on my own terms.” This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

Not only is the government looking for ways to reduce the the broadcaster’s funding even further in coming years, but younger viewers are increasingly tuning out of the BBC altogether.And if the BBC doesn’t find ways to reach these younger viewers, Unsworth asked the corporation’s news staff on today, “How can we continue to take money off them?”The existential question now facing BBC News is whether it can transfer from being a news operation that is still focussed on producing inidual television and radio programmes to a nimbler organisation with centralised teams reporting stories which reach all age groups in all formats.All of this has to be achieved operating on an ever-reducing budget, while maintaining journalistic standards, at a time when every aspect of the BBC’s output is under more scrutiny than ever before. That’s in addition to the intense scrutiny from politicians and other media outlets who are ready to jump on any changes to services – not to mention reluctant staff who fear increased workloads.This is a challenge for any organisation, especially one founded around the principle that it should provide an all-encompassing universal service to the entire country in an era where the media is increasingly fragmented. While some specific cuts to certain shows – such as the outright closure of the Victoria Derbyshire programme and the end of Newsnight’s acclaimed films desk – have been announced, there will be hundreds more journalists who will find out in the summer that they are out of a job as staff or placed into centralised teams.The problem is the BBC is increasingly trying to ride two horses at once. The corporation’s broadcast channels still, despite their declining audiences, reach tens of millions of people a week. Many of them are quite happy with the material they are watching, but these programmes cost money the BBC wants to ert into online operations – and cutting resources could irritate the existing fans of the television and radio output.There have been attempts to bring in new listeners to traditional broadcast stations such as 5 Live by refreshing the lineup with new presenters. But this runs the risk of alienating existing audiences without attracting new under-35s who are more likely to consume material online.Staff who have seen multiple rounds of redundancies and reorganisations in recent BBC history appeared resigned to their fates today, while being intensely sceptical of the idea that one crew of journalists could produce content for wildly different programmes such as BBC Breakfast, 5 Live, and Newsnight. Many pointed out the five BBC News managers announcing the cuts in the broadcaster’s central London headquarters had combined salaries approaching a million pounds a year, and appear to be remaining in their positions.The cuts announced today have also kept headline programme closures to a minimum, making it easier for BBC bosses to push through a substantial reduction in the headcount. Show closures cause outrage among politicians and audiences when they learn that their favourite programme is going off air – as seen by the reaction to canning Victoria Derbyshire’s programme. But saving the brand name while removing much of a show’s resources is a much easier sell.Unsworth is aware that the BBC will come under pressure over the job cuts but she told staff that the BBC now has no choice but to redirect resources into online journalism if it wants to ensure it has a future audience.“Our friends and enemies in the press, well mainly enemies, would like us to be in the broadcasting model only. The problem is the under-35 audience are getting all their news from social media and the internet. They’re not watching bulletins,” she said, making clear that she expected pushback.“If the press don’t like it and the Sun don’t like it – well I’m sorry, that’s just tough.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/28bbe4cf7b8be951019daf1508904e429e6c7a72/0_166_4992_2995/master/4992.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b9f64cb99ca89d8557d3fcbb166224be","title":"ethnic minority pensioners are 24 worse off than others of their age","story":"Report from The People’s Pension says ide is even greater for womenThe researchers behind the analysis said it exposed a sizeable “ethnicity gap” in pensions, with part of this down to issues with the state pension system.This is the difference in pension income for those who belong to an ethnic minority group compared to pensioners of a white ethnicity, and relates to 2017-18.This is not the first time a link has been made between ethnicity and poorer pension incomes. Research by the Pensions Policy Institute (PPI) charity in 2003 and 2008 concluded that people from ethnic minorities, and certain other groups, were more likely to have many of the characteristics associated with lower pension incomes. In 2016 the PPI returned to the topic, and said it had found that differences in income were reducing, “but some will remain”.Many of the findings in the study are based on an analysis of a survey of more than 40,000 households carried out by the Department for Work and Pensions.“Our report highlights large inequalities, which will become starker as the growing ethnic minority population reaches retirement age,” said Gregg McClymont, director of policy at The People’s Pension, which is one of the biggest “auto-enrolment” pension providers with £9bn of assets under management. He added: “Understanding the size of the problem and causes is a vital first step in devising appropriate policies for closing the gap.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/918af36660f316bd5c430b769abd5d2ad4efb838/0_215_4928_2956/master/4928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bb0f248ee0c339a2a6d949afe4958d49","title":"newcastle city council named uk top lgbt employer stonewall","story":"Stonewall publishes top 100 list, featuring Sainsbury’s and Channel 4 for first timeNewcastle city council has been named the UK’s top LGBT employer, with Sainsbury’s and Channel 4 making the equality charity Stonewall’s top 100 list for the first time.Stonewall has said it is the first time a local authority has been named the best LGBT employer in the 16 years it has published the annual list.The top 10 list comprises companies from a broad range of sectors, including the Cheshire fire and rescue service, last year’s winner, the law firm Pinsent Masons, the Ministry of Justice, Citi, GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) and the Welsh government.Other companies and organisations to make the list include the foreign intelligence service MI6 – – but not its domestic counterpart, MI5, which has appeared in the top five several times in recent years and topped the list in 2016 – the House of Lords and the British army.The record 503 submissions Stonewall received from companies wanting to make the list is a reflection of how equality in the workplace has increasingly become a corporate imperative.Sainsbury’s made its debut at No 71 and was the only high street retailer or supermarket to make the top 100.Channel 4 entered at No 35, which follows a significant focus on improving ersity and equality under the leadership of the chief executive, Alex Mahon. Sky, the only media organisation to make the list in 2018 and 2019, rose 35 places to rank at No 28 this year, making it the leader in the media sector.“We spend most of our lives at work so getting workplace inclusion right makes a huge difference in the lives of so many LGBT people,” said Sanjay Sood-Smith, an executive director at Stonewall. “Every year, our list of the top 100 employers shows us who’s leading the way when it comes to creating a work environment where LGBT people can thrive and be themselves in the UK.”For the second year running, education is the sector with the most organisations appearing in the list, at 16, with Cardiff University ranking highest, in 10th, and the multimedia learning and publishing group Pearson debuting at No 80. The legal sector has 15 firms in the top 100.Stonewall has also acknowledged the UK’s top trans-inclusive employers – those it says have “gone above and beyond to ensure trans staff feel accepted”.The unranked 20-strong list includes Aviva, Bury council, the Department for International Trade, Homes England, the real estate advisers JLL, the solicitors Leigh Day, Skills Development Scotland, the University of Sheffield, the law firm Travers Smith, the University of South Wales Group, Victim Support and York St John University.Stonewall’s top 10 LGBT employers in the UK 20203.

She celebrated the former Labour chancellor Roy Jenkins for his role in paving the way for the founding of the single currency.British MEPs including Molly Scott Cato broke down in tears as they addressed the parliament for the final time.But with negotiations between the EU and the UK over the future relationship due to start on 3 March, Von der Leyen also made an appeal for the British prime minister to listen to the calls of the UK’s car industry and aerospace to maintain EU standards outside the bloc. understands that earlier in the day, the EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, had been urged by France during an internal meeting of EU27 diplomats to demand that the UK sign up to dynamic alignment across the board on state aid, environmental, social and labour standards.The French argued that the UK could not be given a competitive advantage from which they would reap idends in the future.Barnier gave a non-committal answer, sources said, but he emphasised that protecting the single market was a more important aim than achieving tariff-free access to the British market for EU goods.Speaking to MEPs, Von der Leyen said the EU was offering an unprecedented “zero tariffs, zero quota” deal but suggested that Britain needed to align on basic standards for that to be achievable.The commission president told MEPs: “We will certainly not expose our companies to unfair competition. And it is very clear the trade-off is simple.“The more the United Kingdom does commit to upholding our standards for social protections and workers’ rights, upholding our guarantees on the environment and fair competition …“Just days ago some of the largest business associations in Britain particularly in the car and aerospace industry asked their government to maintain EU standards and rules and I think this is in our mutual interest.“I believe the United Kingdom and the European Union have a mutual interest in the closest possible partnership,” Von der Leyen continued. “No new partnership will bring back the benefits of being part of the same union. But we have the duty to see the best for the British and European people in a post-Brexit world.”The commission president concluded by quoting George Elliot: “Only in the agony of parting do we look into the depths of love. We will always love you and we will never be far,” Von der Leyen said.Guy Verhofstadt, the former prime minister of Belgium who led for the parliament during much of the last four years since the referendum result, asked MEPs to reflect on what had gone wrong.But Verhofstadt’s explanation that the EU had not become federal enough and that the exemptions and rebate offered to the UK had created an unattractively sclerotic bloc failed to convince Farage, however.In his final statement to the parliament, where he has been an MEP for 21 years, Farage said: “Once we have left we will not be coming back and the rest is detail … When I walked in here, you all thought it was terribly funny. You stopped laughing in 2017.”Farage’s party colleagues waved union flags and gave three cheers as he concluded his comments.“Put your flags away, if you are leaving,” responded Mairead McGuinness, an Irish MEP who was chairing the debate as vice-president of the parliament, as Brexit party MEPs left their seats.Barnier spoke in the debate to single out the former Liberal Democrat MEP Andrew Duff and outgoing Labour MEP Richard Corbett for praise in developing the EU.He referenced the words of former cabinet minister Chris Patten, who had once asked if the defence of the national interest could solely be a national concern. “Is it not necessary to be European over and above being a patriot?” Barnier asked."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/789a5d91a479309a3526d6426a53e2df5be5a4e2/0_95_3200_1920/master/3200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=600c3911b2fbf261cbf17164ab2a509d","title":"the britons getting out before brexit drawbridge goes up","story":"UK nationals rush to settle in Spain before they lose their rights as EU citizens on 31 DecemberCampaigners for the rights of British nationals in Spain have reported a rise in the number of inquiries from people rushing through plans to establish residency in the country before the Brexit “drawbridge goes up”.Sue Wilson, the founder of campaign group Bremain in Spain, says now that Brexit is “concrete and is happening” they are seeing evidence of Britons “expediting their plans” for retirement or a career move to Spain.Under the withdrawal agreement British nationals can settle in another EU member state right up to 31 December and claim lifetime rights as EU citizens.“We have people inquiring what the rules are and we are saying to people that as long as they move before 31 December they will have the same rights as those of us who are already here. It is in the withdrawal agreement,” says Wilson.“Even if you haven’t reached pension age and you have paid in for enough years to make you eligible you will have the right to an uprated pension for life under the withdrawal agreement.”Not all rights are guaranteed and the campaign group British in Europe has urged Brussels and London to secure those that have yet to be negotiated, which include freedom of movement and the right to return to the UK with an EU family member after Brexit. But the rights to study, work and retire remain for those moving before 2021.We spoke to some who have already taken the plunge.“I did a spreadsheet at 4am in the morning and concluded that we could probably go now and that’s exactly what we did,” he says.Andy and his wife sold their house and upped sticks from Manchester to Spain in October.“We had always planned to retire out here, then Brexit put that into stark relief. The way that had been implemented put the fear of God into us, really, in terms of getting out here,” says Andy.“I had the vague idea of retiring somewhere between 55 and 60. We have a strict budget and I’ll have to work but we’re glad we did it. We didn’t like the rhetoric and the type of deal people like Dominic Raab was talking about didn’t seem to stack up. There was nobody to talk to – you couldn’t ring the government and ask: ‘Is this the position? Is this cast in stone? Can we trust you?’“We are not economic migrants. We considered Australia many years ago but in terms of employment it’s more complicated. The freedom of movement is key. You can cross a border into France, Spain without even noticing and you have the ability to work with no questions asked. That’s why we chose to become residents here.“Emotionally it’s quite difficult. The biggest step has been leaving all the friends and family and you want them here with you. Three months in there are days when you do feel homesick but there is Facetime and Skype.”But he and his wife have no regrets. “Our fear was the drawbridge would go up and the rights we had pre-Brexit wouldn’t be there.”Lesley and her husband Colin moved in March 2019 from Coventry, where two out of three constituencies voted leave.A former Conservative voter, she now supports the Liberal Democrats although did tactically vote Labour in the last election.“I wasn’t planning to retire for a number of years, but with Brexit looming in March 2019 we decided to make the move. We got here at the beginning of that March to make we have residency appointments booked in good time before 29 March so our rights would be secured.“I worked for the NHS for 25 years and because I moved early I’m a bit poorer but I’m happier.”She and Colin, a former HGV driver, had already downsized property when the referendum happened and had not intended to move full-time to Spain.They thought they would get a camper van and enjoy their retirement years touring Europe. But he had reached retirement age and was on his state pension, and EU reciprocal healthcare rules means he will continue to get NHS-funded care in Spain.“I’m really glad we did it but I still feel angry and sad, not so much for me but my grandchildren. My overriding feeling is that it is the young generation that will lose out. I just feel sorry for them,” says Lesley.Moved earlier than planned in February 2018 because of Brexit.“Almost two years ago I found myself in a bit of a panic because of Brexit. I felt I wanted to move to the EU and I needed to do it pretty quickly.“I spent 40 years working in pharmaceuticals and was used to looking at things 18 months, two-year windows at a time. I thought: if we don’t do this within six months, the door is going to be slammed, the drawbridge will be up.”A orce and his age makes it difficult financially to buy a decent property where he wanted in London where his daughter is, but in Spain, where he rents an apartment for €600 (£500) a month, there are all sorts of possibilities. “Not only can I afford to rent but I can buy as well.”Served in the US, Canada, Sudan and Turkey, travels to Cartagena two or three times a year and has been going to Spain since he was 21.Peter had wanted to retire to Spain for some time but delayed it because his daughter was not so keen. “Then the referendum happened,” he says. He is putting his house up for sale and intends to move before the end of the transition period.“Leaving England would be a wrench. I often analyse why I feel so strongly about getting out of this country. The last sentence says it all because I didn’t say ‘why I feel so strongly about going to Spain’. The reality is that I want to leave the UK because I don’t feel I belong here any more owing to the fact that democracy has been so undermined, and since Boris Johnson has become prime minister my fears have worsened.“I often questioned whether I was just getting over-emotional because I was being deprived of something I wanted. But that is not the case. I have been angry since 24 June 2016 and nothing has happened to appease me.“When I look at the mess Brexit has created, I thought I would literally leave lock, stock and barrel and move my pension into Europe.“I’ve been an activist since 2016. I joined the Lib Dems and read the . I used to read the Daily  and for 40 years voted for the Tories. I consider myself right of centre but when I look at it I’m a social democrat.

The abuse would be in the house, but in front of others he would act completely differently. I was trapped, too frightened to leave, given all that he had done to me and threatened to do. He controlled every aspect of my life, including the finances. He set up a joint account, but the Jobseeker’s Allowance came in his name and only he accessed that account. I would have to ask him for money, even for basic essentials.After many years I eventually found a way to leave him. I was supported by Birmingham and Solihull Women’s Aid, who found me emergency temporary accommodation in a refuge.One bank saw me three times and gave me false hope, each time saying that they would accept. Then in the final appointment they said the manager had now refused because I didn’t have an address. I was so upset and frustrated. It was like I didn’t matter, nobody cared. It was humiliating and again I had no control. I was worried how I would manage without the universal credit money. I had to feed my children. We had been surviving with support from my family and donations.Staff at the refuge then told me that HSBC UK had started a new way to open an account for women in refuges, a way in which we did not have to give the refuge address. An appointment was made and I attended a branch of HSBC UK far away from the shelter with staff support. They were patient and really kind to the kids and me. During the appointment I did think they would say no at any moment, but when they said the account was open I was so relieved.I finally had control. It was my account. I could make my own decisions, and buy the kids the things they needed, without having to beg or fear his anger.HSBC UK is working with local housing and homelessness charities to provide bank accounts to people without a fixed address, helping to break the cycle of financial exclusion.

Rising columns of plasma, superheated to almost 6,000C (10,800F), show up as bright spots at the centre of each grain – epicentres for the violent release of heat from the sun’s interior to its surface. As the plasma cools, it descends back below the surface via narrow, shadowy channels between neighbouring granules.This intricate level of detail will help improve understanding of the sun’s behaviour and allow its activity cycle to be predicted more accurately.The US National Solar Observatory’s $344m (£265m) telescope features a four-metre mirror – the world’s largest for a solar telescope – and is located at the 3,000-metre (10,000ft) summit of the Haleakalā volcano on the island of Maui.Valentin Pillet, the director of the National Solar Observatory, described the telescope, which had been under construction since 2013, as a “formidable technological achievement”. A major challenge was maintaining the telescope’s primary mirror at ambient temperature while it looked directly at the sun – any temperature deviation causes air turbulence that could ruin the image quality. The heat is intense enough to rapidly melt metal at the mirror’s focal point.Each night, a swimming pool’s worth of ice is emptied into eight tanks. During the day, coolant is routed through the ice tanks and distributed through the observatory by 7.5 miles (12km) of piping. More than 100 air jets are also positioned behind the main mirror.Incoming light from the sun is deflected from the primary mirror into a chamber of mirrors that sits below the observatory’s dome. Here, the light is bounced from mirror to mirror as it is apportioned between spectrometers, polarimeters and other various other instruments. The observatory’s full suite of instruments, which will allow scientists to measure the magnetic field from the sun’s surface up to its outer atmosphere, will come online later this year.The observations could help resolve longstanding mysteries of the sun, including the counterintuitive feature that the corona – the sun’s atmosphere – is heated to millions of degrees when its surface is only 6,000C. Understanding the physics of solar flares and coronal mass ejections could also significantly improve the ability to predict space weather, which can render GPS systems unreliable, take down power grids and knock out communication channels.The release of the images comes as Nasa’s Parker solar probe makes observations from the edge of the sun’s atmosphere, and before the launch of the Solar Orbiter mission, a European Space Agency-Nasa collaboration, next week."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6705246f45b60f6cccb5c4c057165534081e5add/0_362_6582_3949/master/6582.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=55c4c919bc359965c66a7478b1befc0b","title":"i always wanted to be a dad the rise of single fathers by choice","story":"A growing number of men are pursuing parenthood through surrogacy, adoption or fostering – without a partner. Here, dads who have gone it alone share their storiesThe first night Joe Norton brought home his adoptive sons, Tarren and Owen, he considered his new life, then thought: what have I done? “It’s a monumental decision you’re making, and you’re making it on your own,” says the 54-year-old educational manager from Yorkshire. “The enormity hit me.”Going from being a single man to the sole carer for two children was tougher than he had expected. There was the misbehaviour, particularly when the boys, who are brothers, began to settle in. (Experts call this period “regression”, but it is usually a sign that children are beginning to relax around their new parents.) He was also stumped by unexpected questions – what size socks did the boys wear? Norton had no clue what to buy. “You have an idea what size a T-shirt should be, but socks are a different thing,” he says, chuckling.But it was rewarding, much more so than Norton had hoped or dreamed. Three months after the adoption was completed, in October 2012, Norton took Owen and Tarren – then aged six and five respectively – on a break with family friends. On that holiday, the boys started calling him “Dad”. “It was emotional,” Norton says. “It was all starting to happen.”Norton is one of the growing number of men in the UK who are choosing to become single fathers. Whether through surrogacy, adoption or fostering, these men are deciding to go it alone. While there are no reliable figures documenting the number of men starting families on their own (rather than becoming the primary caregiver after their partner leaves or dies), experts agree that it is becoming more common. There was a record number of single-parent adoptions in 2018. The singer Ricky Martin had twin sons via a surrogate, while the footballer Cristiano Ronaldo is rumoured to have used the same method to have his eldest three children.“We are seeing more men wanting to adopt than in recent years,” says Natalie Gamble, a lawyer specialising in fertility and surrogacy law. In addition to the spike in adoptions, Gamble tells me that single-father surrogacy is becoming more prevalent after a long-awaited change in the law enabled single parents who use surrogates to apply for full rights over their child. “Parents have to apply to the family courts for a parental order previously, only couples were able to do this.”Without a parental order, a surrogate could, theoretically, reclaim their child at any moment – a prospect that terrorised Ian Mucklejohn for many years. In 2001, Mucklejohn, a business owner from Newbury, became Britain’s first surrogate single father. Then 58, he used an egg donor and a surrogate in the US to have triplets – Piers, Lars and Ian. Although Mucklejohn was their biological father, he would have had no legal recourse to keep the boys if the surrogate, Tina Price, had chosen to claim them. “All she had to do was get on a plane and come and get them, no matter what she had signed,” he says.The law changed in January 2019, after Gamble brought to the high court a test case involving a British single father who had had a son, “Z”, via a US surrogate. (Having initially contested the case, the government conceded that the law discriminated against single parents when the president of the family ision of the court declared it incompatible with human rights legislation.) Now, solo parents who have children through a surrogate can apply for a parental order listing them as the child’s only legal parent. Gamble was there the day that the father of “Z” obtained his parental order, the first in the UK to record only a father. “It felt really monumental,” she says.Thanks to the legal change, more men are considering surrogacy. “The options are opening up,” Gamble says. “More British surrogates are willing to be matched with fathers.” Dr Sophie Zadeh of University College London is researching the men who choose to become single fathers, in conjunction with the University of Cambridge’s Centre for Family Research. She tells me that many men decide to go it alone for the same reason that many women do – none of their relationships have worked out and they want to have children before they are too old.This was the case for Norton, who separated from his wife in 2009. “I’d always grown up expecting to have children,” he says. “I’m the oldest of four and three of my siblings are adopted, so when my marriage broke down without children I decided that adoption was the best way.” But going through the adoption process on his own was difficult – it is an intrusive process that can take years, and there is no one to share your frustrations with.But not everyone who becomes a single father does so in the wake of a failed relationship. “I always knew, from a very young age, that I wanted to be a dad – and also that I never wanted to be a biological father,” says 35-year-old Ben Carpenter, a stay-at-home parent from West Yorkshire. “There were vulnerable children out there and I wanted to adopt them.” Carpenter applied to adoption services aged 21. “I knew it was what I wanted to do. Instantly, I completely found my niche.”Over the next decade, Carpenter adopted five children: Jack, Ruby, Lily, Joseph and Teddy. All have special needs – Lily is deaf, Ruby is blind, Jack is autistic and Joseph has Down’s syndrome. Teddy died last year, aged two, from complications relating to Cornelia de Lange syndrome. “He was a wonderful little boy,” Carpenter says. “We’re all gutted.” They set a place for Teddy at the dinner table this Christmas, as a reminder that he was still part of the family.Being a single dad can be challenging if, like Carpenter, your children have special needs. Carpenter’s mother lives with the family and helps with childcare. Even so, he can end up being pulled in more directions than he can manage at any one time – he wasn’t able to get to all the children’s nativity plays, because they attend different schools and the schedules clashed – but he is adamant that his parenting responsibilities are manageable. “I do find time for myself,” he says. In fact, he is considering adopting again. “It’s so rewarding to see a child – whose future is, in some cases, so bleak and dark – flourishing into a child who is thriving and cared for.”Carpenter receives an adoption allowance and child benefit, but still has to budget carefully each month to make ends meet. Indeed, using a surrogate from abroad is an option only for well-off people: the majority of Zadeh’s research cohort who used surrogates had high incomes. “I feel so privileged to have been able to do this,” says 54-year-old Simon Burrell, an educational manager from Brighton. His son, William, was born to a US surrogate late last year. William’s birth was dramatic – he was born two weeks early, on Boxing Day, meaning that Burrell had a mad rush to get to the US and missed the birth. Meeting his son for the first time felt wonderful, he says, but was less overwhelming than he had expected. “I felt like I knew him already,” he says. “I didn’t have that feeling of being overcome or in tears. I was his only parent, he needed me, and I was already a day and a half late getting there.”As we speak, William is sleeping in another room in Burrell’s rented apartment in California he is waiting for William’s paperwork to come through so he can bring him home. Burrell estimates that the surrogacy process, which was arranged through the British agency Brilliant Beginnings, cost about £200,000. Burrell funded it through the sale of his home in London. “It’s unfair that other men who would also be good fathers can’t do this, but they don’t have the option.”Adoption and fostering are alternatives for which you don’t have to be wealthy, says Carpenter. “You can be from any walk of life, as long as you go through the process and are deemed to be a suitable person to adopt. There is no set adopter.” In addition, foster parents are eligible for financial allowances that adoptive parents don’t receive.“My own experience of fostering was that they were incredibly open to single fathers,” says Gareth K Thomas, 34, from south Wales. He has been fostering two boys, aged 13 and 10, and their seven-year-old sister since 2017. “The people going through your fostering application aren’t interested in your sexuality or your marital status. They just want to know that you’ll be a good parent to these kids.” He advises single men who want to foster to get experience of being around children – Thomas volunteered with the Scout Association.He has taken to fostering with great happiness – and relative ease. “Sometimes I have to pinch myself,” he says, laughing. “We go away for weekends, camping, take the dog for a walk, go for hot chocolate. I think: it’s my job to do this? Someone is going to find me out soon.” He hopes to encourage other single men to consider fostering. “The door is wide open,” he says. “That’s the message I would like to get across.”But not everyone’s experience of fostering as a single father is so positive. James, 39, a business owner from London, applied to become a foster parent in January 2018 after attending a fostering roadshow. “I’d wanted to do it for a while,” he says. “I didn’t have much desire to have kids of my own, because I thought it was better to sort out the kids we already had.” After being approved in November 2019, James was introduced to Carl, the 14-year-old he would be fostering.As a single carer, James expected support from foster services, but this was not to be the case. “All the promised support evaporated,” he sighs. It took 10 weeks for James to find Carl a school placement, meaning that he was unable to work. His finances began to unravel. He pleaded for more support from fostering services, to no avail. “I was going to them breaking down in tears.” Eventually, James had to end the placement. “The last thing I wanted to do was let this kid down, but that’s what ended up happening. It was really upsetting and stressful.” He wishes that the foster services had been more realistic about how much support they could offer. “I’d come to care about the kid to have to end the placement was horrible.”In a society that is set up to regard women as primary caregivers, being a single father can feel alienating. Zadeh says: “Men get questions asking whether it’s Mum’s day off.” Even in relatively progressive California, Burrell gets comments. “They say: ‘He’s so cute! How’s the mother?’”Single fathers can also be viewed with suspicion or seen as unfit parents. “People assume they can’t parent properly because they are male,” says Zadeh. Her research indicates that fathers are subject to greater scrutiny from healthcare visitors than mothers. “They’re seen as that bit more unusual,” she says. When Burrell told his friends about his plans to have a child, some questioned whether he was biting off more than he could chew. “We’re used to the idea of women as single parents, but there seems to be an assumption that men can’t do it on their own,” he says.Worse still is when people allege that single fathers are predators. Social media trolls have accused Carpenter of molesting his children. “They tell me that they hope I’m arrested for my crimes of abusing children, and that’s the only reason I wanted to adopt. They cannot cope with the fact that a man wants to love and care for children.” But Carpenter emphasises that those people are in a minority. “Nine out of 10 times, the feedback is so supportive and wonderful.”Mucklejohn has seen attitudes towards single fathers change since he became a parent. “In 2001, I was described as selfish, or undertaking a business transaction to get the children,” he says. Although no one writes about the family critically now, those years caused damage – Mucklejohn’s son Ian struggled to cope with the negative press. “It made him want to be invisible at school,” Mucklejohn says. “He kept a very low profile for fear someone would tap his name into a search engine.”As society becomes more accommodating of single-parent families, whether male or female, it is likely we will see more solo fathers on the school run. But there is still a way to go. “Whether, in 50 years, there will be such a societal shift that we see men doing most of the primary caregiving, I’m not sure,” says Zadeh. She points out that statutory maternity leave is up to 52 weeks, whereas statutory paternity leave is up to two weeks. (However, adoption leave is equivalent to maternity leave.) “These conditions would have to be levelled out before you saw more men taking on non-traditional roles.”About a week after William’s birth, the emotion finally came. Burrell had woken at 7am, fed the baby, made coffee and looked out at the beautiful mountain vista he can see from the window of his rented apartment. “It hit me,” Burrell says. “I’m his daddy. It’s real. This is how we’re going to be now, until he leaves home. That’s when it finally dawned on me.” He felt his heart expanding with love, and he was calm.Some names have been changed"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/011c353cca3d894d8c31aa5244615ed9f341a806/152_175_1995_1197/master/1995.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1c5884ab31ae3ea88557cc1ae734e915","title":"ministers told to find 5 savings to refocus on pms priorities","story":"Departments told to identify potential cost-savings in order to boost funds for hospitals, schools and ‘levelling up’Sajid Javid has written to ministers urging them to identify projects that could be scrapped, to cut costs and “refocus” resources on Boris Johnson’s priorities of hospitals, schools and “levelling up”.“This will allow us to refocus our efforts towards the things which matter most: strengthening our NHS making our streets safer and levelling up opportunity across the country,” the letter says.Officials will be expected to examine their budgets line by line, asking whether each item supports what Johnson likes to call “the people’s priorities”.Asking for potential spending cuts is standard practicebefore a spending review – but the emphasis on excising plans that don’t fit the Johnson agenda underlines the urgency with which Downing Street hopes to reshape government.March’s budget is expected to include a significant expansion of long-term investment, funded through extra borrowing, as the Conservatives ditch the tight spending constraints of the past decade.In a speech during the election campaign setting out his plans for the economy, the chancellor said: “Incredibly, at the moment, we can borrow in real terms at negative rates, meaning it is a responsible time to invest.”This approach of borrowing to invest was enshrined in Gordon Brown’s “golden rule”, and championed by a string of Labour shadow chancellors – but rejected by successive Tory chancellors as too lax.Javid is also expected to use Brexit as an opportunity to rewrite the Treasury’s “green book” for measuring the value of investment proposals – a decision that could favour costly plans such as the controversial HS2 rail project.Javid said he would still aim to match current spending with tax revenues, however. “We can’t run an overdraft for ever on our day-to-day spending,” he insisted in his November speech.That is likely to mean the Tories’ more immediate manifesto promises, including recruiting extra nurses and police, will have to be funded partly from within existing budgets – with detailed plans set out in a spending review expected by the autumn.Whitehall departments are being urged to consider ditching some activities outright in order to save money, rather than seeking the “efficiency savings” often favoured by previous administrations.With many infrastructure projects taking years to deliver, Downing Street insiders also say Johnson is impatient to identify more immediate ways of appealing to voters – particularly in some of the seats it snatched from Labour last month.The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, said the letter, which was first leaked to Sky News and the Sun, was evidence that the chancellor would not end austerity, however.“We were promised by Johnson and Javid that austerity had ended and the cuts in public services were over. They clearly aren’t on this evidence. Another Johnson lie exposed,” McDonnell said.Johnson is determined to shift the emphasis away from Brexit after the UK formally leaves the EU on Friday evening, and focus on domestic priorities.He is expected to make a speech next week setting out his approach to negotiating the future relationship with the EU, a task that will begin in earnest in March, once the EU27 have agreed collective negotiating guidelines.The Department for Exiting the EU will cease to exist at 11pm on Friday, when the UK officially leaves the bloc – and Johnson has asked ministers and officials to avoid using the word “Brexit” in communications after that."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a50f6bd268551c51ea95947ed4f173b67aa36a81/0_0_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b7d2a360d47b053f2f41dfbdcbeec35b","title":"most children own mobile phone by age of seven study finds","story":"The majority of children own a mobile phone by the age of seven, according to a study.The devices have become a fundamental part of life for most young people, it indicates.

A few days in the Algarve paid off a year ago when they secured a resounding round‑one win in Dublin but even the best-laid plans can be disrupted at any time.In this instance the Exeter hooker Luke Cowan-Dickie, who had been pressing for Jamie George’s starting place, has had to return to the UK for family reasons, opening up the prospect of Bath’s Tom Dunn winning an unexpected first cap off the bench.Mako Vunipola also missed training because of an eye problem, although England’s management insist he is not a serious doubt for the game at Stade de France on Sunday.All this comes, appropriately enough, at the exact moment that England have been talking about the importance of being more adaptable when circumstances demand it. There is now widespread recognition they did not respond well when things started going awry in the World Cup final against South Africa in November and Paris will be a litmus test for their progress in this vital area.As their fly-half George Ford has been reiterating, there is a lot more to winning games of rugby than simple physicality, particularly when the intended target is a fast-moving one.“Being brutal doesn’t always mean trying to knock the wall down and trying to run over the man straight in front of you,” Ford said. “You have to be smart and controlled and take the sting out of the game a little bit, or maybe throw something at a team that they are not quite expecting. Defensively it is more a case of ‘Right, let’s go get ’em and whack ’em’, but from an attack point of view you can be brutal and smart at the same time.”With Shaun Edwards now in charge of marshalling France’s defensive operation it could be that England’s management decide it is not a day for messing around or blooding too many new caps. It is more than possible that Courtney Lawes will be asked to wear No 6 with the combative Tom Curry at 8 and any huge starting XV experimentation behind the scrum feels unlikely.If Anthony Watson, Elliot Daly and Jonny May are raring to go the starting back three – in whatever order – virtually picks itself and it will be a surprise if the 10-12 combination of Ford and Owen Farrell is not reunited, if only to ensure England have sufficient kicking options to put France on the back foot.If any further incentive is required World Rugby has announced that the pool draw for the 2023 Rugby World Cup will take place after this November’s international fixtures. This puts an added onus on all teams to enjoy a successful 2020 if they wish to avoid ending up with a potentially tougher draw for the tournament, which will be hosted by France.Watson, meanwhile, hopes his Wiltshire-reared teammate Dunn will finally be given the chance, at 27, to export a bit of no-nonsense Chippenham aggression across the Channel this weekend. “If you wanted one person to run through a brick wall he’s probably the first person I’d ask,” said Watson. “It doesn’t matter how high or deep it is he’s going to run full pelt into it regardless.“He’s not the most explosive but he’s not going to take a backward step to anyone and I think you’ve seen that for Bath this year. His work‑rate is phenomenal and he’s also got probably the hardest – and biggest – head in world rugby. He’s like a ram he always gets stuck into things.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/023f18184c61b3d8ba010404586ee077f14f8f1a/633_307_2867_1720/master/2867.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=56c1d9882fb3c28ca979f4bf1d84e482","title":"roger federer novak djokovic history australian open","story":"• Swiss beat Djokovic in last meeting, in ATP Tour Finals• That win ‘showed me he is beatable’, Federer saysRoger Federer has returned from hell twice this week, yet he is still smiling, refusing to panic, and says: “I believe until the end.” Even the 38‑year‑old Swiss does not know when that dreaded moment will arrive but he remains convinced, against growing evidence, there is a little piece of heaven waiting for him here on Sunday.He no doubt kept an eye on Rafael Nadal’s dramatic quarter-final against Dominic Thiem because, if he were somehow to beat Novak Djokovic in their semi-final on Thursday evening, he would be playing the winner or Alexander Zverev in the final.Was he relieved to see the 34-year-old Nadal, the world No 1, lose? Possibly. Or should he fear the vigour and ambition of either Thiem or Zverev, who earlier beat his old friend Stan Wawrinka?These tremors and uncertainties will rumble and multiply in the months to come. It is inevitable. But whisper it to the trio who own 55 majors between them, stretching back 17 years, a dominance like few others in any sport.Federer knows he could have lost against John Millman perhaps he should have lost against Tennys Sandgren. Nevertheless, to win his 21st major the six-time champion will have to go through the man who has turned the screws on his genius more often in recent years than anyone in the game and who, last summer at Wimbledon, inflicted a searing defeat on him. It was the Serb’s 26th triumph in their 49-match rivalry – and his 20th from their past 30, including a walkover – when he saved two match points to move within four slam victories of Federer’s record tally.How, we wondered, could he recover from that to remain in contention here? A subsequent victory against Djokovic at the ATP World Tour Finals helped, he acknowledged.They all believe. They would be skiing in Switzerland if they didn’t. Or fishing in Mallorca.And, wWhether Zverev wins the title or not, whether or not he even gets to the final, the 22-year-old German has already won Australia. The son of parents who grew up in the Soviet Union lives in the tax haven of Monte Carlo and has earned more than $US20m in his short career. And he is standing by his pre-tournament promise to donate his entire $A4.12m purse to bushfire relief if he finally becomes a grand slam champion on Sunday that is a gesture of rare magnanimity in modern professional sport.“Of course, if I win the $4m, it’s a lot of money for me,” he said after his excellent four-set win against the 2014 champion. “I’m not Roger, I’m not LeBron James. This is still big. But, at the same time, I know there are people right now in this country, in this beautiful country, who lost their homes and they need the money. They depend on it, building their homes again, building up the nature that Australia has, the animals as well. I think there’s much better use for those people with that money than I have right now.”Whatever cynicism attaches to his decision to decline playing for his country in the Davis Cup Finals last November, then embarking on a lucrative exhibition tour with Federer, Zverev is going to “pony up” in Melbourne, and a bit of sentimental history is there for the taking if he backs his generosity with the sort of tennis that has made him one of the most exciting young players on the Tour.Twice in the first two hours of the evening quarter-final, Nadal led Thiem 4-2. Twice he squandered the advantage. And, uncharacteristically, he lost his temper with the officials when given a time violation for slow serving in the second set. He had bounced back three times from 2-0 down, and raised his level appreciably to stay in the tournament, but he could not sustain it in the fourth set, when his stamina looked to leave him. A break up, Thiem wobbled at the end.As Kyrgios did two nights previously, Thiem wobbled in sight of the line, a double fault and three unforced errors letting Nadal back in the conversation at 5-all. As the clocked ticked past four hours, they went to a third tie-break – Thiem’s fifth of the tournament, Nadal’s sixth. The younger man, trembled again on the first of three match points, serving, but prevailed (aided by the net), 7-6 (3), 7-6 (4), 6-4, 7-6 (6). There were a lot of stories in Nadal’s closing, weary forehand into the net.Thiem’s battle with Zverev on Friday will be engrossing, a pointer to the future, with no clear favourite – and still it will not hold the history of Federer versus Djokovic."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5ffa5b1753314ab6a32d3147a6954e488a2e06dd/0_126_4797_2878/master/4797.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0c02b1a7a57c9169d11a090f63897f6d","title":"ashleigh barty v sofia kenin australian open semi finals live","story":"First set: Barty* 3-2 Kenin (* denotes server): Another backhand unforced error from the Australian here, but we’ll forgive her given it’s sandwiched between four aces. Enough said.First set: Barty 2-2 Kenin* (* denotes server): Barty begins as the aggressor, pumping that forehand repeatedly across court before walloping another errant backhand long. Kenin is up 40-0 before she knows it and takes the risk by going for the sliced dropshot. Barty races into the net and her challenger responds with a lovely lob straight over her head.First set: Barty* 2-1 Kenin (* denotes server): Still on serve here as Barty holds to love. She kicks off with two consecutive aces, cool as you like, followed by a forehand down the line that’s heavy on the top spin and sneaky on the direction.First set: Barty 1-1 Kenin* (* denotes server): Two unforced errors from Barty allow Kenin to take control of this game but the American dispatches one of her own off her forehand to make it 30-30. Two more unforced backhand errors later and Kenin holds.First set: Barty* 1-0 Kenin (* denotes server): Barty’s first service game is safely negotiated. She takes her time to get set and puts away a regulation smash from the net. Up 40-15, she serves a fault and then lands a shot out off her second. But Kenin does the same on the following point.Weather: The forecast is a maximum 39 degrees at Melbourne Arena, which apparently makes it the hottest day of the tournament yet. Will the roof be put up at some point during this contest.Barty gets a big cheer from the home crowd, featuring some serious sporting royalty in Cathy Freeman. Australia’s most celebrated Indigenous athlete is clearly a big fan of Barty, a proud Ngaragu woman.“I can confidently say on behalf of Aussies and particularly the Indigenous community we’re very proud of her,” Freeman said at Thursday’s Inspirational Lunch. “I think the impact that she can have on everybody but particularly young girls is quite profound. Her achievements and her story will get onto the psyche and into the blood of so many young girls around not just Australia, but the world, it’s very cool. She’s an amazing role model. She seems to have a really good head on her shoulders, really community-minded, not too overawed by the success she’s having - it’s wonderful.”In case you missed this excellent pre-tournament piece by Simon Cambers, who predicted Barty can buck the decades-long trend of Australians cracking under pressure at their home majorHead to head: Barty owns a 4-1 career record over Kenin, but they’ve split their past two meetings at Toronto and Wuhan. Sam Groth is on Nine expecting there to be nerves at both ends of the court.John McEnroe, of Margaret Court protest fame, believes Barty has the edge over Kevin because “she’s got more variety than any other players”.“She drives them a little crazy, unsettles them. They don’t know quite what to do,” McEnroe told the Nine Network. “She uses that slice great, she’s a very good volleyer, having played a lot of doubles ... she’s got a sneaky big serve for someone who’s not very tall.“Perspective has helped her. Her stepping away from the game when she was younger, a bit overwhelmed I guess by the attention and the expectation. She’s come back a far better player. She’s handled it pretty darn well.”It’s already been a day of days for Australia on Rod Laver Arena, where Max Purcell and Luke Saville have beaten Ivan Dodig and Filip Polášek in three sets and are into the men’s doubles final.Go one step further and the pair will become the first all-Australian team to win the doubles since the days of the Woodies. Quite something for the wildcards. Greetings everyone and welcome to live coverage of the women’s singles semi-finals at the Australian Open. And what a treat we’re in for, with world No 1 and local hero Ash Barty facing American Sofia Kenin on her mission to become the first Australian woman to contest her home grand slam final for 40 years.The last to achieve such a feat was Wendy Turnbull back in 1980. Some perspective, for you all. That was the year Evonne Goolagong Cawley won the last of her seven grand slams at Wimbledon, the year a dingo stole baby Azaria Chamberlain, and when the late Malcolm Fraser was in office and so was Dame Edna Everage’s “wisteria hue” hair. Most pertinently, though, it was 16 years before Barty was born. No pressure, as they say. The 23-year-old Queenslander has already made history at this tournament, having become the first Australian woman since Turnbull in 1984 to make the semi-finals after Tuesday’s straight-sets defeat of two-time major champion Petra Kvitová.The reigning French Open champion has never ventured this deep into the draw before, and could be on a final collision course with Simona Halep, the only player in either draw yet to lose a set this fortnight, should the world No 3 see off world No 32 Garbiñe Muguruza in the second semi-final later this afternoon.But first there’s the small matter of 21-year-old Kenin, the world No 14 unexpectedly carrying the weight of her own nation as the only American of either gender still left in the draw.While the attention was on Serena and Venus Williams and fast-rising 15-year-old Coco Gauff, Kenin was quietly and improbably ploughing her way through a star-studded quarter of the draw, bettering Gauff in the fourth round and then unseeded Tunisian Ons Jabeur in the quarter-finals.Both players boast well-balanced games and like to dictate play so this should be a belter.Feel free to share your thoughts via email emma.kemp.casual@the or Twitter @emmavkemp."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9b5ce39d227d831c434210cdf35977916f8f876e/0_0_5124_3073/master/5124.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7e00d6b308231638bc427a46750c8d36","title":"tell us about the websites your children visit","story":"We want to hear from parents and young adults about the non-mainstream sites they and their children accessWith new rules for technology companies to protect children online announced by the UK Information Commissioner’s Office, we want to hear about the non-mainstream sites children and young people access.Some of these principles include:We want to know about the surprising sites that children and young people visit.

Now, he thinks it’s here to stay.“That overwhelming sense of mortality is the hardest, biggest thing that I suspect I’ll be spending the rest of my life really wrestling with,” Ohanian, 36, says. The multimillionaire venture capitalist is speaking from Palm Beach, Florida, where he is working from home, having just collected Olympia, now two, from “school”.The US is one of only three countries in the world not to have any federally mandated parental leave, and the vast majority of American workplaces do not offer it.But things were different for Ohanian, who was able to take 16 weeks’ paid paternity leave from his then employer Reddit (he now works full time for Initialized Capital, an early-stage venture capital fund which he also co-founded).“I couldn’t imagine going through that as a husband and having to decide or even think for a second about choosing between your wife and your career. That is an inhumane choice to expect someone to make in a modern society.”The experience had such a profound impact on Ohanian that he has since become a prominent voice in the US on fatherhood and an advocate for a national paid family leave law.“My wife and I … we have means, we run our own careers, we have family, we have literally every advantage we could ask for when a newborn shows up, and yet still it was such a traumatising period,” he says.Williams, 38, narrowly escaped with her life when she suffered a pulmonary embolism after giving birth by emergency C-section. Following multiple operations, she was bed-bound for the first six weeks of Olympia’s life and many of the childcare duties fell to Ohanian. He had never held a baby before.“I learnt how to do a diaper and I learnt how to do all these things and just get comfortable with this tiny little person that I was now responsible for.”That crash course gave him the self-belief to handle future challenges. “I feel a confidence and a calm that is a direct result of having that time early when I had no fucking clue what was happening. But I figured it out and it worked.”From the beginning he has shared his experiences of fatherhood on social media, which he believes is uniquely placed to normalise fathers as caregivers and undo negative stereotypes such as the “Homer Simpson incompetent dad”.He believes a culture change is under way – evidence of which he claims can be found in his social media feed and group chat which he says is full of “dads doing dad things”.As more high-profile US figures take time off for the birth of their children, such as Chance the Rapper and the baseball player Daniel Hudson, Ohanian says, there has been “a bigger sea change in perception around fatherhood, around masculinity”.Ohanian and co-founder Steve Huffman started Reddit after graduating from the University of Virginia in 2005 and sold it the following year for a reported $10m to $20m. It’s now one of America’s most popular websites.He says a big part of encouraging men who have access to paternity leave to take it is about redefining what male success looks like. “These things are not mutually exclusive. A man can be just as career-driven, just as passionate, just as effective whether or not he takes time off to be with his family when welcoming a new child.”Ohanian says he did not consider the practicalities of paternity leave until he was about to become a father. When Reddit first introduced its policy he thought it was “reasonable” but admits he did not compute its significance.“It wasn’t until a couple of years later when I was using the policy that I realised this is indispensable and it’s something that a lucky few get access to in America, that really everyone should.”Last year, he went to Washington DC with other fathers to meet with members of Congress to talk about the issue as part of Dove Men+Care’s Pledge for Paternity Leave. He says they “came away from that trip feeling pretty optimistic because everyone there on both sides of the aisle agreed that this is something that we need”.The biggest questions, he says, were around how to fund it, but that he is “glad we’re already at that part in the conversation”. He also takes hope from recently passed legislation entitling 2.1 million federal workers to 12 weeks of paid parental leave.Ohanian will not single out which of the multiple proposed bills on family leave he supports, but in terms of paying for it, he thinks the paid family leave policies that have been introduced in some states – through an insurance fund model – could work nationally. While in an ideal world he would like to see new parents get six months off, he appreciates that may be ambitious.Having lost his mother to brain cancer, he would ultimately like a family leave bill to include time for caring for sick relatives. “I knew what it was like in my early 20s to have to take care of a dying and really debilitated parent and luckily, again, I was an entrepreneur and so I could build the schedule that I wanted to build and I had that flexibility, but the reality is not many people have that.”In the absence of a national law, private companies, especially in the tech industry, are increasingly offering paid family leave as an employee benefit. When Facebook’s CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, announced his leave after the birth of his second daughter, he took it as an opportunity to publicise the company’s four-month policy.Ohanian, who excitedly refers to the competition between companies on parental leave as an “arms race”, predicts that in the next 10 years, as demand for tech talent rises across other industries, more companies will start offering it.It’s also valuable for employee retention and productivity. “My instinct here is that yes, an employee will be more productive if they have some sense of peace over how their castle is doing, how their home is doing.”Initialized Capital offers 16 weeks’ paid parental leave. Last year, a quarter of their employees – including three fathers – took it. Ohanian, who refers to himself as a “business dad”, has also started investing in “family tech” companies like The Mom Project, a recruitment service for mothers, and the childcare app Kinside.To get to gender equality, though, he says it’s essential that men take as much parental leave as women. “No matter who’s getting pregnant, if both parents are taking leave then it sort of nullifies that penalty for having a uterus.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dd501862af20062a7469f1c3dce77d05b31c331f/0_164_4957_2974/master/4957.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d859f48525472ba0db871f990429c80a","title":"whole world must be ready to deal with coronavirus says who","story":"Countries urged to be on alert as number of confirmed cases passes 7,000The whole world must be on alert to deal with the spread of coronavirus, the World Health Organization has said as it urged countries to prepare so that they are ready to detect any cases that occur and isolate and treat the sick.WHO will reconvene its expert committee on Thursday to decide whether to declare the Wuhan coronavirus outbreak a public health emergency of international concern. There are now 7,183 confirmed cases of viral pneumonia caused by the virus and 170 deaths, all of them in China.Just 68 cases have been confirmed outside China, in 15 countries, but in three countries, Germany, Vietnam and Japan, there has been human-to-human transmission, raising fears over the spread of the disease.“The whole world needs to be on alert now. The whole world needs to take action and be ready for any cases that come from the epicentre or other epicentre that becomes established,” said Dr Michael Ryan, the head of the WHO health emergencies programme.The World Health Organization is recommending that people take simple precautions to reduce exposure to and transmission of the Wuhan coronavirus, for which there is no specific cure or vaccine.Despite a surge in sales of face masks in the aftermath of the outbreak of the coronavirus outbreak, experts are ided over whether they can prevent transmission and infection. There is some evidence to suggest that masks can help prevent hand-to-mouth transmissions, given the large number of times people touch their faces. The consensus appears to be that wearing a mask can limit – but not eliminate – the risks, provided they are used correctly.He and the WHO director general, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, praised China for its openness and its crackdown in Wuhan, the centre of the disease outbreak. “The fact that to date we have seen only 68 cases outside China and no deaths is due in no small part to the extraordinary efforts China has made,” said Tedros. “They are doing that at the expense of their economy and other factors.”But China’s containment of the coronavirus, which emerged probably from wild animals sold for food in Wuhan’s seafood market, has only reduced the danger to the rest of the world, not removed it.“The continued increase in cases and the evidence of human-to human transmission outside China are of course most deeply concerning,” he said. “Although the numbers outside China are still relatively small, they hold the potential for a much larger outbreak.”The emergencies committee met on two days last week but backed off from declaring the outbreak of international concern, largely because the spread to other countries had not been extensive. The declaration, which was made in the Ebola outbreaks in west Africa and the Democratic Republic of Congo as well as the Sars epidemic, would attract resources to countries that have outbreaks and streamline the measures taken. Ryan warned that 194 countries implementing unilateral measures was a “potential recipe for disaster”.The evacuation of foreign nationals from Wuhan began with airlifts of hundreds of people by Japan and the US. A government-chartered plane carrying 206 Japanese nationals arrived in Tokyo from Wuhan on Wednesday morning. Two showed symptoms of pneumonia following scans, but a coronavirus diagnosis had not been confirmed, hospital representatives said. Two more were admitted to hospital. Seven others with symptoms such as coughs and fever will undergo tests.The rest of the passengers were sent home with instructions to stay in and not mix with people for 14 days.Officials in the US said a chartered plane had made a refuelling stop in Anchorage, Alaska, with about 240 US citizens onboard, including staff from the US consulate in Wuhan. The passengers were due to be re-screened in Anchorage and hospitals there were on alert to take any who needed medical tests or treatment.The first cases in the Middle East were reported in the United Arab Emirates. Four members of a Chinese family who had been in Wuhan and arrived in the UAE on 16 January for a visit were confirmed to have the virus. All four are in a stable condition and under medical observation, the health ministry said. The Gulf Cooperation Council’s (GCC) health committee met on Wednesday in the Saudi capital of Riyadh to discuss the virus and to unify Gulf efforts to prevent its spread, Bahrain’s state news agency BNA said.There have been several suspected cases in African countries, although none have yet been confirmed.Unicef said it had shipped six tonnes of respiratory masks and protective suits to Shanghai to protect health workers. “This coronavirus is spreading at a breakneck speed and it is important to put all the necessary resources into halting it,” said Unicef’s executive director, Henrietta Fore. “We may not know enough about the virus’s impact on children or how many may be affected – but we do know that close monitoring and prevention are key. Time is not on our side.”British Airways said on Wednesday it had suspended all direct flights to and from mainland China after British authorities warned against “all but essential” travel to the country."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/97cc73ed3d56b7073ab21a8f5700ae0fb937075e/0_101_1152_691/master/1152.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e087d8ffc4c30c5cc929d2e504166e0e","title":"indian state school has two teachers a cook and one pupil","story":"Shy seven-year-old girl is the only student after exodus to private schools in rural BiharEach day that seven-year-old Janhavi Kumari arrives at school, her red bag slung over her shoulder, she receives a celebrity welcome. It is not simply that this shy Dalit girl is the star pupil – she is also the only pupil.For the past year, this tiny rural school with pink walls, located in the village of Mansa Bigha, Gaya district, in the Indian state of Bihar, has remained open solely to provide Janhavi with the education she craved, providing her with two teachers and a cook who makes lunch most days.“I have learned to write my name in English and could even tell you the name of fruits and colours in English,” whispered a shy Janhavi, “but I have no friends to study, play and talk with.”Schoolteacher Priyanka Kumari said she was “very impressed” with the commitment of her sole pupil, who comes from an Indian caste who have long faced discrimination and historically had poor access to education. “Little Janhavi is very prompt,” she said. “She has never missed her class right since she got admission in our school in the last session. We also eagerly wait for her every day as her absence means no work for us to do all day.”The primary school, which has been running since 1972, was not always empty of pupils, but a recent growing mistrust about the standard of government schools led to an exodus of students to nearby private institutions. Despite the best efforts of the local administration to convince parents to keep their children in state schools, offering everything from bicycles, uniforms and shoes to schoolbags and free lunches, the government-run classrooms have continued to empty.However, coming from a poverty-stricken family from the lower Paswan caste (also known as Dusadh) for Janhavi, whose father works at a petrol pump and her mother is a housewife, the school fees were unaffordable and so this small local school was her only avenue for education. When Janhavi enrolled at the start of this year, the community made a decision that her education alone was worth the cost of keeping the school going.“How could we have closed down the school? It would have been denial of justice to the poor girl had we shut it down. She too has the right to study,” the local village council chief, Dharmraj Paswan, said.Janhavi’s mother, Pinki Kumari, said she was overjoyed that the school had kept functioning to teach only her daughter. “We are very happy,” she said. “We are so poor … we couldn’t pay hefty fees to private schools. If it wasn’t for the school’s support, my daughter would have been left illiterate.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4153308.1580200203!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus plans to evacuate irish citizens from china","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMedical workers in protective gear talk with a woman suspected of being ill with  the coronavirus at a health station in Wuhan, central China’s Hubei Province, on Monday.

It is estimated there are eight Irish citizens in the affected region, which has been in effective lockdown since the Chinese authorities imposed severe transport restrictions in an effort to prevent the spread of the virus.On Monday, the mayor of Wuhan, in Hubei, acknowledged criticism of his handling of the crisis, and offered to resign. There is growing anger among residents that they were not informed earlier about the risk posed by the outbreak, which is thought to have begun in December.The number of confirmed cases has reached almost 3,000, with 400 of these critical. The number of suspected cases now stands at more than 5,700, but experts believe thousands more could eventually be infected.Stocks markets tumbled worldwide yesterday following concerns about the possible economic impact of the coronavirus.ConcernMembers of the Chinese community in Ireland have expressed concern about the presence here of a tour party from the region of the country where the coronavirus originated.The group left China before restrictions were imposed on travel there, came to Britain and then travelled on to Ireland on the ferry from Holyhead at the weekend. Chinese social media posts show a woman member of the group posing at various landmarks, including Trinity College in Dublin and the Titanic Centre in Belfast. “We are the only tour from Wubei that can travel in UK. That’s not easy,” the woman posted on Weibo, a social media site. She also posted a picture from the Holyhead ferry, on which members of her group had played poker.While there is no evidence the group posed any health threat, its presence in Ireland prompted criticism on Chinese social media.

Photograph: Fiach KellyTaoisigh and ministers are expected to bring in a running mate, but those close to Leo Varadkar have previously claimed his Dublin West constituency is too left-wing for Fine Gael to mount a serious challenge for two seats.That was when Varadkar was merely a high-profile Opposition TD, like in 2011, or a government minister, like he was in 2016. When he was first elected to the Dáil in 2007, Varadkar stood on his own in what was then a three-seat constituency.But the old left-wing excuse would stretch credulity if it were offered now, when Varadkar is Taoiseach.Dublin West is now a four-seater and at Election 2020 Fine Gael wants to take two out of four, although other local sources doubt it can be done.When Fine Gael support nationally was consistently about 30 per cent, two seats was a realistic target.Opinion pollsEven with Fine Gael’s national standing dropping to the low 20s in a series of opinion polls, Emer Currie, Varadkar’s Dublin West running mate this time out, still thinks Fine Gael can take two seats.She is accompanied on a mid-morning canvass of the Lambourn Park estate in Clonsilla in Dublin 15 by party veteran Gerry Leahy, who says the party would need 30 per cent in the constituency – the combined Fine Gael vote in Dublin West in 2016 was 21 per cent – to be in with a chance of taking two seats.“In fairness to the Taoiseach, she is not a token second candidate,” he says. “We are giving her a real shot.”Varadkar does not have a reputation of being a generous running mate. In 2016 he polled 19.7 per cent of first preferences, with his then running mate Catherine Noone recording 2.6 per cent. Local Fine Gael sources said he has given Currie 60 per cent of Dublin West for this election.“In this area we are saying number one for me and number two for Leo,” Currie says on a number of doors in Clonsilla, near her Westmanstown home.Her father, Austin Currie, was a the Fine Gael TD for Dublin West between 1989 and 2002.She came second in the six-seat Castleknock local electoral area of Fingal County Council in last year’s local elections. She and Ted Leddy, also from Fine Gael, polled a combined 27.3 per cent, just ahead of Roderick O’Gorman of the Greens on 27.2 per cent.Some who answer doors in Lambourn Park say they know Currie from her local work on the council, although others are less enthusiastic. One man turns Currie’s canvassers away by telling them his house is one which supports the Greens or Ruth Coppinger of the Socialist Party.Local workCurrie believes her local work should mitigate the negative effects of any national swing against Fine Gael.“The longer I have had on the ground, the more of a personal vote I have and so I would hope I am more insulated from something like that.” Such work, she says, has helped her develop as a candidate in her own right, rather than just being the Taoiseach’s running mate or her father’s daughter.Her campaign theme is what she calls the “struggle to juggle”, which she says comes from her experience as a mother of two and a daughter of elderly parents who is also working through her career.On the doors, Mary O’Riordan says she was a Fianna Fáiler but will now support Varadkar and Currie.Vincent Hegarty also says he will vote for Currie, but keeps her at the door to discuss local transport links.“It takes a half hour to get from Clonsilla to Connolly Station, which is ridiculous in this day and age. That should be five, 10 minutes. The problem is obviously in Connolly Station, trying to get in.”Trying to get in will also be the challenge for both Varadkar and Currie, with one trying to get back into Government Buildings and the other aiming to get into the Dáil for the first time.Such are the fine margins which will decide this election, the Taoiseach may need to repeat the pattern of his predecessors and bring a running mate if he is to get a second term.The best news and analysis from the campaign trail"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4155467.1580321474!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"as long as a hard border stays off the table then that s a huge relief","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMajella Johnson, co-owner of Johnson Produce, wholesalers in fresh-cut flowers and plants. Their warehouse in Northern Ireland is yards from the Donegal border. Photograph: Freya McClements From the outside, it looks like any other warehouse inside, is a garden of flowers hidden right on the Border.Twice a week lorries arrive from the Netherlands bearing their cargoes of sunflowers and carnations, roses and tulips when full, the rows and rows of fresh-cut flowers are spread the length and breadth of the warehouse floor.Johnson Produce, owned by husband and wife Bill and Majella Johnson, is as close to the Border as it’s possible to get.Their side of the Coney Road in Derry is in Northern Ireland the other side of the road is Muff, in Co Donegal.“People come up and ask, ‘Are you in the North or the South’?” says Majella. “We’re just about in the North and no more.”For the last 3½ years, they’ve given the same answer when asked how Brexit will affect their business.He adds: “In recent times, life in this part of the world has just been seamless across the Border. People didn’t really think about it at all, and that was the big fear, that that way of life would be stopped. That’s not the case now.”The Johnson’s flowers are dispatched almost equally between Northern Ireland and the Republic they are the main suppliers of flowers in the northwest of Ireland, with deliveries as far south as Fermanagh and Cavan, and as far west as Sligo.Their flowers are bought by ferry from the Netherlands to Harwich in the east of England, then are driven to Holyhead for the crossing to Dublin and then they are driven on to Derry via the border at Aughnacloy, Co Tyrone.“I think most people have just switched off now, they think it’s all over, and especially when you read the English press they think it’s all sorted now, but on this side of the Irish Sea it’s all to play for still.”‘Less worried’They are in a better position than most. As importers, with the threat of a hard Border removed, “when the lorry gets to the Border at Aughnacloy it will have to come straight on up,” says Bill.“We’re probably less worried than we were, but a lot of companies, especially the exporters, they must be really worried.”Bill and Majella set up their business 25 years ago. Bill, from the northeast of England, met Majella in Zambia, where he was working as a flower grower, and decided to set up their flower business in Majella’s home town of Derry.“I remember at the time we were going round all the flower shops in Donegal and Derry trying to work out if there was a need for the business, so I had maps and questionnaires with me,” he says.“I only had an old car which was forever breaking down, so there were a lot of wires all over the place, and I remember crossing the Border and the soldiers ripping the car apart because they thought I was on some sort of reconnaissance mission.”“You hear people saying it’s put a united Ireland back on to the agenda but I don’t know if that’s even true. I think the politicians have one idea of how life’s going, but most people just want to live their lives as they’ve always lived them.”In the 3½ years, the word “uncertainty” has been oft-repeated on the Border. As the UK’s departure from the EU approaches, that uncertainty is perhaps less sharply-felt still lacking, however, is certainty.“I definitely wouldn’t be relaxed,” says Bill. “I think there still could be huge problems ahead. We’re a net importer into Ireland, so our position’s probably a bit more straightforward.“In a year’s time, everyone will have a better idea.”The UK will leave the EU on Friday on Saturday morning the Johnsons say “we won’t be celebrating or commiserating. It’ll just be the same as ever”.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches. See more here.

The children are reaching out to shake hands in the murals, based on a poem called No More. The message is clear: the next generation wants no part in the violence of the past.This mural was unveiled 10 years ago, but the recent political ructions caused by Brexit in the North have stirred new concerns and tensions within the loyalist community, particularly among the younger generation.Loyalists oppose a trade border in the Irish Sea, the compromise agreed by British prime minister Boris Johnson and the EU in October that paves the way for the UK’s orderly departure from the EU on Friday.Loyalists see the new border in symbolic terms as eroding their political identity as unionists and British subjects of the crown.They see the new customs and regulatory frontier on the Irish Sea not as London, Dublin and Brussels see it – a compromise to avoid a hard Irish land Border that could have sparked republican anger and potentially violence – but as a step to Irish economic unity.For this they blame Johnson, who vowed at the DUP conference in 2018 not to create any economic barriers in the Irish Sea. Their anger is not helped by the confused messages from Johnson and UK officials about the checks required on goods moving between the North and Britain after Brexit.Days after Johnson said there would “emphatically” be no checks on trade across the Irish Sea, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier, on a visit to Belfast on Monday, said checks on goods entering the North from Britain were “indispensable” consequences of the deal.‘Suck it up’Wilson says there is “a lot of anger” in the loyalist community that Johnson “totally betrayed” the British people of Northern Ireland.“This isn’t what I signed up for: to be told by the British government to just ‘suck it up, and too bad this is the way it is going to be’.”After the deal was unveiled in October a series of public meetings and rallies brought together a broad sweep of unionists and loyalists to protest against the deal they call the “betrayal act”.Wilson says Johnson’s deal was a “complete somersault”, and “the ultimate sell-out” which breaches the 1998 Belfast Agreement that underpins the peace process.“Economically he is tying us to the Irish Republic, which is in the EU. It might seem like it is the EU but that’s not the way the loyalist people look at it: they look at it as we are being tied to an economic united Ireland, which was not in the Good Friday agreement.”Wilson fears a repeat of the 2012-13 flag protests when loyalists protested over the limited number of days the union flag was flown over Belfast’s City Hall. He said the protests left hundreds of young Loyalists with criminal records that hurt their future prospects.“Those sort of things are not realistic anymore. I would hope that there are a few things up our sleeves that we could do, but I wouldn’t want to ulge it now. It is hard to explain how you feel when you have been betrayed by your own prime minister.”The former member of Red Hand Commando – a group affiliated with the Ulster Volunteer Force that was responsible for 500 murders in the Troubles – is clear there is “no appetite” to return to the violence of the past.However, Wilson is fearful of the impact of the “armchair generals” and “Facebook warriors” provoking the anger of younger loyalists via well-followed social media channels, some of which are saying “we will not be the generation to fail Northern Ireland”.“I couldn’t tell you where it’s going to go, to tell you the truth,” Wilson says.Criminal elementsEarlier, Wilson had shared his concerns on how Brexit might be used by some criminal elements within the loyalist community during a talk on post-conflict Northern Ireland with a group of US students hosted by Queen’s University.Some in the loyalist community would “saber-rattle”, he warned, speaking alongside Sinn Féin Belfast city councillor and republican Séanna Walsh, who famously read out the IRA statement announcing the end of its armed campaign.“This is not about their loyalism or their Britishness. This about giving them a reason to exist so that they can turn around and can continue to do their drug-dealing, their gangsterism, their money-lending.” These people would “love nothing better than a conflict to start up again because it will mask what they are doing”.He said “loyalism is not in a good place at the moment”.East of Belfast on Bangor’s loyalist Kilcooley estate – one of the biggest in the North – Alison Blayney, who runs the Kilcooley Women’s Centre (part-funded with EU money), says younger loyalists who are active on social media are “hopping mad” and feel “hugely betrayed” over the Brexit deal, which they see as “a one-way route to an economic united Ireland”.She does not believe there will be violence from the loyalist community in response to it: she feels people are “passed that stage” and “wise to the fact that it doesn’t achieve what it used to”.“They are moving towards thinking things through, thinking their politics through, but how they channel that I am not sure. It is a worrying time because I think they won’t accept it.”Blayney is hopeful that the EU and UK can tweak the Irish Sea border arrangements in this year’s trade talks, but she warns against the “dangerous words” being used on the checks.“It’s dangerous terminology because no one really understands what is going to happen because there are different messages coming out.”DivisionsAt Ledley Hall Boys and Girls Club in east Belfast, young loyalists are worried that Sinn Féin is trying to take advantage of the isions over Brexit in the North to push for a Border poll on Irish unity. The party has pledged to secure a poll within five years as one of its manifesto promises south of the Border in the run-up to the February 8th general election.This, as loyalists see it, will inevitably cause tensions between the North’s two communities. “Sinn Féin’s election posters will be ‘we got the sea border, next we are going for the Border poll.’ We will be reminded of it every day,” said one of the youth club’s workers, who only wanted to be identified as ‘KC’.“Anything that we take as a win they take as a loss, so if they are taking it as a win we will be wary of it.”Nationalists will, he says, see the Irish Sea border as a “financial united Ireland” and “the first step to a united Ireland” – a prospect that loyalists abhor.“The words ‘united Ireland’ to a unionist or a loyalist is just petrifying because you have been told by your granny growing up, ‘it is never going to happen, not in your lifetime’, and now it possibly could,” he said.Wayne Gilmour (25), a self-declared loyalist activist from a working-class background who was a regular demonstrator in the flags protests, sees the Brexit deal as in effect giving Northern Ireland as “a delayed gift to the South”.He said it has created “great mistrust”, and fed “the paranoia and siege mentality” among loyalists-unionists.“I know people that would never have been political, wouldn’t have been openly hardline about anything, and they are falling into the fringes,” he said, sitting in a community office in the loyalist Tiger’s Bay area of north Belfast.Loyalists are angered by Taoiseach Leo Varadkar’s failure to take account of their community’s views or worries during the Brexit process. Gilmour was incensed by Varadkar’s comments in October that people in the North would still be able to post letters in red postboxes after the Brexit deal.Arrogance“Who does he think he is? The arrogance is unbelievable. He is the representative of a foreign state he shouldn’t have any say in the affairs of our state at all.”Although Gilmour is not suggesting violence as a means to oppose the deal, he said he could understand why it is seen as a possibility given that the compromise deal came about in response to the “threat of violence from Irish republicanism” over a potential hard land Border.“It would be foolhardy and naive of the British government to mistake or think that loyalism will be quietly pushed into a corner, and will be pacified and accept the deal as it is,” he said, anticipating “mass protests” from the likes of the Orange Order and other bodies opposed to it.Gilmour says Loyalists are “stuck between a rock and a hard place at the moment”, and that “any deal that dilutes the sovereignty of Northern Ireland will be resisted”.He says he is too young to have experienced the height of the Troubles, but is fearful of a possible return to violence.“I fear the night when you hear the rumble and you know what’s happened. It is that sinking feeling. It is just shared among the loyalist community at the moment there’s a feeling of despair that it is going backwards and we can’t stop it.”He says violence is horrible and wrong, but he warns of a “strange duality” within loyalism.“If it does fall backwards you are going to have to do what you can to protect your people’s birthright. If the state can’t do it, you do it.“That in-built sense, that I know it’s not normal to have, but that lies in the back of your head: what if? What are you prepared to do? And no one should be asking themselves that, but we feel that neglected and pushed.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

File photograph: Alan BetsonPolitical promises come and go but patience when it comes to a long-standing pledge to deliver a train line linking Dublin and Navan, Co Meath, is wearing thin due to residents facing long travel times when commuting by car or bus.Locals say the traffic problem is getting worse as a result of growth in the commuter belt’s population, with buses often full before reaching stops along the route.This has seen the need for a rail line, and a solution to the problem of workers being stuck in cars and on buses for hours every day, emerge as an election issue in the Meath constituencies.“The old catchphrase of Navan being ‘only an hour from Dublin’ certainly doesn’t hold true any more for the commuters, many of whom could be home to their kids in a lot less time in the evenings if there was a train,” says Sinead Walker Nelson (49), who leaves her home in Navan before 5.45am to reach her job at AIB in Ballsbridge on time.Hefty costs“I work remotely two days a week and drive to work the other three as buses would not get me in on time. I leave early to beat the traffic and mornings aren’t too bad, taking about 1½ hours but the evenings are a nightmare.“I’ve tried every route and they are all the same. I leave work and am in the car by 4pm, so technically ahead of rush hour traffic. It still takes me 2½ hours to drive 62km. Regularly it takes me an hour to travel just 12km.”She says the costs are hefty too, with tolls coming to €120 a month and petrol a further €300.To help put these quality of life and infrastructure issues on the agenda ahead of next month’s general election, a public meeting entitled “Meath on Track” is taking place in in the Newgrange Hotel, Navan on Thursday, with Meath West Aontú TD Peadar Tóibín chairing.Rail services ran between Dublin and Navan until the 1960s, when the line was closed as part of a major rationalisation of the State’s railway network.The restoration of the line has been mooted many times since, often around election times, and in 2005 it was announced the line to Navan would be rebuilt in two phases as a branch of the western commuter line.Since September 2010, train services have operated from Dublin’s docklands to the M3 Parkway station near Clonee. An additional 21-mile stretch to Navan was to open by 2015 under the then government’s Transport 21 programme.After the recession hit, plans for the extension were omitted from national infrastructure plans. It was not included in the Government’s Project Ireland 2040 strategy last year and it was reported last summer that Minister for Planning Eoghan Murphy had issued a draft directive to the Eastern and Midlands Regional Authority to downgrade the status of the proposed rail line.Jammed busesEarlier this month, Minister of State and Meath West TD Damien English said the National Transport Authority and Department of Transport were to complete a feasibility study this year on the rail line and that once viability had been proven, the next phase would be the allocation of funding.For people like Andrew Ralph (23), who lives between Dunshaughlin and Ratoath, a rail option cannot come soon enough.He says commuting is the “single biggest issue” in and around Ratoath where he estimates that 70 per cent of people commute to work.“At the minute the biggest problem in Ratoath is that there are no direct buses to Dublin from a village of 11,500 people,” he says.Ralph estimates that he spends an average of 13 hours commuting per week commuting from the town, which is 25km from Dublin city centre.“At the minute, the buses are jammed. The commute is stressful and there is no work-life balance. Public transport in Meath is broken,” he says.In Johnstown, a village outside Navan, commuters report being left on the side of the road regularly by passing buses as they are full to capacity.“When a bus finally stops, there’s a seat lottery. Queues of people push and shove to get on the bus and get a seat,” says Clodagh Roche (45).She says it can take 5½ hours to get to and from college in Blanchardstown and that this means “our quality of life has been diminished”.“We are the people who get up early in the mornings – to try and catch a bus against the odds,” she said.The best news and analysis from the campaign trail"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4155648.1580337789!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"varadkar avoids the veronavirus as tds turn out for wexford bridge opening","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTaoiseach Leo Varadkar and Rose Katherine Kennedy Townsend at the opening of the Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy Bridge in New Ross, Co Wexford. Photograph: Patrick BrowneLeo Varadkar probably thought the biggest threat to a successful day out in Wexford on Wednesday lay outside the Fine Gael camp.The Taoiseach would have been fully aware of the ongoing threat posed by the Veronavirus and his team would have taken all necessary precautions to protect him from it.As it turned out, he never came in contact with Verona Murphy, the party’s much vaunted candidate in the Wexford byelection last year before she ran her mouth off about immigrants and was duly booted off the general election ticket.They don’t like to talk about her now.But the head of the Road Haulage Association hasn’t gone quietly and is running a very strong campaign in the county as an independent. Where once her face adorned posters in Fine Gael blue, she now looks out defiantly from a dark background of burnt orange – or black and tan as the locals are describing it.Apart from her remarks about migrant toddlers in Wexford becoming Islamic State recruits, her posters themselves are an abomination – a grammatical one.However, it was the presence of his own contingent of candidates, lusting after a bit of notice, which posed most risk to Leo – physical rather than political.He stepped from his car in New Ross and before he had time to stand up straight a trio of flying Fine Gael candidates burst from nowhere and hurled themselves at him.But these were no ordinary candidates. These were junior ministerial candidates.There is nothing so ruthless or needy as ambitious junior ministers hell-bent on political advancement. They have tasted a little of power and they crave more.Ministerial velcroPaul Kehoe, Michael D’arcy and John Paul Phelan were the three Fine Gael Ministers of State determined to Velcro themselves to Leo Varadkar during all his photo opportunities at the official opening of the New Ross bypass and Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy bridge.Kehoe and D’arcy, on the Wexford side of the magnificent new structure, are fighting it out for the guaranteed Fine Gael seat in the constituency. A second one is looking increasingly like a tall order this time out.Phelan, meanwhile, would be on firmer ground in Carlow-Kilkenny, with colleague Carlow-based Pat Deering snapping at his heels. But every bit of publicity helps.All three were on a mission to milk this good news occasion by getting their mugs in as many photos with photogenic Leo as possible. With perseverance and luck, they might even bag a fleeting appearance on the television news.Alongside them, the Lord Mayor of Wexford, despite being a Fianna Fáil man, shamelessly elbowed himself into the frame whenever he could using his chain of office as a shield.Michael Sheehan is not expected to displace his party colleague and the constituency’s newest TD, Malcolm Byrne, winner of the Wexford bye-election in November, but it won’t be for the want of putting himself about.Byrne decided to stand back from the fray. “It’s a day for the engineers and builders” he said.Pride of Labour PartyAs Leo was engulfed in the rolling maul of his own ministers and one mayor, Labour leader and constituency elder statesman Brendan Howlin swooped in under them all, calmly greeted the Taoiseach and took it upon himself to escort him from his car.Brendan has a proprietorial interest in the new bypass.“I turned the sod on it when I was minister for public expenditure,” he said with pride. Howlin gave the green light to release almost €1 billion in 2012 for significant transport projects, including the New Ross bypass and bridge. And the happy minister for transport also claiming credit at the time was one Leo Varadkar.Graciously, Leo acknowledged his Labour colleague’s part in delivering the infrastructure during his speech.Also claiming credit on large posters in Wexford are the Ministers of State Kehoe and D’arcy: “Shortening your Journey. Delivering for Wexford.” You’d nearly think they built the road themselves.The large platform built on the pristine stretch of roadway with the impressive s of the bridge gleaming in the distance was groaning with public representatives for the formalities. Thankfully, a space was found for engineer (and local woman) Mary Bowe, the project manager.“This is the biggest platform party I’ve seen in a long time at one of these events,” marvelled a public servant. Why could that be? Something to do with the election? TDs from Wexford and Kilkenny took the bare look off the stage. Fianna Fáil’s James Brown and Bobby Aylward didn’t miss the the occasion. There were 21 men on the platform and 3 women (engineer par excellence, Mary Bowe the CEO of Kilkenny County Council and Rose Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, great grand-daughter of the Kennedy matriarch and JFK’s mother, Rose, in whose honour the bridge is named.)Vacant seatsThere were a couple of vacant seats. But Verona Murphy’s name wasn’t on one of them. She was there, at the edge of the crowd, standing near the large foundation stone waiting to be unveiled later by the man who invited her into Fine Gael and then booted her out. (Only herself to blame.)The photographers were hopeful. Windy junior ministers clustered around the Taoiseach aren’t the best material. So they kept an eye on Verona.“Will she approach him, do you think?” one of them asked a colleague. “I hope she f****** does,” came the reply.The speeches went on for a long, long time. There were three chains of office on the platform and more in the invited crowd. The Taoiseach was last to speak. He promised to be brief, recognising it was bitterly cold. At ten minutes, he nearly delivered on the promise.“By the power invested in me, none of you have homework tonight,” he declared, warming the cockles of the 100 hypothermic schoolchildren along to witness this great event. Contractors BAM, the contractors building the National Children’s Hospital, gave them all goodie bags – the children, not the politicians. They contained pens and sweeties.There was an ecumenical prayer service. The Church of Ireland representative cut an imposing figure, a very tall man, dressed for the weather with a voluminous black cape and a black broad brimmed hat. Some people thought he was Phil Hogan.A few Fianna Fáilers were calling the new road the “Howlin Highway”, just to annoy the Fine Gaelers.CountdownAfter the speeches, the Taoiseach went to the other side of the road to unveil the commemorative stone. Verona hovered, but was swallowed up in the crowd. The Taoiseach didn’t see her.Then he went further along the road, with the bridge to his back for the photos, and did the official cutting of the tape with Rose Kennedy Townsend.Leo was wearing very shiny black leather gloves. He held his side of the tape very tightly, wielding a gold pair of scissors and braced, feet apart and firmly planted, like he was preparing to cut the umbilical cord of an alien baby. Or cut all ties with Catherine Noone.He called for a countdown. There was silence. The junior ministers were so excited they couldn’t speak. So he had to do it himself. “5 . . . 4 . . .”Off to one side, Verona Murphy was working the crowd. Earlier, while the Taoiseach made his speech, she stood with her back to him, talking away to a companion.She made sure to avoid him after the formalities, yet was always nearby. He moved, she moved. Always within distance but never close enough for any form of contact.The photographers were beside themselves. But they were to be disappointed.When Leo left, the junior ministers melted away.“I tell you one thing,” mused an official as they departed. “If the Irish team performs half as well in the scrum as that lot performed today, we’ll win hands down against Scotland on Saturday.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4155503.1580324464!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"what are each parties transport election promises","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tAmong the proposals, Fianna Fáil has said it would  revive the shelved Dart Underground project, which would link the largely coastal line to Heuston Station. Photograph: iStockThe perception of being the local politician who “fixed the road” is often referred to as a bread and butter vote winner.Potholes are one thing but where does each party stand on transport policies, and what have they promised ahead of the general election?Public transportFine Gael has said it will examine if it is feasible to extend plans for the Dublin Link project further south-west to include stops at UCD, and to look at extending the Luas to Hazelhatch and Booterstown.The party has stood by the controversial BusConnects plan to redraw the Dublin Bus network, and if re-elected would commission a study on the “feasibility” of introducing free public transport for under 18s still in education.Fianna Fáil has committed to introducing free public transport for those under 18 years of age at a cost of €27 million, and to raising public transport funding by €30 million a year. It would also revive the shelved Dart Underground project, which would link the largely coastal line to Heuston Station.Sinn Féin has said it would reverse the privatisation of public bus routes “where possible” and has also committed to free public transport for all under 18s. The party’s manifesto set out several projects it would back if in power, such as the Western Rail Corridor, a light rail line for Cork city, and the extension of the Luas line to Bray, Finglas, Lucan and Poolbeg.The Greens Party is also in favour of free public transport for students and the introduction of a €365 annual travel pass. It will increase government subvention, create more park and ride and bike and ride facilities and make all trains fully accessible. It says all new urban buses would be 100 per cent electric or low emission hybrids.The party proposes building a new electric bus depot beside the M50 and introducing a rural bus network similar to one in operation in Kilkenny city with two routes operating every 30 minutes. It supports the BusConnects plan and prioritising buses on roads with an expanded quality bus corridor network and priority traffic light signalling for buses.Labour has pledged to reverse the privatisation of public transport, and to push through projects such as the Dublin Link.The Social Democrats would “significantly boost” subsidies to public transport companies, which would lead to a reduction in fares.People Before Profit would “move to a policy of free public transport to get people out of cars,” a call echoed by Solidarity.CyclingFine Gael wants at least €6 million a year from the carbon tax intake to be ring fenced and put towards cycling projects. The party says it would produce a “five year plan” to increase the number of people cycling to work on a daily basis from 57,000 up to 120,000.Fianna Fáil has pledged to create “cycle-friendly cities and towns”, saying it would invest €50 million in cycling infrastructure and introduce priority traffic signalling for cyclists.Sinn Féin says it would commission a nationwide, cross-border review to identify potential new greenways and cycle tracks.The Greens have proposed allowing cyclists to take left turns at red traffic lights (giving way to crossing pedestrians). It also wants to identify and redesign the 50 most dangerous junctions in the country to make them safer for cyclists. It would also fast track seven cycle routes in Dublin and extend and create greenways in Cork, Galway and Limerick.Labour says it would put 10 per cent of the national transport budget towards cycling and 10 per cent towards walking infrastructure. It also wants to expand public bike schemes to large towns.The Social Democrats says it would develop more “inter-urban cycleways and scenic greenways”. People Before Profit said it would improve cycling conditions in cities by “iding wide footpaths where there is less footfall”.RoadsFine Gael is committed to a 2:1 ratio of spending between public transport and road projects. Its manifesto pledges a “strong programme of investment in new roads” such as new bypasses of currently congested towns.Fianna Fáil has promised to green light several major road projects such as the M20 between Cork and Limerick and the A5 between Donegal and Derry. The party would also pilot a smartphone app allowing the public to alert local authorities of potholes that need to be fixed.Sinn Féin is also in favour of delivering on the M20 and A5 roads as well as trebling the funding available for improvements to smaller roads.The Green Party is openly opposed to the €5.7 billion pledged to national road schemes under the Project Ireland 2040 strategy, saying a focus on tarmac is “completely counterproductive” given Ireland’s need to reduce carbon emissions.Labour is committed to prioritising road projects that are required for “the economic development of cities and large towns outside of Dublin,” such as the North Ring Road in Cork.Social Democrats would commit to funding new road infrastructure “where there is a critical need” such as a “high grade connection” between Cork, Limerick and Galway."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4155248.1580312023!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"how republicans came to deify the presidency","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tUS president Donald Trump: Republicans who believe that Trump has a case to answer also know that he will turn his tweets, his voters and his donors on any who defy him. Photograph:  Mandel NganAFP via Getty ImagesIt was plain that Christian Bale is the actor of our times when he made constitutional jurisprudence sing on screen. As a fearsome Dick Cheney in Vice, he encounters, digests and then implements the “unitary executive theory”. This lavish construal of White House power, touted by right-wing lawyers in the 1970s, sidelines those bothersome checks and balances. It was the intellectual alibi for perhaps the mightiest vice-president in US history.This week, as Donald Trump’s lawyers fend off impeachment charges, the film rewards second viewing. The likes of Alan Dershowitz have not majored, you will notice, on the facts of the Ukraine scandal. Only so much time is spent on whether the president sought Kiev’s help against his domestic opponents, on pain of withheld aid. Instead, the legal defence is that such behaviour lies well inside his remit anyway. The quid pro quo purportedly set out in a new book by John Bolton, the former national security adviser, is not damning, says Dershowitz, “even if true”.When the Senate acquits Trump in the coming weeks, partisan fealty will be the main reason. That, and what Michael Gerson, the former speech writer to George W Bush, calls “understandable cowardice”. Republicans who believe that Trump has a case to answer also know that he will turn his tweets, his voters and his donors on any who defy him.There is another motive at work, though, and it is as troubling as naked fear and my-party-right-or-wrong. Lots of Republicans sincerely believe in an all-powerful presidency, at least when one of their own occupies it. Their vote to acquit is the culmination of half a century of conservative thought in that direction. And for all the uniqueness of Trump, his special knack for reducing once-serious conservatives to jelly, this deference to executive power will not vanish when he goes.Nixon and ReaganAfter likening Franklin Roosevelt to a monarch, conservatives rather came to terms with presidential power. They cited the unique exigencies of a world hegemon. Richard Nixon assumed wide discretion to prosecute the Vietnam war. Ronald Reagan needed legal cover for secret operations in Central America. Under Bush, it was the war on terror that justified a new round of centralisation, with Cheney as the de facto if not de jure beneficiary.Thus did the party of small government come to deify the White House. Thus did a party of constitutional originalists read sweeping powers into parsimonious text. It took a big-government liberal, Arthur Schlesinger, that fixture of Camelot, to deplore the “imperial” presidency.In China, the US has a different challenger now, but the Republican answer – a free hand for the commander-in-chief – never changes. It is all the more urgent, they would say, in a world of rising autocracies. Some conservatives fear for America’s viability as a superpower if its leader has to act with less freedom than is enjoyed by Xi Jinping (or Vladimir Putin in Russia or Turkey’s Recep Tayyip Erdogan).When liberals accuse the GOP of strongman-worship, they tend to mean a shallow and pathetic adulation, a schoolyard crush on the tough kid. If only. It is more thought through than that. It is a legal doctrine backed by a political analysis. At its core are misgivings about whether checks and balances, as presently constituted, are reconcilable with great-power status. This tension between limited government and national grandeur is innate to conservatism. John Locke does not always prevail over Thomas Hobbes. Raw powerA case in point is the Republican defence of this president. At times, it does not contest the facts so much as question all the fuss, as though there were something herbivorous and emasculating about constitutional niceties in a world governed by raw power. For all the focus on Trump, a President Mike Pompeo (now secretary of state) or a President Nikki Haley (the recent UN ambassador) could count on no less awesome latitude from Republicans.The partisanship behind the coming acquittal is aired often. It is the main part of the story, no doubt, but it is also the domestic part. The global dimension of what is the first impeachment over foreign policy is sometimes missed. For 50 years, conservatives have wondered if the president is too trammelled to guard US interests in a brutal world.It is not a frivolous concern. There are Europeans with similar qualms about the fragmented, consensualist EU in an age of unitary autocrats. Still, we are left to guess how Republicans will feel about an imperial presidency when it is Bernie Sanders or another Democrat atop the Augustan throne. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2020Read more about the Donald Trump administration"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons january 2020","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2019 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178.Coronavirus: Britons brought back from Wuhan could be quarantined in military baseRachmaninoff the most innovative composer ever...says computerBritain to stop exporting its plastic waste to developing countries under new environment legislation Homeowners should be asked how many neighbours they know to measure happiness, official review saysUnconditional offers with strings attached will reduce by up to 75 per cent in a year, Ucas saysNumber of children treated for eating disorders on NHS has increased by 50 per cent in two years, report revealsEnergy networks reap rewards as customers foot £800m bill, says Government Women\u0026#39s group call for new inquiry into slump in rape prosecutions after \u0026#39flawed\u0026#39 inspectionOnline harms are biggest threat to our children in the next decade, say parents Secondary schools will be given at least £5,000 per pupil from next year, Government saysHS2 should go ahead, Sajid Javid tells Boris Johnson Donald Trump\u0026#39s top diplomat Mike Pompeo says Huawei poses \u0026#39real risk\u0026#39 as he jets in for crunch talksBoris Johnson will tell the EU he is prepared to accept post-Brexit border checks Jackson Carlaw accuses Scottish Tory leadership opponent of lacking ideas and supportComment: Budget cuts will not solve the BBC\u0026#39s problemsComment: The EU has failed to grasp the whole political landscape has utterly changedFlag-waving Nigel Farage cut off in farewell speech as European Parliament ratifies Brexit dealSchools warned that they could face legal action if they fail to allow trans pupils to use toilets of choiceComedy over the heads of honours system, critics claim  Comment: The Eurosceptic mission will not be over until the EU withers awayDowning Street cuts out BBC as Boris Johnson films Brexit Day address to the nationWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus inside locked chinese city virus deja vu","story":"These days, getting fresh food in Foshan for Li Xiyan means waking early and having sharp elbows to fend off other people. Shops are struggling to replenish stocks after authorities blocked numerous transport links across China in efforts to contain the coronavirus outbreak.“The supermarkets don’t have much,” said Ms Li, 55, who lines up before the doors open at 8am. “It’s OK, we just eat less.But simple meals at home are a far cry from how she normally spends this time of year, celebrating the Lunar New Year holiday at banquets with family and friends.  In Foshan, in south-eastern Guangdong province, local officials have cancelled public events and shuttered tourist attractions – including a theme park honouring homegrown kung-fu icon Bruce Lee. Few cars travel the roads, shops are shuttered and empty public buses criss-cross the city, which is known for its textile manufacturing.  Many have obeyed the government’s recommendation to stay at home to try and reduce exposure to the new virus, which has infected nearly 7,711 and killed more than 170.Guangdong has confirmed more than 200 cases, making it the second hardest-hit after Hubei province, which is home to Wuhan, the epicentre of the outbreak. Wuhan is on lockdown as experts race to work out the cause of the virus, and how to stop it, and British nationals have been evacuated.For many in Foshan, this is old news – this city is where scientists believe the first Sars case developed, a coronavirus epidemic that originated in China, spread abroad, and killed nearly 800 people in 2002 and 2003.  “It’s not that scary,” Ms Li says. “We’ve been through this before.”  As of midnight Tuesday, the number of cases exceeded the 5,327 people infected by Sars nearly two decades ago.  The figures have been ticking rapidly upward in the four weeks since China announced it was investigating a new mystery disease, though the country\u0027s centre for disease control estimates a mortality rate of less than 3 per cent, lower than the 10 per cent that were affected by Sars.The government is providing more frequent updates now than it did in 2002, when officials actively suppressed news of the Sars outbreak, exacerbating disease spread and creating panic and confusion among residents. Still, there is growing evidence that the official numbers released may not paint the full picture just yet.The  interviewed Kyle Hui, 42, whose stepmother Chen Min, 65, died within 10 days of developing a fever and cough – symptoms consistent with the new coronavirus infection.  But doctors never tested her for the disease, and her death wasn’t included in the official government count, suggesting the scale of the problem remains far greater than Chinese authorities have acknowledged.  Updates are even harder to come by for doctors working in hospitals designated for treating coronavirus patients, including at the Foshan No. 1 People’s Hospital, where two workers in hazmat suits, blue latex gloves and face masks, pictured below, checked the temperature of everyone entering the building.The infectious diseases ward had its doors propped open, and a sole doctor’s coat hung outside the canteen, as teams of police patrolled the ground. One officer shooed the  away.Information about new developments, including the number of admitted patients infected with the new coronavirus, is hard to come by at the hospital.“There’s no internal communication – we aren’t told much,” said Mr Yang, a doctor at the hospital, who declined to give his full name as he wasn’t authorised to speak to media.Instead, details are being reported to senior health authorities, before being passed on and disseminated through China’s state-controlled media outlets, from where he and the rest of the country’s 1.4 billion citizens are getting their information.“The situation is very serious,” he said. “Now we know it’s contagious and the risks are very high.”“It’s tiring work, being a doctor – it’s hard and dangerous,” he said. “But this is the way things are right now in the country hopefully, it will get better.”  Doctors at The First People\u0026#39s Hospital of Foshan are struggling with poor communication about the virusLocals, though, find the state media updates reassuring. Zhang Yonghang, 30, an English teacher, follows them daily, and remains unfussed, even though China has now raised the highest public health alert.“I don’t think it’s as bad as back then,” Ms Zhang said, referring to the Sars epidemic, when she remembers being worried. “This time, It seems like the government is more nervous, because of all the Lunar New Year travel.”“Staying at home, we’ve been quite bored,” she said, while taking a stroll with her husband and three-year-old daughter in a park next to the Foshan hospital. Long days of doing little will continue for the next few weeks as her school has delayed the start of classes until mid-February.Not everyone is so relaxed. Delivery man Mr Fei, 23, pictured below, in neighbouring Guangzhou, a city of 15 million and the capital of Guangdong province, slips on gloves for protection when he send takeaway deliveries to hospitals.“Of course I’m worried when I have to fulfill those,” he said. “But if I feel that way, others will, too, which means if I push it off, they might as well.”“So I think I better just do it – at this time, it’s better to be strong and help out.”Mr Fei, a delivery man in GuangzhouWith the disease outbreak, fewer orders are coming in, and he expects to take home half of his usual wages – at most 3,000 yuan (£330) this month. So he’s now looking for temporary jobs to make up the difference.Mr Fei, like anyone who ventures outside, is now required to don a face mask. People are also frequently stopped at mall entrances, toll booths, makeshift roadside stands, even parking garage entrances to have their body temperatures checked.  Workers are screening for a fever, an indicator of a potential coronavirus infection, though it’s unclear how effective this will be in combating further spread as scientists have found it’s possible to be infected and not display any symptoms.Members of the public have their body temperature screened at a mall in FoshanExperts are racing to understand the novel coronavirus, investigating how the virus jumped between humans and figuring out in what ways people become infected – all important clues that could inform disease prevention and treatment.  “Now we know there are second, or third-generation cases that have come from those first cases,” said David Heymann, an infectious disease expert at Chatham House, who led the global response to Sars as the executive director of the World Health Organization’s communicable diseases cluster.  “The question we have is, how is it transmitted?” he said. “Is it just by close bodily contact, is it face-to-face when someone coughs in another person’s face?”Until experts discover more about the new virus, allowing health officials to get a better handle on the situation, many Chinese will continue lining up for fever checks and disinfectant spritzes – a handy solution as shops are all out of anti-bacterial hand gels, soaps, wet wipes and cleaning liquids.Cleaners will also keep disinfecting hotel lobbies, shopping centres, and elevators, with signs everywhere showing the sanitising schedule.It’s hard to think about much else with public health announcements emblazoned on billboards – “Have you washed your hands today? Did you remember a face mask today?” – along with propaganda slogans about “government control” over the epidemic.In rural villages, they’re even broadcast on loop over loudspeakers.  Still, Ms Li says life keeps on churning for her and her daughter, Li Sha, 28. The main difference is that they’ve hoarded face masks and always carry a bit of disinfectant hand gel with them.  But “the vegetables are a little bit more expensive,” complained Ms Li. Coronavirus: Britons brought back from Wuhan could be quarantined in military baseRachmaninoff the most innovative composer ever...says computerBritain to stop exporting its plastic waste to developing countries under new environment legislation Homeowners should be asked how many neighbours they know to measure happiness, official review saysUnconditional offers with strings attached will reduce by up to 75 per cent in a year, Ucas saysNumber of children treated for eating disorders on NHS has increased by 50 per cent in two years, report revealsEnergy networks reap rewards as customers foot £800m bill, says Government Women\u0026#39s group call for new inquiry into slump in rape prosecutions after \u0026#39flawed\u0026#39 inspectionOnline harms are biggest threat to our children in the next decade, say parents Secondary schools will be given at least £5,000 per pupil from next year, Government saysHS2 should go ahead, Sajid Javid tells Boris Johnson Donald Trump\u0026#39s top diplomat Mike Pompeo says Huawei poses \u0026#39real risk\u0026#39 as he jets in for crunch talksBoris Johnson will tell the EU he is prepared to accept post-Brexit border checks Jackson Carlaw accuses Scottish Tory leadership opponent of lacking ideas and supportComment: Budget cuts will not solve the BBC\u0026#39s problemsComment: The EU has failed to grasp the whole political landscape has utterly changedFlag-waving Nigel Farage cut off in farewell speech as European Parliament ratifies Brexit dealSchools warned that they could face legal action if they fail to allow trans pupils to use toilets of choiceComedy over the heads of honours system, critics claim  Comment: The Eurosceptic mission will not be over until the EU withers awayDowning Street cuts out BBC as Boris Johnson films Brexit Day address to the nationWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/02/14/18/Airbus-A380.jpg","title":"airbus corruption investigation settlement investigation sfo bribery","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.European plane maker faces multi-billion euro fine but avoids criminal prosecution over alleged bribery schemeAirbus has agreed a settlement likely to cost billions of dollars over allegations of bribery and corruption.The European plane maker reached a deal with British, French and US authorities after a three-year investigation into payments made to intermediaries to secure contracts for jet sales.“Airbus confirms that it has reached agreement in principle with the French Parquet National Financier, the UK Serious Fraud Office and the US authorities,” the aerospace group said.Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“These agreements are made in the context of investigations into allegations of bribery and corruption as well as compliance with the US international traffic in arms regulations.

The discovery of the crater, named\u0026nbspOccator, led some to speculate that it had been constructed by an alien civilisation – though it is most likely just an accident of light and shadow on the surface.In the new research, conducted by scientists from the\u0026nbspUniversity of Cadiz and published in the journal\u0026nbspActa Astronautica, participants were shown one of those mysterious formations on the planet\u0027s surface. They were then asked to describe what they saw, with many people pointing out the unusual formation.The scientists then did the same with an artificial intelligence system, which had been trained to spot squares and triangles in images. The AI also spotted the formations – and, once it had, it meant that participants also saw them too.Both people and artificial intelligence detected a square structure in the images, but the AI also identified a triangle, said Gabriel G\u0026nbspDe la Torre, the neuropsychologist who led the study.\u0026nbspAnd when the triangular option was shown to humans, the percentage of persons claiming to see it also increased significantly.The researchers said the study should warn those hunting for alien civilisations that the use of artificial intelligence could confuse us and tell us that it has detected impossible or false things.

The latest version of Apple’s wireless earbuds\u0026nbspAirPods sold well during the festive season.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesShares in the company rose 1 per cent after the announcement. Apple has more than doubled in value since a low last year, adding more than $725bn\u0026nbsp(£560bn)\u0026nbspto its market capitalisation and cementing its position as America’s most valuable company.Apple sold $56bn-worth\u0026nbsp(£43bn) of iPhone 11s in the quarter, following the launch of the latest iteration of the firm’s flagship handset in September.

Those currently paying a lot in daily fees are likely to see their borrowing costs reduced while those who are less heavily into their overdrafts will pay more.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Torches are lit using a flare ahead of the Up Helly Aa Viking festival.

Britain will go to the polls tomorrow to voteA surfer off the North East coast at TynemouthThe FCA said on Tuesday that it has asked banks how they decided on their new rates, which have clustered around 40 per cent. It has previously warned that it would look at introducing a cap on overdraft charges if lenders did not introduce competitive rates.HSBC, First Direct, M\u0026ampS Bank and TSB will all introduce rates of 39.9 per cent while NatWest is to charge half a percentage point less. Nationwide has already brought in a 39.9 per cent rate for its current accounts and Barclays will charge 35 per cent.Lloyds Banking Group has said its customers will be charged new “personalised” overdraft rates of up to 49.9 per cent from April.In a letter to lenders, the FCA wrote: “We are writing to you to understand more about your new overdraft pricing and the measures you have in place to help customers who may be adversely impacted by the changes you are making to this pricing.”The watchdog introduced changes to overdraft rules after it found that unarranged overdraft fees can be 10 times as high as charges for payday loans.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The latest version of Apple’s wireless earbuds\u0026nbspAirPods sold well during the festive season.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesShares in the company rose 1 per cent after the announcement. Apple has more than doubled in value since a low last year, adding more than $725bn\u0026nbsp(£560bn)\u0026nbspto its market capitalisation and cementing its position as America’s most valuable company.Apple sold $56bn-worth\u0026nbsp(£43bn) of iPhone 11s in the quarter, following the launch of the latest iteration of the firm’s flagship handset in September.

Factories outside Wuhan area will not reopen after the lunar new year holiday until 10 February, Mr Cook said, but Apple built the delayed restart into its wider revenue forecast.Additional reporting by agenciesShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Those currently paying a lot in daily fees are likely to see their borrowing costs reduced while those who are less heavily into their overdrafts will pay more.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Torches are lit using a flare ahead of the Up Helly Aa Viking festival.

Britain will go to the polls tomorrow to voteA surfer off the North East coast at TynemouthThe FCA said on Tuesday that it has asked banks how they decided on their new rates, which have clustered around 40 per cent. It has previously warned that it would look at introducing a cap on overdraft charges if lenders did not introduce competitive rates.HSBC, First Direct, M\u0026ampS Bank and TSB will all introduce rates of 39.9 per cent while NatWest is to charge half a percentage point less. Nationwide has already brought in a 39.9 per cent rate for its current accounts and Barclays will charge 35 per cent.Lloyds Banking Group has said its customers will be charged new “personalised” overdraft rates of up to 49.9 per cent from April.In a letter to lenders, the FCA wrote: “We are writing to you to understand more about your new overdraft pricing and the measures you have in place to help customers who may be adversely impacted by the changes you are making to this pricing.”The watchdog introduced changes to overdraft rules after it found that unarranged overdraft fees can be 10 times as high as charges for payday loans.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Ms Melis suggested that deregulation after Brexit could help persuade financial services businesses to remain in the UK.“If the government can position the UK as having a more favourable regulatory environment and separate it from the red tape of European regulation, then we may see the UK win back its crown and attract new talent to the sector,” Melis said.Adopting a light-touch approach to regulation after Brexit – dubbed the “Singapore-on-Thames” model by some critics – would likely prove controversial.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The world is watching to see if the UK and the EU can overcome the political hurdles around Brexit and secure a deal that makes economic sense.\u0026nbsp“With European economies facing significant economic headwinds, it is vital that policymakers keep a sharp weather eye on wider European competitiveness, and seek to maintain open and unfettered access to global capital markets through Europe’s primary international financial centre in the UK.”Separate research conducted by ZYen found that New York overtook London as the world’s top banking hub in September 2018 and extended its lead last year.Despite the increasingly bleak sentiment about London’s future, its financial sector is still expanding at a healthy clip, at least on some measures.The UK’s net exports of financial and related professional services grew by around 5 per cent to an estimated £82.8bn in 2018, up from £79bn in 2017.\u0026nbspIn currency markets, London has consolidated its dominant position, accounting for 43 per cent of global foreign exchange revenues last year.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

There’s no doubt about that.”London state school praised by Stormzy secures 51 Oxbridge offersMr Millward added: “I think there’s a real issue about capitalising on the talents across all parts of the country.“Nobody would say looking at the current profile of people going into the most selective universities that that reflects the talent and potential of students across the country.\u0026nbsp“This is really about improving opportunity for people who could benefit from that kind of education and don’t currently. That’s a fairness issue.”An Oxford University spokesperson said: “Greater competition inevitably means more students will be disappointed, but we want the best talent possible for the outstanding education we offer.”They added: “More than 69 per cent of undergraduate offers were made to pupils attending state schools, and a record number to those from under-represented backgrounds.“The changes we have brought in, with widespread support across the university and its colleges, have increased and ersified the pool of students applying to and receiving offers from Oxford.”Only a handful of black academics in top roles in British universitiesUK universities ‘increasingly reliant’ on income from Chinese studentsHalf of bosses at elite universities handed larger pay packetsThe OfS said access to university has been a “postcode lottery”, with young people from the northeast and southwest of England much less likely to go into higher education than those in London.Sir Michael Barber, chairman of OfS, said: “What is an assumed rite of passage for many young people across the country is often viewed very differently in rural and coastal communities, the industrial heartlands and military towns.“The north-south ide crops up in many debates around equal opportunities, and higher education is no exception.”Universities found to have failed to improve access can face sanctions by the watchdog including fines.\u0026nbspChris Skidmore, universities minister, said: “It is damning for the sector that large gaps still remain between disadvantaged students and their peers.”He added: “I am pleased to see universities being ambitious in their plans to reach out to those from disadvantaged backgrounds and to support them through their studies. But for universities which do not meet their registration conditions, I fully support the Office for Students to take appropriate action.”Office for Students\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspUniversity of Oxford\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Ms Melis suggested that deregulation after Brexit could help persuade financial services businesses to remain in the UK.“If the government can position the UK as having a more favourable regulatory environment and separate it from the red tape of European regulation, then we may see the UK win back its crown and attract new talent to the sector,” Melis said.Adopting a light-touch approach to regulation after Brexit – dubbed the “Singapore-on-Thames” model by some critics – would likely prove controversial.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Show all 4Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.After hosting the Golden Globes from 2010 to 2012, Gervais returned to the ceremony in 2016 – and chose to devote part of his opening monologue to joking about Caitlyn Jenner, who had recently come out as transgender and was documenting her transition publicly. “Hey @RickyGervais. It’s 2016. Jokes at the expense of trans people are so tired. Catch up,” GLAAD tweeted at the time. Gervais has since doubled down on this line of comedy in a Netflix special. In September 2019, he tweeted: “You can joke about whatever the f*** you like. And some people won\u0027t like it and they will tell you they don\u0027t like it. And then it\u0027s up to you whether you give a f*** or not. And so on. It\u0027s a good system.” Hence, the bottom spot in this ranking.Fresh off a particularly biting 2011 hosting set, was Gervais struggling to figure out just the right amount of meanness for the ceremony? The comedian didn’t seem quite like himself that time around. He delivered some good lines, among them: “For any of you who don’t know, the Golden Globes are just like the Oscars, but without all that… esteem” and “The Hollywood Foreign Press have warned me that if I insult any of you, or any of them, or offend any viewers, or cause any controversy whatsoever, they’ll definitely invite me back next year.” Still, this year doesn’t stand out in Gervais’s Golden Globes history.In 2011, Gervais’s jokes were so incisive, so daring and – let’s just say it, mean – that they elicited occasional gasps from the audience. Over the course of the evening, the comedian took aim at the 2010 film The Tourist starring Johnny Depp and Angelina Jolie (“It seems like everything this year was three-dimensional, except the characters in The Tourist,” he quipped), Robert Downey Jr, and the president of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, which organises the Golden Globes. Gervais’s set was so controversial that some wondered whether it would prove to be his last – but the comedian has now been invited back three more times.Gervais’s first turn as host was also his best. Almost 10 years ago, the comedian proved to be a delightfully sarcastic emcee, capable of the most ferocious take-downs. His best lines of the night were delivered with fake enthusiasm, such as when Gervais – the creator of the original version of The Office in the UK, tore into the US version starring Steve Carell (“Where does he get his ideas from?” Gervais mused). The 2010 ceremony also included this brilliant bit about writers in Hollywood: “This next category is a bit of a downer, to be honest: it’s for writing. We all know writers get way too much credit in Hollywood, and that’s due to the generosity of actors sometimes mentioning them.” And let’s not forget what is perhaps Gervais’s most celebrated Golden Globes quip, through which he introduced Mel Gibson to the stage: “I like a drink as much as the next man,” Gervais said, glass in hand. “Unless the next man… is Mel Gibson.”After hosting the Golden Globes from 2010 to 2012, Gervais returned to the ceremony in 2016 – and chose to devote part of his opening monologue to joking about Caitlyn Jenner, who had recently come out as transgender and was documenting her transition publicly. “Hey @RickyGervais.

When they arrive at the Earth\u0027s ionosphere, they excite the oxygen and nitrogen atoms found in the upper atmosphere, and that energy is released as lights.Created with Sketch.Northern Lights across the UK - in pictures Show all 6Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The beautiful colours of light shining through the Sycamore Gap at Hadrian\u0027s Wall in NorthumberlandThe sky surrounding St Mary\u0027s Lighthouse in Whitley Bay, NorthumberlandThis shot was taken in NorthumberlandThe beautiful skies could be spotted across the sea in Giant\u0027s Causeway, Northern IrelandThe lights seen over Great Park in NewcastleA beach in Saltburn, North YorkshireThe beautiful colours of light shining through the Sycamore Gap at Hadrian\u0027s Wall in NorthumberlandThe sky surrounding St Mary\u0027s Lighthouse in Whitley Bay, NorthumberlandThis shot was taken in NorthumberlandThe beautiful skies could be spotted across the sea in Giant\u0027s Causeway, Northern IrelandThe lights seen over Great Park in NewcastleA beach in Saltburn, North YorkshireWhile the northern lights are often seen as one phenomenon, they are something like clouds: there are a whole host of different kinds, each of which are formed in their own particular ways.The new discovery began when the University of Helsinki\u0027s\u0026nbspMinna Palmroth looked to collect these different kinds of northern lights, in collaboration with enthusiasts. Those hobbyists took photographs of thousands of different examples of the northern lights, which she picked through and categorised for a book to guide those watching the\u0026nbspaurora borealis.A complete guide to the Northern LightsBut as the hobbyists collected those images through Facebook, they found that many of them included a kind of auroral form that was not part of the existing classification. Those were set aside to be examined later, and the book was published.Just days after it came out, enthusiasts spotted the mysterious form again: they saw a green-tinged, even set of waves that looked similar to dunes on a sandy beach. They told Professor Palmroth, who was able to get to work looking into it.One of the most memorable moments of our research collaboration was when the phenomenon appeared at that specific time and we were able to examine it in real time, says Northern Lights and astronomy hobbyist\u0026nbspMatti\u0026nbspHelin\u0026nbspin a statement.The hobbyists and space researchers worked together to collate photos from across Finland. Combining the images – and looking for clues such as stars in the background – allowed the scientists to discover where exactly the lights were coming from.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Inouye Solar Telescope (DKIST) in Hawaii — which is twice the size of the next largest solar scope — have captured an array of cell-like structures that cover the surface of the sun, each taking up space roughly the size of the US state of Texas.It is hoped that by focussing on these areas, scientists may be better able to predict changes in the sun’s surface — including solar flares that can knock out power grids and put satellites at risk.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesFrance Córdova, National Science Foundation (NSF) director, said: “Since NSF began work on this ground-based telescope, we have eagerly awaited the first images.\u0026nbsp“We can now share these images and videos, which are the most detailed of our Sun to date.

His partner, Jade Samuel, is currently on maternity leave and is due to return to work in two weeks, but won’t be able to if he\u0026nbsphas left the country, which he said would leave her “struggling to cope”.Mr\u0026nbspNembhard, who has been fighting his immigration case for years, said: “I’m really depressed. I cry when I think about my child. It’s really sensitive because I’m the world to her, and she’s the same to me. We have a really close bond and this is all starting to affect her.“My partner will struggle to cope. I don’t know what I’ll do if I have to leave my kids. The Home Office is destroying their lives.”The Jamaica charter flight is an outrage – but so are many othersDozens to be deported on first Jamaica charter flight since WindrushThe Jamaican national arrived to the UK on a visit visa in\u0026nbsp1999. He met his ex-wife and applied to remain in the country with her but his application was refused.He continued to fight the case but was accused of assault by his ex-wife\u0026nbsp– whom he had by this point separated from and got together with Ms Samuel – an allegation he still denies.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailThe courts found him guilty and he was sentenced to prison shortly after his daughter was born. He was then immediately detained under immigration powers, before being released on bail and settling down in\u0026nbspLondon with Ms Samuel\u0026nbspand their daughter.In February 2019, he was one of several Jamaicans\u0026nbspthreatened with deportation despite being key witnesses in the inquest into the death of an immigration detainee – but he was granted last-minute reprieve after solicitors intervened.Without immigration status, Mr Nembhard has been unable to work, but Ms Samuel, who works as a supervisor at a jewellery wholesalers, said the family “makes it work” as he is able to care for the children while she works.“He’s an amazing dad. He is their primary carer. I want to be able to work and continue providing for my family. If he is deported I’ll become a single mum, I’d have to rely on benefits. I’ve never had to do that. It took me a long time to get to this position at work but this means I will have to stop working,” she said.“When he was detained on Monday, I did the school run instead of him. My daughter asked, ‘Where’s dad? Has he gone to that place again?’ She’s been emotional. I’ve had to let her school know. She keeps asking when he’s coming home. They’re really close.Dozens to be deported on first Jamaica charter flight since Windrush“The immigration situation has really shaken us up over the past few years. Every time we get a bit of stability, they seem to take him away again. He deserves to be with his family. Here is where his life is.”Mr Nembhard was detained despite the fact that he had a “further submissions” appointment with the Home Office in March where his immigration case was going to be reconsidered.David\u0026nbspLammy, the family’s local MP, condemned the Home Office for putting them in this situation, saying the lives of Mr\u0026nbspNembhard’s\u0026nbspBritish wife and children were being “devastated” by the department’s “gross mishandling” of the case.The Labour MP said more broadly\u0026nbspthat it was wrong for the Home Office to be chartering deportation flights to Jamaica and other parts of the Caribbean before the delayed\u0026nbspWindrush\u0026nbspreview has been published, adding: “How can the home secretary be sure she is not making the same mistakes?”Naga Kandiah, of MTC Solicitors, who is representing Mr Nembhard, said his detention was making it difficult to effectively prepare for his Home Office interview in March, and accused the Home Office of acting in a “harsh and heartless” manner towards\u0026nbspBritish children and their parents.“Without notification, Mr Nembhard was detained. Due to the complexity of his case, we need to obtain all of his past papers from previous solicitors, coroner’s inquest papers, instruct medical and social worker reports, but we cannot do this as effectively as he is incarcerated,” he said.“His family are suffering due to the absence of Mr Nembhard at home. His British wife and British children are not only deeply worried by him being incarcerated with no certainty, but also, struggling to cope as a family unit in day to day activities.”The Home Office said it will be operating a charter flight to Jamaica in the coming weeks and those being deported had all been convicted of crimes in the UK.A spokesperson added: “Foreign nationals who abuse our hospitality by committing crimes in the UK\u0026nbspshould be in no doubt of our determination to deport them. Our priority will always be to keep the British public safe.“The UK, like many other countries, uses charter flights to return people to their country of origin when they have no legal right to remain.\u0026nbsp“The majority of those returned are on scheduled, commercial flights but this isn’t always an option, especially if the inidual is a foreign national offender.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

It seemed like there\u0027s a disconnect.When he approached the candidate at a small campaign event at Urban Dreams in Des Moines, Mr Fallon says he was expecting Mr Biden to address the concerns I was raising about climate change.Instead, he says, he was surprised that Mr Biden appeared to deflect his support, should Mr Biden be selected as the Democratic nominee in the general election, during which he ostensibly would want to earn Mr Fallon\u0027s vote.He just made it more difficult, Mr Fallon says.Mr Biden has pushed back against several would-be voters throughout his campaign, including telling an immigration activist in South Carolina to vote for Trump and telling another man in Iowa — who the candidate also called a damn liar —\u0026nbspthat he\u0027s too old to vote for him.On his website, Mr Fallon writes that his most recent exchange is disturbing on a number of levels.He said: His propensity to violate personal space is a huge non-asset in politics, and his frequent gaffes are prime fodder for opponents and the media. ... Most important, Biden is simply wrong on climate change, and out-of-step with voters on so many issues.Mr Fallon says he supports Mr Steyer for his track record of environmental advocacy and promise to declare a climate emergency on the first day of his administration, if elected.On Twitter, Mr Steyer addressed Mr Biden, telling him: This is no way to treat an Iowan. He said he\u0027d vote for the Dem in the general bc he knows how important it is to beat Trump. We need immediate action on climate. If you don\u0027t agree, happy to talk @ debate.

German courts ruled egg producers could continue grinding male chicks to death until a scaleable means of determining the sex of an embryo in an egg was found.Shredding of chicks is permissible under EU law, so long as death is instantaneous and the bird is less than 72 hours old.\u0026nbspChick-fil-A to end donations to anti-LGBTQ organisationsHundreds of songbird chicks starve to death in European heatwaveSame-sex penguin couple have welcomed their first adopted chickParent bird spotted feeding cigarette butt to chickMr Guillaume said the same timescale would apply to banning the castration of piglets without anaesthesia, according to AFP.Boars are usually castrated to encourage animals reared for meat to put on weight, and because fat in the meat from uncastrated pigs can apparently gives off a more potent smell when cooked, and is known as “boar taint”. But boar taint only usually affects 20 per cent of uncastrated pigs.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

We would like to draw readers’ attention to the fact that sadly, the UK egg industry treats male chicks as though they are inanimate waste products, not living, breathing animals who are all iniduals and feel pain and suffering. They are routinely gassed at just a day old.“Laying hens, even in free range systems, can be crammed many thousands at a time into noisy, dusty, filthy sheds, some never able to access the outdoors. This is a far cry from the deceptive imagery on egg box packaging, with happy hens roaming freely in the sunshine, abundant grass underfoot. Once their laying declines and they are no longer deemed economically viable, they are typically crammed into crates and trucked off to the slaughterhouse at just a fraction of their natural life.\u0026nbsp“But really, we have no need to use and abuse animals in food production. The best thing we can do to help end this shocking cruelty is to give up eggs and other animal products and embrace a cruelty-free, vegan diet instead.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

So far  people have been tested across the country - all have been confirmed negative by the Department of Health.The World Health Organisation is not yet calling this a global emergency - but how deadly is this outbreak Existing data concludes a rough fatality rate of two per cent, meaning one in  people die of the infection. Some  to  per cent of cases are severe, meaning people require hospital treatment or ventilation as the disease causes a pneumonia-like illness.While the SARS-like virus, known as -nCoV, is fast becoming an international cause for concern, it is still a far cry from the virus pandemics in the past, which have ravaged entire countries and claimed millions of lives.Here we take a closer look at the worst ever pandemic viruses to date.It was a case of pass the plague in  A.D. when an early case of smallpox broke out.Known as the Antonine plague, it began with the Huns who then infected the Germans, who passed it onto the Romans whose troops spread it throughout the Roman Empire.Galen, a Greek physician, witnessed the outbreak and recorded the symptoms: blackish diarrhoea, which suggested gastrointestinal bleeding, intensive coughing, foul-smelling breath and red and black skin eruptions all over their body.The total deaths have been estimated at five million, and the disease killed as much as one-third of the population in some areas and devastated the Roman army.This plague continued until about  A.D, claiming Emperor Marcus Aurelius as one of its victims.From  to  an outbreak of the Black Death ravaged Europe, Africa and Asia, with an estimated death toll between  and million people.Thought to have originated in Asia, the Plague most likely jumped continents via fleas living on rats that lived aboard merchant ships.It took ten to fourteen days before the plague killed off most of a contaminated rat colony, by which time, after three days of fasting, hungry rat fleas would then turn on humans, their bite causing a swelling – or “bubo” — most often in the groin, on the thigh, in an armpit or on the neck.Hence the name bubonic plague.The infection took three to five days to incubate in people before they fell ill, and another three to five days before, in  per cent of the cases, the victims died.The Black Death began in London in the poor, overcrowded parish of St. Giles-in-the-Field and ended up wiping out  percent of the population during that terrible summer.When it hit a household, the house was sealed, a red cross painted on the door and the whole family was condemned to death.Dead bodies became so prevalent that many remained rotting on the ground and it created a constant stench.The Spanish flu pandemic, often regarded as one of the deadliest in history, killed an estimated million people of the million it infected as it tore through Europe in  and travelled to the US, killing , Americans.By comparison, the First World War, which ended in , had around million deaths.The first wave of the  pandemic occurred in the spring and was generally mild with the sick experiencing typical flu symptoms such as chills, fever and fatigue then recovering after several days.However, a second, highly contagious wave appeared with a vengeance in autumn of that same year and victims died within hours or days of developing symptoms, their skin turning blue and their lungs filling with fluid that caused them to suffocate.At the time, there were no effective drugs or vaccines to treat it. Citizens were ordered to wear masks, schools, theatres and businesses were shuttered and bodies piled up in makesht morgues with many having to dig graves for their own family members.It became known around the world as the Spanish flu, as Spain was hit hard by the disease and not subject to the wartime news blackouts that affected other European countries.What separated the  flu pandemic from other influenza outbreaks was the victims — instead of killing young people and the elderly, it struck down completely healthy young adults, while leaving children and those with weaker immune systems still alive.By the summer of , the flu pandemic came to an end, as those that were infected either died or developed immunity.Asian Flu was a pandemic outbreak of Influenza A of the HN subtype that originated in China in  and lasted until .In the first few months, it spread throughout China and its regions but by the midsummer it had reached the United States, where it initially infected relatively few people.Several months later, however, numerous cases of infection were reported, especially in young children, the elderly, and pregnant women.The pandemic also reached the UK and by December a total of , deaths had been reported in England and Wales.Estimates for the death toll y depending on the source, but the World Health Organization places the final tally at approximately million, , of those in the US alone.The Zika virus is a mosquito-borne flavivirus transmitted primarily by the aggressive blood-sucking Aedes aegypti mosquitoes and symptoms included fever, rash, joint pain and red eyes.In May , the first local transmission of Zika virus was reported in Brazil and researchers believed the virus was introduced during the August  World Sprint Championship canoe race, held in Rio de Janeiro, which attracted participants from four Pacic Island nations, including French Polynesia, with active Zika transmission.The virus soon spread and affected more than .million people in  countries, thanks to the mosquito’s ability to thrive in city le, flourishing in litter, open ditches, clogged drains, old tyre dumps and crowded flimsy dwellings.The virus was also linked to thousands of babies in Brazil being born with microcephaly, a neurological disorder where the baby had an underdeveloped brain and an abnormally small head.There were also a rising number of stillbirths and miscarriages in mothers infected with the virus.The children that did survive faced intellectual disability and developmental delays.From the first reported case on July ,  in Hong Kong, it took only  days before outbreaks of this virus — referred to as the Hong Kong Flu — were reported in Singapore and Vietnam, and within three months had spread to The Philippines, India, Australia, Europe, and the United States.While the  pandemic had a comparatively low mortality rate, it still resulted in the deaths of more than a million people, including , residents of Hong Kong itself, approximately  per cent of its population at the time.  Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The police denied her a lawyer. The Mayor of Ayia Napa threatened to sue her unless she withdrew the rape allegations. And the judge conducting her trial refused to hear crucial evidence.Now, her harrowing diaries reveal just how much she suffered at their hands.If the British Government is to prevent others going through a similar ordeal, it must act without delay.First, the Prime Minister must throw his full weight behind her brave appeal to clear her name.If that doesn’t work, the Foreign Office should make no bones about advising Brits not to travel to Cyprus.Why  Because the island clearly needs a kick up the backside to reform its broken legal system. And a financially devastating exodus of British tourists would provide exactly that.We don’t believe it’s at all likely that a woman would consent to sex with a dozen strangers. Andyou accept that, then it’s crystal clear this young woman has been the victim of a shocking and preventable miscarriage of justice.Our government has a moral duty to stand by her side.

It began in the far eastback in  and since then, has spread to Italy, Argentina, Mexico, South Africa and Vietnam, where it’s presented by Hoang Rapper. Seriously.Five weeks ago the global pandemic reached Britain and those millions of us who were infected have spent an uncomfortable month trying to work outThe Masked Singer is so bad it’s good or merely so bad it’s an affront to humanity.Somewhat reluctantly, I’ve finally got to admit it’s the former, despite having more than enough self-inflicted wounds and production flaws to sink most programmes.The Masked Singer is, for starters, no sort of contest, and while some of the singers, like Chameleon Justin Hawkins, disguise their identity brilliantly, John Barrowman could no more hide his showbiz light under the Large Hadron Collider than he could a unicorn outfit.There are also issues with that hopelessly random , Jonathan, Rita, Davina McCall and Donny Osmond Ken Jeong, who are either deliberately muddying the waters or are actually thick and deluded enough to believe a Joel Dommett-fronted show might also feature “Margot Robbie”, “Ray Winstone”, “Gemma Arterton”, “Helen Mirren” and “Olivia Colman”, in fancy dress outfits.God knows, it must be hard for them to confront the idea The Masked Singer is now the biggest thing in their careers. The only people I actually feel sorry for, though, are the poor dancers who’ve suffered the torments of hell on this show.The absolute worst of which was doing the twist, wearing only towels and snorkels, while that trippy octopus thing sang Splish Splash standing up in a bath. Yet still I watch. Why  Well, I’ve no realistic choice when the alternative is as tedious as BBC’s The Greatest Dancer.But I’d also choose The Masked Singer over X Factor, The Voice UK and practically any other Saturday night alternative the two main channels have served up recently, for the simple reason the basic guessing game concept and the end-of-show reveal are infuriatingly brilliant.Indeed, I’d go so far as to say Tutankhamun removing his head to reveal former Home Secretary Alan Johnson is one of the TV highlights of the year so far. Inevitably, the overlong shows, repetitive nature of the process and relative disappointments, like discovering it was Kelis in the daisy outfit, will quickly cure me.I’m sticking with The Masked Singer for now, though, because a slightly better bet than Natalie Cole has just reared its head in the duck outfit. After several weeks insisting it was a Spice Girl, Jonathan Ross now thinks: “It could be Diane Abbott . . . ”And, you never know, she might even do her own version of a Spice Girls song,  Become . I’ve rarely wanted anything more.BEST TV hour of the past week was Channel ’s SAS: Who Dares Wins, despite the fact its contestants were only visible for about  per cent of ­Sunday night’s show.Rest of the time they were blotted out by a gigantic Atlantic p***-storm which had engulfed the beautul and brutal island of Raasay, on Scotland’s west coast, so that all you could actually see were some green blobs lumbering up and down the mountains and all you could hear was swearing, from Ant Middleton.Or Foxy. Or possibly Billy. Or maybe even Ollie. “Put the casualty on the f***ing stretcher. Grab the f***ing stretcher and f***ing get him off the f***ing hill. That’s how we f***ing do it. Now move.”A big ask, I think you’ll agree, and the only one who seemed equal to it was James, an estate agent, who’s cracked every single challenge but not a single smile since episode one.He has, however, hinted at a very dark backgroundand claimed, with an entirely straight face: “It’s dficult to sayI’m good at hiding my emotions, ’cos I don’t have many.”No sooner had he said it, though, than Ant and the boys were pressing play on a Skype message from his mum. “Hi Peanut!” At which point James turned into a blubbing, schoolboy wreck.THE burning issue and question on Channel ’s mind last night was Bring Back The Bush: Where Did Our Pubic Hair Go  Where indeed  If it isn’t exactly where you left it or down the back of the sofa.Who worse to investigate this pressing issue, then, than Chidera Eggerue, the creative force behind the “Saggy Boobs Matter” campaign, who clearly craves attention and victim status but hasn’t worked out any better way of getting them than by making a gigantic exhibition of herself.So she’d set herself a real “challenge” here. “I’m growing my pubic hair for the next six weeks.” Exactly the sort of zero-effort empty gesture millennials seem to love.Chidera wasn’t quite confident enough in the project to go it alone, though, so she’d roped in four other minge martyrs to sprout away, while she went to LA to gawp at a porn shoot and work out why it was all the fault of men and the media.With the help of some anecdotal cobblers and an old copy of Playboy, Chidera eventually established the “flawless, hairless women” era was all about blokes “policing women’s bodies”, and the only way to fight back was, as I’d feared: “By revealing our bushes to the world.”When push came to shave, though, two of her mates insisted on wearing massive pants for the climactic photoshoot, the smartest one opted out completely and Chidera herself unveiled something that could’ve been her chuff, but could just as easily have been Ben Kingsley in All Hail The King. Bring Back The Bush  Bring back National Service first, please.But I honestly don’t think they’d get it even then.THIS week’s winner is Susanna Reid and Penny Proud from the Proud Family cartoons.Emailed in by Ricky J.

At times since the decisive referendum vote in , it looked asBrexit would remain a distant fantasy, thanks to the determination of much of the pro-EU establishment to overturn the result.But in the end, the will of the public has prevailed over federalist ideology. The dream of national freedom is about to become a reality.This change in status will represent a daunting challenge for Britain. No longer a regional province in the EU’s empire, we will take charge of our own destiny, with control over our economy, borders, laws, trade and justice system.With self-governance comes tremendous responsibility - and doubts and concerns about trade deals. But our nation can rise to the test.Indeed, Brexit could be the cue for the renewal of our institutions and the rebirth of our democracy.After all, we have achieved so much in the past as an independent nation, pioneering Parliamentary rule, leading the Industrial Revolution, and defeating tyranny in two World Wars.Given this heritage, there is no reason why Britain cannot embrace a new era of greatness.Yet that is not how the embittered Remainers see our future. Immersed in their worship of Brussels, obsessed with goal of European integration at the expense of nationhood, they continually preach the gospel of defeatism and despair.According to their gloomy propaganda, Brexit is a disastrous mistake, which will leave Britain hopelessly in decline.In their view, our country cannot survive on its own. The cold winds of isolation will be felt outside the warm embrace of the EU federation.This is the message that the pro-EU brigade has been peddling for years, ever since the referendum was first proposed.During the  campaign, the Government embarked on its notorious Project Fear, full of grim warnings about the dire consequences of abandoning our EU membership.One Treasury paper predicted that a vote for Leave would “represent an immediate and profound shock to the economy,” followed by a massive rise in unemployment and a meltdown in sterling.But these dire forecasts have not been realised. Instead, since , the British economy has proved to be remarkably robust.There has been no recession, no collapse in the property market, no explosion in the dole queues. On the contrary, the British jobs miracle has continued to accelerate.Only last week, official figures revealed that unemployment is down to its lowest level since , while the national workforce is at its largest in history.Particularly striking is the rise in self-employment to over five million, which indicates that the culture of enterprise is flourishing.Investors have not been deterred by Brexit.According to the Financial Times, “UK equities are positioned to outperform their peers in Europe and the USA.Manufacturing is also poised to prosper. Last week a survey by the Confederation of British Industry highlighted the biggest surge in confidence within this sector on record.Commenting on the “bullish” economic mood in Britain, the distinguished German journalist Alexander Von Schoenburg, editor-at-large of the bestselling BILD newspaper, wrote last weekend: “I see a nation with a strong sense of purpose, built on trust in its own capabilities and a powerful economy.I see a vibrant, open place that can attract huge amounts of foreign investment, has an unrivalled record in business start-ups and is a global pioneer in scientic and genetic research.”Von Schoenburg is right. Our independent future can be a golden one. Already the International Monetary Fund, which in  warned of recession, now predicts that over the next two years, economic growth will be twice as fast in the UK as in any other G state in Europe.What the pessimists ignore are the huge advantages held by Britain, like the global dominance of the English language, the cultural reach of our arts, music and entertainment industries, the strength of our financial services and the solidity of our political system - which was recently demonstrated again in the defeat of Jeremy Corbyn’s quasi-revolutionary Labour party.A recent poll of , chief executives, carried out by the consultancy firm PwC, found that the UK is increasingly attractive to global businesses looking for growth and investment opportunities.Commenting on the survey, PwC’s chairman Kevin Ellis said that “viewed against the turbulent global backdrop, the UK is a beacon of relative stability.”Indeed, on the eve of Brexit, the real crisis is faced, not by Britain, but by the EU and its member states.Whereas Britain can show its dynamism by the embrace of global competition and commerce, Europe is still trapped in outdated economic structures, characterised by heavy regulation, state intervention and unaffordable welfare.Almost every European nation is now in trouble, dragged down by sluggish growth and political dislocation.While Germany hovers on the brink of recession, France is in turmoil because of ferocious opposition to attempts by President Macron’s Government to reform its vast public sector and expensive pension schemes.Spain is now in the grip of socialism, Italy in economic sclerosis. Ireland’s current General Election is unlikely to give any one party more than  per cent of the vote, a recipe for more fragility.For the EU itself, Brexit represents a threat to its very existence.That is not just because of the loss of Britain’s budget contributions, signicant though they are.It is more becauseBritain prospers outside the EU, then the justication for Brussels rule would be permanently demolished.All the claims about the necessity of political integration would be exposed as delusions. That is why pro-EU campaigners so dread the possibility of a booming Britain on the continent’s doorstep.Our success would be the EU’s nightmare.There is, of course, no guarantee that Britain will flourish.There could be dficult times ahead, prompted by a global recession or the refusal of the USA to reach a trade deal because of security objections to the involvement of Chinese telecoms giant Huawei in our broadband network.Equally, the EU might prove tough in its own negotiations with us about a trade agreement. Already this week the Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar has warned that the EU has “the upper hand” and the “stronger team”.But the cause of British independence has triumphed over serious obstacles in the recent past.With determination and vision, our country can do so again, emboldened by the taste of freedom.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He will surely find himself in court very soon.This week a senior US attorney, Geoffrey Berman, said the prince had offered “zero co-operation” to the FBI and prosecutors.This is over his friendship with the paedophile sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein.Andrew admits he kept his friendship going with this horrible financier for longer than he should.No kidding, your highness. You still visited the bloke after he had been convicted of having sex with an underage girl. There has been no convincing explanation as to why you should have done so. Indeed, when you tried to explain it, on TV to the BBC’s Emily Maitlis, you sounded both deluded and deceitful.But there’s worse, of course. With Andy, somehow, there always is.He is himself accused of having sex with a -year-old lass procured for him by Epstein.This is Virginia Roberts. She is one of five women bringing a suit against the now dead Epstein and they want Prince Andrew to testy.Andy denies ever having laid a finger on Roberts. Well, OK, maybe a finger , but nowt more.Andrew has been implicated in this grotesque scandal for a long time now. The sensible thing to have done would have been to speak to the US investigators right at the outset.Becauseyou’ve got nothing to hide, there’s nothing to worry about, is there, matey But Prince Andrew’s actions have not appeared as the actions of a man with nothing to hide. He has preicated at every stage. He needs to understand that just because he says he is innocent of everything, it doesn’t mean everybody has to believe him, you know And there are plenty out there who certainly do not believe him.Sources close to Prince Andrew say he is “angry” and “bewildered” over the accusation that he offered the FBI zero co-operation.Well sure. He’s always bewildered. He’d be bewildered by a piece of paper with “see other side” written on both sides. He’d be sitting there trying to work it out for ages. He is not the sharpest tool in the box.If you’re angry and bewildered, your royal personage, then give the FBI a ring first thing tomorrow morning, US time, and tell them you are anxious to help in their inquiries.Because until this business is sorted out, there is a dark cloud over the Royal Family. And thus a dark cloud over Britain.The terrible suspicion is that our Royal Family is coming apart at the seams.Put all of our minds at rest, Andrew. Talk to the police. And tell the truth.THE Scots have banned the smacking of children by their parents.Braying the bairns was a kind of national sport up there.

It seems certain people are jumping the gun.Geoffrey Berman, the US attorney for the Southern District of New York, has dismissed this claim, and stressed the FBI has made several attempts to contact Prince Andrews representatives.It has previously been reported the FBI had been trying to interview the under-fire royal since November.Mr Bermans office revealed the prince’s lack of cooperation on Monday during a dramatic press conference outside Epstein’s mansion.He said: “The Southern District of New York and the FBI have contacted Prince Andrew’s attorneys and requested to interview Prince Andrew, and to date, Prince Andrew has provided zero cooperation.”The top prosecutor said he was revealing the information because the prince “publicly offered, indeed in a press release, to cooperate with law enforcement investigating the crimes committed by Jeffrey Epstein and his co-conspirators”.Speaking at the press conference – held to promote a new law to make it easier for child sex abuse victims to sue – Mr Berman said the probe into Epstein’s network was continuing.Virginia Roberts, an American mum-of-three and now , claims she was forced to have sex with the prince three times when she was a teenager, after being trafficked to him by Epstein.The royal has vehemently denied her claims.Sigrid McCawley, who represents Ms Roberts, said: Prince Andrew should take most seriously the deeply held belief in this country that no one is above the law.She added: Prince Andrews continued refusal to cooperate with the authorities after freely acknowledging that he would be prepared to answer enquiries raises even more questions about the role he played in the international sex trafficking ring Jeffrey Epstein and others operated.Jack Scarola, another lawyer representing Ms Roberts Giuffre, told The Sun: “It is obvious that Prince Andrew is persisting in a pattern of non-cooperation which is now been going on for years.“I would certainly believe that he should recognise his moral obligation to participate in the search for the truth.“With all that the victims of Jeffrey Epstein have been through – over so many years – I would say that they expected nothing dferent.”Andrew claried his intention to co-operate with the FBI following his disastrous interview with BBC’s Newsnight in November.During the BBC interview, Andrew said he would have to consult with his lawyers before testying under oath about his ties to Epstein.But in a statement after the broadcast, he said: “Of course, I am willing to help any appropriate law enforcement agency with their investigations,required.”FBI and federal prosecutors in Manhattan are trying to bring justice for dozens of Epstein’s victims – by going after his alleged accomplices.Epstein, , killed himself in jail last year while awaiting trial on child sex trafficking allegations – following numerous bungled probes into his conduct.Prosecutors had accused him of sexually exploiting dozens of women and girls in New York and Florida before he hanged himself.Shortly after Epstein’s death, Mr Berman issued a statement vowing to continue the investigation into his co-conspirators.They are now said to be zeroing in on Ghislaine Maxwell – a close friend of Andrew – who is alleged to have acted at Epstein’s ‘pimp’.Maxwell – who is currently in hiding – has denied any wrongdoing.Andrew was forced to quit as a frontline royal last year, following his car crash chat with Emily Maitlis on Newsnight.During the interview, he suggested that a photograph showing him and Ms Roberts together in the home of Maxwell was faked.He said he had “no recollection” of meeting Ms Roberts Giuffre and claimed he was at a Pizza Express in Woking on one of the days they were meant to have had sex.When asked whether he regretted continuing his friendship with Epstein, the prince said: “Do I regret the fact that he has quite obviously conducted himself in a manner unbecoming  Yes.”“Unbecoming ” Miss Maitlis replied. “He was a sex offender.”A Buckingham Palace spokesman declined to comment on the FBI claims last night, but a source close to the prince said: “This issue is being dealt with by The Duke of York’s legal team”.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

There have also been instances of protesting fire- fighters setting themselves alight — albeit with fire extinguishers on hand to douse the flames.You are much more likely to have seen these disturbing scenes on social media than on the television news, probably because such images don’t fit with the anti-Brexit narrative of most UK broadcasters.You see, it was supposed to be Britain that collapsed into chaos, while our continental neighbours basked in the stability allegedly afforded by European Union membership.Most of us are vaguely aware that the image we are often presented of President Emmanuel Macron as the smooth-talking glamour boy of modern European politics is somewhat at odds with the situation on the ground in his country.We have heard a bit about the gilets jaunesprotesters who have been staging huge and sometimes violent protests every weekend across France for more than a year now.But despite France being our closest continental neighbour, we don’t quite know what is going on or why — mainly because these extraordinary scenes are so seldom explained or even covered by flagship news programmes.The truth is that civil stre in France, including the sheer level of violence and fury now being directed at its political establishment and at the police who enforce their will, is in danger of spiralling out of control.In painful contrast to La Belle Epoque, the famous “beautul era” of creativity and gracious living France enjoyed for the  years before the First World War, the country is now sliding into Le Mal Epoque — the bad times, which show little sign of ending.The immediate cause of the latest protests is Macron’s economic reform programme, a dose of unpleasant medicine the French economy probably needs to digest but which its powerful and militant trade unions have no intention of allowing to pass.Macron aims to abolish ious “sweetheart” pension deals enjoyed by dferent occupations, including many public sector groups, and create in their place a single national pension scheme he says will be more affordable and fairer for all.Some groups face having their pensions calculated on their career average earnings for the first time, rather than their final salaries at retirement, as  separate schemes are rolled into one. Everyone is faced with working longer, as the retirement age rises from  to  .Macron is also taking a tougher line on the pay and traditionally quite lax working practices of French public sector employees, which is what the firefighters have taken particular objection to.A six-week transport strike has just ended, while the country is also suffering from a wave of power cuts as electricity workers withdraw their labour.When you throw into the mix other major social problems, such as the alienation and chronic high unemployment suffered by youths from ethnic minorities in the “Banlieues” — grim outer estates that encircle Paris and other major French cities — and the ever-present threat of Islamist terrorist atrocities, then the multiple sources of pessimism and anger among the French public become clear.And that is before the famous gilets jaunes are taken into the equation. These protesters, mainly provincial, traditionally-minded people from small towns and villages, began their demonstrations as a protest against punitive new rates of tax on petrol that Macron had introduced to the acclaim of environmentalists and other fashionable metropolitan groups.That grievance has now morphed into a more general contention that Macron is a president for the rich and well-connected.Leftist union leaders have started to ape the language of the gilets jaunes.Firebrand Philippe Martinez — a kind of French Arthur Scargill — says Macron and his inner-circle are disconnected from reality and need to “shake the hands of a few who actually work”.In British terms, modern France is perhaps best likened to our experience in the s and early ’s, characterised by excessive trade union power, strikes, riots, terrorism, outbursts of police brutality and a general pervading sense of aggression on the streets.With the next French presidential election shaping up as a choice between more Macron or Marine Le Pen, with her Far-Right connections, some in France have started to look across the Channel for a better example.Leading lights in the centre-right Republican Party have even praised Boris Johnson as offering, “a third way between globalists and populists”.As Britain gets ready for a Brexit knees-up tomorrow, with no sign of violence despite the years of political angst we have gone through, we should count our blessings.Many in France would give almost anything to be in our shoes right now.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

They said Labour had spent around £m at the election, way below the £m national limit for the six-week “short campaign”. The extra “third party” funding from the unions and Momentum would come on top of that. Before the election, party chairman Ian Lavery claimed Labour had “never been more ready for an election”. The -page report seen by the Mirror found that Labour lost most support to the Tories among low-income older voters and less well-off families, both traditionally seen as a key party demographic.  It lost ground in “blue collar” areas with industrial pasts, low level of educational qualications and ageing populations.  For the first time, the party’s vote share in these seats was signicantly lower than in big cities and their suburbs.  They concluded that it’s support was in “long-term decline” in these largely working class areas, even though they still constitute half of Labour seats, while the Tories had gained ground.  The internal paper also revealed that of the  constituencies where Labour had the most “contacts” with voters, it only gained one - Putney - while losing Kensington and hanging onto five more. All the rest remained Tory.  However, party activists made an astonishing .m “contacts” on the doorstep, underlining the strength of local party machines.  Labour sources told the Mirror that the majority of contributions at an NEC “away day” on Tuesday to discuss the election result were “head-in-the sand” supportive of Mr Corbyn, who gave a “long and rambling” contribution but failed to apologise for his leadership. Verbal reports were given by Mr Lavery and elections chief Andrew Gwynne. One source at the meeting said Mr Lavery blamed media attacks for Mr Corbyn’s poor leadership ratings. He criticised some MPs and shadow cabinet members for “indiscipline” which he said undermined the party’s efforts.   The insider said: “It was like a parallel universe. You’d have thought we were the slickest, best run party and had actually won.”  However, Mr Gwynne had apologised for the “devastating” result and told colleagues: “If we don’t learn the right lessons of our defeat under the new leadership then we’ll be out of power for longer than just four years”.  And he admitted that Mr Corbyn’s leadership had “drawn on” Labour’s support.  But a second Labour party report, published by the FT, blamed Brexit - while largely absolving Mr Corbyn from blame.  The post-mortem found it would be “unrealistic” not to say its policy to hold a second Brexit referendum played a “decisive” role. While the authors accepted there were “negative views” of the outgoing leader they did not lay direct blame at his door. Far from being a weak or isive leader, they concluded instead that he was the victim of four years of unrelenting attacks on his character. This was an “assault without precedent in modern politics”, they said. But they did admit that a glut of policies had been confusing for the public - although it defended their radicalism. NEC members were shown a third report on the party’s community organising efforts by Karie Murphy, Mr Corbyn’s ex-chief of staff who led the day-to-day campaign.

But after  January  there could be major changes, especiallythere is no trade deal with the EU.  nWeaposve written more about those changes here, but what you need to know is this: the UK has a Brexit deal. It helps stabilise the process of leaving the EU. But it does not deal with the future relationship with the continent after that.  nHere is a short guide to what the Brexit deal is, what it does, and what it doesnapost do.  n What will actually happen on Brexit Day  January  celebrations and what will change n Brexit: Nigel Farageaposs final EU speech silenced after he waves Union flag   nWhat is the Brexit deal   n  n   nThe aposBrexit dealapos is an international treaty that makes it legal for the UK to leave the EU.  nIt consists of the -page Withdrawal Agreement that Theresa May agreed between the UK and EU - plus  pages of amendments from Boris Johnson to change rules on Northern Ireland.  nIt governs the very complicated process of becoming the first country ever to leave the EU - disentangling the nation from thousands of EU laws built up over decades.  nThat deal has now been passed into law by the UK Parliamentand European Parliament.  nThat means the UK will legally have left the European Union at pm on January  and be unable to cancel Brexit.  nWhat does it do   n  n   nThe deal is designed to ensure there arenapost legal gaps when EU law automatically ends on Brexit day.  nMost importantly it creates a apostransition periodapos, which extends all EU laws until  December  while the UK and EU negotiate a permanent trade deal.  nThe Brexit deal said this transition period could be extended by two years, but Boris Johnson decided to make that part illegal when he translated the deal into UK law.  nThe deal also includes guarantees on the rights of EU citizens who are already here to stay, with a new aposindependent monitoring authorityapos to ensure their rights are upheld.  nEU citizens can continue arriving in Britain until  December but must then apply for settled status in order to be able to stay.  nMeanwhile the deal lays out the framework for a £bn aposorce billapos, paid from the UK to the EU over several decadesto cover outstanding commitments between both sides.  nCrucially, the Brexit deal also includes the arrangements for Northern Ireland...  nWhat does it do for Northern Ireland   n  n   nBy far the most dficult question was Northern Ireland - how to solve the problem of trading with both the Republicand Great Britainat the same time.  nThe first version of the Brexit deal, secured by Theresa May, contained a backstop which would have forced the whole of the UK to follow EU customs rules with no time limit.  nBoris Johnson axed that for a hybrid system - with dferent rules for customs and the single market.  nLatest UK politics news  nNorthern Ireland is part of the UKaposs customs territory. But firms will have to sign customs formsthey send goods between Great Britain and Northern Ireland - and pay customs dutiesthose goods are likely to move on to the EU in future.  nMeanwhile Northern Ireland and the Republic will share some EU single market rules - forcing checks on manufactured and agricultural products crossing the Irish Sea.  nThe Northern Ireland Assembly - known as Stormont - will get a vote every four years on whether to let EU law continue in this way. But this vote could be passed by a simple majority - denying the DUP a veto on staying under EU laws long-term.  n n nWhat does it not do   n  n   nApart from a brief political declaration, the Brexit deal doesnapost say what happens from January .  nThat will be governed by a trade deal between the UK and EU, talks over which begin in February . nBoris Johnson wants a Free Trade Agreement between the UK and EU a bit like one with Canada, but that took the EU seven years to agree and sign.  nIf it doesnapost happen by  December , the UK will leave in a aposno dealapos Brexit which ramps up restrictions on movement and tarfs on goods. There could be queues at ports and changes to everything from visas to roaming.  nWrapped up in that deal will be many, many issues, but also those around workersapos rights. Critics had wanted Boris Johnson to tack to future EU rules on workersapos rights, but the PM dropped those assurances from his version of the deal.  n \",\"published\":\"\",\"title\":\" Page Not Found\",\"url\":\"www.mirror news politics what-brexit-deal-uks-agreement-\",\"ratings\":[,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],\"customer\":\"Default\",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],\"customer\":\"Tesco\",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],\"customer\":\"Ian\",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],\"customer\":\"Terry\"],\"findings\":,\"keywords\":[,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],\"analyzed_text\":\"The UK is leaving the EU at the stroke of pm on Friday  January. nAnd thanks to the Brexit deal, nothing much will change to your everyday le for  months. nPassports, visas, healthcare, driving and trade will remain more or less as they are now.

But it does not deal with the future relationship with the continent after that. nHere is a short guide to what the Brexit deal is, what it does, and what it doesnt do. n What will actually happen on Brexit Day  January  celebrations and what will change  n Brexit: Nigel Farages final EU speech silenced after he waves Union flag  nThe Brexit deal is an international treaty that makes it legal for the UK to leave the EU. nIt consists of the -page Withdrawal Agreement that Theresa May agreed between the UK and EU - plus  pages of amendments from Boris Johnson to change rules on Northern Ireland. nIt governs the very complicated process of becoming the first country ever to leave the EU - disentangling the nation from thousands of EU laws built up over decades. nThat deal has now been passed into law by the UK Parliamentand European Parliament. nThat means the UK will legally have left the European Union at pm on January  and be unable to cancel Brexit. nThe deal is designed to ensure there arent legal gaps when EU law automatically ends on Brexit day. nMost importantly it creates a transition period, which extends all EU laws until  December  while the UK and EU negotiate a permanent trade deal. nThe Brexit deal said this transition period could be extended by two years, but Boris Johnson decided to make that part illegal when he translated the deal into UK law. nThe deal also includes guarantees on the rights of EU citizens who are already here to stay, with a new independent monitoring authority to ensure their rights are upheld. nEU citizens can continue arriving in Britain until  December but must then apply for  \"settled status \" in order to be able to stay. nMeanwhile the deal lays out the framework for a £bn orce bill, paid from the UK to the EU over several decadesto cover outstanding commitments between both sides. nCrucially, the Brexit deal also includes the arrangements for Northern Ireland... nBy far the most dficult question was Northern Ireland - how to solve the problem of trading with both the Republicand Great Britainat the same time. nThe first version of the Brexit deal, secured by Theresa May, contained a  \"backstop \" which would have forced the whole of the UK to follow EU customs rules with no time limit. nBoris Johnson axed that for a hybrid system - with dferent rules for customs and the single market. n Latest UK politics news  nNorthern Ireland is part of the UKs customs territory. But firms will have to sign customs formsthey send goods between Great Britain and Northern Ireland - and pay customs dutiesthose goods are likely to move on to the EU in future. nMeanwhile Northern Ireland and the Republic will share some EU single market rules - forcing checks on manufactured and agricultural products crossing the Irish Sea. nThe Northern Ireland Assembly - known as Stormont - will get a vote every four years on whether to let EU law continue in this way. But this vote could be passed by a simple majority - denying the DUP a veto on staying under EU laws long-term. nApart from a brief political declaration, the Brexit deal doesnt say what happens from January . nThat will be governed by a trade deal between the UK and EU, talks over which begin in February .  nBoris Johnson wants a Free Trade Agreement between the UK and EU a bit like one with Canada, but that took the EU seven years to agree and sign. nIf it doesnt happen by  December , the UK will leave in a no deal Brexit which ramps up restrictions on movement and tarfs on goods. There could be queues at ports and changes to everything from visas to roaming. nWrapped up in that deal will be many, many issues, but also those around workers rights. Critics had wanted Boris Johnson to tack to future EU rules on workers rights, but the PM dropped those assurances from his version of the deal. n\",\"usage\":,\"warnings\":[\"metadata: page has no

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailA bridesmaid-to-be cost her close friend £, and ruined her wedding by pretending she had been employed for seven months. After Helen Dove convinced Kimberley Baker to apply for a job at the childrenaposs department at Warrington Borough Council, she posed as  fake employees to convince her she had been hired.Using more than a dozen accounts Dove sent her thousands of emails, asking her to carry out administration tasks and to manage staff rotas, Liverpool Echo reported. Having gone months without pay, Kimberley eventually went to the council offices only to be told her friend did not work there and neither did she. The bizarre scam began in the summer of  when the pair met at some stables in Rainford, Merseyside.  Paul Wood, prosecuting Dove at Liverpool Crown Court, said: During the first few weeks Helen Dove was very nice and they soon became friends, [she was] the type of friend who could not do enough. She bought cards and flowers for her birthday, she used to bring her coffee to the horse yard. When Kimberley explained that it was her dream to work in childrenaposs services, Dove told her she was an adoption worker at the council. She later turned up to the stables sporting an apparent work ID and offered to pick up an application form for her friend, who had worked at BT for  years but had completed a social work degree in her sparetime. Determined to make her career aspirations a reality, Kimberley took voluntary redundancy and applied for the council job.  When the -year-old mum applied for temporary work during the process, Dove told her not to because it could hinder her chances with Warrington Borough Council. Mr Wood said: An interview date was sent to Ms Baker. This subsequently got cancelled. Ms Baker was then informed that she had to complete a set of interview questions over email. She completed these questions and a few days later she received an email confirming she had got the job. This was celebrated with Dove, who gave her victim a congratulations card. During the next seven months Kimberley was sent thousands of emails from ious supposed council members, giving her ious administrative tasks while feeding her excuses as to why her employment had not yet begun.These ranged from computer system failures to introductory meetings with key figures being cancelled due to weather problems. After going months without pay Kimberley confronted Dove and asked her for evidence that she worked at the council. Unconvinced by what she produced, the disgruntled employee went to the council where knowledge of Doveaposs employment was denied. Over the course of the strange scam Kimberley had lost £, in missed earnings at BT, while leaving her paranoid. She had been forced to cancel her wedding due to the financial impact. Her trust for Dove had run so deep Kimberley had asked her to be her chief bridesmaid and had visited potential wedding venues with her. Zahra Baqri, defending, said Doveaposs motive was not to cause her victim financial loss but a desperate and misguided attempt at keeping her friendship.  She said Dove lacked her own domestic unit, she craved that domestic closeness and wanted to help Ms Baker, but created a scheme that snowballed. Ms Baqri added: She says she did not know how to get herself out of the mess she had created and at the same time maintain the friendship. Sentencing Dove, Judge Robert Warnock said a psychological assessment revealed no signicant mental health issues. However, he refuted the idea that Dove had not intended to cause Kimberley financial loss, because she continued the scam after she share her mounting money problems. The judge added: You went to extraordinary s to perpetrate this complex, cruel and harmful deception.

Fireman Aaron Harlow-Stephenson, , plays for rugby league side Gateshead Storm after overcoming his addiction to apossecretapos binge eating. He has spoken out about his tortured teenage years to help others who struggle to lose weight. Now a superfit muscle man, he has , Instagram followers as he gives tips on diet and exercise. But as a tortured teenager, he became a miserable aposrecluseapos, stashing crisps, chocolate and ready meals all over his Durham home. He did not want to go out at week-ends and in the evenings, played video games to escape the cruel taunts of bullies in the aposrealapos world. He turned his le around when he started to play rugby for Sunderland RAFC - he plays both union and league - after leaving school. With a tough new fitness regime and strict diet, he lost an incredible st, dropping to st as he discovered weight training. He slowly transformed his physique through his job as a fireman and his daily five-hour workouts to become a competitive bodybuilder. I was  kilos - more than st - at . I had a massive problem with eating in private, he said. I was a secret eater. I used to hide food all around the house. So it would be in cupboards, drawers, my computer bag, even DVD boxes. I could not fit under the table for lunch at school, I was so fat. I was taunted about my size, about my clothing, about aposcovering up my babyapos as I tried to hide my stomach. Bullying meant that I just kept on eating and eating. I would sit in my room playing computer games for days on end because I hated school. I did not want to step outside the house, I would speak to people on-line playing games. I was so big that I was out of breath walking to my bedroom, I was also really unhappy. One day, as he passed a group at college, and a bully shouted: apos How many cakes have you eaten today apos. Aaron was so ashamed that he vowed to change. That was memorable, a turning point, he added. I started rugby, and starved myself. I lost lbs in two weeks, I chewed on ice to lose weight.  I got massive headaches, it killed me, the withdrawal from sugar and salt. But I got rid of my computer, I faced the real world. Now he has a balanced diet of protein, carbohydrates to compliment his training regime. His bodybuilding photos have won him tens of thousands of followers. I want to raise awareness to show that you can change, said Aaron, a ft in, -stone giant after his tough early years at Durham Johnston Comprehensive School, and the cityaposs New College. Before Facebook and Instagram, there was nothing for lads with eating disorders. It is massively taboo for men, they are forgotten. That needs to change, and I help anyone who gets in touch.

investigation into the  fire which claimed  lives, with offences as serious as gross negligence manslaughter being probed.  nMichael Mansfield QC, representing victims, told the central London Inquiry the timing of the application was “highly reprehensible and highly questionable”.  nHe said: “We have a major question over why it has been done today.  n“It has caused immense anxiety, distress and anger at a time which has come throughout a much longer period of waiting after this disaster, of waiting to get to the point of accountability, as it were, to be almost thwarted at the doors of the

other high-profile inquiries including the Stephen Lawrence Inquiry, the Bloody Sunday Inquiry and the Ladbroke Grove Inquiry. n Grenfell inquiry  member resigns after being linked to firm which supplied cladding  nThe application, made on Tuesday night, was signed on behalf of core participants including Harley, subcontractors for the building’s cladding, workers at main contractors Rydon and the Kensington and Cha Tenant’s Management Organisation, who were responsible for maintaining the west London tower. nIt said a number of witnesses had already been interviewed under caution as the politan Police conduct a parallel investigation into the  fire which claimed  lives, with offences as serious as gross negligence manslaughter being probed. nMichael Mansfield QC, representing victims, told the central London Inquiry the timing of the application was “highly reprehensible and highly questionable”. nHe said: “We have a major question over why it has been done today. n“It has caused immense anxiety, distress and anger at a time which has come throughout a much longer period of waiting after this disaster, of waiting to get to the point of accountability, as it were, to be almost thwarted at the doors of the court.” n Top news stories from nChairman Sir Martin Moore-Bick said: “I agree this application has come very late in the day and at a most inconvenient time. n“It’s very disappointing, I might even use a stronger word.” nResponding to the application, Unite the union said it would be “mockery of justice”the witness evidence is privileged. nGeneral secretary for legal affairs Howard Beckett said: “If the companies involved in installing the cladding knew it was flammable and unsafe and then allowed it to be installed anyway they should of course be prosecuted.” n\",\"usage\":,\"warnings\":[\"metadata: page has no title\"],\"language\":\"en\",\"semantic_roles\":[,\"action\":,\"text\":\"have\",\"object\":,,\"action\":,\"text\":\"signed\",

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailBuilding Control should never have signed off on Grenfell Tower’s refurbishment, the council has admitted. A lawyer for the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chaissued an “unreserved apology” to victims of the deadly blaze, after owning up to a string of failings including not asking for full details of the cladding. It came as key witnesses due to give evidence launched a legal bid to protect themselves from incrimination in a fresh blow to victims and their families. RBKC counsel James Maxwell Scott QC told the public Inquiry on Wednesday: “The council has identied a number of failings in the way its building control services processed and considered the application for building control approval during the refurbishment of Grenfell Tower. “On behalf of the council, it apologises unreservedly for those failings.” He added: “Grenfell Tower is a tragedy which should never have happened. This council could have done and should have done more to stop it happening.” In a shocking list of admissions, he said the council’s Building Control had failed to ask for comprehensive details of the cladding system and decorative crown that have since been found to be primary causes of the fire’s spread.  It also failed to identy that the insulation and materials used in the cladding were combustible and failed to meet building standards, and further failed to request an up to date fire safety strategy report in the later stages of the project. However, victims refused to accept the apology, adding that “no true remorse” had been shown. A spokesman for Grenfell United said: “RBKC do not get any credit for their statement this morning, it is insulting to survivors and bereaved families for them to suggest they are being honest about their role in our suffering. “There is no confession here, barely any honesty and certainly no true remorse.  “They have no choice but to accept that it was a total failure for their building control to sign off the refurbishment.” Meanwhile key players in the renovations, who are due to give evidence next week, issued a last-minute application asking chairman Sir Martin Moore-Bick to apply to Attorney General Geoffrey Cox QC for an undertaking to prevent their evidence being used against them in future criminal proceedings. Without the pledge, the hearing was told many could refuse to answer questions by claiming privilege against self-incrimination. The law preventing self-incrimination has been used in other high-profile inquiries including the Stephen Lawrence Inquiry, the Bloody Sunday Inquiry and the Ladbroke Grove Inquiry.  The application, made on Tuesday night, was signed on behalf of core participants including Harley, subcontractors for the building’s cladding, workers at main contractors Rydon and the Kensington and Cha Tenant’s Management Organisation, who were responsible for maintaining the west London tower. It said a number of witnesses had already been interviewed under caution as the politan Police conduct a parallel investigation into the  fire which claimed  lives, with offences as serious as gross negligence manslaughter being probed. Michael Mansfield QC, representing victims, told the central London Inquiry the timing of the application was “highly reprehensible and highly questionable”. He said: “We have a major question over why it has been done today. “It has caused immense anxiety, distress and anger at a time which has come throughout a much longer period of waiting after this disaster, of waiting to get to the point of accountability, as it were, to be almost thwarted at the doors of the court.” "},{"url":null,"title":"lotto results draw live national","story":"\"liveBlogUpdate\": [NO JACKPOT WINNER SATURDAY#xS ESTIMATED MUST-BE-WON JACKPOT IS #xA.

Inidual years from  to  are predicted to be between . °C and . °C above pre-industrial conditions, and it is ‘likely’ the current record - of . °C, set in , - will be beaten. Considering the coming five-year period as a whole, average temperatures are expected to be between . °C and . °C above pre-industrial levels. This compares to the last five years which showed average warming of . °C, and was the warmest five-year period on record. These temperatures are consistent with continued high levels of atmospheric greenhouse gases. Dr Doug Smith, a Met Office fellow and expert on decadal prediction, said: “The latest five-year forecast suggests continued warming, consistent with sustained high levels of greenhouse gases.  Uncertainties exist within the forecast, but most regions are expected to be warmer and forecast patterns suggest enhanced warming over land, especially northern parts of Europe, Asia and North America – extending the ongoing trend.” Current relatively cool conditions in the north Atlantic are also predicted to warm, potentially exacerbating the warming over Europe. Although the forecast suggests a likely increase in global average temperature over the next five-years, the authors estimate the chance of any single year exceeding . °C - relative to the pre-industrial period - to be less than  per cent.

The Dreadnought in Leith, Edinburgh, describes itself as old skool and a pub that knows how to party. It won the Campaign for Real AleCity of Edinburgh Pub of the Year award in  and . But the trendy boozer has raised eyebrows by putting a sign in the window - telling men they will not be allowed inthey are dressed head-to-toe in grey marl trackies, or wearing shoes with no socks. The Dreadnought is also considering a ban on flip-flops. A sign, reading gentlemen’s dress code depicted a man dressed in a grey tight-fitting tracksuit cuffed at the ankles and trainers, described as jobby catchers. Another image showed a man wearing a leather jacket and turned-up jeans, with bare ankles and smart shoes - circled in red to draw attention to the fashion aposfaux pasapos. The move was welcomed by some people, who called for the ban to be extended to other items of clothing. Gary Saddler said: “Their pub. Their rules. And I agree with them. Iaposd add baseball caps and beanies to the list.” And Henry Campbell Gillan added: “Definitely no men in white socks.” Jenny Mitchell said: “Anything that encourages our younger menfolk to dress better should be applauded.” Some called for rules to be implemented for female punters too.  Andrea Peutherer said: “Yet lassies can strut in half naked. Very classy.”A post on the pub’s Facebook page defended accusations of snobbishness, claiming people in tracksuits just make the place look scruffy.“We do our best to keep the place looking reasonably smart and,the first you see when you walk in is a group of lads wearing matching grey marl jobby catchers, we may as well have installed a beaten up bus shelter in the corner and invited folk to take a slash against it, the post read. “Just to prove our sartorial prejudices cross all boundaries, we’re also taking a stand against this horrendous current trend of half mast jeans, bare ankles and shoes. “If you’re going to base your fashion choices on what the staff at Urban Outfitters were wearing, there’s a place created especially for you. “It’s called Brewdog.” "},{"url":null,"title":"rather bringing more kids world","story":"w.mantis  Colin and Sharon Jamison had two beautul little girls, but they always knew they wanted to have more children.  nWe thought over time that there are a lot of children out there who donapost have homes, Colin told .  nRather than bringing more in to the world, letaposs look after the ones already here.  nThat was  years ago, and since then the couple, who live in Belfast, have dedicated their time to helping to raise children as foster parents.  nTheyaposve had more than  children through their door with placements lasting anywhere between a few days and  years.  nColin, , said: We’ve had children who have had multiple carers before us and have lost their identity along the way.

Our eldest did get a bit jealous with our first placement, but she was able to come and talk to us. We understood that and made sure everybody felt included.  Their longest placement was a little girl who had motor neurone disease, who stayed with them from the age of nine until she passed away aged . Sharon said: We were told she couldnapost talk or communicate, she couldnapost even smile. She was just the most amazing wee girl. It was just like a flower opened up when she could give expressions, her eyes just sparkled. She passed away while living with the Jamison family. She had a really lovely le. She had fun and she never complained even though she was in a lot of pain. She inspired up and kept us going. Everybody around her, social workers, family, came together to make sure her le could be good. We look have very positively, everybody made her happy. The couple attended a Barnardoaposs information event after a friend saw newspaper advert at the same time they were discussing the idea of fostering behind closed doors and gave to them by complete chance.  Colin already knew about the incredible work Barnardoaposs does as some of his school friends lived in one of their childrenaposs homes. The couple now focus on giving the children who stay with them happy memories from their childhoods in a bid to ensure they have nice things to look back on when theyaposre older. He said: When children come in to a strange environment they seem a bit confused and scared. Itaposs great having chuldren who are close in age to them. As adults we stand back and let the children do a lot of the engaging. They soon settle in to the routine. Sharon adds: You can have a child that settles within a few weeks and feels like theyaposve been here forever. But some donapost settle for years. The couple once looked after one boy who packed his bags every time they had an argument as he was convinced they would say they had had enough of him and kick him out, even though he had lived with them for four years.

Scotland Yard has asked Neil Berriman, , to pass on all the evidence he has collected in his four-year investigation to find the missing killer. Neil, the son of nanny Sandra Rivett, who Lucan is suspected of murdering in , said: “I’m pleased they are taking it so seriously.” After his claim was revealed by the Mirror yesterday, the building contractor is now due to meet Det Insp Susan Stansfield, of the major inquiries special casework team at Putney police station in South West London. Neil said tonight: “I know DI Stansfield is out of the country working on another investigation so I am pleased ... she will be meeting me at the first possible opportunity. I am very grateful for the police’s quick response.” The Mirror revealed yesterday that Neil had spent £, of his own money trying to track down Lucan and claimed to have found the elusive peer living as a Buddhist in Australia. Neil has already told Det Insp Stansfield about the eight aliases he believes the man has been using. And he has passed on the address where the man is living. Lucan would now be . Scotland Yard said: “The inquiry into the death of Sandra Rivett remains open, as is the case with all unsolved murders. “It has never been closed. Any signicant new information will be considered.”Lucan disappeared shortly after Sandra was bludgeoned to death. George Bingham, the son of the peer who has been th Earl of Lucan since his father was declared dead in , yesterday said he had been unaware of Neil’s search. The -year-old added: “I’ve met him a couple of times but had no idea he was looking for him and had spent so much... “He isn’t the first person to go to Australia looking. I remember the press went out there to try and find my father and instead found John Stonehouse who had faked his own death.”He added: “I am very sceptical about this. I had seen the story and it does seem odd. It would not be the first time someone has made a mistake. “This is all ancient history. It happened in  and now it’s . I guess people will always go on looking and they are welcome to do so.” He also revealed that on December , he and his we had a baby son Charles, who is in line to become the th Earl of Lucan. The Earl said: “I’ve more important things to worry about such as sleepless nights. My son is not sleeping very well.” Shortly after the murder, Lucan drove to the home of his friends in East Sussex and wrote a letter to a pal, asking that his children be looked after because he was going to lie low “for a bit”. ‘Spotted’ on a volcano and at ex-Nazi colonyThere are a huge number of theories on what became of Lord Lucan and long list of “sightings” – from backpacking on a volcano to living as a hippy in India.Some believe he boarded a ferry at Newhaven, others think he got on a private jet at Headcorn in Kent to fly across the Channel where he was picked up by a limo.  And one source insisted he had committed suicide and his body was then fed to tigers at the Kent zoo owned by his pal John Aspinall. Det Chief Supt Roy Ranson, who led the original murder investigation, claimed in his book that he believed Lucan fled to Africa with the help of influential friends. He was convinced that the discovery of Lucan’s car in Newhaven was a red herring. He also believed Lucan flew to Portugal in a private plane belonging to former Formula One champion Graham Hill, who died in . Later “evidence” suggested that Lucan was in Mozambique in . The first reported sighting of Lucan was in January  when he was supposedly spotted in Melbourne, Australia. Five months later he was “seen” in France at Cherbourg and St Malo. Police in South Africa examined fingerprints, supposedly left on a beer glass by Lucan in Cape Town. Sightings were reported in southern Africa, first in Mozambique and then Zimbabwe, and there were even claims he lived in India as a hippy called “Jungle Barry”. He was also “spotted”at an ex-Nazi colony in Paraguay, a sheep station in the Australian outback and backpacking on Mt Etna, Sicily. In , Barbados Police were asked by Scotland Yard to investigate reports that a British resident was sending money to Lord Lucan in South America. An ITV drama claimed the peer had been spirited away by wealthy friends, including Sir James Goldsmith and Aspinall.

The late Tommy Bennett’s name and photo are on the containers of treats being sold by his old firm for the th anniversary of VE Day. He was a sugar boiler at the Uncle Joe’s Mint Balls factory for around  years, with his only gap being from  to  to fight Hitler in the Second World War. The former RAF flight engineer told colleagues: “One week I was boiling toffee and the next I was bombing the enemy.” Now he can be seen in unorm on the special edition Tommy Tin. The name also honours British troops who were nicknamed Tommies. He started at the factory in  aged . When he was called up at  in , he was the only sugar boiler left at the firm. Company founder William Santus told the Government: “Although Bennett is so young he is at the present time the most vital person I have.”  The mints – much loved by British troops – were so popular that Tommy was granted a six-month leave of absence from the RAF to train a replacement.

Northern Rail’s customers will only really notice a dferencethe Government starts to invest in new track, electrication and signalling. The demise of Northern Rail should sound the death knell for rail privatisation. The policy, rammed through by John Major, is a total failure. It is not just in the North that passengers have been fleeced by train operating companies, as bosses have grown fat from public subsidies while providing an appalling service for ever-higher ticket prices. The only thing preventing the Tories from ending this fiasco is their ideological blindness. It is time for the blinkers to come off. If it makes sense to take Northern Rail into public ownership then it makes sense that the rest of the railways should be nationalised.

It’s not justice The Grenfell Inquiry has already heard that firms which made and installed the cladding knew it was a potential fire risk. Now these companies are demanding immunity from prosecution before staff give evidence. This is deeply insulting to the survivors and the families of the victims, who deserve the truth.

Heidi Broussard was found dead in the boot of a car parked at Magen Rose Fieramuscaaposs house in Houston, Texas, on December . Inside the home was the victimaposs three-week-old daughter Margot, The New York Post reported. More than a month after the grisly discovery Fieramusca, , was indicted on charges of capital murder and kidnapping in connection with the -year-oldaposs death. In an affidavit unsealed earlier this month it was alleged that Fieramusca had concocted an elaborate baby-based hoax.  She had pretended to be pregnant for months in a bid to pass her friendapos baby off as her own. When Margot was born Fieramusca told her ex-boyfriend that he was the father and she had birthed the child on December  - the same day Heidi and the baby went missing. An autopsy determined that the mom’s death was caused by “ligature strangulation,” officials said. Fieramusca’s attorney Brian Erksine said her legal team had only learned about the murder charges through media reports.

Mrs Brownaposs Boys won the award for best comedy, and whilst the cast were overjoyed, the reaction from those watching at home was mixed to say the best. The comedy show went up against After Le, Fleabag, Derry Girls, Sex Education and came out triumphant. After the announcement, Twitter was ided, with some furious fans of rival shows comparing the win to ious other world catastrophes. One person said: Forget Coronavirus, Brexit, bushfires or tensions in the Middle East... Mrs Browns Boys won an NTA ahead of @rickygervais After Le! Stop the planet... I want to get off. But that wasnapost the only person to compare the win to Brexit, another person said: Brexit, Boaty McBoatface, and now Mrs Brownaposs Boys winning an NTA over Fleabag, Derry Girls, Afterle and Sex Education. The public are not to be trusted. And: This is worse than Brexit. This country cannot be trusted with anything. Creator Brendan OaposCarroll who also plays his drag persona Agnes in the show, stood alongside his we Jenner Gibney - Cathy Brown - as they accepted the award. The show is based off the popular theatre production aposMrs Brownaposs Boysapos, and follows the lives of Agnes and her family.

And a home win over Dunfermline shows their form in Inverclyde is just as good as it’s ever been.Morton finding their feet both home and away makes what is always a dficult trip an even stfer test for Dundee.Win and their quest for consistency starts anew – lose and the Dee and McPake could be staring down the barrel."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/01/2.41134731-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/01/2.41134731-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/01/2.41134731-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/01/2.41134731-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"dundee seal loan return for goalkeeper conor hazard","story":"Dundee have confirmed the signing of goalkeeper Conor Hazard on loan from Celtic for the rest of the season.The Northern Ireland international played five games for the Dark Blues in an emergency-loan spell earlier in the campaign and s to challenge Jack Hamilton for the No  jersey.Hazard arrived from the champions in October when Hamilton needed surgery after suffering from appendicitis and impressed during his short time at the club.He played in wins over Ayr, Alloa and Morton before heading back to his parent club in November."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2020/01/19798931-897x564.jpg ","title":"dundee united 2 2 hibs appere solo goal earns united cup replay","story":"Louis Appere earned Dundee United a Scottish Cup fourth-round replay as they twice came from behind to draw with Hibs.Christian Doidge gave the Hibees a dream start after eight minutes at Tannadice before Lawrence Shankland scored a classy equaliser in first-half stoppage time.Martin Boyle put the visitors back in front with a powerful drive on  minutes before substitute Appere curled home a leveller on  minutes which earned the Terrors an Easter Road replay and a place in the hat for the last- draw.United showed five changes from the team which faced Partick last weekend with Jamie Robson, Calum Butcher, Ian Harkes, Peter Pawlett and Paul McMullan coming in for Adrian Sporle, Declan Glass, Nicky Clark, Louis Appere and Mark Reynolds.It was Pawlett#s first start for almost three months, with McMullan and Harkes seeing their first action since the last Dundee derby.What had been billed as the tie of the round got off to a frenetic start. And it was the visitors who almost took the lead after three minutes. However, Mark Connolly was in the right place at the right time to clear Florian Kamberi#s effort off the line.Hibs weren#t to be denied five minutes later, though, as they opened the scoring through a low Doidge effort. Slipped in by former Dundee man Boyle, the Welsh hitman coolly slotted under Benjamin Siegrist for -.On  minutes, straight from a United corner, the Hibees broke. Boyle was again the creator-in-chief, with his surging run into the Terrors# half leaving United back pedalling before Melker Hallberg saw his shot foiled by Siegrist.Kamberi again fired towards his fellow-countryman just before the half-hour but this time it was an easy save for United#s Swiss stopper.The Tangerines were struggling to get a foothold in the match and had created few chances as proceedings approached the half-way point. When Liam Smith found Harkes at the edge of the box to fire in a fairly innocuous shot, however, the mood seemed to lt around Tannadice.On  minutes, Siegrist again halted a deflected Kamberi effort from a matter of yards as the Hibees continued to press. United were starting to enjoy more possession, though, and went in at half-time with the tie level thanks to Shankland#s th domestic goal of the season.In the last of three minutes of added time at the end of the first period, Harkes strolled through the heart of the Hibs defence before sliding in Shankland to slot home from eight yards despite being under heavy pressure.United weren#t level for long, though, as two minutes into the second period the men from Edinburgh were back in the lead.Scott Allan played provider as he laid in Boyle to drive home low beyond an outstretched Siegrist from fully  yards.Kamberi#s battle with Siegrist continued on  minutes with the goalie again denying the striker#s thunderbolt from distance with the rebound just evading Boyle on the follow-up.Allan fired over just after the hour as the Terrors, again, fell out of the game as boss Robbie Neilson ordered their first change of the afternoon, sending Appere on for Pawlett.And young attacker Appere had the desired impact  minutes after coming on, picking up possession on the left before twisting and turning away from Steven Whittaker and then David Gray to curl a delightful effort beyond the helpless Ofir Marciano for -.Both teams pushed for a winner in the closing  minutes, with Siegrist pulling off a top save from Doidge in injury time, but it never came, meaning these two will have to do it all again a week on Tuesday in the capital.Dundee United : Siegrist , Smith, Watson, Connolly, Robson Harkes , Butcher , Powers McMullan, Shankland, Pawlett .Subs not used: Deniz, Sporle, Reynolds, Sow and King.Hibs : Marciano , Naismith , Porteous , Hanlon , Stevenson Hallberg, Allan, Whittaker Boyle, Doidge, Kamberi.Subs: Bogdan , Slivka, Newell, Horgan and Shaw.Ref: Kevin Clancy.Att: ,."},{"url":null,"title":"exclusive hibs kid fraser murray set for dundee loan","story":"Hibs youngster Fraser Murray is set to join Dundee on loan until the end of the season, Tele Sport can exclusively reveal.The -year-old midfielder is a product of the Hibees academy set-up and has made  appearances for their first team.The Easter Road club are keen for him to get more game-time under his belt and hope a switch to Dens Park will offer that.The Dark Blues hope to have the deal sewn up this week in time for Saturday’s trip to Morton.Meanwhile, club-mate Sean Mackie has ed to Hibs after picking up an injury in his temporary spell on Tayside."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/07/5d1a2b73b20428.81132281-726x564.jpg ","title":"lack of leadership a worrying trait in dark blues current plight","story":"What is worrying me most about Dundee right now is the lack of leadership on show at the club, from top to bottom.Dark Blues boss James McPake even admitted himself in the aftermath of last Friday’s - loss to Dunfermline at East End Park that his experienced players didn’t step up to the plate.That is very concerning. They are not going well but you would at least expect them to be out there giving their all.Particularly with a young player like Lyall Cameron making his first start for the club – they have to protect him and dictate how things go on the pitch.I do still feel sorry for James in a way because there is only so much a manager can do once he’s picked a team and sent it out to play.If you have players giving you   every week then you are off to a good start but he is not getting that from even his most senior pros.Kane Hemmings, for example, played like he is getting frustrated. He isn’t getting the right service but he needs to lead by example and work his socks off even when it leads to nothing.James needs his leaders to find a voice and try to get a reaction when they are struggling in games.Too often this season they have gone down without a fight and it was the same down at East End Park.That can be down to a lack of confidence because they aren’t playing well or getting the desired results, but I still think when you are struggling it’s best to go back to basics.I’ve been saying this for weeks, even months, now but it’s the first step of getting back on track.I’ve got a lot of respect for James for sticking to his principles and trying to play possession football out from the back but it’s not getting them into the final third often enough. vw, px\"  They have got to be more direct. It may not be pretty but it can be effectiveit’s executed properly.I thought Ollie Crankshaw did that well when he came on in the second half.He played like he had more positivity in the short spell he was involved than most of the other players.One player they’ve been linked with who I feel is the type they need is Hearts centre-back Christophe Berra.He has not quite got legs anymore and he is getting on a bit but he has got the drive and would run through a brick wall for his team.He would be a massive signing for Dundeehe is fit and sharp."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2020/01/dundee-morton.jpg ","title":"pars not getting carried away as they close gap","story":"Dunfermline manager Stevie Crawford insists his side won’t be getting carried away as they closed the gap to Dundee and the promotion play-offs to one point.The Pars’ - win over the Dark Blues on Friday night moved them to within a point of James McPake’s men in fourth .The Fers dominated at East End Park as Ryan Dow and Kevin Nisbet goals gave them a vital three points after five games without a victory.However, Crawford said: “We’re not getting too carried away.“I keep saying it and, I don’t want to sound boring and repetitive, but you can win a couple of games in this league and be looking at the play-offs then lose a couple of games and you’re looking at relegation.“The boys have worked extremely hard, bought into it and, when questions are being asked about how our season is going to go, to a man they deserve an enormous amount of credit for the way they performed on Friday.”The Pars boss reserved special praise for striker Nisbet as he hit his nd goal of the season amid reports Rangers and others are monitoring his progress as the January transfer window draws to a close.Crawford added: “He’s playing with a lot of confidence, scoring goals and he will attract attention. vw, px\"  “It’s a good problem for us.

All have end-stage organ failure, be it kidney, liver, lung or heart, and require a le-saving transplant.Organs for transplant usually come from bodies of people who agreed to donate before death. But as this does not produce enough organs, both Scotland and England plan to bring in an #opt out# system, meaning that on death a person#s agreement to organ donation is assumed unless they had actively opted out.Live donation is an alternative to awaiting a cadaveric organ. As people can live happily with one kidney or half a liver, family members or altruistic iniduals sometimes offer to donate these organs. Since matching donor and recipient tissue-type, however, is generally required these donations are not always acceptable.Now groups of tissue-type incompatible donor recipient pairs are getting together to mix and match, producing duos who are tissue-type-compatible. So let#s say Annie is rejected as a kidney donor for her sister Jean for incompatibility reasons, and similarly, Arthur is rejected as kidney donor for Jim. But pairing donor Annie with recipient Jim and Arthur with Jean could lead to two successful transplants. A recent report from the US describes the first ever bi-organ exchange involving a liver-kidney swap * .In this specic case a daughter wished to donate a kidney to her mother with renal failure but was rejected because she might later develop the same kidney problem. So she offered half of her liver in exchange for a kidney for her mother. Another donor was eventually identied who wanted to donate half her liver to her sister with liver failure but was rejected because her liver was too small. But she was cleared for kidney donation. So on the day of the swap four operations took place and two needy people received le-giving new organs.Although not presently being considered in the UK, with the ethical issues sorted, this multi-swap procedure opens the way for extended chains of donors and many more lives saved.*Torres et al Am J transplant. :-."},{"url":null,"title":"tarbert club on target for 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe first competition of the new year at Tarbert Gun Club also served as the January leg of the club#s winter league.A full house of  teams turned out on Sunday January , and the early shooters had to put up eith windy conditions which made the clays dance.

Nearly three years later I fear the dream is still a long way from that reality.Mid Argyll Youth Development Servicescertainly seems to have ambitious plans for an indoor skate park and this is to be lauded, however a quick look online will show an apparent apathy with regard to moving forward with the project. A young man created the #Lochgilphead Skate Park Association# on Facebook in , yet a final post in  indicated how little the proposal had moved forward. If the project needs more money to actually get it built we need to know how much, so that appropriate funding can be sought.What is causing the project to take years to come to fruition The potential for help by the £ million Tarbert and Lochgilphead Regeneration Fund in  was dashed when councillors instead decided that improvements to road junctions, streets, a cycle track and indoor bowling were more important, and allocated a staggering £, to feasibility studies for these projects alone, this is before any work is actually done, you understand.That is a great deal of money for feasibility studies and design works.Let us be realistic # in nine long years the community has gone from the initial excited buzz about a skate park to finally managing to purchase a plot of land upon which to build it in early . From there it seems the project has not been able to move.In the meantime the youngsters who worked so hard to give momentum to the project appear to have given up hope and are now probably giving thought to employment prospects rather than having fun.It is a sad state of affairs.But rather than giving up hope, let us reignite this campaign for our children to have the dream of a skate park in Lochgilphead whilst they are still young enough to enjoy it.Nick MacIneskar, TayvallichSir,With regard to your story in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser #Inveraray seawall in need of attention#, would it be possible to contact BEAR Scotland and ask themthey could also create an access point to the shore Possibly at the bus stop at Barn Brae. Thanks very much.Marion McIntosh, InveraraySir,I should like to make an appeal to all MPs, MSPs, councillors and all lawmakers that in  they make no new laws.At the beginning of this new decade they should improve the laws they already passed. I would even like for them to go further and reduce the number of laws that are in existence.Now please don’t get me wrong, I am not against all laws. What I fear is that instead of addressing the issues which are negative to iniduals and society, legislators believing that by extending what are regarded as crimes changes society for the better. Their belief is wrong.We know that parking on pavements is wrong #upskirting# is horrying smoking in a car in which they are children is unacceptable dropping litter is shameful driving through a red light is dangerous.What we need is the range of social and cultural influences that help us feel that we should behave in a positive way. In the s, s and s the majority of people regularly attended churches and religious organisations. In these environments people developed feelings of what was right and wrong. Positive behaviour was also developed by participating in the extensions of these organisations through activities in young mother groups women#s guilds, choirs, and religious celebrations. These helped develop positive moral compass in people.Equally, most children and young people went to youth organisations such as the Girl Guides, Scouts, the BBs, army and naval cadets.

A wee van and a motorbike were behind them at the time and they let them pass and they disappeared down the twisty road at an incrediblespeed.They reached Tighnabruaich at about  o#clock and saw Fulmar in the water, but when they stopped to speak to Johnny Malcolm and Donald Turner they were told she was not in the water more than # an hour and still not fully rigged. They were quite right but George Smith said they were busy getting Psyche ready for launchingbut they would be out first thing in the morning to bend on the sails and finish off the rigging.They got their storesin the yard and with these and their luggage went aboard in two trips. Things were soon put sufficiently enough in order to allow them to get to bed and after watching Psyche go down the slip they were soon in their bunks. It was a beautully clear evening but distinctly cold.Next morning they were up at sevenand about eight the yard men came out and finished up their jobs. Jimmy Smith fixed up the slipping clutch and suggested we do away with the present gear lever fancy arrangement which was not strong enough for its work. This the Skipper agreed to though it meant a less handy working but it did away with the pin and shield that broke up the dog-house seat, they being replaced by a removable hatch cover. It certainly made sitting in the dog-house more comfortable.The Skipper went ashore to the village for meat and some curtain hooks while Archie watered ship and the other two continued cleaning and clearing up aboard.At quarter to twelve they were away under full sail and in brilliant sunshine but with a cold north-westerly they ran to Ardlamont then beat up to Tarbert, being passed just outside Tarbert as an aeroplane flew close overhead, by Blink. They noticed a huge oil tanker doing trials just off Arran.They were anchored off the herring pier before  o#clock and they had supper-cum-lunch then went ashore. The Pilot to visit a friend, the others to get milk in the village then to walk to the end of the road on Loch Fyne. On their way they spoke to an enthusiastic English pair, working in their garden, who wanted to know off which yacht they had come.During the evening Arcturus and Tunnag came in and one or two motor boats. Zaidie was in when they arrived and Leonora was anchored across Loch Fyne in Buck Bay.All aboard, Margaret and Archie went off to the islet in the harbour to get some roots for their new garden then soon afterwards all turned in, for though it was a glorious looking evening it was perishingly cold and the stove, lit as soon as they anchored, had been very welcome.On Sunday they were again up early and found a dull overcast day. The Pilot, ashore for water, heard a poor weather forecastfrom a fishing board. On the strength of this they hurried breakfast and by  o’clock were away with a south-westerly breeze.The Skipper gave the first beacon a rap with the boom-end as they ran out of the harbour. The beat down to Ardlamontand thee ran the engine for five minutes to get out of a nasty lop. The sun came out for about five minutes but by the time they had reached the Carry Buoythe rain had started and it got heavier and heavier.The wind strengthened with the rain and they moved up very fast into Tighnabruaich Bay then up to Loch Riddon to anchor off the pier at Ormidale. As they passed Tighnabruaich they saw Torridon was on Fulmar’s mooring and they watched her crew panicking to get off before Fulmar arrived. They wondered what the Torridons said when they saw Fulmar pass on through and realised that they could have stayed where they were. As they passed Glen Caladh the new Jansi of Kames passed under a not very healthy-sounding engine.They had lunch and the stove was lit then Margaret and Archie went ashore to visit friends and when they came back they brought with them a big sack of coal . The late afternoon and evening were spent below talking and listening to the rain hammering on the deck.Monday morning it was dry but blowing hard. They got the anchor early and motored to the moorings. The sails were hoisted to dry them and St Roma came close by to make their number and at one time a big school of thrasher whales went through the Kyles heading east and at a great speed.About noon they went ashore for a visit to the hotel and for a run round the Ardlamont road . Back aboard they had lunch and soon after packed up and came home."},{"url":null,"title":"the cinema on wheels returns","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe screen machine will be rolling back into Mid Argyll at the end of the month.Bringing with it a host of movies for film fans the Screen Machine will be in Campbeltown Road car park in Tarbert from Wednesday January  to Thursday January  and Lochgilphead Resource Centre car park from Friday January  to Sunday February .Musical fantasy film Cats, based on the Andrew Lloyd Webber stage musical, features an ensemble cast including James Corden, Judi Dench, Jason Derulo, Idris Elba, Jenner Hudson, Ian McKellen, Taylor Swt, Rebel Wilson, and Francesca Hayward.Also known as Star Wars: Episode IX, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker is an epic space-opera film.

Douglas and Sons of Lilliesleaf, on Christmas Eve when Graham Douglas died .The Douglas family business was started at the end of the First World War by William Douglas, who had three sons Willie, Dan and Jimmy, who on leaving school in turn all joined the family business. Through time Willie and Jimmy both retired early from the firm through ill health and when Dan retired in  the business was taken over by Williersquos son, William , and long time colleague, Bill Reid . Graham became the fourth generation Williamto work in the business after leaving school and in  took over the business when his father, Bill, retired.The Douglas family took over the building of the annual Border Union Show and Kelso Ram Sales in  and the Championship Dog Show since the first Show in , completing  years for the former and  years for the latter respectively in .It is interesting to note they succeeded Messrs. Bulman, builders Kelso who had been involved with BUAS since . To have had only two main Contractors in over  years is indicative of their skills and loyalties.Graham was very clever at school with a good practical brain and I heard from his le long friend, Andy Shortreed, that he was an expert at, among other things, technical drawing and would make all manner of things out of wood and other material.He was encouraged to study and utilise these skills while at High School in Hawick but Graham was stubborn! All he wanted to do was leave school and join his father, Bill, and be a fencer, which he duly did in .Countless number of farms and estates throughout the Borders have benefited from Grahamrsquos skill, as have the three core events at BUAS. His younger brother, Neil, was in partnership with Graham for a number of years before ing to utilising his skills with heavy plant machinery.I cannot have more regard and respect for Bill and Graham and how they nurtured me when I joined BUAS as Secretary in . I listened and I learnt from them all the ins and outs of both the Showground and preparing these massive annual Events and bringing them together in such a professional manner and with an uncanny calmness that sometimes was frustrating but one knew that come the day the target was reached. The Ram Sales have evolved over the last  years with many changes and updates and it was a pleasure working with someone who was always conscious of the huge responsibility he had to the many thousands of people, whose livelihoods were often very dependant on a good Ram Sales or a good Show, whether buying, selling, exhibiting, a Trade Stand, providing a service or a member of the public.Grahamrsquos other passion in le was his racing pigeons, which he has bred and raced for over  years - and for the last  with his friend and near neighbour in Lilliesleaf, Bob Spearman. They had many years of great fun and indeed numerous successes with their birds and it was always a great pleasure and exciting for those at the Showground when in the spring Graham would very often bring a crate of young birds when he came to work and released them as part of their early training. A master breeder even he did not understand how the young birds knew which direction was home!He had a great eye and would spend many long evenings just watching the birds to learn which would be potential race winners and which to keep as breeding stock. They had their fair share of success in UK races, whether from Edinburgh or the south coast of England but their biggest success was when one of their favourites ndash Bonnie Lad ndash finished th out , birds released from the South of France. No-one does fathom how these incredible birds find their way home and I believe these two wise owls were also baffled but enjoyed the discussion and banter over a pint or two in the local pub. Thankfully Bob Spearman is carrying on with the ldquoLilliesleaf Legends pigeon flock.Grahamrsquos greatest assets were that he was honest, thorough and reliable with great attention to detail in anything and all in which he was involved.

Perhaps at her age she didnrsquot understand exactly what was going on inside, but all she knew was that her granny shersquod loved was gone and she missed her.Then one evening during a bedtime story, Jessica started to cry and told her dad that her granny was melting like a snowman. At first he wasnrsquot sure what she meant, but then he understood.Jessicarsquos memory of her granny was fading. This was a second loss for her. The first loss was of her grannyrsquos physical presence, her actual hugs, her voice and care and love, even the smell of her perfume. Now Jessica was losing her memory of all this and she knew it. So she felt that something inside her was melting too, something that had been so much of her was vanishing.And this made Jessica fear that others in her le could disappear and then melt away as well, even her dad or mum. It was a terrying thought and it made her not just sad but scared and insecure inside.Her dad tried to reassure her that he or her mum werenrsquot going to die, but despite being only six years old, Jessica now knew that such promises couldnrsquot be kept forever.ldquoNana didnrsquot want to die either, but she did.

When they arrived, she hesitated to sit and had a wave of emotion.ldquoI miss Nana, she saidldquoSo do I. Shall we sit on her seat and miss her together.ldquoBut we have to eat sweeties.ldquoJust so happens Irsquove got some in my pocket, said the dad with a smile. His daughter smiled back and sat on the seat.

I use this phrase to describe the spectacle of street lights at night when viewed from a vantage point.One of the best places in East Lothian to view the lsquoupside down skyrsquo is from the road by Farsquoside Castle. This vantage point gives you views over Wallyford, Musselburgh, Portobello and Edinburgh beyond.These urban areas create a sea of lights which look like a sky full of bright stars, except, of course, itrsquos lsquoupside downrsquo and theyrsquore not really stars. But it looks spectacular in its own way. In fact, views with bright city lights are these days often considered tourist attractions.But Irsquove recently realised something: while the lsquostarsrsquo of the lsquoupside down skyrsquo are getting more numerous and extensive every year, the real stars in the actual sky are becoming more dficult to see at least where I live.Literally thousands upon thousands of houses are being built in the western part of our county. Much of the rural landscape in this part of East Lothian, which I knew when I was a child, is going fast.Most of me understands and accepts the needs for this, but a part feels sad at the loss of a recognisable landscape. And already I have noticed that a by-product of this has been increased light pollution in areas close to where I live. It is going to get much more noticeable as more development takes place.I know many people will say there are many more things to think about, especially in late January, when the Christmas turkey is coming home to roost and all those bills have to be paid at a time when we are already financially drained from festive expenditure, and stressed out. Thank goodness for Burns suppers, a highlight of a month that often seems both the darkest and longest of the year.But this is all the more reason to pause. When was the last time you really had the opportunity to sit under a dark night sky full of visible stars  This is one of naturersquos free gts and stargazing has real benefits for our mental health and emotional wellbeing.I remember some years ago, when visiting a friend in a very rural part of Scotland, I went out to put something in the bin. My friend came out to seeI was OK, as I hadnrsquot ed after  minutes. I had been struck by the beauty and power of the starlit sky, unpolluted by city lights. Without noticing the time, I had sat just gazing at the universe above me.I can remember the sense of awe and peace it created. Sure, part of it was also the quiet and stillness in that area, but sitting under the canopy of stars is what overwhelmed me in that moment.Itrsquos an experience fewer of us can enjoy because of the increase in light pollution, but also noise and general busyness all around us. So we often donrsquot even realise what wersquore missing. Perhaps there is a cause and effect here: the less you notice the absence of something, the less you think itrsquos important or relevant.Our ancient ancestors understood its power. But I think we have lost the sense. I recently asked a group of young people how many of them had sat under the stars and just gazed and wondered at them. Sadly, none had done so, and some thought the idea ldquoweird. I think a lot of adults would share that opinion.But taking time to sit and really wonder at an unpolluted night sky can fill us with awe, as I experienced that evening at my friendrsquos house. It makes us feel small and in so doing it puts our worries and anxieties in perspective. It can promote inner peace and calm.For sure, the bills wonrsquot go away neither will the stress at work or whatever is dominating your thoughts most of the day. But in taking time to pause and wonder at the vast and almost timeless beauty of the stars, your soul gets time to catch up. It can help you see things dferently, in a more creative way. Itrsquos a form of meditation with something bigger than we can imagine, but also something incredibly beautul.And itrsquos fascinating, as you try to identy the dferent constellations, and perhaps realise how much you donrsquot know or have forgotten. Could you identy the northern star, and what constellations can you see  Sailors in days of old were experts at identying the stars to aid direction, but Irsquom sure they also marvelled at the unhindered beauty and mystery of them as well.There are still many places in our county where we can be wrapped in star-lit darkness. But as the lsquoupside down skyrsquo gets bigger and brighter, the real stars are fading in so many places.The real shame is, as the stars disappear from our sight, they may disappear from our consciousness as well.Letrsquos not let that happen. Let us gt our children, and ourselves, with the noticing and gazing at the real stars in our sky and somehow find the time, even briefly, to stargaze."},{"url":null,"title":"garry-oconnor-referees-haddington-amateur-teams-successful-charity-match","story":"Haddington Town FC took time out over the festive period for a special friendly in aid of Back Onside.Former Hibernian and Scotland striker Garry OrsquoConnor, who is an ambassador of the good cause, refereed the match, which saw members of the amateur teamrsquos squad come up against one another on January .Matt OrsquoConnell, chairman of the club, which was formed last year, said they were determined to help support the charity, which helps young people and adults who face mental health challenges.He said: ldquoWersquore a club that was founded on the idea of bringing local guys together into a positive social and active environment.ldquoItrsquos well documented that the highest proportion of suicide across Scotland is men aged - and thatrsquos something we hope to positively redress in our town by facilitating a great environment in which local guys can improve not only their physical but also their mental health.ldquoOur connection with the charity Back Onside was really born of their slogan, #SupportThroughSport, a powerful statement that really resonated with us.ldquoTheyrsquore a great charity who are doing a hell of a lot across the UK and so for us, a small amateur club barely nine months old, to play a small part in helping a charity who share our ethos was immensely rewarding.Haddington Town play on Sunday mornings in Division Two of the Lothian and Edinburgh Amateur Football Association , alongside fellow county side Meadowmill.The charity match, played at Knox Academy, finished - in favour of the lsquoawayrsquo Haddington Town team.Libby Emmerson, founder and CEO of Back Onside, said: ldquoWe are beyond grateful for the support received from Haddington Town Amateur Football Club and guest referee Garry OrsquoConnor.ldquoAs a small charity with a huge clientele, community events such as the Haddington Town AFC charity match are key to raising funds and awareness so that we can continue to support those facing mental health challenges.Mr OrsquoConnell thanked everyone for their support, with the match raising pound, ndash more than double the target.He said: ldquoHuge thanks to Libby Emmerson, FES FM and Garry OrsquoConnor.

They are able to catch and release Atlantic salmon, and they are able to catch and retain sea trout, should they catch them.ldquoBut at the moment, because of the way in which we grade the rivers and because of the grading of some of the rivers in that estuary, they are not able to retain the salmon.Mr Main made the comments while giving evidence to Holyroodrsquos Environment, Climate Change and Land Reform Committee.He was questioned on possible exemptions for the haaf netters by Scottish Labour MSP Claudia Beamish, who represents the South of Scotland region.She suggested the ancient technique kills less fish because it doesnrsquot use hooks, adding: ldquoTherefore, is it not possible that the haaf netters could keep fish  Is that something yoursquove looked into Dr John Armstrong, director of Marine Scotlandrsquos Freshwater Fisheries Laboratory, said he could ldquosee the logic to this.He told MSPs: ldquoThere wouldnrsquot necessarily be a need to take the fish out of the water, which is one of the key issues.ldquoBut anglers typically only catch in the order of  per cent of fish moving up-stream.ldquoAnd now, even of that % theyrsquore releasing %, in that order.ldquoSo therersquos very little damage from catch and release in angling, just by those numbers.ldquoIn terms of where we have rivers that are in poor conservation status, we really just donrsquot want fish killed Irsquom afraid.The Annan Haaf Net Project has been documenting those who still brave the icy waters with their nets, while the Devilrsquos Porridge Museum in Eastriggs, Dumfries and Galloway, is currently staging an exhibition on the practice.Haaf netter Barry Turner recently told the BBC: ldquoIt would be an act of vandalism, cultural and historic vandalism,this traditional activity which is unique to the inner Solway dies.ldquoPlease save us, wersquore desperate for protection.

Until the UK-EU free trade agreement, or no agreement, is known it is not possible to finalisea policy.However, contingency planning is sensible, and one possibility stands out ndash Scotland joining the European Free Trade Association .That guarantees access to the EU single market, but outwith its customs union and therefore able to exercise a great deal more sovereignty than is possible with EU membership.There is a big dference between asking the Scotsthey want the UK to remain within the EU, as in the  EU referendum, to asking them to vote for independence on the premise that an independent Scotland would re-join the EU whilst the rest of the UK remains out.The EU is a customs union.If Scotland joins that customs union whilst the rest of the UK remains out that would inevitably create a trade border at Gretna.At the very least, there would no longer be ldquofrictionless trade between Scotland and England. As with Northern Ireland, where a new border has been created between Ulster and mainland Britain on the Irish Sea, a parallel border arrangement would inevitably be required between Scotland and England in the event of an independent Scotland re-joiningthe EU.Depending on the outcome of the negotiations about to begin between the UK and EU on their future trading relationship, tarfs and quotas on trade may also be required between an independent Scotland and England to maintain the integrity of the EU customs union. By promising to re-join the EU after independence, the SNP would therefore be handing a gt to our Unionist opponents.They would weaponise the border issue in exactly the same way they did with the currency issue in the  Independence Referendum.The chances of winning the referendum would be unnecessarily and substantially weakened.These issues do not arisean independent Scotland is part of a free trade agreement but not in a customs union.

Meanwhile, the service costs around pound million to run per year at a time when the BBC is looking to make massive savings.There are concerns, though The National Federation of the Blind of the UKare so concerned, they have launched a \"Save the BBC Red Button Teletext Service\" campaign, saying that the service is \"vital for visually impaired, deaf, disabled and older people, as well as many other people who want to find out information independently in an easy, convenient and accessible format, who are not online.The organisation expressed concern that the withdrawal will ldquoleave many people, who are already vulnerable, further isolated and marginalised from society.Therersquos a petition Along with the British Deaf Association , the bodies submitted a petition to the BBC this week to \"stop the switch off\".

They will explore the rich history and stories associated with it, through which it became a beacon of the Enlightenment and leading centre for the arts.ldquoWe look forward to welcoming visitors, local and from all over the world, to enjoy these events and help celebrate this fantastic anniversary.The story of Greyfriars Bobby emerged in the latter half of the s after he became something of a local celebrity in the capital. The dog was said to be the pet of John Gray, who worked for the Edinburgh City Police as a nightwatchman, and stayed in Greyfriars Kirk for almost a decade and a half after Mr Gray died, living near his grave.The tale has gone on to inspire both books and films, and a statue of the dog at the corner of Candlemaker Row and the George IV Bridge, remains a popular visitor spot for tourists.The graveyard is also a place of pilgrimage for Harry Potter fans, after author JK Rowling revealed that some of the names on the gravestones had filtered into her novels, while the setting also resembles the cemete ry where the boy wizardrsquos parents are buried.Besides its active congregations, worshipping in Gaelic and English, the kirk contributes to a flourishing local community in central Edinburgh through creating communities of support, social enterprise and wellbeing at the Grassmarket Community Project and the Greyfriars Charteris Centre.The church has links to the Covenantersrsquo early days as the defenders of Presbyterianism against any encroaches by the Catholic faith during the turbulent s.

A new book by local historian Roy Pinkerton has been launched to coincide with the  years exploring the history of the  churches, which have united to form the present-day Greyfriars congregation.In September there will be a spectacular flower festival which will see the building filled with colourful displays paying tribute to the rich history of the  churches.Musical highlights include a performance of the Renaissance masterpiece Spem in Alium by the Scottish Chamber Orchestra Chorus, led by the conductor Gregory Batsleer on  February.During Lent, in a joint concert, the Dunedin Consort and Scottish Ensemble will perform Sir James Macmillanrsquos Seven Last Words from the Cross on March .Edinburgh Royal Choral Union plans a special commission for choir, soloist and organ from composer Thomas LaVoy November .

There will also be chances to get involved, with a ldquoCome  Sing Brahmsrsquos Requiem, conducted by Angus Tully on Aprill , and further events planned.Rev Richard Frazer, who has been the minister of Greyfriars Kirk since , said: ldquoChristmas  marks not only  years of our building but  years of our congregation, an uninterrupted history that has been sustained from the dawn of the modern era and an astonishing record of faith in action."},{"url":null,"title":"last call to nature fund applicants","story":"Nature enthusiasts are being encouraged to submit ambitious ideas to improve habitats, safeguard species and tackle the causes of bioersity loss.Applications are being invited for the latest round of the Bioersity Challenge Fund .But anyone applying will have to be quick – applications for this round must be received by midnight on Monday, February .

While HIAL has gone through the motions of consulting, having clearly failed to take on board any of the concerns raised, it is dficult to see what purpose this has served.“Since the announcement last week, I have been in discussions with local ATC staff who feel badly let down by HIAL.  Nobody disputes the need for modernisation, but even HIAL’s own consultants concluded that the remote tower model was the most costly and risky option. Alternatives were identied that could have delivered the improvements needed at a fraction of the cost.“While I welcome that HIAL is to carry out an island impact assessment, given its approach to consultation so far, there have to be questions over how robust or independent this assessment will be.#In the meantime, ministers must wake up to the scale of opposition and dissatisfaction amongst HIAL’s ATC staff. They should also recognise the clear threat this poses to delivery of leline air services in Orkney and across the Highlands  Islandsstaff choose to vote with their feet. That alone should give Ministers pause for thought and allow more time for alternative options to be explored”.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

For those who campaigned and voted for Brexit, this will be a cause for celebration. For others, our departure from the EU after more than  years will be a matter of despair.I didn’t vote for Brexit in the  referendum, but as a democrat I believe that the outcome of referendums should be respected.If I feel any emotion at all on Friday night, it will probably be one of relief, that we are finally making some progress in getting Brexit sorted, and the country is at last moving forward after three-and-a-half years of stagnation.: Brian Monteith: It is my last week as an MEP, here is what I’ll do: Why Brexit means we could be  times more at risk from dodgy chemicals – Dr Richard DixonFor too long, Brexit has dominated our national discourse.

Perth’s River Tay is transformed into a winter wonderland for the Riverside Light Nights event, while in Edinburgh the BurnsBeyond festival has an East Asian feel to celebrate the confluence of Burns Night and the Chinese New Year.Yet these global spectacles are accompanied by a hint of poignancy: by the time they finish next month, Scotland will have been taken out of the European Union, an international community that is as much about exchanging cultural experiences as it is about trade and policy.Brexit threatens to be catastrophic for Scotland’s creative and cultural sector. Outside the EU we risk being deprived of vital funding for cultural projects, and of the international talent that makes our festivals the envy of the world.With EU exit now a certainty on Friday, and with a no-deal withdrawal still a real threat on  December, I want to outline the steps the Scottish Government is taking to protect this vital sector and ensure that Scotland remains a dynamic, open cultural nation.: Brexit: How Scotland will be in big troubleEU migrants stop coming – Steve Cardownie: Edinburgh Fringe reviews:  shows about BrexitLet’s start by looking at just some of the benefits of EU membership. Thanks to free movement, the EU gives us access to a market of  million people who can come here freely to write, act, perform, or contribute to our cultural le in other ways. Being in the customs union allows our world-class musicians, bands and ensembles to tour across Europe without the hindrance of customs checks between borders.Cross-border cultural exchangesAnd of course, there’s the funding: the Scottish culture sector received at least £ million from the EU between  and , supporting  projects. Many of these were supported through the Creative Europe programme, the EU’s principle funding initiative for the European culture sector. From a festival of string music featuring the Scottish Ensemble alongside musicians from Germany, Estonia and Norway, to a dance and theatre project involving young people from countries including Scotland, Belgium and Denmark, these were projects which facilitated collaboration and cultural exchanges across borders. Many of them simply couldn’t have happened without the support of the EU.With our access to these benefits set to come to an end, today I’m welcoming leading figures from Scotland’s creative and tourism sectors to a round-table discussion to consider the best way the Scottish Government can support them as they prepare for the many implications of leaving the EU.Thousands of talented performersAmong the organisations represented will be the Scottish Chamber Orchestra, National Galleries of Scotland and the Scottish Contemporary Arts Network. These organisations stand to be affected by Brexit in a iety of ways. A fth of the Scottish Chamber Orchestra’s players are from where in the EU, for example, and will be impacted by the UK Government’s new immigration rules. I’m pleased to have the chance to hear from them directly about their specic concerns. I will also be making the case for Britain to remain part of the Creative Europe programme after Brexit, retaining a crucial source of funding for our creative sectors.On Saturday I’ll be helping to promote Scotland’s creative industries to a global audience at the th anniversary celebrations of Showcase Scotland at Celtic Connections. This event introduces international producers, directors and other music industry professionals to emerging Scottish artists, with the aim of securing global touring opportunities. Every year it partners with a dferent country, and this year will be Finland’s turn. As well as offering six Finnish bands the opportunity to perform in Glasgow, this is a chance to build on Scotland’s links with our European neighbours – links we will continue to support and build on in the face of Brexit.As the year progresses, attention will turn inevitably to the Edinburgh Festivals. These world-famous events involve nearly , non-UK participants – a third of whom are from the European Economic Area – drawing audiences of about . million and generating more than £ million in cultural tourism value every year. After Brexit we risk losing access to thousands of talented performers who help to make the festivals so successful.Visa problemsConscious of the potential impact on all UK festivals from the loss of free movement, I have invited representatives from the UK Government and the Welsh and Northern Irish administrations to a summit in Edinburgh to explore the problems festivals face in relation to UK visa and immigration policy.The current process for non-EU citizens is y, complex and costly, with attendees or organisers sometimes spending thousands of pounds on visas and associated costs for a visit that often only lasts a few days. With European performers now facing a similarly dficult process to be able to perform here, summit participants will work together to develop practical solutions for visiting artists and performers in what is likely to be an increasingly restrictive immigration system.The initiatives I’ve outlined here are just some of the ways we are seeking to protect Scotland’s creative and cultural sector from the worst effects of Brexit. Scotland may be leaving the EU, but we will remain a proudly European nation, and the Scottish Government is working tirelessly to ensure we continue to play a central role in the continent’s cultural le.Fiona Hyslop is Secretary for Culture, Tourism and External Affairs and the SNP MSP for Linlithgow©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"lloyds bank closures 56 bank of scotland and halifax branches to close","story":"The banking giant has confirmed plans to shut  Lloyds,  Halax and  Bank of Scotland branches between April and October .The company said the closures are part of a store reduction programme in response to changing customer behaviour and the move towards online banking.Banking union Accord said the move is expected to see staff numbers cut by \"under \" as many employees are to be redeployed in other branches. - Two women in court after video apparently shows baby girl handed a drink from a wine bottleA Lloyds Banking Group spokeswoman said: \"We are committed to having the largest branch network in the UK and, in addition to our branches, all our customers can also use the PostOffice to access their banking locally, alongside our mobile branches which visit many rural communities.\"We have confirmed that a number of branches will close between April and October this year.\"This is in response to changing customer behaviours and the reduced number of transactions being made in branches.\"It comes as the bank continues its closure programme which affected Lloyds and Halax sites in . - Billionaire set to transform remote Scottish village into community hubIn a statement, Accord said: \"We fully appreciate that the demand for high street branch banking is diminishing as customers increasingly move to app-based banking but well be examining Lloyds Banking Groups plans to ensure that theyre properly thought through and robustly evidenced.\"So far, all branch closures have been managed without compulsory redundancies and Accord expects the same outcome here.\"Well be contacting our members who are impacted by the closures to offer support and representation.\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"scottish parliament backs holding indyref2 vote this year","story":"The Scottish Parliament has tonight backed calls for a second referendum on independence to be held in keynote vote.MSPs voted - in favour of a Scottish Government motion stating that \"a referendum should be held so that the people of Scotland can decidethey wish to become an independent country.\"First Minister Nicola Sturgeon insisted that the case for independence is \"overwhelming\" as Scotland faces up to Brexitthis week after a majority of people voted Remain in the EU referendum.But pro-union leaders branded the vote a \"ridiculous charade\" and insisted Scots wanted to see their Government focusing on shortcomings in the NHS, education system and crime figures.The vote is largely symbolic as the Scottish Parliament does not have control over the constitution which is reserved to Westminster. Ms Sturgeon sought a transfer of power from the Prime Minister to allow a referendum to be staged in the aftermath of the SNPs landslide victory in last months election north of the border - but this was rejected Boris Johnson.But Ms Sturgeon told MSPs today: \"The democratic case for allowing the people of Scotland to decide whether or not to become an independent country is overwhelming.\"The First Minister will now set out the \"next steps\" in her campaign to stage a referendum on independence this year in a flagship speech on Friday, the same day as the UK formally departs the European Union.Ms Sturgeon branded opposition parties \"anti-democratic\" over their rejection of a referendum.\"It is only ever parties who know their arguments are bust who have to resort to blocking democracy,\" the First Minister added.\"The more contempt they show for the right of Scotland to choose its own future, the more they demonstrate the urgent need for us to become independent as the only way to protect our vital interests.\"Ms Sturgeon insisted she will continue to make the case for independence which would allow Scotland to become \"fairer and more prosperous.\"She added: \"I know not everyone agrees with my position on independence, but Im happy to have that debate and let Scotland decide.\"The vote saw the pro-independence SNP and Greens to back the motion, which was opposed by the pro-union Tories, labour and Liberal Democrats.Tory interim leader Jackson Carlaw claimed the SNP leader knows there willnot be a referendum next year after this was rejected.\"The reason weve been called here today is that she needs to convince the `Yes movement behind her and beyond that something is happening,\" he said.\"I dont see why the majority of the country has to play along with this ridiculous charade.\"He added: \"If only this Government spent the same amount of attention on police and schools as it does on polling and spin we might have safer streets and the best schools in Europe.\"And while the SNP debate among themselves, their favoured route to another referendum, what the timetable should be and whether or not they have the approval of Westminster, most people outside the political bubble just look on in either wearied resignation or abject fury.\"The debate people outside this chamber want to see is about how to drive up education standards and give their children the solid start in le they need and deserve.\"Instead, here we go again, more time devoted to this First Ministers personal obsession at the expense of the countrys real and present priorities.\"Labour leader Richard Leonard accused the SNP leader of \"playing game\" by staging the vote.\"Nobody in this chamber really believes that there will be a referendum this year,\" he said.\"So Members of this Parliament are being asked to vote for what they know to be a hood. And many of them are prepared to do it willingly.This debate today is not an example of a good use of power. The First Minister claims to be speaking for Scotland. But she is not even speaking to Scotland.

If a situation occurs outside anticipated parameters then electronic control can be useless. Aircraft have landed in the wrong place and landed unexpectedly at Sumburgh. In such circumstance everyone is safer when the situation is within view of a live controller in the airport tower. Such a lookout may also assist aircraft in dficulties, and react tovandalism and other hazardous outbreaks.They should do away with all that glass windows in the control tower as well as all the windows in control towers all over the world as they are clearly not needed. All can be done by looking at a computer screen.Any body with any sense knows there is no requirement to look in the sky, or on the runway or at the weather to see for yourself what is going on.If HIAL are determined to go ahead with this, perhaps there should be a #trial# period, of say at least a minimum of one year.Instead of just installing all the cameras and whatever other gubbins is supposed to make this work, feeding it down the phone line and hoping for the best. Why not pull down the blinds in the tower here and give the local controllers the same monitor screens to look at as they#re intending to use remotely to operate from instead. Meanwhile, also send the data to Inverness, and have them monitor and log on how many occasions and for what duration the data received is either interrupted or of inadequate quality.If the system is as resilient as HIAL claim, they have nothing to worry about or hide, the local controllers will have no complaints about using monitors instead of looking out the window, there will have been no data interruptions to Inverness, and any deterioration in data quality will have been minimal. However,serious shortcomings are evident, a controller only needs to raise the blind to regain actual vision and immediately rescue a situation.Bosses say their communications system has been affected, and that engineers are on the scene working to remedy the situation.# Well, that#s OK then.

While he still enjoys the banter over the counter on a daily basis, hes made himself a local social media personality with his popular posts ranging from the daily headlines to his chatter sparking reminiscences about the confectionery of yesteryear. Editor Des Blackadder sat down with Eugene this week to hear just some of the stories he has to tell after four decades in his Broughshane Street shop.You could say that Eugene Diamond got his start in the newspaper industry and hes been associated with it for most of his adult le.Born in the late s in a long demolished row of mill workers cottages in James Street in Harryville, Eugene is one of nine children - three girls and six boys. Which must have been a tight fit in the James Street days.I was a baby when the family got a move to the houses in the Demesne Estate, just across the Braid River from Harryville. If you ask me I would say it was perfect place to grow up .. we had the ruins of a castle literally at the top of our estate and a forest pretty much on our doorstep!The neighbours were great people and there were lots of children growing up in the Demesne at the time. We used to have great fun making huts up in the woods - which we called the forest - just beside the old Intermediate School site. One of my best memories is making a hut under the pedestrian bridge over the Braid which led to the Ballykeel One estate - we could hear the people walking across above our heads and we thought we were some boys because they didnt know we were there! Innocent days indeed, laughs Eugene.There was no easy pocket money in those days so Eugene had to earn his by delivering newspapers around the sprawling Ballykeel Two estate which had been constructed in the late s.That was my first job in the newspaper business, recalls Eugene. I got the job with the late Tam Johnston who had premises at what used to be known as the Ballykeel One shops. He was a gentleman and his shop will be well remembered by the older generation around Ballykeel and Harryville.Having attended St Patricks High School, Eugenes first real job took him to the Murphys Bottling Plant which was sited just off Railway Street in Harryville.Always on the look out for an extra few quid, Eugene took on a weekend job serving in a clothes shop in the centre of Ballymena.That was me into the retail sector - and it was a great time to be in the clothing trade. A guy called Brian Close owned the shop which was called In-Gear. It was just at the corner of Bryan Street and Church Street - the same building occupied until recently by David Bellingham.Things went well and he offered me the post of manager so I left Murphys for good.It was an era of glam rock, outrageous stars and some outright fashion disasters.Top of the Pops more or less set the style. When the Bay City Rollers hit the heights their tartan striped half mast trousers and skinny college style jumpers were huge sellers especially with the girls.Most guys round Ballymena were pretty much content with a pair of jeans, a gingham shirt and a Shetland wool jumper. Younger lads wore a lot of Wrangler denim known locally as the Wrangler suit of jacket and skinner half mast jeans.I remember the night that David Essex appeared on Top of the Pops wearing a grandad shirt - the next day there was a huge demand for the style, we couldnt get enough of them!Bryan Ferry more or less brought the elegant suit back into fashion when he and Roxy Music made a comeback just after the punk era had faded. Guys all wanted the double-breasted suit with turn-up trousers at the time, he recalls.Eugene chuckles when I ask him about the fashion disasters he encountered.I sold an awful lot of velvet jackets at a time, he recalls. Black, blue, bottle green. They were very popular but I bet the guys who bought them wonder why when they look back.Then there was the parallel suit - I can remember the favourite colour was electric blue. Basically it was a sports coat worn with matching extra width trousers. You could have sailed the Atlantic with themyoud nailed them to a mast!But denim was, without doubt, the major seller in Ballymena and a controversial advert for one particular brand meant that Eugene found himself in the eye of a publicity storm which made headlines far and wide.In those days dferent shops were linked to a certain brand - for example Sam of Sams Boutique had what was effectively the Wrangler dealershipI remember. Edwin Maternaghan was another big name in fashion retailing locally and he had Brutus.By now the name of In-Gear had been changed to Bananas Boutique and we were selling Easy Jeans and a new product called Jesus Jeans.They had a full colour poster of a well-proportioned lady squeezed into a pair of Jesus Jeans with the slogan He who loves me, follows me. We put it up in the window and it was a marmite job - people either loved it or hated it! One religious group based out in the country started a petition about it so we started a counter petition in the shop.It was the time when Ballymena couldnt appear in a news story without the words Bible Belt being added on - around the same time you had the ELO showgrounds story making headlines too.While Eugene enjoyed the fun times at Bananas, he can well remember one of Ballymenas worst days of devastation during the troubles when Church Street was blown to smithereens by an IRA bomb.It was on Friday, May ,  and I remember I was chatting to a friend outside the shop when a police car raced up and an officer told us to clear the area because there was a bomb in a post office van parked in the street. I had got round to Wellington Street and was talking to my good friend journalist Lyle McMullan.I said to him theres a story for you and because there were so many bomb hoaxes in those days he replied onlyit goes off.With that the lower end of Church Street just lted. Ive never felt or seen anything like it before or since. It was a scene of utter devastation which people who lived through it will never forget. One of my vivid memories is how dficult it was to get re-opened - the shop had very distinctive rounded windows and it took a long time to get new glass  made by Pilkingtons. And of course a lot of people will remember the bomb damage sales which took place in the aftermath.When Bananas closed its doors in , Eugene reckoned it was time for a change of direction and when he came across a small shop for rent in Upper Broughshane Street he decided to take the plunge. It was called the First and last because it was the first shop on the way into town and, coversely, the last as you were going out!I had started off delivering papers as a wee boy and now I found myself in behind the counter of a paper shop, he said.”My first rent payment was pound a week.”Forty years later hes still loving the job - despite a horrying early .am start!Sure its only seven days a week, laughs Eugene.In those  years, Eugene has witnessed the high points of the newspaper market when titles like News of the World sold by the barrow load.You couldnt explain to todays generation just how huge the NOTW actually was. People might have bought the quality Sundays but they also bought the NOTW eventhey did tuck it inside the Sunday Times! Of course they were caught out in some abysmal practices and that cant be forgiven but they did break some enormously important stories too. I still have some NOTW publicity material on a side wall of the shop. It may well be the last such material still on display in Britain but I keep it there to remind of just how big the newspaper print industry was at the time.But selling papers was only part of Eugenes role and he was a past master at stirring up some publicity out of all proportion to the size of his tiny shop.Back in the early s I took a punt on getting my own Ballymena Rock made up by a firm in Newry. People thought I had lost the plot because everyone associated rock with seaside resorts and not a town like Ballymena. Thankfully local people loved the idea and I had a great sale on it. Quite a few bars were sent overseas too, he laughs.The ieties of sweets and chocolate bars Eugene has sold down through the years is staggering.In fact, Ive come to the conclusion that people here have the sweetest tooth in the world! If you want to start a debate in Ballymena all you have to do is ask someone what their favourite sweet of all time was.Im a diabetic so I dont do many sweets but I have a good knowledge of wnhat the public wants and to this day people will travel from all over the country to buy a certain brand of toffee or an old style boiled sweet which I stock. Sweets especially are memory jerkers and they have tremendous nostalgia value. If it gets people talking and laughing sure its a good thing. How many times have I heard stories about someone losing a filling to the old Rileys Toffee Rolls  And yet they still came back for more!And does he have a personal favourite Cinnamon Lozenges all the way, he says. As far as I know they are more or less an Irish-only sweet because people come in all the time and take away a few bags full to friends and family in other parts of the world.Talking about local flavours, Eugene says he still has regulars who come specically for the bottled minerals.You would not believe the number of people who still swear by Kali water! And the younger generation will have absolutely no idea wnat Kali Water is but older people will probably be remembering the day they took a drink of it by mistake.If digital technology is our pathway to the future then it is a time machine which works both ways and Eugenes nostalgia posts about old sweets on social media have been delighting the local public for the past few years.As one who was steeped in newspapers I was a latecomer to twitter and facebook but time waits for no man so I decided to embrace it. To be honest Ive had some great fun thanks to social media. People love the old pictures of products and just love to tell you their stories of why they loved a particular brand more than others, says Eugene.The recognition by the National Lottery reflects sales which have raised more than pound. million for good causes down through the years. As one of the last old style newsagents the award is well deserved and theextends its best wishes to Eugene as he embarks on his st year in the trade.

I’ll try where I can to find outanybody nearby owns the property. These places are almost always in a bad state of repair – broken windows, roofs and doors missing. “If it’s somewhere that’s been left open you’re not breaking and entering and you’re not going in to commit a crime so you can’t be prosecuted for that either. Michael likes to tell a story through the items that have been left behind“You’re going in at your own risk. If you can’t get in you write it off and move on. Like I say it’s a grey area so I prefer to keep a low profile and let my pictures speak for themselves.”Michael shares the photographs he takes via his Facebook and Instagram pages entitled Forgotten Places NI: “I respect people’s privacy andI’m ever asked to take any photos down I do it straight away.“I do it for the love of old buildings and their contents, it’s as simple as that. It’s a hobby and I don’t try to make any money from it. “I had been taking photos for my own pleasure to start with but when I showed them to other people they said I needed to share them online because they were so good. That’s why I started up Forgotten Places NI.”An old ambulance found at a derelict propertyMichael’s photographs are posted with a short description of the property but little detail about the location unless it’s somewhere that’s easily recognisable. He said he likes to keep his best finds to himself: “I know a couple of other guys who do this. There’s ones who take photographs and sell them. Mine is purely a hobby.“I’ll get messages from other people asking where I’ve been. I don’t always tell them. It’s dog eat dog. It sounds stupid because there’s nothing to gain from it.

I don’t see the point. It’s finding the places and not knowing what’s going to be inside that does it for me. If you go somewhere that’s already been documented it takes the excitement out of it.”Most of the properties are in a bad state of repairHe said: “What I do I call it documenting. I go in take pictures and write a wee blurb about the place I’ve been. “Sometimes it’s a property that’s got a ‘for sale’ sign at it. You’ll come back in three months and it’s gone, it’s been flattened for redevelopment. It’s sad because when you’re in it you get a real sense of the character of the house, the essence of it.”Michael said he used to have a penchant for ghost hunting, but with his new pursuit he tries to steer clear of the paranormal: “I used to have a bit of a fascination with paranormal investigation, though I think it had more to do with the old buildings. I love walking round old places as you can pick up so much of the history from just walking around. “I used to do a few paranormal investigations so that gave me an appreciation of old buildings, the character of them, just how dferent they are to the ones now.“With Forgotten Places NI I don’t like to spook things up to be scarier than they are. That said, there’s a post I put up just this weekend about a house that I called the House of Ambivilence. It really did have mixed feeling about it. “It looked lovely from the outside, a nice farmhouse. Downstairs had a nice calm atmosphere, but when you went upstairs, honestly, you wanted to get out again, something just didn’t sit. I felt uneasy about the atmosphere. A well lived in room“That’s not generally the case, mostly you get a good feeling about the place because of the items you find in them – kids’ toys, religious pictures, birthday cards. It’s that connection I like.”Michael’s photos are largely focused on derelict properties in NI but he has also ventured into the Republic of Ireland: “Banbridge is a good location to have as a base. I can be in the south in  minutes, quicker than to get to Belfast.“For me it’s trying to find places that haven’t been documented. Everybody’s done Cairndhuand because of its popularity it has been subject to vandalism. Nevertheless it’s a fascinating place. It doesn’t matter what people do to it.” Michael, who has three children, said: “My daughter would come out with me from time to time for a wee spin. We’d trek up country roads to seewe can find any or maybe I’ll have some place marked to check out. “I’ll maybe read around online about an area to seethere’s any stories relating to old mills, old schools. You can look at satellite images before you go. We’ll maybe have eight or  places marked.“These places that I’m going into, people don’t even know they’re out there. There’s hundreds of them. I mark them on my Google Maps – there’s five or six hundred on there to explore.”Michael said he has a bank of photos stored on his phone that he hasn’t shared yet: “If I didn’t go out for another three months I’d have enough to keep posting. “Looking back at some of my older photos, they aren’t great. I think I’ve got better. “In July or August I had , likes on the page, by December it had doubled, now I’m pushing towards ,. “It’s amazing because I’m not doing anything with it, I’m just publishing photos with a small bit of a story, I’m not promoting it or trying to make money from it.”Michael is quick to point out that he is not the first person to find beauty in the Province’s derelict properties. He said Abandonned NI set the benchmark for this sort of photography.Michael said his obsession was a year-round one: “I’ll be out in winter as well as summer. In winter it’s good because the foilage dies back and you’re able to see things that would previously have been hidden. I remember once crawling through a hole and the hedge to find this property that you’d never know was there.” Asked what led him to begin searching for old houses Michael said: “It was my son who got me started, it must have been about three or four years ago. “He showed me this video on YouTube of a guy in America who was exploring this derelict mansion that used to belong to a drug dealer. “It looked fantastic, all the broken windows and doors hanging off and the stuff that was left inside. “My son said we should try to find something like that here. I said, ‘you’re not going to get something on that scale but we’ll have a look’. “What we did was we went to Cairndhu which is near Larne. It’s pretty much where everybody that does this starts. It’s so well known, it’s such a tragic story of how it fell into such disrepair. It’s so vast. As soon as I got in I was hooked.”Cairndhu which was built around  is the former home of Sir Thomas Dixon. It became a convalescent home before it was closed in .Michael said: “There are people on social media who tell me about a derelict house near to them, sometimes it can be just a shell. For me that’s not that interesting. “What I find interesting is somewhere that has personal possessions still inside. It could be furniture, it could be letters, there’s houses you go into and you’d think people had just walked out and left everything still in it.Michael said his passion was driven more by what people had left behind inside the properties rather than the buildings themselves.He commented: “Some people would look at a man in his forties out exploring the country like this as stupid, but for me it’s just that sense of adventure. “It’s good to be out and about. It’s a healthy interest and no one is harmed.“It’s like how you feel when you’re a kid when you go out exploring. “I’m not sure I was even this adventurous as a kid. Maybe I’m making up for it now.“It’s that excitement of the unknown, that danger of not knowing what you’re going to find. That’s why I do it. “It’s those wee unassuming houses that look like nothing and you go in and they’re just filled with stuff. You find out all about the owners, the le that they led.”Discussing some of the remnants of the past he has uncovered, Michael said: “You see so many of the old Singer sewing machines.“There was one house where I found the shell of a Mk II Jag. I found an old ambulance as well.“For me the best finds are the wee personal things like a Valentine’s card or a kid’s note that says ‘mummy has been mean to me and daddy’ – you’re hoping that was just a wee fleeting moment.”He continued: “I try to capture those items as they sit to tell the story of the house. “I take the photos on my phone, maybe I’ll upgrade to a fancy camera someday though photographers will tell you it doesn’t matter what you use, it’s your eye for a photo.“People say to me they can imagine a story around my posts. In my wee blurb I’ll not give the location away unless it’s a well known building. I’ll just describe it a wee bit as best I can and let the pictures tell the story.”Offering suggestions as to why houses end up derelict yet full of possessions, he said: “A lot of the time you’ll get an elderly person who will pass away, they may have nobody to leave it to or they may leave it to the family and they can’t agree what to do with it so it just sits.“Sometimes you get people who buy the property for the adjoining land but don’t knock down the original property.”Some of the items left behindThe scene in an abandonned kitchenBoots no longer made for walkingThis cupboard remains well stockedAn Evening Prayer"},{"url":null,"title":"new ulster hockey kirk cup sponsorship deal to help raise funds for ni children s hospice","story":"Ahead of the final, NI Law Firm of the Year, Millar McCall Wylie, has announced a sponsorship deal with Ulster Hockey to back the competition through to the end of .Chief Operating Officer, Christopher McCandless said: ldquoWe are thrilled to be sponsoring the Kirk Cup, both this season and next.

I want to be in a position to make robust decisions on key issues and I hope Casement will be one of those.”Another key decision for Minister Mallon will be on the York Street Interchange, which was specied as a commitment for the Executive in the New Deal, New Approach document.“There was a procurement process that was challenged. We now have to commence that procurement process again,” she explained.“It certainly is an issue that needs to be addressed. Anyone who travels in that part of the city will know it is hugely congested when it comes to traffic. It is also bad for emissions and the climate which is one of my priorities.“I want to try and progress that but also balance it around connecting people and doing what we can to tackle the climate emergency.“The project is stated as commitment for the Executive but it also features in the New Deal New Approach and I very much welcome that commitment is in there.“Infrastructure is central to the new document and it recogniseswe are serious about transforming lives and ensuring people have real opportunities in areas were people are really struggling then we need to be investing in infrastructure.”As for a possible Glider extending to link South and North Belfast, Nichola saidone of her priorities is “about increasing public transport and people’s access to it”.“I have asked officials for an urgent briefing to see where that is but encouraging people to use public transport and encourage people to walk and cycle are priorities for me.”After three years of no Stormont Executive, Nichola said she is under no illusions to the challenges facing her around Infrastructure, including a huge backlog of work to tackle street lighting, potholes and climate change.“The financial situation that I have inherited is extremely challenging. If you look from , there have been systemic signicant budget cuts to the department.“One of the areas which has been affected has been street lighting and it is something I am very aware of. It is on people’s front doors and gives people a sense of safety and confidence.“If we want to make a dference to people’s lives, we need to address issues like street lighting and pot holes.“I would be hopeful of working with Minister Conor Murphy in the Department for Finance to secure more money to address some of these issues.“Pot holes is a big issue across the North and mainly due to budget cuts to the department. I want to try and address it.“I think we could be doing so much more in Belfast, especially around cycling. We need to encourage and facilitate parents who want to be able to walk their children to school. It will involve safety mechanisms but it is something I want to have a big conversation about with not only my officials but people as well. It is beneficial for the climate but also for people’s physical and mental health.”Asked about many people’s negative attitudes at -hour bus lanes in the city, the Minister stressed she is keeping an open mind but called for better conversations around such controversial issues.“It is about a balancing act. It is about encouraging people to use public transport but in a way to promote local businesses as well.“I have an open-door policy here and I want to engage with everyone. When we all put our heads together, that is when you get to a better place for policies and decision-making.”As for rumours of potential water charges being introduced for residents, she was quick to spell out her position.“The SDLP is opposed to water charges and I have been very quick to say that it won’t be the case under my watch.“I also welcome the fact both the First and Deputy First Minister have come out as well to say it also. I view my role as important in helping struggling families and not to add to their burden.”On a personal level, Nichola is “excited” about her role over the next two years but stressed she will not forget about her local constituents in North Belfast who elected her to Stormont in the first place.“It’s very exciting. It is a very big department. I think a lot of people think it’s just about roads but in actual fact, the department impacts on everyone’s daily lives.“Infrastructure covers things like whether houses can be built or not which is important because we have a housing crisis and other things like waste and water.“When you turn on your water tap, how you travel to and from school and work, MOT to ensure your vehicle is safe, road gritting in winter – all fall within the Department for Infrastructure.“I haven’t forgotten I am here only because the people of North Belfast elected me. I am keen while I take up this role I don’t lose sight of that and continue to be focused also on my constituency and the service I provide.“I will still be a familiar face around North Belfast. The reason that I got into politics is to serve people who put their faith in me.“I won’t lose sight of that and I am very clear that I want to be in the constituency and welcome people to still come to me with their problems and their issues because my job is to try and help them.“I am a parent too and for all parents, it is important to balance your work and your le. I am very lucky I have a supportive family. I look forward to family time and spending time with my children is important but I will do my absolute best in this role.”As for her hopes for her two-year tenure at the helm of Infrastructure, Nichola concluded: “I really want to make the most of these two years. I understand I am coming into a position where we haven’t taken decisions for three years so there is a backlog.“There are huge financial restraints but I really want to make an impact. At the end, I want to look back and ask what did I do to improve people’s lives, better connect people, have a thriving and balanced economy and an improved climate.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"janines wedding day is captured on camera","story":"WELL-known local woman Janine Howard will feature in tonight#s edition of the popular BBCNI documentary series, True North.‘Saving Face’ follows the story of -year-old Janine and her preparations for her marriage to fiancé Matthew Light in October.Janine was just two years old when she was diagnosed with leukaemia.

He has alerted the relevant authorities. The site is just yards from the St Gall’s GAC clubrooms. Belfast City Council waste bags, household fridges, cemetery headstones, construction rubble, wood and huge amounts of other waste have een dumped on to the land and the massive mound is sliding close to the Ballymurphy Stream.The land is known as Milltown Glen and is situated between Maguire’s Garage, Milltown Cemetery and the Bog Meadows.Michael Culbert of St Gall’s GAC said that the issue of land ownership needs to be claried. “There is a gateway that runs from Milltown Cemetery, a lane, and it’s that land that is being dumped on,” he said. “We want a clean environment, we care about the environment. We have all age groups at St Gall’s, from six-year-olds up and have been in this area for approximately  years. We have never seen the like of this. This is a beautul glen, you have the Bog Meadows and here it’s the epitome of fly tipping. This is going on in the heart of West Belfast and it’s not on. We need someone with responsibility to hold whoever is doing this to account for the contamination of this area. We don’t want the river polluted.“It needs to stop and it needs to be cleared up and now our local councillor Steven Corr has taken up this issue.”Ulster Wildle Nature Reserve Officer Deborah McLaughlin told the Andersonstown News that the dumping has got worse since the start of the New Year.“This is an absolute eyesore and I have contact DAERAin relation to it as a lot of the rubbish will end up in the stream,” she said. “We are concerned at the level of fly tipping going on and concerned for health and safety. DAERA are aware of the issue and at the minute we are waiting to hear back from them.”Local Sinn Féin Councillor Steven Corr said the illegal dumping is “destroying the landscape”.“What we are seeing is a localised environmental nightmare,” he went on. “We are only a few feet away from this stream being contaminated. I can’t get my head around why somebody thinks it’s ok to do this. There are lorry loads of rubbish being dumped down a riverbank, killing wildle as it goes. I’ve never seen anything like this, on this scale, in West Belfast. This is fly tipping on an industrial scale, there is industrial waste on the site, glass, headstones. There is confusion as to who is responsible for the land but we would be calling on the Rivers Agency and the NIEAto work with us. Belfast City Council have offered support as their bags are also being dumped on the site. This land needs to be secured as a matter of urgency.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"mclaughlin pays tribute to reds second half hunger","story":"CLIFTONVILLE boss Paddy McLaughlin paid tribute to his side’s second-half effort in their dramatic injury-time County Antrim Shield comeback win against Ballymena. The Reds battled back from Leroy Millar’s early opener in the second half to stage a smash-and-grab - win and McLaughlin felt his side emptied everything into their search for a route back into the game. “I’m delighted,” reflected McLaughlin. “You saw how much effort that players put into the second half and you’ve got to give Ballymena credit – they were good on the break, got their lead with a soft goal we gave away and they defended their lead really well. But you saw how much our boys put into the second half, they emptied their heart on to the pitch and gave us everything.“To get the equaliser, we were happy with that and to go into extra time because I thought the momentum was with us. But to go and win it a minute later was an incredible finish to the game. It’s a sore one for Ballymenayou’re a Ballymena fan or player tonight. I’m sure they’re going back absolutely devastated at losing the game in the th minute. Unfortunately someone had to lose and you don’t want to see young players going off with their heads down but you can’t take it away from our boys. They gave it everything and they probably slightly deserved it in the end.” McLaughlin refused to take any credit for substitutes Thomas Maguire and Ryan Curran popping up with the late goals, but he praised the duo for putting their personal disappointment to one side for the good of the team. “The players on the pitch did the business,” he added. “The players on the pitch worked Ballymena really hard, they tried their best to work opportunities, Ballymena defended brilliantly well, you can’t deny them that, but when the seven minutes went up we looked like we had a goal in us. I was just hoping it wasn’t going to be one of those days where it would be a sad story – could we have done this and should we have done that “I felt we would get one chance in that seven minutes and take it to extra time, I felt we were finishing the game the stronger. For Thomas [Maguire] and Ryan [Curran] to pop up, fair play to them because I’m sure they were disappointed not to be starting the game. They put their own personal disappointment to one side to go and do a job for the team.”Such was the intensity of that seven minutes of madness, McLaughlin was unable to remember his feelings during the late drama but acknowledged the backing of the Red Army and paid tribute to their “incredible” support. “I pulled two hamstrings running on to the pitch celebrating and anything after that, I don’t know what happened,” admits McLaughlin. “Your emotions take over you because you can see what it means to the players and what it means to the supporters. You can’t go through any interview and not talk about the supporters tonight. “That was incredible support that Cltonville brought tonight in the County Antrim Shield on a Tuesday night. I think there is only one team in the ision that has that support and it’s Cltonville. You saw what it meant to the players and supporters from the goals went in. My mind went blank straight away and only now am I settling down.”Tuesday’s victory ends a four-year wait for silverware and McLaughlin hopes it will give his players a taste for future success. “Sometimes the first trophy is the hardest one to get. “I didn’t come here to make up the numbers, I came here to try and establish Cltonville back as a contender for the ision and as a team who should be challenging to win trophies. “If I didn’t see that potential in them, I wouldn’t have come up,” said the Derry man. “When I see the quality within the playing squad and the support they get when things are going well, when I see how hard they work, I know they’ve got potential to win trophies. All that hard work’s been justied tonight. “It’s one trophy but we’re not going to rest on that, we want more. It’s such a young squad and for a lot of them it’s their first senior medals. Hopefully now they’ll get that appetite for success and to challenge for trophies even more and you never know where this team might go.” "},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"register now for the craic 10k st","story":"BELFAST’S First Citizen was onhand to officially launch the annual SPAR Craic K.Set to kick-start St Patrick’s Day celebrations on March , thousands of runners are set to take part in the urban run which is celebrating its sixth year.Lord Mayor Danny Baker told the Andersonstown News that he will counting down the race as runners go through their paces.“I will be starting the race and as much as I would love to take part I have a sore knee at the minute and that’s my excuse,” he laughed. “This is a huge event for the city and I’m delighted that a portion of the funds raised will go towards Marie Curie cancer charity.

was “oven-ready” and just needed the money to finance it.“We are estimating in terms of pay roughly about £ million maybe needed to cover all those aspects in terms of pay – not just the settlementbutwe’re looking at potentially what could be settlements for   and   and for the non-teaching side of it,” he said.Mr Weir said around £ million was needed to improve special needs provision.On the issues many schools were facing to cover their day to day budgets, the minister said: “To essentially get it to the point where the head is above water, ideally we need at least £ or £ million on that side of things.”The deal that restored powersharing includes a commitment to develop a childcare strategy.Mr Weir saidthe executive moved to a model that would see the provision of  free hours of childcare a week, it could cost between £ million to £ million a year.He said the Executive wanted to move quickly on the issue of childcare but cautioned that a new system would not be ready in the forthcoming financial year.The minister said he was committed to implementing reforms within his department that could deliver cost-savings.But he warned that reforms alone could not plug the funding hole.“You can do all the reforms in the world and it will not come anywhere close to filling that level of gap,” he said."},{"url":null,"title":"experts call on assembly to pass ban on smacking","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthsundayleEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

What do those names mean to you minister ”Mr Murphy said the RHI episode was a “crisis” and in crisis situations all parties pull in a range of party figures to help co-ordinate the response.“That involves people who manage,” he said. “Now some people may draft in other people who are elected representatives, most parties have chief executives, they have people on their executive committees who aren’t elected representatives and you involve people who can manage negotiations as we have managed negotiations since the early s.”He added: “A party management team manages in the middle of a crisis and all of the inidual members of that team try to co-ordinate their activities.“That’s how we do business andthere was a crisis here tomorrow morning I don’t doubt we would draft in a team to try to manage our response to it, which would involve a range of people including elected and non-elected representatives.”\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  TUV leader Jim Allister claimed the appointment process for special advisers had been ‘watered down’ During his appearance before the committee Mr Murphy revealed that the Assembly budget would be struck before the Chancellor announced his budget on March .He said any additional money flowing to Northern Ireland as a result of Sajid Javid’s budget would then be factored into Stormont’s spending plans.The Finance Minister also reiterated his claim that the UK Government had failed to honour undertakings to finance the New Decade, New Approach powersharing deal.He said only £ million of the £ billion package announced by the Government was new money.He said £ billion was already pledged to the region as part of UK-wide spending commitments and £ million was previously contained in the  confidence and supply deal between the Conservatives and DUP.Mr Murphy said the £ million, which will be spread over five years, was well below what had been discussed during the negotiations ahead of the deal being published.“Those commitments that were given in that document weren’t a Santa Claus wish list,” he said.“They were carefully worked out through a series of discussions between all of the parties, senior officials from the department of finance, the head of the civil service hereand senior officials from the Northern Ireland Office.”Mr Murphy said his officials were continuing to engage with Treasury officials with the aim of securing more funds.The minister expressed frustration that the executive had to hand back £ million to the Treasury ahead of the next financial year at the same time as they were asked for more funding.But he pointed out that the £ million of unused Financial Transactions Capital could not have been erted to the powersharing deal.He said the FTC money could only be accessed in very specic circumstances – namely in the form of a loan to, or equity investment in, a capital project delivered by a private sector organisation.Mr Sterling, who appeared before the Executive Office Committee on Wednesday, was asked whether he expected the Government to provide more money.“You will know the Finance Minister had meetings in London last week, I think he was quite positive about how they went,” he told the committee.“It’s a matter of record that the Department of Finance is doing further work to identy the cost of the ious commitments, the challenges that are facing us and to go back to Treasury with a strong case for additional resources. I wouldn’t want to make a judgment on the likelihood of that leading to signicantly more money but I hope it will.”At the finance committee, TUV leader Jim Allister claimed a revised code for special advisers had “watered down” the appointment process by removing an obligation on ministers to canvas a pool of candidates and outline the reasoning for their choice.“Do you think that’s meeting the expectations of the public in terms of transparency ” he said.Mr Murphy said the priority was strengthening the code in respect of how special advisers operated when in post, not how they are appointed.“The question is are we more concerned with how they get there or what they do when they are there,” said the minister."},{"url":null,"title":"northern ireland traffic alerts latest updates","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthsundayleEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

They continue to surprise me.”The tunnel exposes limitations of President Donald Trump’s border wall, which stretches several feet underground in the area and is considered effective against small, crudely built tunnels often called “gopher holes”.The tunnel announced on Wednesday was found about  feet underground, well below the wall.Following the tunnel’s discovery in August, Mexican law enforcement identied the entrance and US investigators mapped the tunnel, which extends a total of , feet. The next longest tunnel in the US, discovered in San Diego in , was , feet long.The newly discovered tunnel is about five-and-a-half feet tall, two feet wide, and runs at an average depth of  feet below the surface, officials said.Agents discovered several hundred sandbags blocking a suspected former exit of the tunnel in a San Diego industrial warehouse area.The tunnel went under several warehouses in the district, where sophisticated tunnels have often ended, and extended into open fields.LeNoir, a veteran on the multiagency task force of tunnel investigators known as “tunnel rats”, said he made his way through about  feet of sandbags blocking the tunnel but could not go any further.An incomplete offshoot of the tunnel that extended , feet suggested to authorities that smugglers had plugged an initial exit point and were building another.The suspected previous exit “became unsustainable for whatever reason, so they built a spur,” Border Patrol spokesman Jeff Stephenson said.By federal law, US authorities must fill the American side of tunnels with concrete after they are discovered."},{"url":null,"title":"511843","story":"After receiving their transfer tests today, hundreds of young people and their parents will be making the decision as to which school they want to go to.To help them, Derry Now has collated information on all the grammar schools in County Derry.The information includes how many applications the schools received last year, how many applications were approved and the scores or grades the schools used to admit pupils.

The Western Trust has revealed that its final business case will be handed over to the Department of Healthfor approval in February. Last February, the Trust entered an “initial” twelve-month agreement with site owner the Department for Communitiesto enable the Trust to further develop the proposal of locating a new Cityside Health and Care Centre at Fort George. During that time no further marketing of Fort George took place. The DfC has however said that once it receives the complete business case it will consider the best way to “maximise” the site’s potential. googletag.cmd.push A Western Trust spokesperson commented: “The Western Health and Social Care Trust can confirm that as part of the business case development process for the provision of a major city side health and care centre, it has been engaged in the identication of a site suitable for the purposes of bringing together GP and associated healthcare services in an integrated model. “Fort George is likely to be the recommended site deemed suitable for future service provision within the city. “The Trust and Department for Communities have entered into a joint Memorandum of Understanding allowing the Trust to progress the completion of the business case and to secure the necessary Departmental approvals. googletag.cmd.push  The development of a Cityside hub is anticipated to bring up to  whole time equivalent permanent jobs, new and relocated, which will deliver mostly nursing, social work, allied health professional and administrative roles. It would enable both Trust and GP Medical Practices to work together to further expand and enhance local health and social care services currently spread across the city. If delivered, the hub is expected to support people in improving their health and well-being, particularly around the areas of physical activity, nutrition, smoking cessation, alcohol misuse and mental health. Once established, it would optimise the potential of communities to become more active in improving their own health and well-being. ‘No timescale’ At a Derry City  Strabane District Council meeting in November , a new project was put on the table for a poundm - poundm multi-purpose development at the Fort George site. This would comprise of a “world-class” Maritime and Emigration Museum, -star hotel, public realm development, office space incorporating a technology and research  development hub, plus two residential blocks with car parking at the former army base. Speaking at that meeting, well-known Derry businessman, Garvan O’Doherty said projects brought forward by the city lacked ambition and with central government support the museum could be the fourth major tourism pillar in Northern Ireland alongside Titanic Belfast, The Giants Causeway and the Wild Atlantic Way. He felt the health hub could be located at a dferent site, adding, it is imperative to look after both the economy and people of the city. A Department for Communities spokesperson explained that it is awaiting the Western Trust’s final business case before considering the best way forward for the site but could not put a timescale on that process. He said: “The Department is awaiting receipt of the final Business Case from the Western Health and Social Care Trust but officials have been regularly engaging with the Trust and signicant progress has been made. “Once the final Business Case has been received, consideration will have to be given to the optimum way to develop Fort George.

They faded and after a briefthey disappeared again. But now they are back, building from the foundations up. Club PRO Paddy McCann spoke to Michael McMullan, to trace their steps back into the world of club hurling. As a new decade turned earlier this month, Slaughtneil took the aristocrats of club hurling – Ballyhale Shamrocks – to the pin of their collar. Following the dramatic conclusion to an equally epic encounter, the Emmets narrowly missed out on qualication for Sundays All-Ireland final. But it was the subplot that struck an equally loud chord across Ulster. googletag.cmd.push After the game, Ballyhales players and their iconic manager Henry Shefflin were swamped by fans in search of autographs and selfies. A genuine outpouring of passion mixed with adoration. The glee etched across youngsters faces spoke volumes. In the recent past, its, perhaps, the biggest sign that the pockets of hurling across Ulster are alive and well. Bursting to get out. Witnessing it first hand was inspiring. Last November , another Kilkenny icon was in Ulster. It was a dferent brief entirely. Martin Fogarty coached many of the hurlings greatest. But in his role as hurlings National Development Manager, he was up in Drummullan to present medals to the underage players of St Finbarrs hurling club. googletag.cmd.push Two years after theirfrom the hurling wilderness, the clubs U team won the Ulster shield. They now unveil their plans for registration evenings later this month, giving Irelands national game another opportunity to spread its wings. And in the north of the county, Claudy are putting their roots down in search of another success story. For St Finbarrs, they have a heritage. In the late s hurling was played in the Loup area before the club was formed around the turn of the s. Of the three county finals they competed in the took the title in  and . They had quality players in brothers Liam and Colm Hinphey. John James McPeake, Sean and Francie Smith, M and Brian Mitchell. Patsy Donnelly. Joe McKee. S McGrogan. Henry McGlone. They also had Cork man Pat Russell in their ranks, who hailed from a club of the same name on Leeside. After the initial burst, St Finbarrs disappeared. It reformed later for a short time in the early eighties but ran out of steam before the newest dawn, when the wheels were set in motion for the club as it currently exists. Kilkenny man Brian Waldron, from Freshford, married Sheila Devlin and in recent years they settled in her native Loup. Their sons Odraacuten, Cian and Naoise hurled with Cuala and won Nicky Rackard Cup medals with Derry two years ago.   In Meadowbank, before we stopped before Christmas, we had two of the big pitches filled and two of the small pitches at the back. Paddy McCann  Brian, now the St Finbarrs Chairman, has hurling in his blood. He was involved with Kilkenny minors in the early noughties and, since histo Derry, has been coaching in seven of the local schools in the Loup area...spreading the gospel. The interest morphed into an informal meeting in January , that included Derrys Regional Hurling Development Officer Kevin Hinphey and Dunloy native Seamus Kane, who now resides in Loup. Kevins father Liam was part of the  St Finbarrs winning team. “Brian went around the local schools coaching and developed an appetite for hurling,” recalls St Finbarrs PRO Paddy McCann, one of the six at that initial meeting. “There was a group of us there at the start. Niall Lagan was there as well, his father also played on the  St Finbarrs team.” And so it began. Following Ogra Colmcilles withdrawal from the Derry junior league, they reached out to St Finbarrs, offering their premises base to help them build an identity. They are indebted to Ogra and to St Patricks PS Loup, where they host meetings. “The first night at Drummullan, it was like the build it and they will come sort of idea,” explains McCann of the new dawn in May . “We didnt really know who was going to turn up and when they called itthere was the guts of  youngsters...it was fantastic.” Now the club has over  members with  playing junior members. The players come from a iety of parishes in the South Derry and Loughshore area. The formation of the club has ensured access to hurling for all children in the area. It began with Us and earlier this month that cohort, mainly still Us, fielded the clubs first U team. “We would be expecting to field at U, U and at the younger ages. In Meadowbank, before we stopped before Christmas, we had two of the big pitches filled and two of the small pitches at the back,” McCann adds. “That would have been from Us, Us, Us, Us and down to Us.” Their growth has been helped by Brian Waldrons brainchild, the St Finbarrs Cup. A tournament played between the schools within their catchment area. Some field two teams, with eight or nine players in each. Its all about participation. “It is part of Brians work going around the schools, he organises it in Meadowbank and all the schools he was at would come in and play,” McCann explains. “It feeds into all the schools and for anyone showing promise and an interest, we can get them to play for St Finbarrs.” The Us and Us have had the privilege of playing at Croke Park in Go Games for the last two years. The youngsters are competing well and are going from strength to strength. The club achieved their first on field victory in October , when they won the Ulster U Regional Shield played against very competitive Letterkenny and Slaughtneil sides at Dungivens Kevin Lynch Park. At the presentation night, Martin Fogarty offered advice to carry on into this season, as they strive to grow. He emphasised the pride the club should take in passing on skills to the children and promoting hurling in the area. They had a blueprint for others to tap in to. “He spoke well about the club and he said he had heard about us,” McCann recalls of Fogartys address on the night. “Other clubs he goes to, that are struggling for numbers with one or two people doing the work and getting burned out, he was using us an example for other clubs.” Already this year, St Finbarr’s has made further strides with entry in the U North West indoor league. They have also entered teams into the U U Tain Oacuteg regional leagues run by Croke Park, as well as U league and Feacuteile. In their recent historic debut at U level, they gave a good account of themselves in a blitz that included Tyrone clubs Naomh Colmcille, Fintona, Belnaleck of Fermanagh and Dungloe. All with a  back-boned by Us. In any club, the people are the real assets. St Finbarrs are no dferent. Kevin Hinphey and Colm Dillon helped steer the coaching in the early days. The club described the input as immense but now the aim is to become self-sufficient. “Seamusand Brianare great for bringing people in. At our AGM, there were people volunteering that never played hurling to get doing coaching courses in it. “There is a lot of good will and parents are really buying into it. Some of the people are not really from GAA backgrounds.” It ensures that the future looks bright and their door is open to all new coaches and players, of all abilities. Everyone is welcome and there is always something to aspire to. Two years ago, three of the clubs U players represented Derry at half-time in their game with Down in the Christy Ring Cup. “They are holding their own. You would know they have started a few years later than other clubs but their skill levels are coming up,” McCann explains of how their oldest underage stars have progressed.   Other clubs he goes to, that are struggling for numbers with one or two people doing the work and getting burned out, he was using us an example. Paddy McCann  “There are a couple of guys and their skill levels are right up there with what other clubs have. We just dont have enough yet to be competing across the team but I can see them moving right up.” A club with championship tradition dating back to the s is back on the map. With continued efforts and promotion, maintaining their drive towards U and adult hurling is a target. As well as getting players through to Derrys Celtic Challenge team...and further. It would signy payback on a bigger scale and a chance for their club to grow further. For now, the Gaels in this corner of the county will continue to raise the bar. St Finbarrs registration for the  season takes place in Meadowbank on Tuesday, January  and Tuesday, February  at ..

He was always destined for success. His mother Catriona is an Ulster and All-Ireland champions camogie player, before moving into coaching where titles also streamed in her direction. Garys father Ronnie and grandfather George are steeped in motorbikes. On a dferent tangent, his sister Lara is both a champion gymnast and trampolinist. Sport simply runs in the family. For the  year-old St Patricks Maghera pupil, he has excelled in the world of motorsport despite only going into his third season in the saddle. Gary has competed on the Irish minibike circuit since its inception in , finishing second in the junior class, before graduating to the senior ranks last season. googletag.cmd.push In recent weeks, he was awarded the prestigious David Wood scholarship which the Motorcycle Union of Ireland awards to its most promising rider. It was won for the first time in  by Lee Johnston, winner of the last seasons Junior Isle of Man TT winner. He also took on the role of IMC Youth Ambassador – to act as a role-model for our younger members. “During this time Gary has shown maturity beyond his years, building up a great rapport with our Junior Members and his peers,” commented IMC Chairman Mark Boyd. “In addition to his abilities as a competitor, his positive attitude in success or defeat coupled with the clear commitment shown by both Gary and his family to his budding racing career bode well for his future. googletag.cmd.push “As Chairman of The Irish Minibike Championship I am privileged to recommend Gary for inclusion in the  BTC and wish him every success with the selection process.” His mothers reluctance stalled Garys career until just before his th birthday but she is now fully behind him since his early short circuit days. In , he progressed to the IMC Senior Open and Ulster Superbike Moto Championship. “Last year he was doing pit bikes with young kids but this year he went on to the short circuits and he was racing against adults, when he won the Moto championship,” Catriona said. “Now he is hoping to go to the British Superbikes on a Moto as well.” “As a rookie in the USBK Moto Championship, against some very experienced and older riders I came away with the title USBK Moto Champion ,” Gary outlined in his CV, which has been compiled with the view to attracting sponsorship for this season and a shot at the Moto class. The costings for next season could amount to over poundk, including a pound, Honda NSFR bike, entry fees and travel. “At the end of next year my aim is to make a wildcard into the Spanish Championship with my future dream to ride in the World Championships,” Gary added. He grew up watching and supporting both his father and grandfather in action on both the circuits and roads. It was no surprise to see him emerge from their shadows. His family helped him raise the funds for a trip to Donnington to compete in a round of the British Superbikes to help gather invaluable experience and a taste of what  could bring. MCUI Trainer and respected journalist and photographer Baylon McCaughey was full of praise for Gary. “Despite the cold and wet weather Gary, despite having only one season of tarmac racing under his belt in Pit Bike Racing, showed great enthusiasm and certainly was not afraid to ask questions,” he said. “After each session, he would enquire,he was doing the correct thing or not, and listened to advice given. “With plans to compete in the British Championships, I know this lad has the correct approach to his racing, his manners off the track, and competitiveness on the track, will certainly help him to achieve his goals.” Talent, with an attitude to match. Perhaps the greatest combination. If the next two years follow his meteoric rise since , Gary Scott is destined for greatness. Remember the name.

This Friday, January  , there will be the Festival of Light Illuminations at the Tower Museum. Images of local heroines who span history from the s to the present day, such as Bronagh Gallagher, Pat Hume, Annie Russell Maunder and Amelia Earhart, will be projected on to the tower of the museum in a celebration of their work.There will then be an action-packed day on Saturday, February , starting in the Tower Museum at am with a coffee morning at which former factory workers can gather and re-create old photos, while at pm there will be a Factory Workers’ Lunch where invited guests, alongside Mayor Michaela Boyle, will share memories with old friends over a light lunch.Following that, at pm ex-shirt factory workers will gather together to share music, memories and craic of the good old days during the Factory Girls’ Herstory-telling event. Roy Arbuckle will lead the group in reminiscence and invited guests will have an opportunity to share their own stories of their time in the shirt factories.Meanwhile, at pm in the Guildhall the Girl Power Event will aim to inspire all. This workshop is open to girlsof all ages, but might be enjoyed mostly by pre-teens. The workshop will focus on positivity, respect and resilience in an informal setting, where girls will learn, create and have lots of fun.Activities include writing a love note to yourself, creating your own or framing your favourite empowering quote, a photo booth, workshops and goody bags. There will be lots of Girl Power tunes and games, and of course you will hear from some real le powerful girls!Mayor Michaela Boyle explained why it was so important for the council to take part.“This is a wonderful project and one that I am honoured to be a part of.“Women like Amelia Earhart and Pat Hume have played a role in shaping our district into what we have today, so it will be magnicent to see them projected on our Tower Museum for citizens to take a moment to step back and appreciate them.“Just before Christmas I hosted an event in celebration of our Factory Girls, and I’m really looking forward to meeting back up with them to hear more of their stories and fond memories.“Just as important as celebrating the role of the important women of our history is to inspire our youngsters and show them how they can positively affect the future, and taking part in Herstory will allow us to do that.”Ruth McPhillips, council events officer, said it was a weekend to look forward to.“Herstory   is a fantastic project and one that we as a Council were delighted to get involved in,” she said.“Derry and Strabane has been truly blessed with so many incredible women who have both made and changed history, and to whom we owe so much – none more so than our fantastic Factory Girls.“The Festival of Light will also be something special as we, quite literally, illuminate the achievements of many of our prolic local women from all walks of le.”Ruth continued: “There is also a chance to inspire the next generation of girls coming through with our Girl Power event.“We would encourage everyone to get involved and to take this opportunity to thank and celebrate those magnicent women who have played a vital role in getting us where we are today.“This is a project that will hopefully have a lasting legacy for years and generations to come.”Pre-registration is necessary for the Factory Workers’ events. Spaces are limited to - for the coffee morning.

Following the meeting with representatives the utility said the main towns of Cookstown, Dungannon and Magherafelt have been identied as a focus for population and economic growth to promote sustainable development and to support the efficient use of public services, facilities and infrastructure.But NI Water has warned that it can only spend within its annual public expenditure budget and plans for water and wastewater can only happenthey are funded.Steve Blockwell, Head of Investment at NI Water said:“Since the presentation was given to Mid Ulster Council, I would like to welcome the New Decade, New Approach Deal and the Executive’s commitment to invest urgently in wastewater infrastructure which is at or nearing capacity in many places across Northern Ireland, including Belfast. “Providing safe, clean, drinking water supplied to houses and business is always the top priority for NI Water. While we have been able to maintain safe clean drinking water, the huge constraints on our capital budget has meant that Wastewater issues have largely been left unaddressed as highlighted in our PC Business Plan our PC business planning process has identied ninety-nine areas where new housing and businesses may be unable to get connected to our sewerage system throughout the province.”“The funding made available in PCby NI Government to date for water and wastewater infrastructure is not keeping pace with what Northern Ireland needs.“Signicant investment is needed for wastewater and water infrastructure. NI Water knows Northern Ireland’s growth ambitions, we know what needs done and we have the plan and the skills to deliver it. However,funding continues at current levels there will be signicant constraints on economic growth, damage to the environment and risk to people’s health.” googletag.cmd.pushIf you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Donegal County Council closed off the road to Lisfannon beach after signicant damage was caused due to the effects of Storm Brendan and ongoing erosion.Councillor Jack Murray said: “Unfortunately the road at Lisfannon Beach has endured signicant flood damage in recent days. “The council has responded and fenced off the immediate area for safety reasons. “Further to that, I have asked that it is cleaned up and repaired as soon as possible. There is some dficulty however in completing lasting repairs to the road as flood damage is a recurring problem with the location being very exposed to the elements. “The council will however liaise with all relevant statutory agencies with the aim of developing a lasting solution to this problem.“This is hugely important for the local community as Lisfannon Beach is an extremely popular tourist amenity and is much loved by local and visitors alike. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Speaking ahead of next week’s Apprenticeship Week at the North West Regional College , Brendan Duddy said he chose an apprenticeship, knowing he would be guaranteed employment, during, and at the end of course. Brendan, , from Bishop Street, enrolled for an apprenticeship at NWRC after he completed his A-Levels at St Joseph’s Boys School.He explained: “I knew % that I wanted to get a trade. At University I could spend years of my le studying to work in an oversubscribed area, so when I saw the apprenticeship opportunity with NWRC and Errigal Contracts, I knew it was for me.”The joint enterprise between NWRC and Errigal was launched in , offering two-year apprenticeship opportunities in a number of skills areas. During the two-year programme, students are given the skills in college to achieve a City and Guilds Award work with top professionals on jobs across the UK and Ireland, all while earning top apprenticeships wages.Brendan, who won the gold medal in dry-lining at the Live UK Worlds Skills Finals in Birmingham and will now go on to represent the UK at the  world finals in Shanghai, said his apprenticeship had given him the opportunity to work all around the UK, in Manchester, Liverpool, and Belfast, learning his trade.He’s now looking forward to the Skills Olympics next year when he’ll go head-to-head with the world’s best. The competition in Birmingham was tough,” he said. “As you work you are aware of the thousands of people who are looking at you. “When I won gold I was shocked and I’m delighted to now be going on to compete in Shanghai.“I’ve really enjoyed the opportunities that studying with NWRC and working with Errigal has given me and I’d encourage more young people my age to give it a go. I’m now working full time with Errigal and it’s been great.”From, - February, a series of events are being held across the Derry City and Strabane District Council area promoting the opportunities available for apprentices locally.North West Regional College will host two events to celebrate Apprenticeship Week.The Construction Futures event will be held at the Student Zone at Strand Road campus on Tuesday, February  from - p.m. An information evening on Higher Level Apprenticeships , will be held at the Strand Road campus the following nightat .pm.

Speaking ahead of next week’s Apprenticeship Week at the North West Regional College , Brendan Duddy said he chose an apprenticeship, knowing he would be guaranteed employment, during, and at the end of course. Brendan, , from Bishop Street, enrolled for an apprenticeship at NWRC after he completed his A-Levels at St Joseph’s Boys School.He explained: “I knew % that I wanted to get a trade. At University I could spend years of my le studying to work in an oversubscribed area, so when I saw the apprenticeship opportunity with NWRC and Errigal Contracts, I knew it was for me.”The joint enterprise between NWRC and Errigal was launched in , offering two-year apprenticeship opportunities in a number of skills areas. During the two-year programme, students are given the skills in college to achieve a City and Guilds Award work with top professionals on jobs across the UK and Ireland, all while earning top apprenticeships wages.Brendan, who won the gold medal in dry-lining at the Live UK Worlds Skills Finals in Birmingham and will now go on to represent the UK at the  world finals in Shanghai, said his apprenticeship had given him the opportunity to work all around the UK, in Manchester, Liverpool, and Belfast, learning his trade.He’s now looking forward to the Skills Olympics next year when he’ll go head-to-head with the world’s best. The competition in Birmingham was tough,” he said. “As you work you are aware of the thousands of people who are looking at you. “When I won gold I was shocked and I’m delighted to now be going on to compete in Shanghai.“I’ve really enjoyed the opportunities that studying with NWRC and working with Errigal has given me and I’d encourage more young people my age to give it a go. I’m now working full time with Errigal and it’s been great.”From, - February, a series of events are being held across the Derry City and Strabane District Council area promoting the opportunities available for apprentices locally.North West Regional College will host two events to celebrate Apprenticeship Week.The Construction Futures event will be held at the Student Zone at Strand Road campus on Tuesday, February  from - p.m. An information evening on Higher Level Apprenticeships , will be held at the Strand Road campus the following nightat .pm.

This can help tackle both the obesity epidemic and improve childrenrsquos overall health and well-being.The Active School Travelprogramme which Sustrans delivers has successfully increased the number of pupils walking, cycling and scooting to school, with the charity explaining that it takes on  new schools each year.However, it says the programme needs to expand and provide more long-term support to school communities in order to turn around these statistics.In the   period, the number of children walking, cycling and scooting to school in the AST programme increased from % to % while, at the same time, the number of pupils being driven to school fell from % to %.Cllr Walker says he is ldquoall for getting more children to walk to school, but explained that in some parts of Down District, this simply isnrsquot possible as in many rural areas there are no footpaths. In addition, he said there are no dedicated cycle paths.ldquoI fully support the work of Sustrans and have worked with the charity on a number of schemes in my own area, he revealed.ldquoI recognise that the more children who walk to school, the less congestion there will be and fewer cars sitting in traffic queues pumping dangerous fumes into the atmosphere.Cllr Walker said mph zones have been introduced outside some local schools, calling for such schemes to be rolled out across all council areas.He added: ldquoWith the emphasis now on people taking more responsibility for their own health and getting fitter, encouraging children to walk to school when it is safe to do so will sew the seed of keeping healthy from an early age and this will stay with them for the rest of their lives..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd January 2020 Delay.jpg","title":"Delay for development meeting on Irish Street  ","story":"AN event designed to provide business owners in Downpatrick with an input into plans to redevelop the former Irish Street police station site and a number of adjacent empty buildings has been delayed.Originally scheduled to take place before Christmas the meeting was delayed in the wake of the snap Westminster election, with hopes that it would go ahead this month.Now it has emerged that it could be February or March before what is being viewed as one of the most signicant town centre regeneration meetings ever to take place in the district takes place.A number of Downpatrick councillors were recently given the opportunity to view the inside of the former police base and the expansive grounds to the rear which will feature heavily in the proposed redevelopment scheme.The old police base enjoys protected status and therefore cannot be razed to the ground to pave the way for any new development. As a result, innovative ways will have to be found to include the building in the new retail scheme which could also include new housing.There are also some who believe that a multi-storey car park mdash with retail outlets on the ground floor mdash should be considered in the new development and built on top of the existing Irish Street car park footprint.Newry, Mourne and Down Council officials have this week reaffirmed their commitment to work with the Downpatrick business community, residents and other stakeholders on the redevelopment of the Irish Street site, with the project being spearheaded by the Department of Communities.Council officials say that working alongside local people on the redevelopment proposal will provide consultants charged with coming up with a design on the way forward with an understanding of what local people would like to see and what would work at this particular site.Officials insist that there is little point developing options which they think might work, with the forthcoming meeting with all stakeholders designed to secure by-in from them and develop a project that is likely to succeed.The planned meeting with all stakeholders will help shape a development brief inviting potential developers to come forward to transform the site and kick-start a signicant town centre economic regeneration initiative.In addition, the development brief will outline what all those involved in the process would like to see happen in Irish Street to maximise the potential of every square inch of available space.Leading High Street brands including Marks and Spencer and Home Bargains have expressed an interest in the location which is the last large scale development site remaining in Downpatrick town centre.It is over two years since it was revealed that the former police station site had been earmarked for a major economic regeneration initiative, with local council officials confirming recently that ious pockets of land which make-up the Irish Street site have now been purchased.Local councillor Dermot Curran said the recent visit to the proposed Irish Street development site provided an insight into its size and development potential.He is backing the move to involve businesses and residents in helping shape the development brief for the site and hopes that the planned meeting at which they will be asked for their input can take place soon.ldquoWhat we are talking about is the biggest ever investment in Downpatrick town centre. We have to get this right as it has the potential to not only regenerate Irish Street, but the wider town centre by attracting increased footfall which will boost existing businesses, many of them locally owned, said Cllr Curran.ldquoIt is clear that having viewed the Irish Street site that it offers massive potential and can transform Downpatrick town centre and provide a major boost for existing businesses.Cllr Curran said he has spoken to a number of business people who are keen to have the date of the meeting with consultants confirmed so they can attend to help play their part in shaping the future development of a prominent town centre site.He added: ldquoPeople want to see progress on this crucially important development. Redeveloping the expansive Irish Street site can act as a catalyst for additional town centre investment and will provide a boost for existing businesses..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd January 2020 Down.jpg","title":"Down senior footballers face tough opener  ","story":"DOWNrsquoS senior footballers head for Clonmel on Sunday more in hope than optimism to open their Division  Allianz League campaign against Tipperary.Paddy Tallyrsquos charges face a tough opening game as the Premier County, who were relegated from Division  last season, will be like a wounded animal and determined to bounce back into the leaguersquos second tier.The sides met last June at Pairc Esler when Down won an All-Ireland Qualier - to -.

His unavailability through injury is a severe blow to Tallyrsquos aspirationsJohn OrsquoHare and Marc Hynes shared the goalkeeping duties in the two McKenna Cup games, but Castlewellanrsquos Rory Burns is still considered as the county number one.Downpatrickrsquos Gerard Collins, Burrenrsquos Kevin McKernan and Warrenpointrsquos Ryan McAleenan could well man the full back berths with Annaclonersquos Brendan McArdle also in the frame.A knee injury for Saulrsquos Pierce Laverty, picked up against Tyrone, could rule him out of action, but Daniel Guinness could well fill in for him at right half back. Captain Darren OrsquoHagan seems to be favourite to start at centre half back with a mixture of Ross Carr, McArdle, Mayobridgersquos Shane Annett and Guinness flanking him.Midfield has been a bit of a problem for Down, but Loughinislandrsquos Jonny Flynn should start in this sector with either Liatroimrsquos Liam Middleton, Castlewellanrsquos Sean Dornan, Carryduffrsquos Owen McCabe or Longstonersquos Conor Poland most likely to get the nod.The set of six forwards will come from Poland, McCabe, Corey Quinn, Barry OrsquoHagan, Conor Maginn, Pat Havern, Donal OrsquoHare, Brendan Gallen, Ciaran Harney, Liam Kerr and Ross McGarry.Regardless of who Tally starts with, Tipperary will be no pushovers and now under Powerrsquos management, they will be keen to impress.Michael OrsquoReilly, Liam Fahey, Bill Maher, Robbie Kiely, Jack Kennedy, Conor Sweeney and Liam Treacy all showed up well in Tipperaryrsquos recent McGrath Cup campaign and did enough, even without Quinlivan, to suggest that they will be a tough nut to crack..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd January 2020 C Diary.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C January 22%2C 1980  ","story":"DOWNPATRICK mdash Rumours were re this week that it could be another ten years before the adoption of the poundm-plus scheme to provide a lsquoring roadrsquo in Downpatrick.Work on the scheme first started in the late sixties and, ironically, the Department of Environment is preparing to make a public announcement within the next two weeks on the route they want the road to take.But on Monday Downpatrick councillor Mr Eddie McGrady told a meeting of Down councillors that there were local rumours of another ten-year delay.Within the past  hours it has become obvious that the warning could take on realistic proportions.It seems clear that a wall of objections will be raised of the scheme and it could particularly take years to smooth out negotiations and pare the way for a pubic inquiry, which now looks inevitable.Mr McGradyrsquos warning came during a council discussion on a planning decision to refuse alterations and extensions to a dwelling in Saul Street, which is expected to be in the path of the new road.He drew the councilrsquos attention to a planning approval for squash courts in St Patrickrsquos Avenue mdash also likely to be in the path of the road mdash offering one explanation for the conflicting decisions.ldquoThere are rumours that planning permissions might be given in certain circumstances because it might be ten years before the road is implemented, he said.CROSSGAR mdash The st Crossgar Boys Brigade will represent Down Battalion in the Northern Ireland district finals of the squad drill competition in Omagh on Saturday.The Lissara boys qualied for the finals by wining the annual Down Battalion competition held at Banbridge on Monday night.

about geology and include sites that are of interest for their history, archaeology, bioersity, folklore, cultural and local heritage.Securing the prestigious geopark designation is one of the key planks of Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos tourism strategy, with those behind the bid confident that it has the potential to deliver high quality tourism in the area, increasing the number of

opportunities to develop cohesive partnerships with the common goal of promoting the arearsquos signicant geological and other heritage.If the local bid for geopark status for a huge swathe of land covering Strangford and Lecale, the Mournes and Ring of Gullion is successful, the international designation is expected to play a key role in helping transform the local economy.The geopark brand will use the geological heritage of the three areas to develop sustainable tourism that generates economic benefits, while providing recreational opportunities and increased awareness of the arearsquos natural assets, working with landowners, businesses and communities.The ultimate aim of a geopark is to enhance the economy and develop employment opportunities for the people who live there, but the global brand does not impose any restrictions on farming practices, planning or development.There are currently  geoparks found in  countries across the world, all of which have been

But now as long as its dry, Newcastle is busy and parking is a necessary part of the town centre, she said.ldquoWhen the overflow car park is not being used, itrsquos complete chaos and parking can create issues for residents in nearby folds.She asked council officers when the new overflow car-park would be open for business andthe current overflow area could be kept open in the interim to help with parking demand.Michael Lipsett, the councilrsquos director of active and healthy communities, said he envisaged the work lasting three months and promised that once the necessary planning approval was gained, his department would be preparing to tender for a contractor as soon as possible.Slieve Croob Cllr Andrew McMurray queried whether the car-park would be a ldquoblanket tarmac covering andit would encroach on the green space.He was told that the proposal was to use a synthetic grid which would allow grass to show through so it would look green but would also indicate the car spaces available and one-way traffic system planned.Mournes Cllr Harold McKee welcomed the development as a ldquogreat idea and said parking in Newcastle was ldquoan absolute nightmare at any time of the year.Cllr Devlin suggested that the current overflow parking area should be in continuous use until the new facility is opened.However, Mr Lipsett said he currently did not have the budget available to cover this but would investigate and report back..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd January 2020 Philip.jpg","title":"Philip and Helen in tandem at Kildare  ","story":"ON a bitterly cold Saturday morning Phillip and Helen Vint were at the start line for the latest in the East of Ireland Marathon series, at Staplestown, in North Kildare, which also provides half marathon and k alternatives, mostly for partners, like Helen who feel itrsquos nice to be there to support your other half, but who feel that running a marathon with them is pushing things a bit too far, . miles too far to be exact.The temperature was -C when they began running and a sultry +C when they finished and underfoot conditions were slippery by virtue of the frozen ice around the route.So, well done to both on completing what they describe as steady runs for their firsts of , Phillip in .. and fth place and Helen in .. and third place respectively.BornRunSaturday saw a big turnout,  in fact, for the sixth of the BornRun Run Forest Run Series.This week the venue was Gosford Country Park which will also host the NI  Ulster Intermediate and Masters Cross Country Championships next weekend.The only distance on offer this week was k and the route headed out in a loop around the start and continued towards the outer boundaries of the forest.The first k was quite level and took everyone into the scenic forest for k where there were a few small inclines, but overall it was a flat, fast course with a good run in the last k down to the finish line.No-one made better use of the terrain than East Downrsquos Jimmy Sloan, who fairly flew round the course in a superb ., which was almost two minutesahead of the second-placed Thomas Carson . with third place filled by Barry McAuley in ..I believe this is Jimmyrsquos first win in club colours and it certainly wonrsquot be his last, given his present form and continuing improvement, which in spite of hearing later that the distance was allegedly  metres short, nevertheless represents a great effort and time.

This year they donated a fantastic amount for the charities, said Raphael. ldquoI am delighted to see young people come on board to help others. They are a credit to their school and their families.Raphaelrsquos chance meeting with Martin, a homeless man living on the streets of Dublin whom he met during a visit to family members a number of years ago, was the catalyst for him to launch his annual appeal which has enjoyed tremendous community support.The photographerrsquos meeting with Martin underneath a railway bridge close to Pearse Street railway station had a profound impact on him, moving him to organise an appeal as soon as he ed home.ldquoThe sight of seeing Martin on Pearse Street back in  will be with me forever. To see homelessness on the rise across Ireland,north and south, means something is badly wrong. There doesnrsquot appear to be any political will to cure the problem. It there was, we would not have homelessness in a modern society. More needs to be done, immediately, said Raphael.Year on year the response to his appeal has increased and this year he will be looking for anyone interested in helping to get in touch to help with the collection, storage and distribution of donations.Raphael confirmed that he plans to launch his appeal for volunteers to join forces with him this October.ldquoI cannot begin to praise every single person who responded to my Christmas appeal. It was so overwhelming, he explained.ldquoAll I do is put the word out about my appeal and people come forward in great numbers to help. The response to the latest appeal was the biggest to date and I cannot thank people enough for their generosity and support.ldquoThe response from the public was truly unbelievable. I am particularly indebted to everyone, in particular, the staff and students at St Colmcillersquos High School.The annual appeal is particularly time-consuming for someone who runs his own business and that is why Raphael is hoping people will volunteer to help him in .ldquoEvery item that is donated has to be unpacked and checked to make sure it is okay to pass on. Then it has to be sorted, re-packed and stored until the time to deliver it comes. This takes up a lot of time and there is only so much one person can do, he explained.Raphael has also singled out the management and staff at Peter Fitzpatrick and Sons Estate Agents in Downpatrick for particular praise for allowing their Irish Street base to be used as a -off point for his appeal.ldquoThe business has been so supportive over the past number of years. I cannot thank them enough for all their help, he said.ldquoDePaul was over the moon with the items people donated and the fact that a signicant number of people took time out at Christmas to think of and help others is very humbling. If more people come forward to help me this year, together, we could do even more.In future Raphael hopes to deliver the majority of donations to more local charities and organisations. He said it only seems right that items collected are distributed locally so in future most of what he receives will go to local charities.He added: ldquoThe generosity and community spirit across the district is something to behold. All I do is announce details of the appeal and people across the community then donate in numbers.ldquoOnce the message gets out there, people are quick to respond and I am so grateful as are the organisations they are supporting. The generosity of spirit that local people have displayed since my first appeal continues to be overwhelming..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd January 2020 Red.jpg","title":"Red High back in business  ","story":"ST Patrickrsquos Grammar School, Downpatrick, booked their place in the MacLarnon Cup play-offs against Carndonagh Community School and are now just one win away from the quarter-finals.The holders didnrsquot start that well as St Louisrsquo grabbed the first two points through Aidan Scullion at the Dub last Wednesday, but as the first half progressed it became clear that St Patrickrsquos were the more accomplished team.Although St Louisrsquo still led at the break by - to -, the writing was on the wall for the mid-Antrim boys with the pace of the Downpatrick wing-forwards and wing-backs, plus the presence of Aodhan Harney, Tom Smyth and Ruairiacute Connor down the centre was always a problem for them.St Louisrsquo looked good in the opening few minutes with Scullion lively and Ruairiacute Hagan and Ryan McQuillan pushing forward, but that penetration was arrested before the end of the first quarter and the scores dried up.Their hopes of remaining in the tie against the strong breeze in the second half rested on a penalty in first half injury-time when Ronan McKillop fed Ryan McQuillan and the Glenravel man was taken down.But Scullion pulled his shot wide from the spot kick and that two points lead did not look good enough.Tom Smyth, Tom Savage, Chris McIlroy and Dermot Donaldson all pointed in the opening six minutes of the second half and the result was not in doubt from then on.Some of these were well taken scores, but the cream of the crop was a seven-player move down the left wing which finished with Conor Murray slinging over the second of his four second half scores in the nd minute.Six minutes later the Red High slammed the door shut on Ballymena.

This year, she will celebrate her ninety second birthday and she discusses a letime of activism across Europe.Veganuary is an annual event which encourages people to go vegan for a month. In last yearrsquos campaign, a quarter of a million people pledged to try a vegan diet.More NewsVale school pals brave the shave for animal charityPenarth father of four is recognised in New Year Honour list for services to cricketHouse prices increased in the Vale of Glamorgan, latest figures showOnce a fringe movement, veganism is quickly gaining a vast appeal, especially amongst the young, as the environmental benefits of a plant-based diet become clearer.According to a study by the Vegan Society, , people in the UK were vegan in  ndash  and a half times higher than in . Almost half of these were people aged below .Veganism has brought with it a lucrative trade in plant-based produce as businesses move to accommodate the concerns of their customers and promote ethical alternatives to meat.Long before veganism became a dietary and commercial trendsetter, however, June Holder, a -year-old woman from Penarth, had her eyes opened to the costly effects of meat consumption. After eating a vegan breakfast at a local cafeacute, she settled down to tell me her story.ldquoIrsquove been vegan for  years, she said. ldquoMy daughter had a stall at Camden Market, and she used to collect masses of money for animal rights there. It was her who first introduced me to the cause.ldquoLater on, I organized a charity coffee morning and sent the money I raised to Compassion in World Farming. In , they sent me a magazine which showed what happened to the animals. Well, I sat down that morning and read what theyrsquod sent me ndash and I was vegan!Whilst the public has become more receptive to veganism, June still encounters hostility: ldquoPeoplersquos reactions y when I tell them Irsquom vegan. They become hostile because theyrsquore guilty, I suppose.ldquoI remember that a vegan group had a stall in the market a few years ago. They were advertising parts of Alsatians to eat. People were horried. So, when they were angry, I had a chance to talk to them. lsquoYou accept that any animal can be treated like this except when it comes to your dogsrsquo, I told them. Well, they had to accept it. How could they not Originally from Penarth, June moved to Dinas Powys from Barry after her husband, Derrick, passed away  years ago.Derrick was the owner of Holders Menswear, a menrsquos fashion store which was once renowned throughout the Vale of Glamorgan and beyond.Junersquos decision to become vegan sparked  years of dedication to activism. She joined the Animal Welfare Party, and, in her sixties and seventies, she travelled across the UK and Europe to campaign for animal rights.ldquoI demonstrated in many places. I went to Brussels twice to protest against the exportation of live animals. The International Fund for Animal Welfare took us in a coach.ldquoI was in the front row of the crowd, up against these spikes and razor wire. If they had started to push from the back, I dread to think what would have happened.ldquoThe night before the protest I had this thought: lsquoThe danger is not to protestrsquo. I wrote it on a little board.ldquoPeople kept tapping me on the shoulder and passing the board around the crowd and eventually it made its way back to me.What does the message mean ldquoIt means that it is more dangerous not to protest against these injustices that are happening.June still has a copy of the placard. Later, at her home, she retrieved it from a trove of scattered paraphernalia accumulated after years of protest.She has written prolically throughout her le about events which have provoked and enthused her. One poem describes the day of protest in Brussels. It reflects Junersquos unceasing dedication to animal welfare but also her frustration at the pace of change:ldquoThe writer of these verses was, quite some time ago, in Brussels with a poster which now rings yet more true. lsquoThe danger is not to protestrsquo is what the message said.ldquoThen round it went to young and old for everyone to read. From countries all round Europe, but the farmers paid no heed. Live transport, a huge issue then, continues just the same.Another poem read:ldquoChristmas is a time to spend, but why not save instead  In sheds around the country to sate the publicrsquos lust for something huge to set their feast. The turkeys just exist.ldquoTen million in this country at Christmas time alone. Is this the way to talk of peace and teach our children love Veganuary runs throughout January.

I started the week as usual by walking Isaac to school, enjoying a father-son chat about the day ahead. has seen a rocky start with wildfires ravaging through Australia and tensions rising in the Middle East but this cannot set the tone for what is to come.As someone who has family in Australia, I am truly appalled to see the spread and devastation of the fires, but also the initial response from senior Australian politicians.Their denial of the link between the climate emergency which we face globally and the disaster which has swept across their nation is completely incomprehensible.Moving forward we must accept that we are in a state of emergency and must take drastic action to limit as much of the impact as practicably possible.We certainly have an interesting year,not decade ahead. The UKrsquos withdrawal from the EU will begin later this month and we have a Conservative Government in Westminster until at least .Regardless of the numbers in the Commons, the Labour Party still has to stand up for those we represent. I am confident that my colleague, Stephen Doughty MP will continue to do that.The Labour Party will now move to elect a new Leader and Deputy Leader, a chance to reunite the Party and hold the Prime Minister to account for his actions.I am truly glad to see that several MPs from across the Party have put their names forward to stand for both positions. This offers the membership and the country a broader choice.I am yet to decide who I will back in the forthcoming election but I know that I want to see a vision from each of the candidates. For me, that vision needs to be a realistic reflection of our last decade out of government in Westminster, but also a strategy for reconnecting with our voters and securing a Labour government which can deliver for those who need us most.Finally, I want to thank the staff across the NHS and wider public services for their hard work under increasing pressures, particularly during the winter period.Our public services work hard all year round and many take the sacrice of working over the Christmas and New Year period for which I, and many others, are extremely grateful.As everyou would like to speak with me, you can call my office on    or write to me at Vaughan.Gething@assembly.wales or Office of Vaughan Gething AM, Room C, National Assembly for Wales, CF NA. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Itrsquos better than shoving a drumstick up your arse on stage, he said.Originally from Cardf, Pritchard studied cooking at college but dedicated himself to professional skating when he was sponsored at .ldquoDirty Sanchez was great.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

January , : pm\"\"Parents are dipping into their kids savings to supplement day-to-day living costs, a study has found.Researchers polled , mums and dads and found one fth have borrowed money from their childrens piggy banks and accounts in order to pay their living expenses.Nearly half of those have taken cash out of their little ones savings to pay household bills, with  per cent borrowing money to cover the cost of groceries.And, ironically, more than one sixth have done so in order to cover childcare.The research was commissioned by comparethemarket as part of their latest Parentdex report on pocket moneyJody Coughlan, Money Manager, at comparethemarket said: \"Fortunately for kids, the wider squeeze on the household budget seems to have had little impact on the generous amounts parents wants to give their children.\"That said, parents do need to ensure that they are able to give their kids this pocket money, without needing to dip into it to cover wider household bills.\"The report uncovers the spending habits of British children who receive an average of £ a month, totalling £ every year and giving them the equivalent of £.billion to spend collectively.Research also found kids savings accounts are relatively healthy, with the average child having a signicant £. stashed away.In fact, one fth of children have £, sitting in their savings.It also emerged children are generating a second source of income, with four in five parents giving their offspring extra money to cover unforeseen requests such as new clothing or nights out with friends.These ad hoc requests see one fth of parents topping up pocket money once a fortnight, and more than a quarter giving these extra handouts once a month.Meanwhile, the Bank of Gran and Grandad appears to be another fruitful source of income for kids.One quarter of grandparents find themselves contributing to kids income, with two thirds giving their grandkids generous handouts as and when they see them.Unsurprisingly, children in the capital are the recipients of the highest amount of pocket money compared to anywhere  in the UK, with the average parent in London giving £ to their child each month.In contrast, children in the east of England are given £ a month while those in the south west who are given £.Fortunately, the poll also shows mums and dads are confident in their childrens ability to manage their finances effectively, with almost three quarters believing the youngsters will be well equipped to handle money as they approach adulthood.In the absence of financial education at schools, this could be down to discussions at home, with nine in  stating they have talked about money management with their children.However, parents clearly feel their children would benefit from additional teaching in schools, with four fths of those polled believing schools should do more to teach financial education.Jody Coughlan added: \"Its incredibly encouraging to see the number of parents who are willing to talk to their children about financial management from such an early age.\"Not only will this do more to prepare them for financial responsibility in the long run, but it should also help to lessen their long-term dependence on the Bank of Mum and Dad as a result!\"\"\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\"

In the last few years Pulse PR has worked with clients include Applegreen, during the roll-out of its first stores in Northern Ireland, jewellery retailer Argento that has over  high street stores in Ireland and one of Ireland’s most iconic gt wear brands, Belleek. And with a business spirit which has helped take root due to her father’s own entrepreneurial background, Grainne’s developed her own firm over the last  years – growing with the changing media landscape, creating communications and marketing strategies, working with tech start-ups from the ground up and building on strong media relationships. “For seven years I had worked with PR agencies and businesses such as Barclays, Tayto and Tesco. I was approaching  and I decided it was now or never,” she told Ulster Business. Networking at Down Royal Racecourse with a pocket full of business cards saw her leave with three clients, and from that, the business was born. Although Pulse PR was initially centred around work with public relations and press, Grainne now works with a lot of start-ups, particularly those within tech – her business is also based at Catalyst, formerly the Northern Ireland Science Park, which is the largest technology park here. One of those she’s now working closely with is IRP Commerce – a £m turnover software development company which made it on to Deloitte’s Technology Fast  list of high growth technology companies seven times. “That relationship started eight years ago with a press release, and now I work with them to target retailers, manufacturers and distributors across the UK, promoting its e-commerce  at national conferences and building strategic relationships with key players in the e-commerce industry. When I started it was very traditional PR, and dealing with newspapers and magazines. Now, it’s also grown further into the digital sphere with online PR, blogging and video testimonials. “I’ve seen a big sht in how my time is spent from when I started  years ago. Although clients still value print coverage, there is definitely a demand to create engaging campaigns for social media. “Because of how the world is changing, I have had to ersy as well. It’s about being flexible and realising the developing trends, and trying to adapt. I’ve always been comfortable in front of the camera or with a microphone in my hand so turned this into a business opportunity to host events, commentate on radio or host  at tech conferences – there is an under-representation of women in this sector so it’s a gap I believe I fill.” As a self-employed businesswoman, Grainne extends her reach with clients by collaborating with freelance photographers, designers and videographers. “You have to get results for your clients. I purposely keep my client list manageable so I’m not competing against myself and I can broaden the scope of activity I do for them,” she says. Grainne also works with Catalyst on its Springboard programme as a marketing domain expert, giving start-up companies assistance when they are bringing their product to market. She says most of her clients come through referrals from other companies she’s been involved with. “Referrals are great as it means I’ve done a good job for the person referring me. I also find a lot of work comes from people I have previously worked with or went to school with. Northern Ireland is known for having two degrees of separation – this also applies in the business world.” She’s also been working with the Ulster Farmers’ Union this year to help promote the organisation’s Open Farm Weekend. It’s an initiative, sponsored by Bank of Ireland UK, to allow members of the public to pay a visit to a farm for the first time. “This is a new sector for me, but the principles are the same – find out the end user and then apply the right marketing tools to engage with them. “It’s about fitting in with a company and how that business thinks – being adaptable and working out what they want, and trying to help them grow. It’s about presenting a strong and clear message, developing strong media contacts and also working across digital and print media to boost reach.” In  years, the media and PR landscape has evolved, including how information is consumed. “But I’m still a firm believer in knowing the basics,” she says. “It’s about having the experience and the education to be able to do it. After my degree and Master’s, I studied to gain additional post-graduate qualications from the Chartered Institute of Marketing. I’m a firm believer in le-long learning. Too many people starting in the industry think all the need is a smartphone and an Instagram account. “It’s competitive, but there’s always enough business for everyone out there. You really just need a few clients and then you turn your focus to them, as well as working with others as and when they come. A few projects naturally ended last year so I’ll be expanding my client list in the coming months. It’s always exciting to start with a new company or entrepreneur. “It’s about being flexible and being aware of what is going on with your clients, and being proactive. Being a sole-trader means you are flexible and can work closely with companies, either in their office or remotely as an extended member of their marketing team. I have often thought about employing more staff, but I believe clients want to see me working on their account, rather than meeting me at the pitch and then being passed over to a junior member of staff. “There’s a great satisfaction in helping an innovative small business, which is set for bigger things, and working alongside them in getting their message out there, building, growing and creating jobs. You really want to work with them and help build their business. “It’s about building the relationships and contacts, and that’s something you can’t teach. People buy from people and I believe one of the reasons I have kept many of the same clients for  years is because I always go the extra mile and am true to my word.” Grainne’s desire  years ago to go it alone with Pulse PR is something she says is very much part of the family story. “My father Malachy is an entrepreneur, a mechanic by trade, but he’s always been able to turn his hand to everything,” she says. My sister Orla was also self-employed as a pharmacist. I’ve been brought up in that environment and we’ve always had support and a ‘can do’ attitude from our mother Geraldine. I had a baby, Gabriel, four months ago but didn’t get the option to take maternity leave. This is the downside of being self-employed, but the flipside means I can work from home when I need to.” As for the next  years, Grainne says it’s about trying to give something back, using her skills to help those who have little or no experience in knowing how to bring their message and products to the fore. “I’m still as passionate about business as I was  years ago. I’m excited to see how I can continue to use my skills to add value to clients to ensure their message and their voice is heard.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/234234343334.jpg","title":"stormont deal business back new assembly","story":"Posted on Friday  January  by John Mulgrew Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Julian Smith and Irish Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney. Pic Kelvin Boyes Northern Ireland’s business community has given its support for a deal which has seen the Assembly up-and-running after a three year stasis. The Northern Ireland Assembly couldon Fridaypolitical parties back a deal tabled by the UK and Irish Governments. DUP leader Arlene Foster has indicated that her party will back the deal, while Sinn Fein said its leadership will meet to discuss it on Friday. The UUP has said they will consider the deal, but are willing to attend the Assemblyit sits. In a joint statement urging politicians to accept the ‘New Decade, New Approach’ deal, NI Chamber president John Healy, vice president Ian Henry, and chief executive Ann McGregor, said: “After three years of paralysis, we now have a workable deal that will allow an Executive to start addressing the problems within our health service and education system. They will also be able to take action to grow our economy and support the community and voluntary sector. “We therefore encourage the five main political parties to progress it urgently. Business, health and education cannot wait any longer - failure is not an option. “Now is the time for our politicians to show mature leadership and help navigate a path to the future by accepting this deal.” Secretary of State Julian Smith and Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney published the New Decade, New Approach deal on Thursday evening and urged parties to back it andto Stormont on Friday. Reacting to the news, Trade NI – the alliance of Retail NI, Manufacturing NI and Hospitality Ulster – said: “We welcome the draft deal published by the British and Irish Governments in the final round of talks to restore devolution. We strongly encourage all the main parties of Northern Ireland to sign the deal today and get the Assembly back up and running.” “As our three organisations represent the majority of the businesses that make up private sector jobs in Northern Ireland, we are cautiously hopeful that the deal and aof the Assembly will see the development of policies and legislation at devolved level and the kick start that our economy desperately needs. The clear prioritisation of the Northern Ireland economy highlights the many challenges that businesses have faced over the past three years and our message to the parties is that we support you in your endeavours to secure this deal.” “While this is a good start, improvements are still needed to drive the economy forward and support the growth of business across Northern Ireland. As stated in our Vision  document, Northern Ireland’s potential is signicant but reform and growth is needed to create the modern economy we are capable of and deserve.” FSB NI policy chair, Tina McKenzie, said: “Businesses will welcome the agreement published last night as a step forward towards restoring devolved government, something for which FSB has been calling since the collapse of the institutions three years ago. “The draft agreement contains some positive commitments to bolster the local economy, on issues like skills, infrastructure and Brexit. However, theof devolution is by no means a panacea it just means that at long last we have elected representatives in place to tackle a very dficult task. “The next Executive must move quickly to deliver on the myriad issues which have been left unaddressed for far too long. While the health service will be high on the agenda, we must not lose sight of the need to bolster our SME economy, which is the absolute bedrock on which the first-class public services to which we all aspire are built. “Ministers must move swtly to support our economy at one of the most turbulent times for many decades, starting by lowering the rates burden on small businesses, whilst also moving forward rapidly with key infrastructure projects which have stalled and ensuring that our schools, colleges, and universities are providing students with the skills they need for the jobs of the future. “In order to begin to address these issues, the parties must put pragmatism first and get back round the Executive table.” Colin Neill, chief executive, Hospitality Ulster, said: “We encourage all parties to seize this opportunity and sign up to the deal published late last night to get the Assembly and Executive back as quickly as possible.” “This is the best chance to bring the devolved government back to le. Our message to the party leaders is clear, we support you in your endeavours and encourage you to get the New Decade, New Approach agreement over the line today. Redmond McFadden, president of the Londonderry Chamber of Commerce said: “The Londonderry Chamber as well as other representatives of business, education, health, trade unions and civic organisations, held a meeting with the five main political parties at Stormont last night. “At that meeting we pressed the urgent need for the parties to agree the draft deal which was published by the British and Irish Governments. Three years without Ministers making local decisions has had an enormous impact on our economy and wider society. A lack of effective and meaningful representation here is curtailing investment in our region, stling job creation and driving our young people away. Simon Hamilton, chief executive of Belfast Chamber, said: “Belfast Chamber welcomes progress towards the restoration of the Northern Ireland Executive and encourages the local political parties to reach agreement. For the last three years, our members have seen how an absence of decision making has stunted growth and stled investment. The proposed priorities for the Executive contain some issues which Belfast Chamber has been supportive of for some time. “Other policies which could boost our economy are noticeably missing but we look forward to joining with our colleagues across the business community to ensure that the new Executive pursues an agenda that grows jobs and boosts our economy.” Northern Ireland Local Government Association chief executive, Derek McCallan said: “I am very pleased that the British and Irish governments have tabled a draft deal on restoring the NI Executive. I hope that an agreement can be reached quickly to get the Stormont institutions back up and running immediately. For three years, our eleven local councils have been the only ing form of democratically elected government in Northern Ireland. Local government has been a vital democratic anchor during this period and ensured the provision of crucial public services for local citizens. “It’s time to bridge the democratic deficit and unlock the potential of local government in Northern Ireland by investing in our local councils. An Executive commitment to a devolution bill and greater financial powers and resources will drive a transformation in Northern Ireland’s democratic governance and help create a more sustainable democracy, environment and economy for Northern Ireland.” Kirsty McManus, national director, IoD NI, said: “The ‘New Decade, New Approach’ deal is to be welcomed, filled with ambition that,fulfilled, can deliver real improvements for the people and businesses of Northern Ireland. “We would therefore urge all parties to get behind the deal to enable the speedy restoration of the Executive. “Commitments from the British and Irish governments for some crucial pieces of infrastructure such as the York Street Interchange, upgrades to the A and A road and Northern Ireland’s wastewater network are particularly pleasing. “The expansion of university provision at the Magee campus in Derry meanwhile will go some way to rebalancing the regional economy. “Plans for multi-year budgets and increased civic engagement will also improve overall governance. “From a business perspective however, we would have liked to have seen more around a new skills agenda, which urgently require focus alongside a renewed look at the Apprenticeship Levy which is not included in this deal. “On behalf of our members, we will also monitor closely commitments to bring forward legislation that will allow unfettered access to the Great Britain market for local business following Brexit.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/edel1.jpg","title":"leaders in business edel doherty beyond business travel","story":"Posted on Friday  January  by Ulster BusinessEdel Doherty’s grand ambitions for her business travel firm probably should come as no surprise to those who know her – it’s a sector which she has worked in her entire le.A decade ago she founded Beyond Business Travel, a business with a £m turnover and around  staff. Now, the aim is to grow that to £m, which includes a new office in Dublin to expand its market reach right across Ireland.“We are hoping to take that to £m in the next four years and we have opened an office in Dublin,” she told Ulster Business.“It’s an ambitious target, but we have grown year-on-year for the past nine years and have brought a lot of technology into the business and to our clients.”The client list reads like a who’s who of the giants of Northern Ireland industry, including poultry processor Moy Park, Almac and Devenish Nutrition. The firm has also looked after those on the Game of Thrones crew.“We have a strong track record of getting and maintaining good clients,” she says. “We are a new breed of travel management company. We want to make a dference in client businesses. “People, the human capital, is what the business is and making sure they are looked after while they travel is a big thing for us – doing it effectively, making sure they have the support,  .“I’ve been in travel for more than  years and I’m passionate about it. It has changed dramatically, with the rise of the smartphone.”That includes the development of booking tools for clients, but also looking ahead and building more advanced technology, incorporating articial intelligence and being able to personalise the experience for each traveller. Born in Belfast, Edel’s initial career trajectory looked set for university, but instead she wanted to go in to the world of work, and tackle the travel sector.“I went straight into the industry and I’m a great believer in le-long learning. I want to be the best version of me and to reach my potential,” she says. That includes working across dferent areas of the travel industry. But Edel says business travel “was always my love”.Edel is involved with the Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry, and Women in Business, as well as sitting on the CBI’s SME Council in London. She’s also just been named Businesswoman of the Year by Women in Business.And like many company founders, Edel hit the ground running with her own business as the world entered its worst recession in a generation. She was previously a director with a company for  years, before deciding to make the move and go it alone.“I made a business plan – I said to myself, I can do this, I know I can. I built a brilliant team around me, and almost  years later, here we are. It’s been hard work, but it’s enjoyable and I’m passionate about the Northern Ireland economy. I’m passionate about buying local.”As for Brexit, Edel says setting up the Dublin office was one was in which the firm was mitigating against any business concerns arising from Brexit.“It’s hard to plan when you don’t know. Business people are problem solvers,” she says. “Once we have a problem, we come up with a solution. But people are holding back on decisions. We did a complete analysis of our clients and they are down on last year. It completely filters down and there is a knock on effect and people are nervous.“A lot of our clients are exporters. If they are affected, everything from export documents, to the movement of goods and people – that willimpact.”Looking to the future and Edel’s ambitious £m turnover target she says leading the way in tech and being early adopters is helping to drive expansion.“We are looking out at what’s coming – some clients won’t work without technology, and we have tech bedded in. It’s tried and tested.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail_MM-Photo-1.jpg","title":"manufacturing month ni to showcase strength of sector","story":"Posted on Tuesday  January  by Ulster Business Economy Minister Diane Doods with Manufacturing NIs Stephen Kelly Northern Ireland’s burgeoning manufacturing sector will be showcased as part of a major initiative to highlight the strength and excellence of the industry here.
