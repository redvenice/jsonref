I\u0027m so happy to be joining the natural immunity club. Going to have a nap.\u0027 There has been much debate about the effectiveness of ivermectin during the pandemic after it was hailed as vaccine sceptics as a miracle cure. The hype started early in the pandemic when ivermectin was shown to destroy the virus in lab studies. Several dozen trials have also indicated that the pills may have some value in the pandemic - either by using them on patients with Covid, or as a preventative.But, according to a BBC investigation last year, around a third of studies advocating ivermectin\u0027s use were seriously flawed or biased in some way, making the results unreliable. Reviews by health authorities in the US, UK and EU have found there is insufficient evidence for using the drug against Covid.The first double-blind, gold-standard clinical trial into ivermectin is currently being carried out in Oxford, as part of the PRINCIPLE trial.Definitive results on the drug are expected this year.  Currently in the UK, health watchdogs do not recommend any clinicians prescribe the drug but, as a safe and approved medicine, it can be obtained privately. Fox recently got engaged to prep school teacher Arabella Fleetwood Neagle, 28.Miss Fleetwood Neagle apparently supports his political campaigning as she was pictured alongside him on the top deck of his Reclaim Party\u0027s battle bus during his unsuccessful bid to become London Mayor last year.Fox – whose acting dynasty includes his father James and cousin Emilia – was dropped by his agent in 2020 after a string of social media comments.Last year he said he could remove his children from school over his opposition to the Covid vaccination programme.He said he would educate them at home rather than let them be vaccinated without his consent.Fox shares custody of his boys with Miss Piper, whom he orced in 2016.  "},{"url":null,"title":"MEGHAN MCCAIN Rogans incredible popularity make media reflect going wrong","story":"Share this article He has built an empire and level of trust that is almost unfathomable.I can remember having a conversation with a friend and crew member when I worked at The View about the insanely-left politics of the show and he told me he only listens to Joe Rogan because he was the only person really speaking for him in the media.So, why aren\u0027t people in corporate media asking themselves, as their ratings dwindle to almost pathetic levels, why so many Americans have turned to Joe Rogan instead?While CNN\u0027s Jim Acosta can barely break half a million viewers a night on his new primetime show, Joe Rogan is garnering an estimated 11 million listeners per episode on his podcast.What should come of this is some serious self-reflection in the media about why a huge majority of the American public neither trusts nor cares what so many corporate mainstream journalists and commentators are saying.Instead, there is a hysterical clamoring to deplatform Joe Rogan off of his Spotify platform.Censorship and deplatforming is the opiate of the Left and they can\u0027t stop jonesing for a fix.Their only answer is to cancel people and remove their voices from society. The harsh reality is that some people simply cannot be deplatformed or cancelled and Joe Rogan is at the very top of that list.Ultimately, I don\u0027t know where Spotify will land but given the gargantuan financial investment they have made into Joe Rogan\u0027s show, I find it unlikely they will kick him off their platform because a bunch of irrelevant boomer musicians are demanding it.What I am certain of is that - no matter what happens - Joe Rogan and his loyal audience are not going anywhere, and instances like this where the media elite try to tell his fanbase what they can and can\u0027t listen to, only makes him more powerful."},{"url":null,"title":"I dreamed attending college liberals like Pandemic taught wrong JANE KITCHEN","story":"Share this article After a few weeks of being overcome with uncertainty, I started looking for schools that were more aligned with my values.I quickly discovered that almost every school that was operating even remotely normally was overtly religious. That was really hard for me to wrap my brain around given I had a somewhat fixed view of conservatives being rigid and intolerant. Yet, here I was, confronted with the fact that these religious institutions were, in practice, far more aligned with my values like inidual liberty, critical inquiry, and ersity of thought than the place that explicitly claimed to be those things.In my admissions interview for Hillsdale, a small school of less than 1,500 students, founded by Baptists in Michigan, I praised Christopher Hitchens—a staunch and unapologetic atheist—as one of my intellectual heroes. I disclosed that I was not religious. I debated with my interviewer about whether math was invented or discovered.And they wanted me anyway. When I received that acceptance letter in November for the Spring 2022 semester, I cried.I\u0027ve been at Hillsdale for three weeks, and life here is blissfully normal. I have sorority sisters. We get together and study and play board games. The student union and dining hall are packed. No one asks anyone else\u0027s vaccine status. There are no mask mandates, and no mandatory Covid testing. You\u0027ll see an occasional student in a mask but no one thinks anything of it.Students and staff I\u0027ve encountered disagree on the utility of masks and the danger of Covid, but it\u0027s rarely the focus of conversation and certainly not the organizing principle of anyone\u0027s life. It feels like someone finally turned off the fire alarm that had been blaring for nearly two years.I went to office hours—in person—the other day for one of my new classes, a required course about classic literature and I got into an interesting debate with a professor. Upon sharing an idea that directly refuted his interpretation of a line from Genesis, which I had never read before, he said, \u0027That\u0027s a great point. Why didn\u0027t you share that in class?\u0027 \u0027I didn\u0027t want to be argumentative,\u0027 I told him. \u0027Be argumentative,\u0027 he said emphatically.Of course, there\u0027s a serious social learning curve. I curse a lot, my classmates, generally, don\u0027t. I get a lot of invitations to church services and Bible study, which I politely turn down. There is a distinct lack of PDA on campus. But I do not feel judged for thinking differently.Someone on Twitter cited my migration to Hillsdale as an example of following an ideology to my own peril. I think just the opposite happened I rejected an ideology and it set me free. When I stopped being scared to say what I really thought and surrounded myself with people who put their principles into practice, I was able to begin really thinking for myself.There\u0027s an alternate universe where Covid doesn\u0027t exist, where I stay at Bryn Mawr and am never forced to learn these lessons or to confront my own limitations. I graduate believing that deep down there was something wrong with me for not seeing the world the way my peers did, and feeling ashamed for not being brave enough to voice my dissent. I am the same fearful girl I was at 10, who pretended to go to church so she could make friends.My advice to upcoming high school seniors is this: try not to buy into the idea that any prestigious institution or affiliation will determine your future success.Credentials are no longer the proxy for knowledge that they once were the internet has removed the gatekeepers of even the most specialized information. You don\u0027t have to go to a particular college—or even college at all—to have a meaningful experience. Real growth isn\u0027t about your GPA or the letters after your name it\u0027s about choosing discomfort and challenge rather than going along.These past few years have introduced a lot of potential for regret and embarrassment, but instead, I was forced to embody the values I had previously only performed, like honesty and courage. In that respect, I\u0027m glad this all happened. I know what I really believe. And I\u0027m not afraid anymore.Archived: Health and Safety | Bryn Mawr College"},{"url":null,"title":"NFL legend Tom Brady 44 says decided return Tampa Bay Bucs","story":"Share this articleTom Brady says he still hasn\u0027t made a decision on retirement - CBS NewsTom Brady’s contract makes potential retirement complicated for Buccaneers - The Boston Globe"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/12/08/16/3B2EB06B00000578-0-image-a-78_1481215945206.jpg","title":"SpaceX Falcon 9 FINALLY launches four delays","story":"Share this articleSpaceX on Twitter: \u0026quotDeployment of COSMO-SkyMed Second Generation FM2 confirmed… \u0026quotSeparation of SpaceX rocket could be seen with the naked eye due to ‘jellyfish effect�Elon Musk\u0027s SpaceX planning for record 52 launches in 2022"},{"url":null,"title":"Austria makes Covid vaccination COMPULSORY 18s today","story":"Share this articleThousands protest in Vienna against mandatory vaccination | Reuters"},{"url":null,"title":"UK weather 7 000 homes without power two days 90mph Storm Corrie","story":"Share this article\u0027We would like to apologise to all customers affected and would like to reassure them that all available resources have been deployed to support with restoration efforts and our teams are doing all they can to safely restore power as quickly as possible.Meanwhile Northern Powergrid said it only had 61 properties to reconnect today and added last night that it was \u0027continuing to work into the night to enable the last reconnections to be completed as soon as possible tomorrow\u0027.Andy Bilclough, its director of field operations, said last night: \u0027Our teams have got through a phenomenal amount of work today, which includes reconnecting around 17,000 customers that were impacted by Storm Corrie, and they\u0027re still out there now.\u0027Almost all of the work we have left to do is a blend of repair work that we discovered when we got to site, some difficult site conditions that meant we couldn\u0027t complete the work today or where we would have needed access to the property during the night but have agreed with the customer to complete the restoration tomorrow.\u0027A Northern Powergrid spokesman added that \u0027all the work is scheduled and allocated to teams who are ready to complete the work\u0027 today, continuing: \u0027We understand that it is frustrating to have been without power for this length of time – we appreciate the continued patience of our customers.\u0027We are also grateful to the fantastic teams of people who have worked tirelessly to restore supplies to more than 80,000 customers and to support all those affected.\u0027The firm insisted it had learned lessons from November\u0027s Storm Arwen, which led to widespread complaints about the way it communicated with customers who had lost power and long delays to restore supplies. Deputy First Minister John Swinney told the BBC\u0027s Good Morning Scotland radio programme yesterday that there had been \u0027a much stronger join-up between the power companies and local resilience partnerships\u0027.Meanwhile, rescuers said a hillwalker who got lost climbing 4,295ft Ben Macdui was \u0027lucky\u0027 to have been found.

The IHS MarkitCIPS Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) showed the output index rose to 54.5 in January - its highest since July 2021 - up from 53.6 in December. That’s stronger than an initial flash estimate of 53.8 released last month, indicating that the economy may have strengthened as Covid-19 cases fell back from record levels last month. The headline PMI, which measures activity across the sector, dipped to a four-month low of 57.3 in January from 57.9 in December. It was pulled down by a slowdown in new order growth, and faster deliveries from suppliers, as the strains on global supply chains eased (delays push up the PMI, as they typically show higher demand, rather than supply chain disruption). But, manufacturers did warn that raw material shortages, supplier capacity, transportation delays and difficulty in sourcing goods were still issues. Rob Dobson, Director at IHS Markit, says: Economists polled by Reuters had forecast a fall of 6,000. Daniel Terzenbach, a senior official at the Labour Office, says: The Bank of England reports that approvals for house purchases, an indicator of future borrowing, rose to above 71,000 in December, up from 67,859 in November. That’s above the average in the year before the pandemic. It’s another sign that the housing market remained solid at the turn of the year, despite the end of the stamp duty holiday and the Omicron surge. Joshua Elash, director of property lender MT Finance, explains: The BoE’s data also shows consumers borrowed an extra £831m in credit last month, including £386m more on credit cards. That’s a little lower than the £1bn increase in November, showing that Omicron didn’t put a big dent in household borrowing. Adam Hoyes, assistant economist at Capital Economic, says: Household savings slowed in December, though. Around £2.7bn was deposited in banks and building societies, and £500m into National Savings and Investment accounts - much slower than the average monthly net flow of £10.6bn in the previous year. Factories fared well in the face of the omicron variant, says Maddie Walker, Accenture’s Industry X lead in the UK: Victoria Scholar, head of investment at interactive investor, points out that export growth remains modest, despite the improvement at supply chains: But price pressures remain at “stomach-churning levels”, he adds: Factories have reported that output and employment grew at a faster rate last month, while inflation pressures became less intense.

Rob Dobson, Director at IHS Markit, says: Data firm IHS Markit reports that production, new orders and employment all grew at a faster rate, alongside encouraging signs that supply chain issues are starting to abate. Its latest survey of purchasing managers across the euro area found that: Austria (whose economy shrank in the last quarter of 2021 during Covid-19 lockdowns) had the strongest-growing manufacturing sector in January, while faster expansions were also seen in the Netherlands, Germany and Ireland. Manufacturing growth in Spain was strong and unchanged from December, while slower improvements were seen for Italy, Greece and France. Input price inflation eased to a nine-month low, meaning costs rose at a slower rate. But firms took “a more aggressive approach to price setting”, with factory gate charges rising at a faster rate -- showing that inflationary pressures are still rippling through the economy. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit said:  Annual shopping bills in the UK are set to rise by around £180 on average as inflation pushes up the cost of groceries. Prices are rising on many fronts, and the weekly shop is no exception, says Fraser McKevitt, head of retail and consumer insight, at Kantar’s Worldpanel Division. This squeeze is likely to push shoppers towards low-cost products, McKevitt adds: Last month, journalist and campaigner Jack Monroe warned that lower-cost alternatives were “stealthily being extinguished from the shelves”, hurting the poorest in society: Retail analyst Steve Dresser, the chief executive of Grocery Insight, has tweeted more key points: European stock markets have also rallied in early trading, after a weak January. Limited supply of homes on the market could support prices, though, points out Andrew Montlake, managing director of the UK-wide mortgage broker, Coreco: Here’s the full story: Irn-Bru owner AG Barr is lifting its prices as it battles rising cost pressures. In a trading update, AG Barr reports that it is facing inflationary pressures, particularly across packaging and energy linked commodities, and responding with higher prices.  AG Barr also makes the Rubicon sparkling drinks range, and Funkin cocktail mixers. Irn-Bru was a surprise hit at the Cop26 climate talks three months ago, with US congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez posting an Instagram video of herself praising the beverage. Jeremy Leaf, north London estate agent, says the market was resilient in January: Tomer Aboody, director of property lender MT Finance, says an ‘overflow’ of deals boosted the market in January: Emma Fildes of property agency Brick Weaver also sees a slowdown later this year: He points out that house price growth has outstripped earnings growth by a wide margin since the pandemic struck and, as a result, houses are less affordable: The pressures on household finances will also dampen demand:  Plus, higher interest rates could cool the markets -- if it leads to higher mortgages rates, Gardner concludes: UK house prices have begun 2022 with strong gains, as robust demand and a shortage of properties for sale continue to support the market. It’s the strongest start to the year since 2005, and takes the average house price on Nationwide’s survey to £255,556 mark. It’s the sixth consecutive monthly increase in house prices, explains Robert Gardner, Nationwide’s chief economist: Higher borrowing costs might slow the market this year, though, as the cost of living crisis also squeezes household budgets. Surveys of purchasing managers in the UK, US and eurozone will show how factories were hit by omicron, and the persistent supply chain problems, in January. European stock markets are on track to open higher, as investors look to put January behind them.  2022 has certainly been volatile, with energy stocks surging and technology notable weak: Markets are adjusting to the Federal Reserve’s phasing out of the massive stimulus provided over the last two years, says Naeem Aslam of Avatrade.

Graphic: Paul ScottThe price of a standard stamp is to increase by 15 cent next month, bringing the total cost of posting a standard letter in the country to €1.25.It is the second price increase in less than a year, after it was raised by 10 cent to €1.10 at the end of May last year.An Post said in a statement that the rise reflects sharp transport, fuel and energy cost inflation and the true cost of maintaining a nationwide postal service with steadily falling traditional letter volumes.The price of a standard stamp has tripled in the last two decades, from 41 cent in 2002 to the new cost of €1.25 – a 205 per cent increase.The change, which will come into effect on March 1st, will also see the price of sending a letter abroad rise by 20 cent to €2.20.The price of a book of 10 stamps will remain unchanged at €11 until the end of the year, An Post said, representing a saving of 15 cent per stamp.SMEs can also avail of the €1.10 stamp price through the An Post advantage card with an increased discount of 12 per cent on larger stamp packs and a 34 per cent discount on parcel postage until year-end.Existing N (national) and W (worldwide) stamps will remain valid and fully usable after the new prices come into effect.The utility’s community focus supports, such as free postage to and from nursing homes and free newspaper delivery for older customers, will be available indefinitely, An Post said, adding that “check-ins” by postal delivery staff on older, vulnerable or isolated customers are now a “standard part” of the service.An Post said despite the latest price increase, the cost of stamps in Ireland is still “well below the current average European tariffs for high-quality letter delivery services”.The average price of a comparable national stamp across the principal EU14 (plus the UK) countries is now €1.58, while the comparable worldwide tariff is €2.27, it added.At the end of May last year, An Post raised the price of a national stamp by 10 cent to €1.10, while the cost of an international stamp rose from €1.70 to €2. However, the increase was originally intended to come into effect in February 2020 but was deferred due to the Covid-19 pandemic.Inflation“International air freight prices have increased by up to 360 per cent in the pandemic transport cost inflation is running at 18 per cent and electricity, gas and fuel costs are up 27 per cent year on year,” the An Post statement said.“The new postal tariffs will help ensure the continuity of next-day national letter services based on customers paying the same price for delivery of letters nationwide regardless of distance, as well as ongoing investment in letter services, staff and infrastructure.”David McRedmond, chief executive of An Post, said the increases are essential to cover rising costs. “An Post is rebuilding the postal infrastructure for the future by developing new service and product choices to suit how we live now and how we will choose to live, work, communicate and connect in the future,” he said.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"reaction disappointment over plans to return to traditional leaving cert","story":"Changes to the hybrid model Leaving Certificate in 2022 would be ‘an extremely disappointing decision’.

It appeared to be “welded” to the old Leaving Cert which was “brutal” and needed to be reformed, he added.To date the Minister for Education Norma Foley had “always done the right thing” when it came to the Leaving Cert, but this year it appeared there had been “different voices” on education that were not “on board” with any change, he said.Mr Ó Ríordáin siad the Ombudsman for Children who had expressed concern about the mental health of children had been ignored.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"tolka river plans among last of btr schemes","story":"The Richmond Road complex would have 104 one-bedroom and 79 two-bedroom apartments.Plans for 10-storey build-to-rent scheme of 183 apartments beside the Tolka River in Drumcondra, have been presented to Dublin City Council.

But in response to a public access request by a journalist, the commission later said no record had been kept of such messages.“The narrow way in which this public access request was treated meant that no attempt was made to identify if any text messages existed,” said ombudsman Emily O’Reilly.“The ombudsman found that this amounted to maladministration,” the watchdog said in a statement, asking the commission to check again for the relevant messages and to reply to the recommendation by April 26th.“If text messages concern EU policies and decisions, they should be treated as EU documents,” the ombudsman added.A spokesman for the commission later on Friday declined to comment about whether the texts had been cancelled and whether they were exchanged with a private or a professional telephone.He told journalists the EU executive would reply to the ombudsman by the deadline and noted EU rules required the commission to register documents, with no specific requirement to store text messages as long as they were not treated as documents.The ombudsman’s recommendations are not binding, but usually trigger heightened scrutiny from the European Parliament. “The European Commission has become less transparent, less accountable to the European Parliament and frankly more unhinged from European democracy,” said liberal Dutch MEP Sophia In ‘t Veld.The deal negotiated via text messages and calls, according to what Ms Von der Leyen herself said in an interview with the New York Times, was the biggest contract ever sealed for Covid-19 vaccines, with the EU committing to buy 900 million Pfizer-BioNTech shots, with an option to buy another 900 million.When the deal was formally announced in May, the EU had already secured hundreds of millions of vaccines from several drug-makers, including another 600 million doses from Pfizer and BioNTech under two previous contracts with the two companies. – ReutersEverything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"inside","story":"Decades of progress overshadowed by Putin crackdowns and confrontation with WestRussia\u0026rsquos land of the midnight sun said to have inspired creator of Chanel No. 5Atomic icebreakers and floating power plants to help Kremlin develop Arctic shipping routeMinority nations feel squeeze as Putin\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquopower vertical\u0026rsquo crushes republics\u0026rsquo autonomyHistory of bloodshed and tragedy haunts stunning region shared by Muslims and ChristiansOil wealth and new mosque and churches help keep Tatarstan on Kremlin\u0027s sideOfficials claim West wants to \u0026lsquoGermanise\u0026rsquo and instil special identity in strategic regionNato monitors heavily armed Kaliningrad as locals long for borders to reopenAttack on renowned Memorial rights group deepens opposition anger and international alarmSaint Petersburg Letter: Russia\u0026rsquos old imperial capital celebrates 200 years since birth of Crime and Punishment creatorEnergy giant hopes vast forests will offset carbon costs and ease green transitionCircassian heritage trampled and property rows continue as Winter Olympics city boomsKremlin criticised as most Russians reject vaccination and hospitals face huge strainKremlin changes tack on global warming and looks to vast forests to offset emissionsRussia and Japan co-operate on Sakhalin despite row over nearby Kuril islandsIndustry and struggling communities fear wildlife support could stifle Far East developmentCity with echoes of San Francisco is thrillingly original, yet tarnished by graft and neglectGrowing energy, security and diplomatic links between Moscow and Beijing worry WestDecembrist rebels and their aristocratic wives embraced \u0026lsquoreal Russia\u0026rsquo in Siberian exileFears for permafrost as tusk hunters feed Chinese market starved of elephant ivoryInside Russia: Melting permafrost threatens critical infrastructure and feeds global warmingStalin\u0027s popularity growing as Kremlin focuses on Soviet triumphs, not tragediesInside Russia: Party wonders how far it cane press Putin after years in soft \u0026lsquosystemic opposition\u0026rsquo roleInside Russia: More protests planned as officials reject calls to address e-voting complaintsMoscow Letter: Poet\u0026rsquos statue has been a magnet for generations of Russian dissentersOn the eve of an expected sham election, many of Putin\u0026rsquos political opponents are already jailed or dead"},{"url":null,"title":"amnesty accuses israel of subjecting palestinians to apartheid","story":" Israeli soldiers order Palestinian vendors to close their shops in the old part of the West Bank city of Hebron on Saturday after claims that stones were hurled at Israeli settlers. Photograph: Abed al HashlamounEPAAmnesty International has accused Israel of subjecting Palestinians to a system of apartheid in a decades-long campaign that deprives them of their rights under international law and amounts to a crime against humanity. In a comprehensive report released on Tuesday, Amnesty cites Israeli, Palestinian and international rights activists, groups, organisations and testimony, providing a historical, political, economic and social overview of the explosive situation. In the report entitled Israel’s Apartheid against Palestinians: Cruel System of Domination and Crime against Humanity, Amnesty documents and analyses “Israel’s institutionalised and systematic discrimination against Palestinians” and its use of “inhuman and inhumane acts” to maintain this system which “amounts to the crime against humanity of apartheid”. It is the second international rights organisation in the last year to accuse Israel of engaging in a system of apartheid after a report by Human Rights Watch did so last April.Amnesty secretary general Agnes Callamard states: “Governments who continue to supply Israel with arms and shield it from accountability at the UN are supporting a system of apartheid, undermining the international legal order, and exacerbating the suffering of the Palestinian people. The international community must face up to the reality of Israel’s apartheid, and pursue the many avenues to justice which remain shamefully unexplored.”Amnesty says that before Israel’s creation in 1948, Palestinians comprised 70 per cent of the population and owned 90 per cent of privately owned land while Jews were 30 per cent of the population and owned 6.5 per cent. During the 1947-49 conflict, 800,000 of 1.2 million Palestinians were “displaced in what amounted to ethnic cleansing”. The 150,000 who remained were granted citizenship but were placed under military rule until 1966 and have faced dispossession, discrimination and political marginalisation. Since 1948, Amnesty says, “Israel has pursued an explicit policy of establishing and maintaining Jewish demographic hegemony and maximising its control over land to benefit Jewish Israelis while minimising the number of Palestinians and restricting their rights and obstructing their ability to challenge this dispossession.” Israel extended this policy to East Jerusalem, the West Bank and Gaza in 1967 when another 350,000 Palestinians were driven into Jordan, the report says. MethodsThe report lists means which Israel employs to achieve its objectives, including land expropriation, deportation, denial of building permits, home demolitions, movement restrictions, administrative detention and imprisonment, closure of civil society organisations, and separate legal systems for Palestinians and Israeli Jews.Palestinians, Amnesty writes, “overwhelmingly regard themselves as Palestinian and have deep and shared political, ethnic, social and cultural ties” wherever they reside while Israel “considers and treats Palestinians as an inferior non-Jewish racial group”. In its response, sent through its Dublin embassy, the Israeli government rejects “all the false allegations that appear in the report”, claiming it is “biased and based on lies spread by terrorist organisations”. Foreign minister Yair Lapid states, “Amnesty was once an esteemed and respected organisation, Today, it stands for anything BUT human rights. It’s become simply one more radical grouping of uninformed activists that echoes propaganda with no serious examination of the facts.”Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"young africans","story":"Tom Saater has a rags to riches story and a unique insight into Nigeria\u0026rsquos biggest cityIn one of the world\u0026rsquos most dangerous places to attend school, teachers lead lessons and the students comeAfrican country\u0026rsquos tech innovators call for international investment and domestic supportYoung Nigerians dance out onto world stage with pride, confidence and high ambitionWomen-led organisation aims to stop atrocities of dictatorship from reoccurringIn the Gambia, a flourishing comedy scene is used to convey serious messagesStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"anne boleyn exhibition portray feminist attempt dispel scheming","story":"Anne Boleyn’s childhood home is launching a new exhibition to shed a “feminist” light on the queen and dispel the myth of her as a “scheming” mistress.She was accused of adultery and executed for treason in 1536, and experts have argued that the charges laid against her by men five centuries ago have lumbered her with an unfair reputation as a wily seductress ever since.A new exhibition at her childhood home at Hever Castle in Kent will seek to portray her in a more “feminist” light as an educated woman who made history in her own right, and not simply a “headless queen”.Featuring a miniature portrait of Anne that has never been displayed before, the show will mark the 500th anniversary of her debut in the court of Henry VIII, and use personal possessions to offer a humanising history of her early life before her fatal marriage.Dr Owen Emmerson, the curator of the exhibition, said: “We\u0027re really trying to challenge the idea that she and her family were scheming, grasping courtiers on the rise. We’re trying to dispel these myths.“It’s very difficult to try and claim Anne herself was a feminist, the concept hadn’t been invented yet.“But there has been a move to see her life and struggles in a feminist light. She was transgressive, she did break the rules of the time, she supported education for women.”He added: “Her life is so often told backwards, starting with her execution for treason, and then seen through that lens - but her execution was a stitch-up and it doesn\u0027t tell the whole story.“She was not just the scandalous wife, but played an active part, she played her role in history, and, actually, she changed history“It’s about time that we recognise that, and not just see as this headless Queen.”Becoming Anne: Connections, Culture, Court open on 4 March - 500 years to the day she entered English court life - and will use contemporary portraits and letters written at the time to explain her family’s rise from country gentry to royalty.Miniature portraits of Anne and the political players active during the 16th century, including Anne’s uncle Thomas Howard and King Francis I of France, will go on display alongside a recreation of the dress she wore to her first pageant at the English court in 1522.More from NewsSue Gray latest: \u0026#39Not clear\u0026#39 if anything more will be added to report, says Dominic RaabUkraine crisis latest: Boris Johnson to fly to Kyiv as he fails to reschedule Putin callChinese New Year 2022: Everything you need to know about the Year of the Tigerpolitan Police officers \u0026#39joked about raping wives and black babies dying\u0026#39, watchdog findsDominic Raab \u0026#39cannot substantiate\u0026#39 Boris Johnson\u0026#39s claim that Keir Starmer failed to prosecute Jimmy SavileThe last thing Ukraine needs on eve of war is ally Boris Johnson distracted by a sordid scandalMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"female banker shouted male colleagues catchphrase not now stacey","story":"A female banker who was shouted down by male colleagues with the catchphrase “not now Stacey” has won more than £2 million in compensation for sexual discrimination. Stacey Macken sued French bank BNP Paribas after being belittled by her boss, who used the phrase so often that colleagues copied it.The finance specialist, who earned £120,000 a year, claimed that over a four-year period, she received hundreds of thousands of pounds less than her male peers in salary and bonuses, adding that once she complained, managers targeted her with unfair treatment. Now, Miss Macken has won £2,081,449 in one of the largest awards ever made by a British tribunal.The London Central tribunal heard Miss Macken, 50, was hired by BNP Paribas in 2013. Unbeknown to her, a male recruit hired with the same job title and responsibilities was being paid £160,000.Within months of joining, she claimed that she was exposed to sexist behaviour involving one of her bosses in the prime brokerage team, Matt Pinnock. Georgina Chapman, his former PA, told a tribunal that a “large Halloween-style black witch’s hat” was left on Miss Macken’s desk after some of the team, including Mr Pinnock, had gone to the pub towards the end of the day. Ms Chapman said “they were visibly drunk” when they returned to the office that evening.The next morning, upon discovering the hat, Miss Macken asked Ms Chapman if she knew who had put it there.“I told her that I did not know, but I suspected it was one of the drunk team members, because they were the only people in that area of the office the evening before, which, combined with their drunkenness, made them most likely to have done it,” Ms Chapman said. “Stacey was visibly upset and confided in me that she felt really uncomfortable working with those male colleagues, knowing that one of them had purposefully gone out of their way to leave a witch’s hat on her desk.”Denis Pihan, another boss, was accused of routinely demeaning her by replying “not now, Stacey” when she tried to talk to him. Miss Macken made repeated internal complaints about her treatment, in particular relating to her pay and bonuses.Eventually, she took the bank to a tribunal, claiming more than £4 million in compensation and back pay.The tribunal heard that in her first four years, her male peer was paid more than £167,000 in bonuses compared to the £33,000 she received. The bank claimed it had hired her as a junior and that her male colleague deserved his higher salary because he was her senior.Miss Macken, from Fulham, south-west London, was successful in her claims of sex discrimination, victimisation, and unequal pay.The tribunal ruled that leaving a witch’s hat on her desk was an “inherently sexist act” and the regular use of “not now, Stacey” was branded a “demeaning comment”.At Miss Macken’s compensation hearing, Emma Burns, the employment judge, said that “Mr Pinnock and Mr Pihan behaved spitefully and vindictively” because she had raised concerns about her pay, and that they had a “discriminatory motive”.Mr Pihan “apologised for causing distress” at the tribunal, but “did not acknowledge that he personally discriminated against Miss Macken, nor did he apologise for discriminating against her”. The bank claimed it has now adopted a “detailed Gender Strategy and Gender Action Plan” in response to its poor gender pay gap and is “trying to increase the number of women at senior management level”.Miss Macken’s claims of harassment were dismissed and she lost a claim for damages over the “stigma” she suffered in this case. As part of her £2 million compensation fee, she received £51,400 to cover “pain and suffering” caused, £35,000 to cover injury to feelings, and £15,000 in “aggravated damages”. “We are pleased that the Tribunal recognised the seriousness with which we have taken its findings and the major steps forward we have made to try to ensure that nothing like this happens again.”More from NewsSue Gray latest: \u0026#39Not clear\u0026#39 if anything more will be added to report, says Dominic RaabUkraine crisis latest: Boris Johnson to fly to Kyiv as he fails to reschedule Putin callChinese New Year 2022: Everything you need to know about the Year of the Tigerpolitan Police officers \u0026#39joked about raping wives and black babies dying\u0026#39, watchdog findsDominic Raab \u0026#39cannot substantiate\u0026#39 Boris Johnson\u0026#39s claim that Keir Starmer failed to prosecute Jimmy SavileThe last thing Ukraine needs on eve of war is ally Boris Johnson distracted by a sordid scandalMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"justin trudeaus woke agenda tearing canadian society apart","story":"After three generations of an official culture of political correctness in education and the media, Canada has become a strongly Left-leaning society. Six in 10 voters support the culturally Leftist Liberals and New Democratic Party (NDP) while 4 in 10 back the Tories or populist People’s Party of Canada (PPC). In many other western societies, such as Britain, the balance is far closer to 50-50.This gives Trudeau’s Liberals an incentive to tack to the woke Left on cultural issues to attract votes from the NDP while adopting a market-friendly economic approach to soothe business interests. When reports – which turned out to be false – of mass graves of indigenous schoolchildren surfaced, and Left-wing activists burned 30 churches in response, Trudeau called the actions “understandable” and did little to stop this attack on Catholic communities.Though their cause has only modest support, the truckers have tapped into the alienation of culturally conservative working-class Canadians from Trudeau and the cultural elite. As if on cue, the Canadian media has tried to portray the protest as racist, focusing on the extremists on its fringes. Trudeau has, without evidence, described anti-vaxxers as racist and misogynist while NDP leader Jagmeet Singh smeared the convoy as led by “those that claim the superiority of the white bloodline and equate Islam to a disease,” a complete fantasy.More from NewsSue Gray latest: \u0026#39Not clear\u0026#39 if anything more will be added to report, says Dominic RaabUkraine crisis latest: Boris Johnson to fly to Kyiv as he fails to reschedule Putin callChinese New Year 2022: Everything you need to know about the Year of the Tigerpolitan Police officers \u0026#39joked about raping wives and black babies dying\u0026#39, watchdog findsDominic Raab \u0026#39cannot substantiate\u0026#39 Boris Johnson\u0026#39s claim that Keir Starmer failed to prosecute Jimmy SavileThe last thing Ukraine needs on eve of war is ally Boris Johnson distracted by a sordid scandalMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"see men objects","story":"Do you see presidents in peppers, houses that look like Hitler and the son of God in your sourdough? You’ve probably got face pareidolia – a scientific phenomenon in which illusory features appear in inanimate objects. According to new research, the brain is more likely to spot young male faces in objects than the physiognomy of older women – but is that down to social conditioning, hardwiring, or are our eyes not-so-secretly sexist?Susan Wardle, research fellow at the Laboratory of Brain and Cognition at the National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, and the paper’s lead author, charted the responses of almost 4,000 people to everyday objects and found that illusory faces in inanimate objects are readily perceived to have a specific emotional expression, age, and gender. Participants were asked to state whether each item had a gender – and male faces were found four times as often as female ones. ‘This male bias could not be explained by pre-existing semantic or visual gender associations with the objects, or by visual features in the images,’ the paper found. ‘Cognitive bias’ was definitely at play, they added, but they are yet to discern how this occurs. One theory is that we more often see chaps in our chips as a result of ‘threat perception’ – where, historically speaking, assuming that a quickly-glimpsed face is male and a threat functions as a defence mechanism, alerting the viewer to the possibility of conflict. Then, there is the case that humans were exposed to more male faces during the earliest stages of development, further upping our likelihood of seeing them in lieu of female ones. ‘The origin of the bias – whether from social conditioning or from perceptual factors such as our visual diet of faces during development – remains an open question,’ according to researchers.Emotions were also frequently attached to the images participants were shown – leading to judgments of potatoes as listless, and handbags as sad. Dabblers in internet culture will know that finding faces in everyday objects – which research previously assumed was an early sign of psychosis – is nowadays grounds for going viral, with a smattering of social media accounts dedicated to sharing the best (one of which had several hundreds of thousands of followers until being suspended). From screaming plug sockets to sleepy pies, angry car bumpers and doleful bath taps, even the most vague approximation of facial features in unlikely places is enough to send online users into a tailspin. Primates do it too (though are probably less inclined to share their finds on the internet) a 2017 study found that animals such as the rhesus monkey experienced face pareidolia, poring over photos of illusory faces far longer than those without. “Face recognition is very important,” says Professor David Alais, psychology professor at the University of Sydney, adding that they are “detected incredibly fast. The brain seems to do this… using a kind of template-matching procedure, so if it sees an object that appears to have two eyes above a nose above a mouth, then it goes, ‘Oh, I’m seeing a face.’There seem to be certain faces we see more often – including that of Richard Nixon, whose resemblance to a range of vegetables, from peppers to aubergines, has proven catnip for the armchair pareidoliac. Jesus also has (typically food-based) form, showing up on toast and in the dregs of Marmite jars in crisps and banana skins, pancakes and potatoes. Elvis Presley is another common spot, making his presence known via cloud formations and ketchup-covered chips. Distinct features – such as pronounced jaws, a la the King and Nixon, or the messiah’s flowing locks - could be why certain faces seem to appear so frequently, though researchers have yet to investigate.As elsewhere in life (albeit a touch less importantly here) women are less likely to take centre stage. That’s not to say they’re completely absent from the ardent face pareidoliac’s findings, however: Whoopi Goldberg’s resemblance to a red onion has been documented, ditto an approximation of Mother Theresa and fellow nuns in cinnamon buns one jelly bean resembling the Duchess of Cambridge was listed on eBay at a starting bid of £596, while a toasted cheese sandwich ‘depicting’ the Virgin Mary sold on the same site for over £20,000. It’s a lot of dough for what was, at the point of purchase, a decade-old lunch – but the internet casino that bought it remained confident that this integral “part of pop culture” was worthy of the sum, and a subsequent world tour. Manna(chego) from heaven, perhaps, or plain madness more like.Still, there are more upsides to conjuring facial features where they may not be than not seeing them at all, Prof Alais suggests. “From an evolutionary perspective, it seems that the benefit of never missing a face far outweighs the errors where inanimate objects are seen as faces… when objects look compellingly face-like, it is more than an interpretation: they really are driving your brain’s face detection network.” Calculating the expressions of those faces is key, he adds, to determining whether “they are a friend or a foe.” Seeing the Cookie Monster in a loo-roll-hauling lorry or Donald Trump in a butter tub is central to survival: you heard it here first.More from NewsSue Gray latest: \u0026#39Not clear\u0026#39 if anything more will be added to report, says Dominic RaabUkraine crisis latest: Boris Johnson to fly to Kyiv as he fails to reschedule Putin callChinese New Year 2022: Everything you need to know about the Year of the Tigerpolitan Police officers \u0026#39joked about raping wives and black babies dying\u0026#39, watchdog findsDominic Raab \u0026#39cannot substantiate\u0026#39 Boris Johnson\u0026#39s claim that Keir Starmer failed to prosecute Jimmy SavileThe last thing Ukraine needs on eve of war is ally Boris Johnson distracted by a sordid scandalMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"tiktok phenomenon sees book sales skyrocket","story":"The rise of “BookTok” is driving teenagers and young adults into bookshops in numbers not seen since the Harry Potter years, according to the head of Waterstones.Sales of new books are booming after being recommended by influencers on TikTok, the social media app - but some classics are also becoming unlikely viral sensations.“These last three or four weeks in the United States, James Joyce’s Ulysses has been a significant seller because on TikTok the kids are getting excited about it,” said James Daunt, managing director of Waterstones and chief executive of the US chain Barnes \u0026amp Noble.The #BookTok hashtag has had 37.4 billion views and popular influencers tend to be young women, mostly recommending books by female authors.Mr Daunt said they were helping to make bookshops popular with young people, reminding him of the decade from 1997-2007 which saw publication of JK Rowling’s Harry Potter series.“It is back to that kind of energy in our stores. Our challenge now is that we absolutely have to keep those customers, as we did with the Harry Potter generation. It stepped booksellers up and it stepped book sales up,” Mr Daunt told a bookselling conference in Italy, reported in The Bookseller.Waterstones runs its own TikTok account as a marketing tool and Mr Daunt explained: “It’s about fun and enjoyment and enthusiasm and the people who do it brilliantly are of the same generation - it’s our young booksellers and we let them get on with it.”He joked: “We have generally found that the people with blue hair do better than the people with sensible haircuts.”Barnes \u0026amp Noble has dedicated a section of its website to books recommended on TikTok. Even WH Smith groups some of its books under the tag “TikTok made me buy it!”Books that have benefited from the TikTok effect include The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo by Taylor Jenkins Read, It Ends With Us by Colleen Hoover and The Song of Achilles by Madeline Miller.Hoover’s book sold 21,000 copies on its release in 2016, but sales were reignited at the end of 2020 when TikTokers began posting about it. By summer 2021, according to Publishers Weekly, it had sold 450,000 copies.Sally Rooney’s Normal People and the Hanya Yanagihara novel A Little Life are also frequently recommended. The Barnes \u0026amp Noble list features classic titles The Great Gatsby, Pride and Prejudice and Wuthering Heights.The New York Times reported on the phenomenon with the headline “How Crying on TikTok Sells Books”, noting that tear-jerking novels were particularly popular. One of the most popular British “BookTok” stars is 22-year-old Abby Parker, who has amassed 428,000 followers.Often, Parker’s videos consist of her brandishing a book while a caption runs on screen and a soundtrack plays over it. Her recommendation for The Secret History, Donna Tartt’s 1992 bestseller, said simply: “No because never has an opening line hooked me faster. I’ve never been so excited to start a book.”Parker told Amazon last year: “I’ve always dreamed of sharing my love for books with the world and TikTok has finally been my gateway into doing just that. Getting completely involved with the book community this past year has been truly one of the greatest things I’ve ever done in my life.”The popularity of Ulysses, which many readers find to be impenetrable, is more difficult to explain. However, several TikTokers have introduced Joyce and his novels to a wider audience by discussing the racy letters he wrote to his wife, Nora.Joyce features in a video by Esme Louise James, an Australian PhD candidate who runs an irreverent account called Kinky History.More from NewsUkraine crisis latest: Boris Johnson to fly to Kyiv as he fails to reschedule Putin callSue Gray latest: \u0026#39Not clear\u0026#39 if anything more will be added to report, says Dominic RaabChinese New Year 2022: Everything you need to know about the Year of the Tigerpolitan Police officers \u0026#39joked about raping wives and black babies dying\u0026#39, watchdog findsDominic Raab \u0026#39cannot substantiate\u0026#39 Boris Johnson\u0026#39s claim that Keir Starmer failed to prosecute Jimmy SavileThe last thing Ukraine needs on eve of war is ally Boris Johnson distracted by a sordid scandalMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"covid became free speech nightmare","story":"When a comedian promises to try harder after an ageing musician complains about their work, it’s rarely – if ever – headline news. Joe Rogan’s mournful Instagram video pledge to “try harder to get people with differing opinions on” his podcast after his “absolutely I get things wrong” mea culpa is possibly unique in the history of popular culture perhaps marking the moment we’ve passed through the looking glass on free speech and Covid.If that wasn’t thorny enough on its own, it comes as questions are being asked about how sensible an approach the BBC will take towards this week’s episode of Question Time, which will feature unvaccinated people in the audience, and as MPs are investigating the tactics of the government’s Nudge Unit after psychologists have questioned its “deploying fear, shame and scapegoating during the pandemic”.It is very difficult to know where to draw the line in discussions about disinformation and official information. If we were to say that all disinformation should be banned from major media sites, who decides? The World Health Organisation? Inidual governments? “It’s very problematic,” explains Martin Bright at Index on Censorship. “The musicians involved are perfectly within their rights to protest – where I become uncomfortable is when an ultimatum is set, forcing Spotify to choose between Joe Rogan and these musicians. As an open society we should, wherever possible, allow even the most uncomfortable debates to happen in as big a public arena as possible.”Since the start of the pandemic, however, there has been a surprising orthodoxy around the right thing to do, spearheaded in the UK by the likes of former Sage guru Neil Ferguson, and UK Health Security Agency chief executive Jenny Harries. Science has never been about unshakeable consensus – scientific theories are called theories for a reason. They are our best guess under the circumstances, but they could prove incorrect should further evidence emerge. The half life of Covid facts – the amount of time it takes before the majority of the knowledge we have is proved false – is uncertain, but from lockdown to masks and vaccines, credible dissenters have found themselves denied access to the airwaves and faced being smeared by the Twitter pundit and mainstream broadcaster alike.Oxford University professor Sunetra Gupta, who is so pro-vax that she’s part of a team that patented a new influenza vaccine a few months ago, knows this better than most. She fell foul of this orthodoxy as one of the primary authors of October 2020’s Great Barrington Declaration, which argued that protecting the vulnerable should replace a strategy of national lockdowns.“There is no moral imperative for consensus,” she says. “It is difficult to dismiss our viewpoint as being outrageous. Lockdowns and non-pharmacological interventions had huge uncertainty – we didn’t know what they would do to the spread of pandemic, but we did know they would cause economic harm to the poor and the young. Since then, the mainstream media and scientific journals have been actively engaged in publishing defamatory articles, saying we’d been bankrolled by the Koch brothers, and refusing us a right of reply. We are not on the BBC whilst the Zero Covid proponents are.”This response, Gupta found, meant that adherents to the wilder Covid theories – those who blame 5G, argue it was a Chinese Communist Party plot, that it was a scheme hatched by George Soros and Bill Gates to defeat Donald Trump, that it’s a Big Pharma plot and that, in fact, it doesn’t exist – ended up pushed into the same camp as an experienced epidemiologist like her. As a result, she found scientists who agreed with her research choosing to remain silent or even asking for their names to be taken off research papers.“It’s sad that we’ve ended up in coalition with some strange bedfellows,” she says. “I think that’s because we’ve lost the ability, as a civilised society, to accept that there is more than just a yesno answer to every question. In 1991 I was part of a team that published a paper on anti retrovirals urging caution – and the general climate was one of tolerance and different opinions being permitted. Today that is no longer the case.”Part of the problem, according to Dr Clare Birchall at King’s College London, who is researching Covid conspiracy theories, is that the general state of polarised debate means contrary views in any public debate are instantly politicised.“Lockdowns have created a coalition of distrust, drawing people together who would not normally share the same protest space,” she explains. “This means that views ranging from mild libertarianism to hardcore conspiracy theories become entwined and hard to disentangle.”Even as evidence for mask use has ided scientific communities, most nations opted to err on the side of caution – so although papers from as far back as 1997 show face masks are poor protectors against influenza, and a 2006 pandemic preparedness plan from the Canadian government did not recommend healthy iniduals use face masks, it has been hard to hear these positions argued in the mainstream media. Ferguson himself has admitted his doomsday predictions had been ‘oversimplified’ and “wrong” but lockdown fans – a curious concept – have not sought de-platforming.“Covid has put a huge strain on our instinct for free speech in this country,” Bright agrees. “Joe Rogan is prepared to have all sorts of conspiracy theorists on his programme – that’s part of his appeal. If you have someone who believes in UFOs or a flat earth, these discussions are harmless. Discussions about an international pandemic are of a different order. It is important to find ways of challenging inaccurate information in the public arena rather than closing all debate down.”As useful illustration of how this can backfire is known as the Streisand effect after the singer’s attempts in 2003 to get a photograph of her house removed from the California Costal Records Project saw downloads jump from six (including two by her lawyers) to 420,000.Some scholars argue that de-platforming doesn’t work, says Birchall “because it directs speakers towards unmoderated alternative online spaces or even private encrypted spaces. Many people say it’s better to have the conversation in the open to balance the risk to public health with the risk to public safety. Equally, we might think there is a problem with handing decisions about free speech to private companies like Facebook.”However deplatforming does, she adds, make it much harder for “conspiracy grifters like Alex Jones to make a living,” referencing the Infowars presenters huckstering of products like “Nano Silver toothpaste” and a “Superblue Silver Immune Gargle” as treatments for Covid.Certainly the gap in the mainstream media has allowed Rogan’s interviews to acquire an importance they don’t deserve – and has allowed celebrities like Russell Brand to take strong positions on the debates in his YouTube show.Rogan is emerging as a voice of reason in this debate – possibly prompted by Spotify’s cratering share price. “I will do my best to try to balance out these more controversial viewpoints with other people’s perspectives so we can maybe find a better point of view,” his statement concluded.Bright believes that the long term picture is positive. “Covid has put a huge strain on our instinct for free speech in this country,” he says. “Because of the pluralism of our media you will find people who are sceptical in some media outlets and other media filled with people signed up to the government’s line. When we look back overall I think we will see that, despite the strains, the discussion of Covid lockdown has been for the most part an open and vibrant debate.”He cites discussions on the BBC about whether locking down students was the right way to proceed - as opposed to putting a ring of security around old people per the Barrington Declaration. In the maelstrom of Covid coverage, however, the brutal treatment of dissent on social media platforms suggests Twitter mobs still have the power to drive, for instance, Gupta away from the platform.Bright acknowledges the tensions but argues things haven’t reached the level of the trans debate or arguments about war crimes in Syria. Then he pauses thoughtfully and adds “I’m not sure if you should quote me but I think we’ve come through this.”More from NewsUkraine crisis latest: Boris Johnson to fly to Kyiv as he fails to reschedule Putin callChinese New Year 2022: Everything you need to know about the Year of the TigerSue Gray latest: \u0026#39Not clear\u0026#39 if anything more will be added to report, says Dominic Raabpolitan Police officers \u0026#39joked about raping wives and black babies dying\u0026#39, watchdog findsDominic Raab \u0026#39cannot substantiate\u0026#39 Boris Johnson\u0026#39s claim that Keir Starmer failed to prosecute Jimmy SavileThe last thing Ukraine needs on eve of war is ally Boris Johnson distracted by a sordid scandalMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"judge requests prince andrews former assistant testify civil","story":"The Judge presiding over the civil suit brought against the Duke of York has requested that the Prince’s former assistant, Robert Olney, give evidence.Prince Andrew is being sued by Virginia Giuffre, claiming she was trafficked by Jeffrey Epstein to have sex with the Duke when she was 17 years old. The Duke of York denies all the allegations against him.Judge Lewis A Kaplan has written to the Senior Master of the Queen\u0027s Bench Division in an effort to get Mr Olney to testify regarding communication between Prince Andrew and Jeffrey Epsiten, Ghislaine Maxwell and Ms Giuffre as well as his travel to Epstein’s various properties.Last month, Ms Giuffre’s lawyers had requested Mr Olney’s testimony as well as one potential witness based in Britain.Judge Kaplan also wrote to the High Court requesting to hear the testimony of Shukri Walker, a UK based woman who claims to have seen the Duke and Ms Giuffre in Tramp nightclub in London in March 2001.Ms Giuffre’s husband Robert and her psychologist Dr Judith Lightfoot have also been asked to provide testimony.For his part, Mr Giuffre will be asked to discuss how he met his wife, any childhood trauma suffered, her relationship with Epstein and Maxwell as well as any occasions on which she mentioned the Duke of York.Dr Lightfoot will be asked to discuss any medical interactions she has had with Ms Giuffre as well as the theory of false memory.All four witnesses have been asked to finish giving testimony by April 29.More from NewsUkraine crisis latest: Boris Johnson to fly to Kyiv as he fails to reschedule Putin callChinese New Year 2022: Everything you need to know about the Year of the TigerSue Gray latest: \u0026#39Not clear\u0026#39 if anything more will be added to report, says Dominic Raabpolitan Police officers \u0026#39joked about raping wives and black babies dying\u0026#39, watchdog findsDominic Raab \u0026#39cannot substantiate\u0026#39 Boris Johnson\u0026#39s claim that Keir Starmer failed to prosecute Jimmy SavileThe last thing Ukraine needs on eve of war is ally Boris Johnson distracted by a sordid scandalMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"16 parties investigated sue gray","story":"All  parties investigated by Sue Gray - including  probed by policeSenior civil servant Sue Gray found failures of leadership and judgement over the Downing Street lockdown parties, including one allegedly held just hours before the Queen buried Prince Philip aloneBoris Johnson is under pressure after Sue Gray found failures of leadership and judgement over the parties Image: AFP via Getty ImagesByMatthew DreschNews Reporter:,  Jan |commentsSue Grayaposs report investigated  Downing Street parties, including  being probed by police.

Ludicrously seeking to pin blame for Jimmy Savile on Keir Starmer, the Labour leader’s devastating takedown of Johnson clearly stinging, should’ve had doctors in white coats shepherding the PM to safety.  Johnson undoubtedly lost friends and alienated people yet the great unknown remains how many mutineers will add their signatures to the estimated  or  Conservative MPs already demanding a ballot to oust the PM. The magic number is  to trigger a contest then  to guarantee Johnson’s head on a silver platter to end the Partygate nightmare. Damning evidence in civil servant Sue Gray’s censored report is merely the end of the beginning rather than the beginning of the end in a totemic scandal displaying why Johnson’s unfit for high office.  With the cops criminally investigating him, studying more than  photographs and  pieces of paper linked to a dirty dozen potentially illegal parties, including one in the Downing Street flat and another with a birthday cake plus a pair featuring a DJ and suitcase of booze on the eve of the Duke of Edinburgh’s funeral, it’s going to get worse, not better. Johnson initially refusing a past pledge to guarantee eventual publication of Gray’s full report smacks of panic. Tory grandees Theresa May and Andrew Mitchell put the boot in viciously. Apologists defended the indefensible. The silent, brooding majority will determine Johnson’s fate.

This blows apart Downing Street’s original defence there were no parties and the guidance was followed at all times.  Gray reveals the police are investigating  of these parties including a gathering in the Prime Minister’s private flat on November ,  and the Birthday Party for Mr Johnson on June , . This leaves open the possibility his we Carrie could be dragged into the police investigation. Johnson is also accused of misleading Parliament after he denied in the Commons on December  last year that a party had taken place on November  .  Here is what  Sue Gray said in her report… and what it really means: What the Gray report said:“We carried out interviews of over  iniduals, some more than once, and examined relevant documentary and digital information, such as emails Whatsapp messages text messages photographs and building entry and exit logs. This has also included searches of official records.” What it means:All of this information has been handed to the police who are investigating whether the parties broke lockdown rules. Scotland Yard today said it had been given more than  photos as part of the evidence compiled by Gray. If any of the pictures feature Johnson it could prove he was partying while the rest of the country was told to follow lockdown rules. Evenhe is cleared by the police, these images could see him damned in the court of public opinion.  What the Gray report said: “It is not for me to make a judgment on whether the criminal law has been broken that is properly a matter for law enforcement.” She later writes that because of the police investigation: “I have not made comment on whether inidual gatherings were in line with the relevant guidance and regulations in place at the time.”What it means:These were the only lines that proved helpful to Johnson. In his Commons statement, he hid behind these words to claim Gray had not reached a definitive conclusion and to urge MPs to wait until the police investigation. The Prime Minister is trying to buy time in the hope that public anger will have subsided when the police conclude their inquiries.  What the Gray report said: “The hardship under which citizens across the country worked, lived and sadly even died while observing the Government’s regulations and guidance rigorously are known only too well. Those challenges, however, also applied to key and frontline workers across the country who were working under equally,not more, demanding conditions, often at risk to their own health.”What it means:This blows apart the defence used by No  and some Tory MPs to excuse the parties. They had tried to claim that Downing Street was a unique building and its layout meant that work and downtime often collided. Supportive MPs said that staff and officials deserved a chance to unwind after working so hard during the pandemic. Gray does not buy this excuse. What the Gray report said: “Against the backdrop of the pandemic, when the Government was asking citizens to accept far-reaching restrictions on their lives, some of the behaviour surrounding these gatherings is dficult to justy. “At least some of the gatherings in question represent a serious failure to observe not just the high standards expected of those working at the heart of Government but also of the standards expected of the entire British population at the time.What it means:This is as close as Gray gets to delivering a guilty verdict. The “serious” failure to “observe high standards” suggests that Covid rules were broken by the occupants of No  and there was no justication for what took place. Her comments demolish Downing Street’s claim that the guidance was followed at all times.  What the Gray report said: “At times it seems there was too little thought given to what was happening across the country in considering the appropriateness of some of these gatherings, the risks they presented to public health and how they might appear to the public. “There were failures of leadership and judgment by dferent parts of No  and the Cabinet Office at dferent times. Some of the events should not have been allowed to take place. Other events should not have been allowed to develop as they did.”What it means:This is the most damning part of the report. The criticism of the failure of leadership is a direct rebuke of Johnson. The fact that Gray concludes the events should not have been allowed to take place suggests they were against the law. The line “events should not have been allowed to develop as they did” reads like an admonishment of Johnson for failing to stop the parties and undermines his claim that nobody had told him the “bring you own booze” party might have been against the rules. What the Gray report said: “As a result of the politan Police’s investigations, and so as not to prejudice the police investigative process, they have told me that it would only be appropriate to make minimal reference to the gatherings on the dates they are investigating. “Unfortunately, this necessarily means that I am extremely limited in what I can say about those events and it is not possible at present to provide a meaningful report setting out and analysing the extensive factual information I have been able to gather.”What it means:Gray reveals she has uncovered far more than she is able to publish. As a result we do not know the names of the iniduals who attended the parties or whether they included the Prime Minister and people from outside Downing Street. We also don’t knowher final report will include photos and internal emails and WhatsApp messages. Johnson initially refused to commit to publishing the full Gray report once the police have finished their inquiries only to backtrack later. There will be a reason why he was so reluctant for the truth to come out.  What the Gray report said: “The excessive consumption of alcohol is not appropriate in a professional workplace at any time. “Steps must be taken to ensure that every Government Department has a clear and robust policy in place covering the consumption of alcohol in the workplace.”What it means:Johnson has repeatedly claimed that he and No  staff were doing everything the could to help the country through the pandemic. Gray shows how that during this crucial time there was a drinking culture in Downing Street that had clearly got out of hand. Her comments again point to Johnson’s chaotic and free-wheeling approach to the job.  What the Gray report said: “Some staff wanted to raise concerns about behaviours they witnessed at work but at times felt unable to do so. “No member of staff should feel unable to report or challenge poor conduct where they witness it. There should be easier ways for staff to raise such concerns informally, outside of the line management chain.”What it means:Gray alludes to the fact that some people in No  did realise that the partying was inappropriate and possibly against the law. Her words suggest that they were too scared to speak up because of an intimidatory culture in No . This is will be seen as poor reflection of Johnson’s management at a time when he has been accused by a Tory MP of using ‘blackmail’ to get people to do his bidding.

Here are the answers to the main questions you might have after todays revelationsBoris Johnson delivering a statement in the House of Commons today Image: PAByRachel WearmouthSenior Political Correspondent:,  Jan |comments Boris Johnson has been branded unfit for office after top civil servant Sue Gray said several Downing Street lockdown parties should not have been allowed.Her nine-page interim update said at least some of the gatherings were a serious failure to observe not just the high standards expected of those working at the heart of Government, but also of the standards expected of the entire British population at the time. Here are the main questions - and answers - you may have after today. How damaging was the Sue Gray report for Boris Johnson That Boris Johnson is now fighting for his political le is now beyond doubt.Senior civil servant Sue Gray pulled no punches, concluding there were failures of leadership and judgment in No and excessive consumption of alcohol that was not appropriate in a professional workplace.The sheer number of rule-breaking parties cops are now investigating - in total - across the -month period also underlined the scale of rule-breaking which was taking place behind closed doors.  Ms Gray warned excessive consumption of alcohol is not appropriate in a professional workplace, that Downing Street felt unable to blow the whistle and how key workers across the country were following the rules while working under equally,not more, demanding conditions that Downing Street staff. Labour leader Keir Starmer described the Prime Minister in the Commons as a man without shame.How has Boris Johnson responded to the report  The Prime Minister issued another grovelling apology and told MPs “I get it and I will fix it”. Itaposs no use saying this or that was within the rules and itaposs no use saying people were working hard, he said. This pandemic was hard for everyone.  He announced a shake-up of the No operation, with a new aposOffice for the Prime Ministerapos to be created with its own private secretary. The government will also review the civil service and special adviser codes of conduct - but not ministersapos. The PM will also be clinging to the hope that the public will move on to other issues, such as the Ukraine crisis and the governmentaposs hastily-pulled-together White Paper for levelling up. How did Tories react The level of anger on the Conservative Party benches was clear to see. Former Prime Minister Theresa May led criticism, saying the report made clear rules were not obeyed in Downing Street, saying: So either my right honourable friend had not read the rules or didnapost understand what they meant and others around him, or they didnapost think the rules applied to Number . Which was it Meanwhile, former minister Andrew Mitchell told the PM he could no longer support him and Aaron Bell, an MP from the  intake, said he had attended his grandmotheraposs funeral during the first lockdown but could not hug his parents.Does the prime minister think Iaposm a fool , he asked.Is Boris Johnson now safe  It remains up to Conservative MPs as to whether Boris Johnson continues as Prime Minister. Under Tory Party rules, % of MPsmust send a letter saying they have no confidence in the PM to trigger a vote. Mr Johnson needs % to win .  It is not clear whether Tories are angry enough to move against their embattled leader. Despite rivals Rishi Sunak, Liz Truss and Tom Tugendhat making clear they fancy a tilt at the top job, there is no frontrunner yet. Some MPs may also be biding their time and hoping the PM can absorb responsibility for the May local elections, whichpolls are correct,will be devastating for the party.Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON politan PoliceConservative PartyLiz TrussTheresa MayBoris JohnsonAndrew MitchellPoliticsDaily MirrorCoronavirusSue Gray\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Perhaps it will be released as an opera, so it will cost £ for a ticket to see it. Then we’ll see a chorus of tenors singing “why do you leave us, do not forsake us ” Then the sopranos will reply “We go to Waitrose, to fetch more wine,” in red chfon dresses. Then a booming bass roars cheekily “It’s a workplace meeting”, all in Italian. It’s possible the report has become more complicated because it turns out Prince Andrew was at one of the parties.  Or maybe she can’t finish it because there was a -piece swing band playing in the No bathroom throughout lockdown, and  people re-enacting the Battle of El Alamein in the kitchen, so she has to interview all of them. But now the Met Police have been kind enough to make her job simpler. Because they insist her investigation should leave out anything about the parties. And an investigation is always easieryou don’t have to include anything that you were investigating. To keep the police and the Government happy, her report should go: “On Tuesday it was quite sunny. The end.” Then she can pad it out with  pages of dot-to-dot puzzles and a nice picture of farmyard animals, with suggestions for how to colour them in. The police can make their own lives simpler by applying the same rules to themselves. When they investigate a robbery, they can leave out everything about the robbery from their investigation and they’ll be able to complete their task much more quickly. When the police announced they were investigating the parties, we were told this meant the report might be delayed for several more weeks. That would be convenient. Maybe they’ll keep this going. So next time the report’s about to appear, it will be announced that the Vatican are investigating the parties to see whether they constituted a mortal sin. So the report can’t be published until there’s a pronouncement from the Pope. In any case, the Government’s supporters now say the whole business of parties against the rules is “trivia”. Why are we bothering with wine and cakes, when there’s inflation and a might-be-a-war with Russia   This would make sense,when Johnson was reading out the rules every single day for several months, he’d said: “But don’t bother sticking to any of this. “You can do whatever you like, I’d invite your mates round and spend all day naked mud-wrestlingI was you. Remember – Hands – Face – Cake – Bottle – Conga.” But they insisted we absolutely had to stay alone, while they did the opposite. Andyou were cynical, you might suspect thatthey lie so blatantly about that, maybe it’s possible that they lie about everything  as well.

And Nicoles doing everything in her power to make sure she succeedsNicole and Penny have an incredibly close bond Image: Nicole GoldByJessica TaylorReal Le Features Writer:,  Feb Updated:,  Feb |commentsNicole Gold knew her daughter Penny was destined for fame when she was just a toddler - slipping into her mum’s high heels and tottering around. “From the time she could toddle she was in my shoes,” Nicole, , told The Mirror. “She was picking up my microphones too.” Nicole, who records her own music and performs at festivals, had grand plans for her daughter from birth - getting Penny a baby acting agent at the age of three months old. “She did a Fairy commercial and a couple of campaigns and photoshoots when she was really young,” Nicole, from Colchester, Essex, explained. Surrounded by the commotion of a TV crew and set, Penny barely batted an eyelid - signalling she was meant to be in front of a camera. Reflecting on her own childhood, musical Nicole, from Colchester, Essex, regrets that she didn’t go to stage school at a young age - waiting until she was older to put herself through a performing arts course. “I’d have loved itmy parents had pushed me into stage school. It would have been a lot easier to get into it,” she said. So when the mum-of-one fell pregnant, she decided she was going to push her daughter into singing, acting and dancing to take up the opportunities she felt she missed out on as a kid.  Penny, now six, takes on around  hours of activities every week that will prepare her for a career in showbiz - meaning dedicated mum Nicole spends her week ferrying her daughter to and from classes. “It’s a juggling act,” Nicole said. “But I’m training her for what she wants to do.” Penny’s jam-packed week begins with gymnastics on Monday, followed by Latin Ballroom lessons on Tuesday, circus school on Wednesday, and performing arts and musical theatre school on Saturday. She wakes up at around .am every day and Nicole aims to have her in bed by .pm so she can get plenty of rest for the busy day ahead. To fund the array of extra-curricular activities Penny takes part in, Nicole runs her own beauty business - dropping Penny off at her grandma’s house on Fridays so she can see clients. In keeping with her glamorous education, Nicole homeschools Penny, giving her singing lessons using YouTube videos and practising reading by rehearsing scripts. “I try to make it fun. To be honest, kids learn more when everything’s fun so I try to make it more into a bit of a game,” Nicole explained. She added she’d always considered homeschooling Penny but decided to send her to school shortly before the pandemic began. Then, when schools closed and all parents were forced to homeschool their kids, Nicole thought it would be best to carry on home education after classrooms welcomed pupils back. Are you a apospushy parentapos  We would love to hear from you. Email jessica.taylor@reachplc.  “She loves it - she’s got more friends than when she went to normal school. Where we live there’s a massive homeschooling community,” Nicole said. As she teaches Penny more about le and fame, Nicole is starting to see her daughter’s natural talents as she excels. “I’d like her to go into music but I can see her acting more when she grows up. She has a right little flair for dferent characters.” Nicole acknowledges she’s a “pushy” mum but believes her approach to parenting will encourage Penny to follow her dream and give it her all. “First and foremost I want her to be happy and the best she can be. If her best means she doesn’t make it, then that’s ok - as long as she’s done everything to the best of her ability,” she explained. “If Penny decides one day that she wants to go and be a vet, that’s ok too, as long as she gives it %.” However, she reckons her daughter’s love of performing arts will continue to flourish and propel her to fame as she grows up.

She spent years being bombarded with messages from Hardy, who created several fake accounts in a bid to harass her. As a result, the mumaposs relationship broke down and she was even unable to enjoy the birth of her third child. Bizarrely, the harassment was triggered by an innocuous five-minute meeting between the pair, which barely registered with Sabrina at the time.Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here Sabrina, , says: He absolutely ruined my le and dominated my thoughts for five years. He set up accounts pretending to me and sent messages to my friends and family and even my children. He also set up accounts in my friendsapos names and messaged me pretending to be them. The level of research he carried out to discover small details about me was mind-blowing and it made me so afraid that he would hurt me or my family. I hated letting my children out of the house, even to go to school. I barely slept and I was forever checking for him in the street. My le was completely controlled by him. The pair first met in  when Sabrina called in to see a family friend of her late mum, and Hardy was at the house. Sabrina, from Mere, Cheshire, says: I was only at the house to drop something off, I said hello to Matthew and we left it at that. I didnapost think any more of it.But days later, he began messaging me on Facebook and accused me of having an affair with the family friend I had been to visit.I assured him he had got the wrong idea the man was much older than me and married to my mumaposs friend. I thought it was a bit odd and left it at that. But she then received a slew of messages, both from Hardy and from accounts of people Sabrina knew well. In one message, she was accused of having an affair with an ex-boyfriend of her late mum. In another, he suggested she was sleeping with her best friendaposs husband and also with a close male friend. She says: The messages were from accounts of people I was friendly with and at first there was lots of detail and they seemed genuine. Most of the time he would just make conversation before he started making really creepy suggestions. At first, I thought my friends were turning against me. It was really upsetting and confusing. One year on, Sabrina learned that Hardy had previously been convicted of harassment over social media and she became suspicious. Sabrina, who runs fitness and pole dancing classes, says: I went to the police, but I didnapost feel they took me seriously. They suggested I try blocking him but of course, he had so many fake accounts in dferent names, and I didnapost know which were my genuine friends and which were him. He was by this stage messaging my friends and work colleagues from a fake account he had set up in my name, so evenclosed my social media down he was still able to stalk me. I had no idea what he was saying to people about me and it was very embarrassing. The level of information he was able to gather about me was frightening. He was very clever and manipulative and messaged students from my fitness class, and even the studio owner. He delved into my past to find people Iaposd lost touch with. He seemed to know everything about me. I became scared for my safety and for my children, I was constantly checking the street before we went out. I was on high alert all the time. I was so desperate that I even contacted Hardy directly, and his mother, to ask to be left alone. I asked him why he was stalking me, but he couldnapost give me an answer. In February , Sabrina had a daughter, Nancy, but the birth was ruined by the constant harassment from Hardy. Sadly, her relationship broke down too under the strain. She says: I suffer with endometriosis and the stress caused by Hardy made it so much worse. He was affecting my health mentally and physically. I contacted the police on several occasions and finally last year the case was taken up by PC Kevin Anderson rom Northwich Local Policing Unit who was absolutely wonderful. I was horried to find out that Hardy had targeted many other women as well as me. Matthew Hardy appeared before Chester Crown Court earlier this month in relation with the harassment against Sabrina and other women, and was jailed for nine years. He had earlier pleaded guilty to three counts of stalking with intent to cause alarm or distress, two counts of stalking without intent to cause alarm and breaching a restraining order from , which banned him from using  details on social networking sites. He also admitted stalking a further four women, which was taken into consideration upon sentencing. Following the sentencing, Police Constable Kevin Anderson from Northwich Local Policing Unit, said: Having led on this case for more than  months I have seen the emotional distress and turmoil that Hardy has inflicted on his victims - he did all of this while hiding behind his computer screen. The impact on those affected by his actions has been immense, causing some of them to change some of their daily habits, and live in constant fear that they were being watched. On other occasions, it caused them to lose trust in their friends and family members, and even led to the breakdown of long-term relationships. Thankfully, Hardy has now been held accountable for his actions, and his online activity has finally been brought to a stop. I hope that the conclusion of this case will provide some closure for his victims and enable then to rebuild and move forward with their lives.

Page was jailed in  for his part in a £m property scam, he said: Iaposve admitted my crimes, and Iaposve served my time,.

He wrote: Perhaps, I thought, they were wearing them against air pollution, which is bad at the moment. Or because it was a cold morning and they actively enjoyed the warmth of their foetid breath circulating inside the germy fabric  Or perhaps, I supposed, these masked ninnies were still so afraid of the now-harmless bug that they were prepared to endure the mild discomfort and inconvenience that comes with the illusion of security provided by a mask.  Or perhaps, in their post-pandemic health hysteria, they were hoping now to protect themselves against flu, measles, hepatitis ... even cancer  . While masks are no longer a legal requirement in England, there are still some settings where they are recommended. Londoners need to keep wearing them when using Transport for London services.  While London Mayor Sadiq Khanaposs demands are not enforceable by police and do not carry a fine, face masks will remain a condition of carriage on TfL services. That means you can be refused admission to a Tube or bus without one. Mr Khan urged the PM to rethink scrapping face masks altogether.He said: Wearing a face covering is one of the single most important and easiest things we can all do to prevent the spread of Covid- and the Government should rethink their plans.Some supermarkets will continue to either ask or suggest that shoppers wear a mask. Sainsbury’s and John Lewis said their customers will be asked to wear masks, though the latter acknowledged it will ultimately come down to “personal choice”.

Tillie Adams, , is one of an estimated , under-s suffering with the long-term effects of the virus in the UK - with , ill for more than a year. During her  month ordeal Tillie has spent weeks in hospital and is often too ill to go to school.Her weight plummeted dangerously as she struggled to eat after falling ill with coronavirus last January, and she still suffers from debilitating sickness a year later.After her condition baffled medics for months, the schoolgirl was eventually told she had Post Covid Infection Syndrome, and has had a NG tube, which provides vital nutrients, since last summer. Long Covid is thought to affect around one in  children under the age of , while . per cent of those aged  to  are believed to have it.  Tillie, who now struggles to walk up the stairs at her home in Hoxton, east London, and has fainted several times in recent months, said: Sometimes I get so angry, I want to go to school, but itaposs just so hard, some days I canapost because Iaposm just so tired and so washed out. When she was first diagnosed with Covid she suffered with a temperature, aches and pains and lost her smell and taste.Her mum Kelly was told that Tillie should start to feel better within a fortnight, but weeks later she was still suffering from headaches, stomach pains and dficulty eating.Tillie, who used to be full of energy and enjoyed playing outside before she became ill, said: I just felt confused, I was just so scared, I didnapost know what to do. At first Iaposd just stay in bed because I was scared to move.  She spent two weeks in hospital after losing a stone in a matter of weeks as medics desperately tried to work out what was wrong. The more weight she was losing, the weaker she became, said Kelly, . She went grey and her lips split open, it was awful. It took a month before her energy levels picked up. She couldnapost manage the stairs, she was sometimes falling up the stairs and when she got to the top she was so light headed she would almost faint. She still gets those effects now. Sheaposs like a totally dferent child. At first Tillie was unable to dress herself, and she still needs help washing her hair.  Tillie, who is now helping researchers at University College Hospital in London understand Long Covid in children, was initially told she would only require an NG tube for two weeks. But nine months later she is still using one as she makes a phasedto school, aiming to do a half day five days a week. Brave Tillie missed out on much of her final year at primary school, but is desperate not to fall behind during her y recovery. She wants to push herself and she wants to be at school, said Kelly. But theyaposve told her she wonapost be able to go back to school full time until at least Year . Since October sheaposs only managed three weeks where sheaposs managed five half days. The rest of the time sheaposs in bed, sheaposs so washed out.  Sheaposs really worried about falling behind, but she knows that this could go on for years.Determined to show that Covid isnapost just a virus that affects adults, and keen to show others going through a similar ordeal that they are not alone, Tillie last year set up an Instagram account documenting her journey.It has amassed thousands of followers and the family have been inundated with messages of goodwill. She said: Itaposs been amazing. I want to raise awareness for others so they knowthey have it theyaposre not alone. The night before speaking to The Mirror, Tillie had spoken to another girl who was having an NG tube fitted.  Kelly said: At first I was really nervous, but she said: aposI want to help people in the same position and show that kids are suffering tooapos. Children are often forgotten about, you donapost see anything about kids with Long Covid, but when we were in hospital I spoke to lots of other parents who were going through the same thing. Latest figures from the Office for National Statisticsestimates that , children with Long Covid had to limit their activity a little in December, while , were severely restricted. It is believed that around . million people of all ages had Long Covid at the end of last year - just under two per cent of the population. Sammie Mcfarland, founder of charity Long Covid Kids, said the organisation is supporting just under , families across the UK, with numbers rising steeply. Last week alone more than  registered for support, she said. Itaposs getting worse, Sammie told The Mirror, adding that she is aware of several children who require NG tubes after contracting Covid. There are a lot of children with issues like Tillieaposs. We urgently need GP training in recognising Long Covid and we need a strong awareness campaign that accepts children are experiening Covid harm. Weaposre not seeing large numbers of people saying theyaposre back to  per cent, many children arenapost getting any better at all. That for me is the largest concern.Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON British Medical JournalEducationHospitalsSchoolsCoronavirus\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus briefing with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Deborah has now shared the note in a bid to shame the person responsible into coming forward. She said: Whoever posted this in my door, I donapost have a car so you are the idiot. Please come knock back on and get your stupid note back and talk to people face to face. Whoever this is for, leave your car where it is.  According to Deborah, the offending car was parked near the entrance of a cobbled back alleyway but wasnapost causing a major obstruction. The -year-old said: When I checked the entrance the car I guess the note was intended for was covering the entry slightly but not blocking it. Itaposs too narrow to park a car down there and itaposs only for bringing your bins out. It wasnapost that big of a deal anyway. I honestly think they should have left the note on the personaposs car. Either that or knocked on and asked meit was my car. I donapost drive at the moment so the fact they still posted it without correct knowledge shows immaturity. Itaposs a bit over the top for an adult and very childish. Iaposm more annoyed theyaposve assumed it was mine and posted such a vile note.  Mum-of-one Deborah explained that a note had been left on the windscreen of the same car around a month earlier. She added: I have seen notes left on cars around here countless times. There is another back alley entrance across the road too which is always blocked by cars as there is literally nowhere  for them to park. But theyaposve never had a note, yet this blue car seems to annoy them. Deborah admitted parking for homes around her area is a nightmare, with double yellow lines making it particularly dficult. The issue is exacerbated by staff, visitors and patients of the Royal Stoke University Hospital leaving their cars on the surrounding streets. She said: A lot of people donapost use their drives when they have them and we have a business which often has vans out front. We also get people from the houses further down which have no parking in front of them trying to park here. Itaposs like probably about  houses trying to park at the front or squeeze down Nelson Road. I think the council has double yellowed far too much of this road. The note was delivered to her address close in Hartshill Road, Hartshill, at around am on January .

The tragedy led to his daughter Queen Elizabeth IIs ascent to the throneKing George VI died in  Image: Popperfoto via Getty ImagesByClaire OBoyleAssistant Features Editor Writer:,  Jan |comments He was the much-loved King who had helped Britain through the horrors of the Second World War. And when King George VI ’s le was cut short at just , the nation was plunged into sorrow. In our week-long series to mark the beginning of The Queen ’s historic Platinum Jubilee year, we look back on the tragedy that led to her ascent to the throne.For grief engulfed the country - even as they welcomed their vibrant new monarch. The announcement from Sandringham came at . on the morning of February , . “The King, who retired to rest last night in his usual health, passed peacefully away in his sleep early this morning.”  Within moments, the nation was plunged into mourning. The King’s eldest daughter, the new Queen Elizabeth, was halfway across the world in Kenya with her husband the Duke of Edinburgh, and by nightfall, they were in the air. Reports at the time said she burst immediately into tears at the news of her father’s death before quickly composing herself and making moves to get home. Her family, and her country, needed her. The royal airliner left Entebbe, Uganda at .pm that night and before .pm the following day Prime Minister Winston Churchill was on the runway at London Airport as he led a mournful party in welcoming home Britain’s new, grieving Queen.  Yet somehow, through her sorrow, the stoic young Elizabeth, just  at the time, managed a smile. The last time her father had been seen in public was less than a week before his death at that very same airport. He had come to say goodbye as the young married couple headed off on their Commonwealth Tour. George VI had been in ill health for some time, and just four months earlier he’d been under the surgeon’s kne for a lung operation - one lung was removed after a tumour was discovered. Yet when it came, his death was still a shock. Just a day earlier he had been out shooting with a neighbour on the Sandringham estate. But when James Macdonald, his personal valet for many years, called softly to the King as he took early morning tea to the Royal bedroom that historic day, no reply rang out. Court officials were called from their beds and the soon news was official. The King was dead. Within moments his we, soon to be known not as Queen but Queen Mother, and daughter Margaret had arrived. A sense of tragedy swept through Sandringham House and on to Marlborough House when the news was broken to the King’s heartbroken mother, Queen Mary. The feeling would soon spread right across the nation. Flags in the villages around Sandringham were lowered to half-mast, then lted again with the arrival of the new Queen. With theof Queen Elizabeth to Britain on February , the formalities could begin. Hours after she’d been greeted at the airport by the Prime Minister, Mr Churchill shared his sorrow with the country in a pm broadcast on the airwaves. “When the death of the King was announced to us yesterday morning there struck a deep and solemn note in our lives which, as it resounded far and wide, stilled the clatter and traffic of twentieth-century le in many lands, and made countless millions of human beings pause and look around them,” he said. “The King was greatly loved by all his peoples. He was respected as a man and as a prince far beyond the many realms over which he reigned.” He concluded his deeply solemn speech with a resounding message of support to the new monarch, saying: “ I, whose youth was passed in the august, unchallenged and tranquil glories of the Victorian era, may well feel a thrill in invoking once more the prayer and the anthem, “God save the Queen!”  The very next day came Proclamation Day where the new Queen, dressed in full mourning at St James’s Palace, told of the “heavy task” laid upon her. In a stately room in the Palace, before the assembled Accession Council, while thousands stood in silence outside, she said: “By the sudden death of my dear father, I am called to assume the duties and responsibility of sovereignty. At this time of deep sorrow it is a profound consolation to me to be assured of the sympathy which you, and all my peoples, feel toward me,” adding: “I pray that God will help me to discharge worthily this heavy task that has been laid upon me so early in my le.” The King’s coffin was taken from Sandringham to London, where it lay in Westminster Hall for three days. More than , came to pay their respects. Then in the early hours of February , the day of the King’s funeral, crowds began to gather in the capital for the procession through the streets, which were closed to traffic from am.  A little while after am the funeral party gathered before the cortege made its way through London at .am. Chimes rang out from Big Ben  times, each one representing a year of the late King’s le. The King’s coffin was draped in the Royal Standard of red, blue and gold, with the Imperial State Crown, the Gold Orb, the Sceptre, the insignia of the Order of the Garter and a white wreath from his we placed on top. From the windows of Marlborough House, high above The Mall, Queen Mary the King’s Mother, watched on. Thousands stood below as the procession passed, while many more watched at home on their televisions. The procession was the first of a British monarch to be broadcast on TV. After passing the Guildhall, where officials bowed their heads in respect, the funeral party arrived at Paddington to the refrain of Chopin’s Funeral March before the royal train left for the funeral in Windsor shortly after midday. By pm, the country fell silent.  The family, joined by dignitaries from around the world, gathered in St George’s Chapel at Windsor, where floral tributes to the King had been laid, while hundreds of thousands came to a standstill in the streets across Britain. Buses, cars and taxis pulled up by the pavements and turned their engines off with drivers and passengers getting out. Pedestrians stopped as they walked and bowed their heads. A hush fell over the country while for two minutes people held King George VI in their thoughts. Then at .pm the King was laid to rest. As his plain oak coffin was gently lowered into the family’s vault at St George’s Chapel his daughter, the Queen, sprinkled earth from a gilded bowl. A striking picture captured the solemnity of the day as three Queens, shrouded in their heavy mourning clothes that dreary February day were seen together - the new Queen Elizabeth, her mother and the late King’s widow as well as his mother Queen Mary, reflecting the pain of the nation behind their veils. The simple service, attended by the Archbishops of Canterbury and York and the Bishop of Winchester, drew to a close. The Queen, herself a mother of two and just  years old, would lead the country out of sadness.

She also alleges she was forced to have sex with the -year-old royal at Epsteinaposs home in New York and the US Virgin Islands. The mum-of-three is suing Andrew for unspecied damages, which US lawyers say could easily be in excess of £ millionshe is successful. Should he lose, he could have officers from the court arriving at the doors of his Royal Lodge home, it was reported. Lawyer Arick Fudali, who has worked closely with Epstein’s victims, told The Sun : There is a method and procedure for seizing assets, even overseas assets, in the event there is an award of damages and the defendant tries to avoid paying.This could include seizing bank accounts, physical property, etc. “Assuming for the sake of this question that there is an award of damages against Prince Andrew, he would be able to avoid the seizure of assets by posting a bond pending the inevitable appeal. “Assuming the appeal goes in favour of Ms. Giuffre, Prince Andrew would either have to pay the amount owed, settle the matter for another amount, or risk his assets being seized.” Andrew has continually denied all the allegations. Earlier this month it was revealed Andrew has found a buyer for his beloved Swiss retreat. Spencer Kuvin, a lawyer for Jeffrey Epsteinaposs victims, says it could have been to prevent his accuser from claiming the asset should she win the case. He said: “If Virginia gets a judgement against Andrew,this went all the way through to trial and she received a financial judgement in her favour, she could execute on any properties he has, the most likely being his ski chalet.  If Andrew had properties in any companion country that would abide by such jurisdiction of the US, she can execute on those properties. If the Queen has transferred any property to him, anywhere throughout the entire world, they could try and execute on that propertysuccessful in foreign courts. Last week the Duke attempted to distance himself from convicted sex offender Maxwell, insisting in court documents the pair were not close. He has been pictured several times since the s holidaying and partying with the disgraced socialite, who also attended several royal residences. In legal papers responding to accusations from Virginia Giuffre, the Queen’s second son dismissed any notion they were close friends. Royal insiders say Andrew has made the ultimate gamble by demanding trial by jury, saying it could cause irreparable damage to the monarchy and overshadow the Queen’s Platinum Jubilee celebrations.

Five female members of staff - three secretaries and at least two porters - have resigned from their post since he took the position in July last year, according to reports.Mr White, , is a key ceremonial figure and is seen walking in front of the Queen every year at the state opening of Parliament. He also advises the Government and Buckingham Palace about large state events, including the Queenaposs Platinum Jubilee Celebration which is set to take place in June.  His boss, the Duke of Norfolk, is responsible for organising state events.The duke told the Mail On Sunday he was aware of the allegations and said he summoned Mr White imminently for an initial discussion.He also said he takes his role extremely seriously and wouldnapost hesitate to take any action necessary.  Mr Whiteaposs upcoming appearances include presiding over the Duchess of Cornwall being sworn in as a Royal Lady of the Order of the Garter - the top slot among knighthood ranks. It will also fall on Mr White to pronounce the Queenaposs death from the balcony of St Jamesaposs Palace on the date of her passing. According to sources, the staff members had no issues with Mr Whiteaposs predecessor, Sir Thomas Woodcock, , who held the role for  years. Sir Thomasaposs former secretary Lydia Birch was the first to leave, just three months after Mr White took over.

There were other resignations from two porters at the College of Arms, according to reports. One source claimed to the Mail: aposHe threw tantrums. There was a culture of bullying, undermining and making staff cry. Perhaps the pressure is getting to him. He started a new job and with the jubilee thereaposs a lot on.

The surrounding area of the house was cordoned off after the incident. Luckily, no injuries were reported as a result of the roof and its tiles falling onto the pavement below.On Saturday, the day the roof was ripped off, yellow and amber weather warnings for high winds had been issued across northern England, Scotland and Northern Ireland.  Tragically, three people died over the weekend as a result of Storm Malik’s gale-force winds. A nine-year-old boy, from Staffordshire, and a -year-old woman, from Aberdeen, were both killed by falling trees on Saturday. A -year-old man also died after a lorry overturned on the M. Around , homes across northern England and Scotland have been left without power in the wake of Storms Malik and Corrie over the weekend. Schools across Aberdeenshire were forced to close on Monday, as a result of power outages or storm damage. A -year-old hospitality worker, from Northumberland, has been without heating and electricity since Saturday morning. Clare Stirling-Turnbull said: “We have no electric, no heating or hot water - we do have a wood burner so can heat one room.Clare is unable to go to relatives’ houses, as one of the children in her family of six is currently isolating with Covid-.On Sunday night, gusts of mph were recorded at Stornoway in the Western Isles, which forecasters described as exceptionally strong. Met Office meteorologist, Alex Burkill, said: There is no wonder there were signicant impacts such as power outages and damage to buildings.It is very unfortunate that things were worse than that for some people. Fortunately, the Met Office said that the next few days would be a lot calmer, before a brief cold snap on Thursday.

She said: “It was like I’d gone schizophrenic overnight. Even when I started sleeping I was obsessing over things.Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here I kept thinking people were testing me to seeI could cope. I thought my we and her mother were watching me on the baby monitor to seeI made mistakes. “I thought they were hiding my medicine so they could drug me to make me stop talking. I was obsessively askingit was time to feed the babies, and how much they would need at their next feed, just repeating the same questions over and over. “Then all the hallucinating and obsessing about birds in the garden started. If I saw only one magpie in the garden I would obsess that something bad was going to happen to the babies, and Iaposd chase around the garden trying to find all its friends. “I’d be really gladI saw a robin in the garden and follow it about because when my we sees a robin she says it’s her dad who died, but I obsessed over them.  “I had a hallucination of my we carrying a bag down the side of our house, but I can’t have seen that, because I was sitting on the sofa with a wall in front of me. “I did a similar thing with my friend’s car, which I thought I saw, but it wasn’t there when I looked again.” Charity became pregnant following articial insemination in August , and along with we Sarah, an HGV driver was over the moon. The wives used a sperm donor from Denmark, and Charity had intra-uterine injections because of suspected polycystic oies she said. The mums-to-be were delighted when three little ones were spotted on the seven-week scan: each with their own amniotic sack and placenta, on March , .The babes, each weighing four pounds, were born by planned caesarean section after a -week uncomplicated pregnancy. The girls were strong enough to stay in the main hospital with mum, resting in special hot-cots, and fed via nasal-gastro tubes. The new mums cuddled and burped their tots, and changed many tiny nappies, before bringing their family home on April . But Charity Horton, , struggled to relax after babies Raine, Poppy and River were born, and once she got home from hospital barely slept for an entire week. Soon she became very ill and was convinced she was starving her tiny babies - even though the trio were perfectly healthy. And she believed her mother-in-law Cheryl Horton, , and we were hiding her medication, and that Cherylaposs dog was going to eat the babies. In the following weeks, her mental health spiralled, and she started to hallucinate thinking she could see through the walls. Convinced that magpies in her garden were a sign of bad luck, sheaposd chase them out the garden of their home in St Austell, Cornwall. Doctors initially prescribed the exhausted mum antidepressants and sleeping pills, but the depleted woman couldn’t find peace. Frightened Charity began to self-harm and take risks with her le. The troubled mum once tried to put her foot in scalding water to seeshe could feel the pain.  In a cry for help, she told her we she was going to take her own le, and disappeared, on April . Loved-ones including mum Joy Ternouth , was worried sick, she said. The family called the mental-health nurses and Charity, who ed home the same night, was admitted to Longreach mental health acute psychiatric ward on April . The mum was given support and a six-month course of antipsychotic drugs and was well enough tohome to her we and babies on May . After two weeks of in-patient treatment, she was on the road to recovery and able tohome. She spoke up about her experience to help other mums going through the same thing. Charity, a CCTV manager, said: “At first I didnapost think there was anything wrong I just thought I was high on le after having these three beautul girls. “Then we got home and I was so frightened of having to look after them. I was sure I was doing it wrong. “I convinced myself I had to feed them all at once. I couldn’t switch off or sleep at all. It was like I was wired. I could hear them all the time, and they always sounded really loud. “I feared they would die in their sleep, so when they were quiet I thought they were dead. Whenever they were awake I thought they needed something all the time. “I didn’t stop talking, I just kept repeating the same questions to my we and her mum all the time. It just got worse and worse, until I wanted to kill myself because I was in so much pain. “I just wanted the anxiety to stop. Looking back now it seems so scary. I just canapost believe that happened. It’s brilliant being a new mum now - I love it. “I’m really embracing it and making up for the lost time. I just laugh and play with them a lot and get them to smile. I’m so glad Iaposve got through it. “At leastmy girls go through mental health problems I’ll know how to help.” After a month, brave Charity confessed she was having thoughts about self-harm and was admitted to hospital, where she was diagnosed with postpartum psychosis. She said: I knew there was something wrong but not what it was.  “I desperately needed help. I threatened to hurt and then kill myself because I was hoping somebody would realise that I wasnapost me and that I was in this horrible place. “I just wanted to feel like myself again. I was glad to pack my bags - it was the right place for me. “I was too in my own head to worry about leaving the babies, I just need to get better. “After nine days I started really missing them so I knew I was getting better. They’re not quite sure why postpartum psychosis happens, about one in a thousand women get it, and it’s triggered by birth. “I imagine it’s the perfect storm of all the hormones of being a new mum, the stress, and being so tired. It’s a medical emergency -somebody gets it you need to ring an ambulance it’s that bad. “It’s rare, but be on the lookout for your family and friends just be aware of what can happen. One minute you seem fine but the next you don’t know what’s going on.” If you are suffering from postnatal depression, donapost struggle in silence. PANDAS is a charity dedicated to helping people.

Cherie Hitchens, , and Joanna Morrison, , have been living in temporary accommodation for a year.They both have multiple disabilities including multiple chemical sensitivity, making them extremely sensitive to any chemical-type smells, DorsetLive reports. Dorset Council said the only permanent accommodation it could offer them was a bungalow just one mile from the Lush soap factor. Cherie and Joanna said they had no choice but to turn it down, leaving them homeless. Cherie said: They evicted us because we said no to one permanent bungalow in Upton.  We said no to that because it was right next to the carriageway, there were lots of Lush smells, lots of people working for Lush - we are allergic to scented products, they make us very ill. Also the problem with the bungalow was they saidwe didnapost stay there for five years, we would have to pay for all the disabled adaptions. In , the pair had been living in Upton. They are part-time wheelchair users, with Joanna suffering from asthma and diabetes. Cherie also suffers from spinal stenosis, Graves Disease and has recently recovered from cancer. That year, when their council-funded home became unavailable they were moved into a hotel and from there they were moved to a temporary house for a year. They were then offered a new bungalow, but the two friends said it was unsuitable. for our daily newsletter to keep up to date with all the essential information atwww.mirror email.Cherie said: We had to do an assessment, of their opinion and our opinion of why we couldnapost take the bungalow in Upton. We did that. They [the council] said you should have taken it. We looked in Devon, Hampshire, Wiltshire, Cornwall, and Dorset obviously, to start with. Theyaposre throwing us out of Dorset. We canapost go to places that have very well-known scented product shops and factories - we canapost go near them, and they are all over the place. We did look at three properties out of a lot that I saw. Three of them we wanted, but one landlord said: aposno, housing benefitapos. They believe whataposs on the TV - that weaposre all scum and weaposre just milking the system. We are not. Itaposs not our fault we had these accidents - itaposs not our fault we have to rely on benefits. Weaposre relying on credit cards now - Iaposm almost maxed out. Cherie claims they went through the courts, but the council has stopped all forms of help. She says they were evicted from their temporary home on January . The pair are now staying in a hotel for as long as they can afford to, which they expect will be until Tuesday. Cherie said: Theyaposre expecting us to sofa-surf, theyaposre expecting us to have friends and family. But they use scented products! We used to use scented products - we used to have lovely incense sticks, you know  We couldnapost live there. [Joannaaposs] suffered enough. Sheaposs nearly  years old - she doesnapost deserve this, we donapost deserve this. No disabled person deserves this - the way we are being treated. When asked what she felt needed to be done, Cherie said: Weaposve looked for a three-bedroom, detached bungalow, with a wet room, with a garage, no wood burners, no VOC paint, not newly refurbished, no new carpets and not near carriageways, factories or industrial estates. Thataposs what we want. Itaposs not easy - of course, weaposre part-time wheelchair users, and Iaposm going to be paralysed in a few years because of my narrowing of the spinal cord. Cherie said: Jo has to see the specialist, sheaposs got another condition, and she has not been able to see them for six months. So we cannot move out of Dorset until she sees them. So weaposve got to stay here until February . There are other counties that offer three, four, five properties. We were only offered one. We didnapost know that! They never said to us,you donapost accept it, then you are going to be on the streets. She added that the situation has taken a toll on their mental health. A spokesman for Dorset Council said: “The council is unable to go into detail on inidual cases. “However, there is a very clear legal procedure the council has to follow in offering residents a suitable property. “The consequences of refusing to accept a property, which is deemed suitable, are clearly communicated in writing and verbally. “Decisions can also be reviewed and go through the court system. The council also has an obligation to use temporary accommodation in the best way possible for all residents.” Thecontacted Dorset Council for comment.

The latest figures, released by the Department for Health on Monday afternoon, show a four per cent increase on confirmed infections from this time last week.Last Mondaya total of , new coronavirus cases were tallied.Meanwhile, deaths slightly decreased from . On Sunday, , new cases and  deaths were tallied. Case numbers have substantially dropped since peaking around New Year’s - with , cases recorded on January . From Monday the UK Health Security Agencyis now including data on possible reinfections in its Covid- dashboard.The UKHSA says a Covid sufferer who has tested positive at least  days after a previous infection will now be considered a reinfection, whereas people were previously only counted in the figures the first time they tested positive for the virus. As a result updated figures for England show ,, episodes of infection since the start of the pandemic, with ,reinfections added to the total case number for the country.The new data metric shows reinfection rates averaged around . percent of cases until November , , when a spike in infections took place following the emergence of the Omicron iant.Professor Steven Riley, UKHSA’s Director General of Data and Analytics, said: Reinfection remained at very low levels until the start of the Omicron wave. It is right that our daily reporting processes reflect how the virus has changed.  We continue to see downward trends in case numbers and incidence of illness as we work to reduce the impact of the pandemic on our day-to-day lives. With vaccination still a great defence against infection and illness, please get jabbed as soon as possible. Mondayaposs figures came as the highly-anticipated report into the Downing Street lockdown parties was released. The Sue Gray report found failures of leadership and judgement over Downing Street lockdown parties that should not have been allowed.The nine-page update said at least some of the gatherings were a serious failure to observe not just the high standards expected of those working at the heart of Government, but also of the standards expected of the entire British population at the time. It also revealed Scotland Yard is probing  out of the  parties she investigated - including Boris Johnsonaposs birthday party. Monday also marked an end to Covid restrictions. The guidelines introduced last year have been changing gradually and working from home orders have also come to an end. From Monday, curbs were relaxed in care homes as living with the virus becomes the latest instruction by the UK Government.  Cases are plummeting and the aposRapos rate has also dropped to its lowest since March . Limits had been introduced on care home visits under Plan B curbs allowing millions to spend time with their nearest and dearest. But the three-visitor restriction was dropped from today in all care homes. Workers will have to take lateral flow tests before every sht from February .  Weekly PCR tests are currently required along with lateral flow tests three times a week.Almost nine in ten care home residents had been triple jabbed, said Health secretary Sajid Javid, allowing visiting rules to be relaxed.He said: I know how vital companionship is to those living in care homes and the positive dference visits make, which is why we continued to allow three named visitors and an essential caregiver under Plan B measures. Thanks to the progress we have made, I am delighted that care home restrictions can now be eased further allowing residents to see more of their loved ones, he said. Also from Monday, vulnerable five to -year-olds have their first jab to protect against Covid.

More than , homes were without electricity following back-to-back storms which hit the UK over the weekend and cost three people their lives. Storm Corrie brought winds of mph to Stornoway in the Western Isles of Scotland late on Sunday. It came after Storm Malik blew down trees, damaged power lines and ripped roofs off homes in the north of England and Scotland on Saturday.Now more stormy weather is predicted with a Met Office yellow warning in place for the north and east of Scotland. It states: “Strong winds on Tuesday may lead to some disruption.” Adding people can expect: “Some short term loss of power and other services is possible. “Probably some bus and train services affected with some journeys taking longer. It’s possible that some coastal routes, sea fronts and coastal communities will be affected by spray and or large waves.” Met Office Alex Deakin said that it is set to be cloudy and wet day with the strong winds on Tuesday but temperatures are expected to be mild.  He said: A grey day for England and Wales with outbreaks of rain across the North West some brighter skies across Scotland, some sunshine coming through. It is going to be windy across the North East, gusts of mph over the mainland maybe a little bit more than that across the far North East and of course after those recent storms there is the potential for further disruption so we do have a yellow warning in place across the north east of Scotland.” Temperatures are expected to remain relatively mild through the middle of the week before an Arctic plunge caused by a cold front sweeping in bringing snow on Friday for Scotland and temperatures as low as -C over the weekend. Weather Outlook forecaster Brian Gaze told the Express : Pulses of polar maritime air from the northwest could bring brief colder interludes, with showers turning wintry in the north and over the Welsh mountains. Mr Deaking added:This cold front looks like being pretty active and it will swing across the country later Thursday, overnight into Friday bringing a band of heavy rain as it does and then look at that sweeping away the mild air and bringing something a little colder on Friday. UK forecast for the next  days Today: Cloudy and mild for most parts with some patchy light rain and drizzle. Brighter weather moving south across Scotland, northern and eastern England, whilst wintry showers affect the far northeast. Windy, with severe gales for northeast Scotland. Tonight: Showers and winds in the far northeast easing, then turning clear and chilly for a time. Cloud, rain and drizzle in the west moving eastwards later. Wednesday: Cloudy for many with some patchy light rain and drizzle moving eastwards, then some heavier rain in the far northwest later. Brighter across the south. Mild and breezy. Outlook for Thursday to Saturday: Squally rain sweeping southeast Thursday, with sunshine and wintry showers to follow. Milder at first over the weekend but with more squally rain and showers following later. Windy throughout.

This one though seemed to try to address Kim’s sudden weight loss and even showed him struggling to walk down a set of stairs. Framing it as a positive, the documentary declared that the sudden weight loss was because of all the hard work the tyrant had done for his country. The narrator says: “[Kim Jong Un] showed us his fatherly side by doggedly braving snow, rain and wind while taking on the fate of the nation and people like his own children.  “His body completely withered away, and he showed his motherly side by greatly suffering and worrying to realise the dreams of the people.” The state media also airs a citizen’s remarks that the dictator looked “emaciated”. As the narrator says this, the documentary shows Kim holding an umbrella, whilst slowly descending the stairs, one step at a time.  The stairs scene appears similar to one from a documentary of his  activities, when he vanished from his longest-ever break from the public. At the time the narrator said he was not “feeling well”. This year’s programme repeatedly emphasises that North Korea faces its “worst-ever hardships” and “challenges” in .  This was in reference to the Covid pandemic, and it spoke a bit more about the national “food crisis”. The country’s food crisis has been a controversial issue internally as it has been subject to much censorship and did not originally appear in any initial print media reports on the June party assembly. According to the film’s narrator, Kim presented “important policy ideas in order to urgently stabilise the people’s lives and the tense food distribution situation and overcome the current food crisis with an emergency policy.” As well as talking, briefly, about the dictator’s health problems, the KCTV documentary shows shots of the dictator riding around on horseback, and looking contemplative at what is thought to be one of his many mansions.  Elsewhere in the film, it showed the first ever look at the completed new -story skyscraper in North Korea, as well as a number of other major construction projects. KCTV is expected to repeatedly broadcast the documentary over the coming days and weeks.

She added that some head teachers would also be expected to retire within the transition period.#Job sizing will be criticalthe proposals are to be implemented,# Ms Connor said.Council documents explain that the process of job sizing takes into account the size of schools, leadership roles and teaching time when deciding on the salary scale for promoted posts in education.#Head teachers retiring would also form part of the modelling,# Ms Connor added. #If a school collective was agreed where there were, for example, seven head teachers then two might be retiring and that would form part of the model.#Until collectives are looked at in more detail we can#t have a clear idea of staff numbers.#As part of the consultation process, which started in November and is due to finish on March , the council has shared its proposals with parent groups and community councils.Feedback from the consultation is timetabled to be presented to Argyll and Bute Council in April.This will be followed by the proposals being voted on towards the end of  and,approved, interim processes to bring in the changes would begin in spring .At Tuesday#s meeting it was explained, however, that the consultation will continue throughout the process with pupils, parents and educators being included in the process throughout.In addition, dialogue is continuing with the Roman Catholic Diocese of Argyll and the Isles concerning the involvement of faith schools in school collectives.These discussions were described by council officers as #ongoing# and #collaborative#.Concerns were also raised about the timing of the proposed changes, coming when pupils# education and wellbeing had been impacted by the pandemic.Acting Head of Education Learning and Teaching Wendy Brownlie said: #Young people#s views have been gathered throughout and they have expressed really interesting points both for and against the changes.#The consultation paper addresses the issue of the pandemic by saying: #The last couple of years have been extraordinarily challenging for schools.

honour the traditional Scots dish with a rendition of one of Robert Burns’ most famous and oft-performed poems: Address To a Haggis.Usually recited by the dinners host, the tongue-in-cheek address has been a long-established focal point of the Burns Supper, a night which celebrates the birth date of the literary legend himself: January , .After the haggis is piped to the table , Burns’ words are recited over the dish as it is cut open and served to the guests.Some say it is wise to cut a small incision in the side of the haggis before it is properly \"cut open\" on the table - tales of guests being scalded by flying contents during enthusiastic recitals have been told.Others say this is part of the fun.What is the history of an Address to a Haggis The address was composed in the year  - not long after the poet arrived in Scotland’s capital city. There are two stories linked to the poem’s inception - one more romantic than the other.The first version alleges he’d been invited for dinner at the house of a merchant friend, Andrew Bruce, and composed the poem to amuse the wealthy host and his guests.The second, and slightly more charming version, is that he composed the poem off-the-cuff whilst visiting the house of his cabinetmaker friend, John Morrison, in a fit of inspiration brought on by the sight of the luxurious meat pudding.In the th century, haggis would not be a meal enjoyed very often – reserved as an item of extravagance and occasion. Based on Burns’ political persuasion, it’s been speculated that his tribute was ironic in its praise – poking fun at the upper classes who might revere it as an item of luxury.Though the true origin of the poem is debated, it was one of Burns’ first poems to be published in the Edinburgh periodical, The Caledonian Mercury, on December , ..removeA quick video search for an “Address to the Haggis” brings up hundreds of results, ranging from a “Haggis Address for Kids”, recitals at kitchen tables and in dingy restaurants - to a piper in full dress, piping the dish into the National Museum of Scotland in Edinburgh.  High-society lestyle magazine Tatler recently published an article titled “Where to head for the finest Burns Night supper in London” - it’s clear that the Address to the Haggis can and should be performed in places both high and low. As thousands of Addresses to the Haggis continue to be made the world over, it’s inevitable that each one will have a character of its own - something the Bard himself would surely have approved of. Address to a Haggis by Robert Burns, in FullFair fa your honest, sonsie face, Great chieftain o the pudding-race! Aboon them a ye tak your place, Painch, tripe, or thairm : Weel are ye wordy oa grace As langs my arm. The groaning trencher there ye fill, Your hurdies like a distant hill, Your pin wad help to mend a mill In time oneed, While thro your pores the dews distil Like amber bead. His kne see rustic Labourdight, An cut you up wi ready sleight, Trenching your gushing entrails bright, Like ony ditch And then, O what a glorious sight, Warm-reekin, rich! Then, horn for horn, they stretch an strive: Deil tak the hindmost!

Pugh’s monumental history of Dunbar is consulted, we read that there was a turnpike toll at Kirkhill near the town’s parish church another on the main road through Belhaven and a third known as Cleikimin Toll on the road from Dunbar to Spott.Kirkhill Toll stood near the parish church, near the former site of the Bellevue Hotel there is a house at the site today but this rather large two-story building does not look like a toll-house.Cleikimin Toll stood until Edwardian times but is today buried underneath the A road.Mr Pugh assures us that Belhaven Toll was known within living memory to bus drivers and conductors, but its situation has been open to debate.The Canmore database of Historic Environment Scotland contains the following reference to it: “Benston Cottage, in the angle between the Aand the south going cross road, is reported locally to have been a toll house, but it shows no features distinguishing as such apart, perhaps, from an outshot  foot square abutting its E end, with a small window facing the road. Visited  February .”Now who is right  The Belhaven locals or the Edinburgh architectural historian The earliest newspaper mention of Belhaven Toll is from July , when a certain James M’Dougal was on trial in Edinburgh for issuing counterfeit £ banknotes.The prisoner had asked several toll-keepers to issue change for his bogus banknotes, but when he came to Belhaven Toll and asked for a glass of whisky, the tollkeeper James Liddle did not at all like the look of the £ note he was handed.After the scoundrel M’Dougal had beaten a hasty retreat, Liddle gave the banknote to a Dunbar bank agent who pronounced it to be a forgery.M’Dougal was found guilty and sentenced to death issuing  banknotes was considered a heinous offence in those days.The property page of The Scotsman of March ,  contains the following important notice: “LAND AND HOUSES NEAR DUNBAR.It says: “The park adjoining the post-road on the west side of Belhaven Toll, consisting of  acres English measure or thereby, as presently possessed by Mr France, together with the dwelling-house, large garden, and offices thereon, called Rosebank.”It turns out that Rosebank House is still standing today, although a number of houses have been built in its extensive grounds, some of them along Edinburgh Road itself, including the former Belhaven police station.The next mention of Belhaven Toll is in the Edinburgh Evening Courant of October , , announcing the sale of “That PIECE of ENCLOSED GROUND, extending to   Acres imperial measure of thereby, situated to the South of Belhaven Toll-Bar, on the West Side of the road leading from Belhaven to Spott, and contiguous to the Line of the North British Railway Company”.These newspaper notices establish, without any doubt, that there was a toll-bar at Belhaven, constructed before  and still operational in  when the arrival of the railways meant that the old tollgates were under threat.William Forrest’s  map of Haddingtonshire tells us that the toll was there already by that time, at the junction of the post-road and a road going to the south-east.The newspapers provide some further valuable clues to its position.Back in , the grounds of Rosebank were on the south side of the post-road [today Edinburgh Road], just west of the junction with the road from Belhaven to Spott [today Beveridge Row].In , the farmland between Belhaven and the mainline railway was bordering what is today the west side of Beveridge Row and stated to be situated to the south of Belhaven Toll.This would indicate that the toll-house was situated at the corner of Edinburgh Road and Beveridge Row, and indeed this is the exact position of ‘Benston Cottage’ described in the Canmore survey by the doubting Edinburgh historian. I would not agree with the opinion of this inidual that the building looks unlike a toll-house.The Edinburgh toll-houses, of which specimens survive at Morningside and Merchiston, are single-storey buildings but have some quaint architectural features. The East Lothian toll-houses were even more primitive, even by the standards of the time: small and low cottages offering only the most basic amenities.Belhaven Toll – alias Benston Cottage – very much, in fact, resembles the Goatfield toll-house at what is today  Dunbar Road, Haddington, and the surviving toll-house in Haddington, Abbey and Aberlady.Thus it can be concluded that the locals were right, and that Belhaven Toll still stands today!On the morning of September , , the No.  bus between Dunbar and North Berwick took off without any incident.But on Edinburgh Road, Belhaven, it was involved in a collision with a Vauxhall Antara and veered off the road, crashing right into. . . Benston Cottage alias Belhaven Toll!Fortunately, the cottage was empty as it was undergoing renovation further remedial work would surely be needed since the bus hit it with considerable force, knocking down the front door and some of the wall.A number of police and firefighters were soon at the scene, successfully cutting the trapped bus driver free using hydraulic gear and making sure that the other victims of the crash were taken away in ambulances. A -year-old East Linton RAF veteran, who had been a passenger on the bus, hit a handrail hard and later died in hospital.A -year-old man, the driver of the Antara, was charged with causing the incident, being handed by the courts an order of  hours of community service and banned from driving for three years.As for the battered former toll-house, it was repaired and taken care of by a firm of property developers, and is today used as a holiday let for out-of-town sportsmen and visitors, ‘sleeping six’ in the restored cottage and offering extra storage for surf boards and golf clubs.It is curious that neither the newspaper accounts of the bus crash, nor the Benston Cottage homepage ‘fishing’ for customers, mention the interesting past of the former toll-house.History can be made, but it can equally easily be forgotten."},{"url":null,"title":"snooker-legends-coming-musselburgh","story":"The two will recreate some of their most famous duels, accompanied by icon John Virgo as referee and host delivering his famous snooker impressions.The night will conclude with a Q and A session with a chance to ask your favourite stars the burning questions you’ve always wanted to ask.: Craig Hills Pumped! comes to MusselburghVIP tickets are also available which will allow locals to get up close and personal with their favourite stars of the sport as well as premium seating and a complimentary drink.The show will take place on Wednesday, March  at .pm, with the VIP meet and greet taking place at pm.Tickets are £and can be purchased via telephone    or online at www.thebrunton  "},{"url":null,"title":"river-esk-pollution-situation-improving-says-sepa","story":"The two organisations are continuing to work together to respond to the oil-based spillage, which was first reported on Friday, January .Further investigations and ecological studies are continuing to fully understand the cause and implications of the incident, they say.: Dye testing carried out as efforts to clean-up pollution continuesSEPA has also continued to carry out a range of investigations and assessments in relation to the source of the pollution. While officers have been pursuing a number of lines of enquiry, SEPA says it cannot comment further given it is a live investigation.A council spokesperson said: \"While the situation with discoloured water and odour in the River Esk has improved signicantly in the last two weeks, local people may still observe some residual polluted material discolouration on the surface of the river as well as the Craigie Burn, which discharged into the Esk, particularlysignicant rainfall patterns are experienced.\"Frequent multi-agency assessment of progress continues to be made in order to inform further remedial actions and next steps, supported by East Lothian Council’s contractor.\": Schoolchildren make get well soon cards for River Esk wildleFurther survey activity has been carried out by SEPA ecologists to understand the impact of the pollution incident on the River Esk and its affected tributary, and this will continue at regular intervals.Survey activity continues to show that while the receiving burn remains impacted, the short-term impact on the river continues to be low and there has been no further deterioration.: Colin Beattie MSP column: Pollution in the Esk was shockingSEPA officers undertook dye testing earlier this week using luminous green tracer dye to check drainage system connections.The dye is designed for this purpose and is not harmful to the environment or local ecology.

address has been a long-established focal point of the Burns Supper, a night which celebrates the birth date of the literary legend himself: January , .After the haggis is piped to the table , Burns’ words are recited over the dish as it is cut open and served to the guests.Some say it is wise to cut a small incision in the side of the haggis before it is properly \"cut open\" on the table - tales of guests being scalded by flying contents during enthusiastic recitals have been told.Others say this is part of the fun.The address was composed in the year  - not long after the poet arrived in Scotland’s capital city. There are two stories linked to the poem’s inception - one more romantic than the other.The first version alleges he’d been invited for dinner at the house of a merchant friend, Andrew Bruce, and composed the poem to amuse the wealthy host and his guests.The second, and slightly more charming version, is that he composed the poem off-the-cuff whilst visiting the house of his cabinetmaker friend, John Morrison, in a fit of inspiration brought on by the sight of the luxurious meat pudding.In the th century, haggis would not be a meal enjoyed very often – reserved as an item of extravagance and occasion. Based on Burns’ political persuasion, it’s been speculated that his tribute was ironic in its praise – poking fun at the upper classes who might revere it as an item of luxury.Though the true origin of the poem is debated, it was one of Burns’ first poems to be published in the Edinburgh periodical, The Caledonian Mercury, on December , .A quick video search for an “Address to the Haggis” brings up hundreds of results, ranging from a “Haggis Address for Kids”, recitals at kitchen tables and in dingy restaurants - to a piper in full dress, piping the dish into the National Museum of Scotland in Edinburgh.  High-society lestyle magazine Tatler recently published an article titled “Where to head for the finest Burns Night supper in London” - it’s clear that the Address to the Haggis can and should be performed in places both high and low. As thousands of Addresses to the Haggis continue to be made the world over, it’s inevitable that each one will have a character of its own - something the Bard himself would surely have approved of. Fair fa your honest, sonsie face, Great chieftain o the pudding-race! Aboon them a ye tak your place, Painch, tripe, or thairm : Weel are ye wordy oa grace As langs my arm. The groaning trencher there ye fill, Your hurdies like a distant hill, Your pin wad help to mend a mill In time oneed, While thro your pores the dews distil Like amber bead. His kne see rustic Labour dight, An cut you up wi ready sleight, Trenching your gushing entrails bright, Like ony ditch And then, O what a glorious sight, Warm-reekin, rich! Then, horn for horn, they stretch an strive: Deil tak the hindmost! on they drive, Till a their weel-swalld kytes belyve Are bent like drums Then auld Guidman, maist like to rive, Bethankit! hums. Is there that owre his French ragout Or olio that wad staw a sow, Or fricassee wad make her spew Wi perfect sconner, Looks down wi sneering, scornfu view On sic a dinner  Poor devil! see him owre his trash, As feckless as witherd rash, His spindle shank, a guid whip-lash His nieve a nit Thro bloody flood or field to dash, O how unfit! But mark the Rustic, haggis-fed, The trembling earth resounds his tread. Clap in his walie nieve a blade, Hell mak it whissle An legs an arms, an heads will sned, Like taps o thrissle. Ye Powrs, wha mak mankind your care, And dish them out their bill o fare, Auld Scotland wants nae skinking ware That jaups in luggies But,ye wish her gratefu prayer Gie her a haggis! "},{"url":null,"title":"new-highway-code-2022-test-new-rules-starting-today","story":"Major changes to the Highway Code requiring drivers to have more responsibility to look out for cyclists and pedestrians risk failing to boost safety due to not being widely promoted, campaigners have warned.Charity Cycling UK said that a “long-term and well-funded communications campaign” is needed to make people aware of the update.The Highway Code, which contains advice and rules for people on Britain’s roads, is being amended this weekend to introduce a risk-based hierarchy of road users.Here’s everything you need to know about what’s new as the rules of the roads receive an update.Hierarchy of road usersA new hierarchy means people in charge of vehicles that can cause the most harm in the event of a collision have the greatest responsibility to look out for other road users.Walking, cycling or riding in shared spacesCyclists should not overtake people walking or riding a horse in shared spaces closely or at high speed, while pedestrians should take care not to obstruct paths.Positioning of cyclistsCyclists should make themselves as visible as possible by riding in the centre of lanes on quiet roads, in slower-moving traffic and at the approach to junctions.Pedestrians crossing at junctionsTurning traffic should give way when people are crossing or waiting to cross at junctions.Traffic must give way to people on zebra crossings.Overtaking cyclistsDrivers travelling at speeds of up to mph should leave at least . metres when overtaking cyclists.They should give more space when overtaking at higher speeds.Opening car doorsCar occupants should open doors using their hand on the opposite side to the door, making them turn their head to look over their shoulder.This technique, known as the Dutch Reach, reduces the chances of doors being opened into the path of cyclists and motorcyclists.Overtaking cyclists at junctionsWhen cyclists are going straight ahead at a junction, they have priority over traffic waiting to turn into or out of a side road, unless road signs or markings indicate otherwise.Cycling in groupsPeople cycling can ride two abreast but should be considerate of the needs of other road users when in groups.RoundaboutsDrivers should take extra care when entering roundabouts to make sure they do not cut across cyclists.Electric vehicle chargingElectric car owners using a public chargepoint should park near the device and avoid creating a trip hazard from trailing cables."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/12800707.jpg?type=article-full","title":"runs-scotland-investigation-scotlands-corridors-power-full","story":"Our subscribers will get exclusive access to the people and organisations with signicant influence over so many aspects of our lives. From the hundreds of secret lobbying meetings to who really runs Scotlands wind farms, whisky and media -

Sam, , trained in Silversmithing and Metalwork at Camberwell School of Arts and Crafts in London but grew up on the Isle of Lewis and lived on Orkney for  years. “I started fishing again when I moved up to Orkney,” he explains. “I made a fish sculpture for the house and friends saw and liked it and wanted it for themselves, and everything grew from there.”Sam now lives in East Lothian, and says that the sea has always been a major feature in his le. He is an keen fisherman, er, swimmer and retains a deep fascination with the ocean and all its creatures.He notes: “My choice of subject, the fish, suits very much the material I work with. The metals seem to suit the hard, shininess of the fish. People like the aesthetic appeal of the fish, and I think it’s the same sort of fascination people have for the sea. I sell to fishermen and ious people the majority of whom are connected to the sea or rivers in some way.”From his studio Sam creates impressions of fish using the tactile effects that metal , its processes and techniques have to offer.“Because all the scales are hand done and beaten, you can go a wee bit mad,” he laughs. “I did once count how many hammer blows were in one of the herring that I do and there was .”Sam’s work has been featured on TV and he has also shown at group exhibitions in galleries including the House of Bruar, the Royal Scottish Academy, The Wykeham Gallery and Visions West Gallery, Montana.www.sam-macdonald ROIS SCOTTISH SEA GLASSFor Rois Clark, one person’s trash truly is another person’s treasure. Since , Rois, , has been creating unique pieces of jewellery from the sea glass she finds on Scotland’s coasts.“I’d noticed someone making shell and sea glass jewellery in Hawaii years ago, and I’d never seen it used that way before,” she says.“I started to look around beaches in Scotland and found we had our own sea glass. Then I noticed how dferent shores have produce dferent types of sea glass – the colours, types of bottles and textures were unique to the conditions of the that particular coastline.”Rois Clark Rois, who is based in Glasgow, admits the main source of satisfaction from her work derives from creating meaningful jewellery from broken pieces of old discarded glass.“My background is in Student Ministry,” she comments, “mostly working with younger vulnerable women.“I find it quite a prayerful practice making treasure out of the broken pieces – the action for me is a symbol of hope. We’ve all had our own tumultuous journey, and many vulnerable people can feel a little broken themselves, but when handled with care and attention things can change.”Rois collects her sea glass from over  beaches all over Scotland, gathering samples of ying shapes, colours, and textures. Each piece of jewellery is handpicked, handmade and comes with a map stating where it was found.She says: “I’d say  per cent of people who select my products choose it for the location aspect. A lot of the time people share a story about why that location means so much to them.”www.roisseaglass IONA TURNER ARTISTSince graduating from Glasgow School of Art last June, artist Iona Turner has impressed many with her original jewellery made from seaweed foraged from Scotland’s beaches.Growing up in Edinburgh, Iona chose  to spend a lot of her time by the sea and since the age of  she has been a seasonal surf instructor in East Lothian.Iona Turner “I began working with the materials that I was foraging there after developing a desire to make something using the natural surroundings,” she says.“I came to seaweed through foraging it for food, that’s how I got a bit more familiar with its materiality.“The process I have is low-impact and a sensitive approach to the seaweed – I don’t meddle too much with it before making my pieces.”Iona forages for seaweed that’s been ripped up by natural processes, such as after a storm or a big swell. The storm-cast knotted-wrack seaweed is used to make her bold statement pieces of jewellery.She says: “I really like that I get to collect the material myself and source it from places that I love. I also love working with a material where there is no waste from it – any discards are made into compost. And what I really enjoy most about the seaweed is that I get to be the supply chain.“I think my buyers are drawn to my pieces because of the sense of the closeness to nature and the fact that they are buying something that doesn’t have the same consumer guilt that other products can have. Just having that connection to a coastal place is also a big draw.”www.instagram iona.maker"},{"url":null,"title":"letters-partygate-shows-just-feeble-scotlands-voice","story":"Rudely ejected from his comfort blanket of unionist hegemony, Mr Smith confronts sustained support for independence and pondersSir Keir Starmer could be the man to “save” the Union with a shot of devolution max. This, of course, was exactly what was promised by Gordon Brown and David Cameron in . Instead, Westminster delivered Brexit, the UK Internal Market Bill, muscular unionism and the Government of Boris Johnston. I doubtMr Smith will find the answer to his fears in the Labour Party, which remains electorally irrelevant in Scotland.It is interesting that Mark Smith fails to mention the Scottish Conservatives as worthy opponents of the independence movement. Labelled as “lightweights” and “nobodies” by senior UK Government ministers, their beleaguered leader, Douglas Ross has now tasted the realpolitik of how Scotland is regarded by the UK Government. The Partygate fiasco has illustrated just how impotent all Scottish MPs are at Westminster, even when they belong to the party of government.However, I have good news for Mr Smith. The question of independence will soon be settled, perhaps much sooner than he thinks. Sustained pressure, both legal and democratic, will precipitate a second independence referendum. After all that has happened since , I am confident that the people of Scotland will choose to run their own affairs and Scotland will become an independent country. In common with all  nations which have gained independence from the UK, Scotland will not turn back but will rapidly establish its place in Europe, Nato and the UN as a thriving modern democracy. Mr Smith’s angst will be salved, the independence issue will be settled.Iain Gunn, Elgin.LABOUR MUST NOT PLAY THE SNP GAMEJUST who is advising Sir Keir Starmer on Scotlandhe thinks that the priority of any incoming Labour Government is more powers for Scotland Labour will only get elected again at a UK levelit looks and sounds like a Labour Party. It cannot out-compete the SNP on the constitutional question. If the Labour Party does not understand the value of being in a union, then what does it actually believe in  Surely it should understand what the arguments are.If it wants people to vote for it, then it should make itself visible and relevant to the electorate. Instead of trying to find an angle on the constitution, it should simply go out and find a whole lot of doctors, nurses, shop workers, lorry drivers and policemen to stand as candidates, people who really understand what is going on in the world at present. We will need  years to get properly out of the Covid situation. Concentrate on that, and Labour might stand a chance. Play the game that the SNP wants you to play and you can forget about it.Victor Clements, Aberfeldy.THE UKS MORAL BANKRUPTCYI AGREE with your correspondent Michael Sheridanwhen he describes the slogan \"Its Scotland Oil\" as depressing. To me the slogan represented the worst form of a narrow parochial nationalism, the opposite of what an outward-looking country should seek to be.However, Mr Sheridan and others who share his strongly unionist views have questions to answer, not least in outlining which institutions of the British state are worthy of respect. The question is all the more relevant, indeed pressing, considering that the British Prime Minister has shown utter disdain for these institutions, not least that of his own office. This contempt is glaringly obvious when we reflect on the Prime Ministers treatment of Parliament, the monarchy, the courts and very worryingly, devolution.Mr Sheridan goes on to say that our nation is a \"beacon of hope\" in the world Afghans, Iraqis and others may wish to disagree. He also says that when Scotland joined the Union the country was bankrupt. The worst form of bankruptcy is moral bankruptcy, something ubiquitous in the polity Mr Sheridan so admires.Brian Harvey, Hamilton.BALANCING UP DEMOCRACYI WAS astonished by the assertion from Jill Stephensonthat “the same amount of time andmoney” should be spent by those opposing Scottish self-government as by the elected Scottish Government. This implies that she is unaware of the Union Unit which was based in No , and fronted first by Luke Graham, then Oliver Lewis, or the Michael Gove-led Union Directorate. We also have the Union Strategy Committee, sitting above the Gove committee, all employing dozens of people across Whitehall, at substantial taxpayers expense: this without referencing the state propaganda outfit called the “Scottish Office”.All this has been going on for years, while the Scottish Government independence campaign has been in abeyance due to the pandemic. If Ms Stephenson takes off her blinkers, she must admit that the “time and money balancing” should be toward the pro-independence side: anything , as she asserts, is a “denial of justice and democracy”.GR Weir, Ochiltree.FRANCHISE IDEA IS DANGEROUSDOUGLAS McBeanadvocates extending the independence referendum franchise to all non-resident native Scots. That would be legitimatethe franchise were to be based on birth rather than residence but, for consistency, the quid pro quo would require removal of the franchise from any and all Scottish residents who were not Scottish by birth. Such a franchise test might go down well in Brexit-minded jurisdictions, but would surely be the wrong road to go down in an open-minded and welcoming European nation like our own.Willie Maclean, Milngavie.THE CASE FOR PR FOR WESTMINSTERCATRIONA C Clarkgives us a list of the places where the SNP has total dominance in the election of MPs. In doing so, she makes an excellent case for electoral reform at Westminster: it cannot be right that in  the SNP took  per cent of the seats on the basis of % – little over one-third – of the vote.Proportional representation would also have other wholly beneficial effects. It would stop the votes of non-nationalists being wasted and would indeed demonstrate that independence is only supported by a minority of Scottish voters. And at Westminster it would stop the SNP from taking its bogus position as the third party and its accompanying procedural and financial privileges. The only surprising thing is that the Tories and the Labour Party do not support electoral reform And before anyone asks, yes, I did support PR when first past the post disproportionately favoured the Labour Party.Peter A Russell, Glasgow.ARMS SALES MAKE LITTLE SENSEGEORGE Fergusson’s Agenda articlehighlights the UK arms industry.A great many British people are puzzled by and despair when it seems clear that the sheer availability of guns in the United States makes repeated mass killings of innocent citizens inevitable. Yet Britain and France, unlike Germany and Japan, have no compunction about ensuring the ready availability of far more deadly weapons to the Middle East and where, making mass killings on a far greater scale than in the schools and streets of the US also inevitable.Mr Fergusson comments that \"there is little public opposition\" to our continuing arms sales. To find the free availability of weapons to American civilians unacceptable, but to be totally relaxed about our Governments determined supply of deadly armaments throughout the world, makes little sense.Ronald MacLean, Kiltarlity, by Beauly.DONT LET COVID GUARD DOWNBA., the sub-lineage of Omicron, is spreading, as Helen McArdle points out . It is more transmissible than Omicron BA. and has become the dominant iant in Denmark and India. BA.’s arrival in the UK on December  last year, with , cases now identied in England , is a wake-up call.We cannot afford to do away with face masks being worn in schools, on public transport and in indoor spaces. We also need to reinstate social distancing at one or two metres, as BA. is likely to prolong the virus at higher rates into February and March.Humankind will always be vulnerable to Covid iants unless we in the West ensure Covid vaccines are made available worldwide, especially in Africa, where only six per cent of Africans are vaccinated. Big Pharma has to be forced to waive intellectual property rights to Covid vaccines so that developing nations can produce Covid vaccines locally. In this way we can eventually get back to some real sort of normal.Sean Clerkin, Barrhead.Read more: Shame on those who want to abandon the Union for sordid gain"},{"url":null,"title":"letters-scottish-government-needs-take-big-decisions-dysfunctional-calmac-ferry-operation","story":"The second point is that Calmac is not, of itself, “Scotland’s ferry network”, but one of no fewer than  year-round vehicle ferry providers operating in Scottish waters, which collectively carry signicantly more traffic than Calmac. Of these four are local authorities that underwrite any operational deficit. Four are commercial private operators that operate at a profit and are unfunded by the public purse, and in each case provide superior service to comparable state-funded services in terms of capacity, frequency and longer hours of operation. Oneis a commercial management company funded to operate ferries on behalf of the Scottish Government and then there is the state-owned David MacBrayne Group  Calmac, also funded to operate ferries on behalf of the Scottish Government.Bearing in mind the current multiplicity of ferry owning and operational practice in Scotland, there is no fundamental reason why the number of state-funded tenders should be restricted to two. It has often been stated that the large Calmac fleet enables vessels to be replaced easily in the event of breakdown or other disruption. In practice Calmac performs worse in this regard than almost all other Scottish operators, with frequent service disruption and capacity constraints being widely criticised by the communities affected.Of course de-bundling is anathema to the RMT “monopoly”, but the Scottish Government must decide whether the huge and ever-growing sums devoted to one dysal ferry operator is for the benefit and largesse of Calmac’s personnel or the well-being of the communities it purports to serve.Roy Pedersen, Inverness.PUNISHED FOR USING SCOTSHUGH Macdonald’s articlecertainly struck a chord with me regarding the Scottish “cringe” or feelings of inferiority, in particular when it relates to the way we speak. We are all aware of the days when Gaelic-speaking children were punished for using their own first language, but children were also punished for using Scots. Indeed even at home many of us were forbidden to speak anything other than the King’s English.My mother, born in , was brought up to have a lelong disdain for anything Scottish, considering most things as being inferior to English. After my paternal grandmother died, my grandfather came to live with us, and spoke with a broad Arbroath accent. This irritated my mother and she was upset when my speech started to adopt elements of his Angus tongue. So when I was about , she sent me to elocution lessons to “improve” the way I spoke. This was something I detested and something I had to keep from my schoolmates.However, her desire to make me sound “proper” backfired. My elocution teacher was impressed with the timbre of my recently-broken baritone voice and immediately set me to memorise and recite some poems – in Scots. I can still remember my mother’s look of horror when I started reciting “Willie Wastle dwalt on Tweed, the spot they ca’ed it Linkumdoddie. Willie was a wabster gude. Could stown a clue wi ony body”. It wasn’t the misogynistic content of Burns’ poem that bothered her – it was the Scots tongue.Unsurprisingly and to my great relief my lessons came to a rapid end, and to this day, almost  years later, I can still remember Willie Wastle well enough to recite it almost word perfect.Thanks, Rabbie.Neil Scott, Edinburgh.AN EGREGIOUS COMPLAINTI MUST object to the egregious overuse in yours and other areas of the media of the word “egregious”.We must put a stop to this egregious invasion of our language before it becomes too late.Even friends of mine who, until now, have spoken normally have taken to using this word, of which they were not aware until Boris Johnson became Prime Minister.Whilst I do not believe they are using this word egregiously, I believe the egregiousness can be laid at the door of the media whose egregious focusing on a word that sounds more learned than it is is truly egregious.By the way, the word originates from the Latin “egregius” meaning “outstanding”. So I remain, with all due humility, your egregious correspondent.William Thomson, Denny.THE TIRESOME FORWARD THINKINGR RUSSELL Smithdoes well to compose a letter containing so many of Britains endangered sayings.Of equal concern must be the plethora of new sayings now familiar to most of us.Business leaders, politicians and committee men and women never tire of telling us how their new policy will benefit us going forward.

We work closely with Glasgow Le on international marketing campaigns and this activity will be able to build on the recent success where Glasgow has been the second most popular destination in bookings from the US, based on total gross room nights booked through the online travel company.“The city’s recovery from the pandemic is essential to Scotland’s visitor economy overall and we continue to work with our partners on key campaigns promoting Glasgow as a UNESCO City of Music and theof the Burrell Collection in March.”"},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/12094681.jpg?type=article-full","title":"sustainability-not-just-fleeting-fashion","story":" While retailers fought to keep customers safe, keep shelves stocked and maintain sales during the pandemic, new research from UK law firm TLT reveals that they were engaged in another signicant battle - the one to keep sustainability at the top of the corporate agenda. After years of progress, and despite the climate emergency being thrust into the global limelight with COP, the onset of a global pandemic - coupled with other crises - means that for a quarterof retailers sustainability has in fact gone down the agenda over the last year. % would even go so far as to say it has done so \"quickly\". The research, based on interviews with  leading UK retailers in October , reveals that one-fthof retailers say sustainability is not currently important to their business, with % saying “not at all”.TLT’s report, titled Sustainability Matters – putting the ‘eco’ in retail economics reveals the impact of the “great storm” of issues retailers are facing following the pandemic. More than halfadmit sustainability has had to take a step back due to Covid-, with the figure rising to two-thirdsof fashion and beauty retailers.The current supply chain crisis also comes to the fore as retailers continue to fight to keep shelves stocked and fulfil online orders. Some % of retailers also say there is a risk that sustainability will fall down their list of prioritiesthe crisis continues.Highlighting the need for sustainability to be embedded from the top down in an organisation, only two-fthsof retailers say the main person responsible for sustainability in their business has “signicant” or “high” influence on company decisions and projects.Sustainability, meanwhile, is also in a “battle of the priorities” with profits, with the vast majorityof retailers saying their shareholders look at profits before sustainability, and % believing that sustainability will never be of equal importance to profit.In addition, % of retailers admit their business sees sustainability more as a cost centre than a cost saver, despite sustainable initiatives – such as shared logistics – having the potential to improve efficiencies, reduce environmental impact and cut costs in the long-term.More positively, over halfof retailers say sustainability is important to their business, and % say it has moved up the agenda over the last year, while % say their approach to sustainability is becoming less organic and more strategic. Three-quartershave announced sustainability improvements, one-fthare giving customers a choice between standard and sustainable deliveries, and % have launched a new line of sustainable products separate from their standard offering.The increasingly high-profile area of rental and resale also comes to the fore, with % of fashion and beauty retailers and % of retailers in the lestyle and leisure sectors launching their own rental or resale service.Howard Beach, partner at TLT, comments: “Our research reveals just how vulnerable sustainability is to other priorities facing the retail sector at the moment. “These other pressures – like the supply chain crisis and staff shortages – are likely to continue for some time, so there’s an urgent need to find a way of balancing these demands. Retailers need to appoint people with the right expertise who can set the right strategy and oversee its implementation. They need to have credibility and a voice that is heard at the highest levels of the business.“At the same time, this isn’t something that can fall to just one person or team. It needs to be part of how the business operates, and people need clear communication and support in their roles. Simply put, sustainability cannot afford to lose this battle of the priorities to the extent that it has done for a quarter of retailers over the last year.”Meanwhile, just % of retailers – and % of grocers – are “very confident” they will meet the expectations of the Competition and Markets Authoritywhen it investigates misleading green claims this year.The finding comes as % of retailers say they are under pressure to make their position on sustainability more visible, and % are becoming more vocal about their sustainability credentials – despite % admitting it’s impossible for retailers to knowthey’re doing enough to say they’re sustainable.TLT’s Sustainability Matters – putting the “eco” in retail economics report identies three types of retailer:The report also highlights the fact that the biggest pressure to be more sustainable is coming from the Government and regulators , closely followed by customers , shareholders investorsand the media . Some % of retailers are becoming more vocal about their sustainability credentials, while just one-fthhave taken the bold move to position themselves as a “sustainable business”.Highlighting the growing legal risks associated with green claims, three-quartersof retailers say customers misunderstand claims about sustainability, while one-fthsuggest they do so “often”.TLT’s research also reveals that many retailers are signicantly more concerned about the PR risksof “greenwashing” than the legal risks, with only % worried about civil claims and % worried about regulatory prosecutions.According to retailers, the biggest barrier to preventing greenwashing is competing priorities , followed by the time it takes to do what’s neededand a lack of budget .One-quarterof retailers blame a lack of accepted benchmarks and definitions for terms such as “green”, “ethical” and “sustainable”, while one-fth blame a lack of in-house skillsand a lack of board-level support for sustainability .Mr Beach points out that the messaging from the CMA has been very clear. “The CMA has already announced that it is prioritising the fashion industry as part of its full-scale review this year,\" he notes.“The review should be a concern for all retailers who arenot only promoting their own businesses but also repeating or relying on the sustainability claims of their suppliers. Retailers who haven’t already done so need to familiarise themselves with the CMA’s Green Claims Code and its list of  questions. “They should review their internal procedures to identy where the risks might be and what changes might be needed.” www.tltsolicitors "},{"url":null,"title":"cross-country-skiing-winter-olympics-2022-rules-team-gb-competitors","story":"Men and women can both compete in long distance events, some as long as km, shorter events such as km, and relay events.Competitors compete to complete the set distance in as short a time as possible.There are six dferent disciplines for both men and women.The women will compete in the km classic, .km + .km skiathlon, km mass start, freestyle sprint, classic team sprint, and the xkm relay.While men will participate in the km classic, km + km skiathlon, km mass start, freestyle sprint, classic team sprint, and the xkm relay.There will be no Team GB athletes competing in cross country skiing in Beijing.February February February February February February February February February "},{"url":null,"title":"green-scotland-cop26-climate-investigation-full","story":"Our subscribers will get exclusive access as we look to answer the pressing questions in Scotlands climate crisis fight.As the COP conference looms on the horizon, we will leave no stone unturned in a bid to stimulate discussion and debate on this crucial topic.Find out more about our exclusive £ for two months offer here. From the hundreds of sites and big-name companies that broke environmental rules, to the most polluted streets in Scotland, readers can expect ground-breaking exclusives, in-depth analysis, and interactive content – as well as regular live videos, giving you the chance to speak directly with the award-winning reporters behind the stories.Here, you can find every article published in the week-long investigation so far - with this piece being updated daily with new exclusive stories.To make sure you do not miss out on the high-quality insight, join us today by taking out a subscription for just £ for two months here.More than  industrial sites across Scotland have been officially damned as “unsatisfactory” on pollution, according to data from the Scottish Environment Protection Agencyseen by The Ferret.Sepa assessed the environmental performance of two big oil companies, ExxonMobil and Ineos, as “very poor” in .

It is more important than ever we all get vaccinated to protect ourselves, our family and friends. Boosters increase our protection against the virus up to more than  per cent.We talk to myth-busting medical experts who answer your most frequently asked questions about these essential jabs. vw, px\"  What protection does a booster jab give Dr Emeka Okorocha, who works in AE in London and South East, said: “As a doctor, I have seen first-hand the effect COVID- can have on people. I want to remind everyone you can still get seriously ill with the virus, so it is so important to get the jab to keep ourselves, your friends and loved ones safe. COVID- is highly infectious. The vaccine remains our best line of defence against it. Omicron is highly transmissible and still has the potential to lead to signicant numbers of people in hospital, so it’s so important your immunity is topped up, and to come forward for your first or second doseyou haven’t already. We don’t know what threat any future iants may pose, soyou haven’t come forward for any jabs, it is absolutely essential you do so.”When can you have a booster jab Yorkshire-based Professor Mahendra G Patel OBE, Pharmacy and Inclusion and Diversity Lead, said: “You can get a COVID- booster three months after your second dose and  days after positive COVID test. It’s also not too late to get a first or second dose. Getting the vaccine has never been easier. Everybody aged  and over have now been offered two doses of a COVID- vaccine. If you are  years old or above on the day the vaccinations are taking place in school, you will be able to access a vaccine.If you have not yet had a COVID- vaccine, it’s not too late. Appointments for first doses of COVID- vaccines are still available for anyone unvaccinated.”Is it safe to have a booster jabI’m pregnant London-based Dr Jenny Jardine from Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, who is also seven months pregnant and has had her COVID- booster jab, said: “Both as a doctor and pregnant mother myself, we can now be very confident the COVID- vaccinations provide the best possible protection for you and your unborn child against this virus. I would strongly call on all pregnant women like me,you haven’t had the vaccine yet, to either speak to your GP or midweyou still have questions and then book right away today.”Does a booster jab carry side effects Dr Okorocha said: “The COVID- vaccine is quick, easy and free. Don’t worry about the side effects. Like all medicines, the COVID- vaccines may cause some side effects, but most of these are mild and short-term, lasting no longer than a week, and not everyone gets them. Also,you weren’t able to get your booster dose because you had COVID-, remember to book your jab  days after you no longer have the virus.”How easy is it to get a booster jab Bradford-based NHS Dr Amir Khan said: “We know many people are juggling busy lives, which is exactly why the NHS is making it as easy as possible for you to get your booster. New walkin vaccination sites have been set up across the country, and existing sites have extended their opening hours, so as many people as possible can get jabbed as soon as possible. And, once you’ve had your vaccine, then why not encourage your friends and family to book as well, so we all have the best protection possible.”How effective is a booster jab Prof Patel said: “New analysis of vaccine efficacy by UKHSA has found protection against hospitalisation from vaccines is good against the Omicron iant. When the reduced risk of hospitalisation was combined with vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic disease, the vaccine effectiveness against hospitalisation was estimated as  per cent two weeks after a booster dose. One dose of any vaccine was associated with a  per cent reduced risk of hospitalisation among symptomatic cases with the Omicron iant, two doses with a  per cent reduction up to  weeks after the second dose and a  per cent reduced risk  or more weeks after the second dose.”Your booster jab is vital vw, px\"  copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Children from P , P  and P  are instead accessing learning from home. Three classes — P, P  and P — and the nursery remain open.On Monday evening, Orkney Islands Council shared hopes to reopen the school fully on Wednesday, with further updates to be confirmed today, Tuesday.Head teacher Islean Gibson has been meeting with representatives from the education service and public health on a daily basis and this will continue as required.She has also been communicating directly with families on the ever-evolving situation and is heartened by the support shown.“We are confident that the home learning on offer to our three classes is working well for families at this time,# Miss Gibson said.#Part of our meeting involved planning for the rest of this week, and I will be writing out to everyone as soon as is possible tomorrow to let parents know what we hope we can provide across the remainder of this week.“It has been an exceptionally tough day for staff and a tricky balance in terms of in class teaching and making sure we have learning going home, so I thank all from the bottom of my heart for the understanding as we all try to get to grips with our new normal for today and tomorrow. To say the team at Dounby have rallied is nowhere near thanks enough.”OIC executive director of education, leisure and housing, James Wylie, added: “The school is experiencing a high number of teaching and support staff absences due to sickness which includes COVID, and this is now coupled with an increasing number of pupils being off across some of the classes too.“Whilst there are  reported COVID-positive LFD and PCR cases within the staff and pupils at the school, it is the combination of all the sickness absences that has led to this decision. We are looking to all measures to try and ensure the school can operate in full from Wednesday, and this will be communicated tomorrow.“Please be assured that we are doing everything we possibly can to get back to normal as soon as possible. I want to also commend the Head Teacher and her team for stepping up in these dficult circumstances.”Despite a relaxation of restrictions nationwide, it remains vital for everyone to continue carrying out lateral flow tests and to report the result, whether positive, negative or void here: https:www.nhsinform.scot # coronavirus-covid-#copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It is moored on a single tension tether. The subsea location and ability to winch low in the water column enables extreme storm loadings to be avoided so that the device can continue to operate in rough sea conditions. The Waveswing is designed to react to long ocean swell waves as well as short, wind-driven seas, for high energy capture.The £. million prototype project has been funded by Wave Energy Scotlandas part of the Novel Wave Energy Converter development programme. The demonstration at EMEC is also supported by the Interreg North-West Europe’s Ocean DEMO project.Neil Kermode, managing director, EMEC said:“We’re delighted to welcome AWS and the Archimedes Waveswing to Orkney and support its deployment and testing at our site in Scapa Flow.“Real sea deployment is a vital step in proving performance, reliability and survivability of these devices. We know that prototype testing at sea is really valuable to technology developers to check how a technology and its components work and react in the environment prior to scaling up. We are looking forward to helping the team as they prove how to install, operate and maintain their exciting machine in Orkney’s harsh conditions.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

We do not know what will happen to the fall. Whether there will be a new iant,” Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen told Danish radio.Health authorities urged Danes to get tested regularly to keep an epidemic surveillance andneeded, “react quicklynecessary”, as health minister Magnus Heunicke said last week.The Danish government has warned that Denmark could see a rise in infections in the coming weeks and said that a fourth vaccination shot might be necessary.The restrictions were originally introduced in July but were removed about  weeks later after a successful vaccination drive. They were reintroduced when infections soared.In , Denmark became one of the first European countries to close schools because of the pandemic and sent home all non-critical public employees.The head of the Danish Health Authority, Søren Brostrøm, told Danish broadcaster TV his attention was on the number of people in ICUs, rather than on the number of infections.He said that number had “fallen and fallen and is incredibly low.”He said  coronavirus patients are in ICUs. Several weeks ago, that figure was .In neighbouring Finland, Covid- restrictions will end this month, with Prime Minister Sanna Marin saying her Social Democratic-led government would negotiate with the other parties in parliament the timetable for the removal of the measures.On Monday, border controls at the internal borders between Finland and the other Schengen countries that form Europe’s ID check-free travel area ended.That restriction was introduced at the end of December to slow down the spread of Omicron.Travellers coming from outside the EU will continue to meet border controls at least until February .We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

She#s in Cruickston # there is quite a big estate there and when I went for a walk there, I came across a park almost every minute of the walk. I was amazed how many there were there.“I put up a post about this on Facebook # as the two parks we have in Portree are not really looked after and are quite dilapidated.“I asked why we can’t do better for our kids here. It started a big conversation and got loads of people talking about it. Lots of parks were mentioned where local groups had got together to develop them, like the one in Plockton and the one in Kyleakin.”Tfany was given a helping hand by friend Gary Shinnie who suggested the old park in Matheson Place, which had been left to rot, and agreed to assemble a squad of volunteers to help clear the site.After chatting to Highland Councillor John Gordon, Drew Millar from the local community council, and the Portree and Braes Community Trust, and a representative from the Lochalsh and Skye Housing Association it was decided that the best way for Tfany to take the project forward would be through the Trust’s Outdoor Activity group.The project was able to acquire £, from the National Lottery, and the group raised £,. last Friday and Saturday at the Co-op in Portree.Commenting on the response, Tfany said: #Friday and Saturday wasn#t just about fundraising it was also about making people aware of the project.“When people were standing and put their signatures down, we were able to explain to them what we were doing, and when they saw the plans, most people said that it was a great idea, and they loved the fact that it had things for children with special needs in it.”The group is raising money through funding applications, a JustGiving page, and is also inviting businesses to get involved in supporting the project too.A D plan of the play park has been made by Kompan, who also worked on the new playpark in Kyleakin.The park will comprise  dferent play activities including four swings, an octopus seesaw, a carousel, a four-tower unit with a tunnel and a slide, it will be able to accommodate  users of all ages.Although there’s still plenty to do to bring the play park to le, Tfany is confident that it will happen, and this year.to donate to project."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Sanas-Padlet-266-x-150-mm-1.jpg","title":"dreuchd ur ann an","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineADVERTISING FEATURE: NEW YEAR, NEW CAREERAig an àm seo den bhliadhna, bidh sinn tric a’ smaoineachadh air ar dreuchdan atharrachadh agus mar sin is dòcha gum bi an goireas ùr aig Bòrd na Gàidhlig feumail dhuibh ma tha sibh a’ beachdachadh air dreuchd ùr ann an teagasg tro mheadhan na Gàidhlig.’S e goireas didseatach a th’ ann am padlet far a bheil làraich-lìn, sgrìobhainnean agus bhideothan air an cruinneachadh air balla.

They prefer instead to view Gaelic as a natural medium for their music # a not atypical outlook for their island generation raised with the language as part of their education during the s.And this should be encouraging, for the key to the future survival of the language will lie not in its exceptionalism, but in its ordinariness.While Gaelic may be natural to Niteworks, what sets them apart is how they use it. Their trademark sound is forged from the rich Hebridean song tradition of their native communities, and the dance music they listened to in their bedrooms, and later in Glasgow nightclubs.They have just released their third album # A’ Ghrian,– which follows the eponymous debut album of  and Air Fàir An Làwhich came out in .In what should have been one of the marquee events of Glasgow’s Celtic Connections festival, last Friday Niteworks should have been on stage with the Royal Scottish National Orchestra. But to immense frustration and disappointment, Covid restrictions were not been lted in time and the concert has been rescheduled for the summer.Unsurprisingly, lockdown and the pandemic are themes that have influenced the new album, says band member Allan MacDonald.. “It has been over two years since I have been to a club as a punter.“That was a huge part of our lives. I wouldn’t say it has changed our musical tastes, but what we listen to at home now is dferent to what we would listen to in a club.“That has influenced us and the direction we are going as a band. We’re also getting a bit older, there’s two in the band that have young families now and this album is perhaps a bit more reflective than the others.”It is approaching  years since the quartet put on their first gig – at Braes Hall as part of the year of Highland culture celebrations in . Their first EP followed in , and Niteworks have since become regulars on the festival circuit # including annual appearances at SkyeLive in Portree.They aren’t full time as a band, however, and online rehearsing was a familiar process to them long before the outset of the pandemic.Allan, who is from Braes and from a family of pipers, works in renewable energy and is based in London. Synth and keyboard player Innes Strachan from Breakish works in sound production in Glasgow drummer Ruaraidh Graham, also from Breakish, works in Edinburgh for Historic Environment Scotland and bass player Chris Nicolson, from Braes, is with the BBC in Inverness.One of their ‘lockdown projects’ included writing the music to mark Edinburgh’s Hogmanay, and in turn this led to the orchestral collaboration and the more ‘expansive and cinematic’ sound of the new album, says Ruairidh Graham.“We were partly inspired by our work writing the music for Edinburgh’s Hogmanay Fare Well film that reflected on what  had been like for many during the pandemic,” he adds. “The nature of the project required broad expansive sounds, and that led to us going further in that direction through the writing and recording of the album.“Our upcoming orchestral concert for Celtic Connections further reinforced our desire to keep down that path.”There is an abundance of vocal talent to be found on A’ Ghrian, including from long-time collaborators Sian . Celebrated Scottish singers Kathleen MacInnes, Beth Malcolm, Hannah Rarity and Alasdair Whyte also feature, and Niteworks have incorporated English folk and Scots songs into their repertoire for the first time.The album, which was funded by Creative Scotland and recorded in autumn , also features Fiona MacAskill, Aileen Reid and Laura Wilkie of Kinnaris Quintet alongside Susan Appelbe on strings.A’ Ghrian is available to buy on CD and stream and download on all digital s, and the band will tour the until the end of .

Although I am still in my first year of the course, I have already learnt new skills and I would recommend the Foundation Degree option and The Gallaher Trust’s Scholarship Scheme to other students.“I wasn’t really interested in staying on at school to do A Levels as I just wanted to concentrate on computing, so I decided to apply to Northern Regional College when I learnt about The Gallaher Trust’s Scholarship Scheme.“I’m really enjoying learning about the dferent aspects of the IT industry and I’m getting a feel for what area I might like to work in in the future. If anyone is thinking about applying for a Gallaher Trust Scholarship next year, I would simply say, ‘just do it.’ The Scheme helps with job opportunities and allows participants to get a good start on whatever career path they want to go down while also helping with fees.”Christine Brown, Vice Principal of Teaching and Learning at Northern Regional College commented: “We are delighted that Scholarship Scheme recipients, James and David, are enjoying their respective courses.“We partnered with The Gallaher Trust to help more young people in the Ballymena area to gain the skills and qualications they will need to build successful careers in their chosen area.“I have no doubt that the scholarships will be invaluable to the successful applicants in terms of helping them develop new skills, getting an opportunity to complete a third level qualication and securing a job in a sector they’re truly passionate about.”Roy Douglas, a Trustee of The Gallaher Trust’s Board added: “At The Gallaher Trust, our mission is to create jobs, develop skills and provide assistance to those from a disadvantaged background and through the Scholarship Scheme, we’re ticking all of those boxes.“We want to ensure that the Scholarship Scheme graduates have the opportunity to learn the skills and gain the qualications they need to carve out a successful career. “It’s our hope that the Scheme will serve to create a pool of well qualied and high“ly skilled young adults who will meet the needs of local employers.”The Scholarship Scheme will support six Ballymena students, two per year for three years over a two-year specic subject course. Applications are now invited for the   academic year.

While he had wanted to make the climb last year, the pandemic scuppered those plans.But he took off from Heathrow on New Year’s Day for Buenos Aires. This was followed by a connecting flight to Mendoza, and a four-and-a-half-hour bus journey to Aconcagua.Eight hours of climbing for just over two weeks meant he was burning close to , calories daily.

The CEO’s salary is set by the remuneration and performance committee which is made up of three members of the board, known as the Council. All of our board members are volunteers.”Unicef Ireland’s director, Peter Power, has an annual salary of €, , while St Vincent de Paul’s national director , Andy Heffernan, brings home between €, and €, Agnes Lunny is the chief executive of learning disability charity Positive Futures, based in Northern Ireland, and Positive Futures Ireland, based in the Republic.Her combined salary for both roles is £, annually.In her response to this newspaper request, Ms Lunny said: “My average working week across both roles is + hours, more often than not  hours. That puts my hourly pay at between £ and £.“My salary was recently increased following a benchmarking exercise against similar roles in Health  Social Care.”All-Ireland wellbeing charity Inspire’s chief executive, Kerry Anthony, has an annual salary of between £, and £,. An Inspire spokesperson said: “You will see from our accounts that our income mostly comes from contracts for services with very little coming from donations from the public. Any donations we do get from the public to support our work go straight to the projects for which they are raised and don’t contribute to the pay of our CEO.”Ulster Unionist MLA Andy Allen, a member of Stormont’s Communities Committee, said he can understand why some may be concerned by charity bosses taking in large salaries, however the signicant amount of work they undertake must be taken into account.“The structure and complexity of modern charities require leadership and ability at the highest levels to ensure the organisation is managed effectively to deliver vital support services for their beneficiaries,” he said.“While I understand fully the public concern that salaries of some charity chief executives are over £,, it is important to recognise the experience and skills required to run an organisation that employs hundreds of people, manages millions of pounds of public money and donations — delivering vital services to our most needy and vulnerable.If an inidual could earn more in a similar position in the private sector, as is the case in many of these examples, then how can our charities attract the best and most qualied leaders to ensure services to those most in need are deliveredthey are not offering a comparable salary that recognises the skills and experience needed ”In December , it emerged that the then-Communities Minister Caral Ni Chuilin had commissioned an independent review of the Charity Commission, following a report by senior civil servant Jonathan Baume looking at how the Department for Communities handled complaints in relation to the Commission.Responding to an Assembly question about the Baume report’s recommendations by TUV leader Jim Allister at the time, Ms Ni Chuilin said: “The former Head of the Civil Servicecommissioned a review into how the Department for Communities had handled a number of complaints from a member of the public in relation to the Charity Commission.“HOCS asked my Department to respond to the suggestions set out in the review. These are currently being progressed, including consideration of the Department’s role as the custodian of charity regulation law and policy and sponsor for the Commission.“The Department’s Head of Governance has also written to the Chief Commissioner to seek assurances in relation to matters highlighted in the Review.“In order to restore public confidence in a system that has undoubtedly been damaged, I have also decided to commission an independent review of charity regulation including a review of the performance of the Charity Commission in its role as statutory regulator.”Related topicsAndy AllenJim AllisterDepartment for CommunitiesMore On Andy Allen PremiumViewpointOpinionCharities must look at sky-high salaries PremiumShock figures show  died while waiting for place to call home last year PremiumDurkan ‘shocked’ that Stormont minister ed almost £m in funding PremiumQuestions raised after Justice Department s £m to Finance Department as PSNI faces budget shortfall PremiumHousing Executive owns more than  acres of unused land while, people on homes waiting listMost ReadCondolences offered to Sir Jeffrey Donaldson following the death of his brother AndrewRevealed: The Northern Ireland charity chief paid as much as the First MinistersPSNI officers wear brand new unorm for first time in  yearsRarely-seen Bloody Sunday pictures: Twelve minutes that changed Derry foreverColeraine woman thanks shoppers who ‘saved her le’ in TescoTop VideosPlayPSNI officers wear brand new unorm for first time in  yearsPlayVideo: Jamie Dornan dismisses bond rumours at Belfast premiere PlayVideo: Veteran DUP politician Jim Wells aims his future sights on punditry Latest Northern IrelandPM’s Jimmy Savile jab at Starmer is ‘wrong and cannot be defended’, says former NI SecretaryLegal challenge warning over decision to stand down teaching regulatorTransfer deadline day: Cltonville fail in Ronan Hale pursuit as Linfield’s ‘no-nonsense’ signing Ben Hall ready for fresh startOisin Smyth ready for ‘fantastic opportunity’ at Oxford United as boss hails ‘very impressive’ deadline day signingSecond climate bill backed by Agriculture Minister Edwin Poots to be debated in Assembly todayLatestCulture Secretary Nadine Dorries announces ‘sector vision’ reviewThe Ulster Business Podcast: Episode  - Nuala Murphy, Diversity Mark NIYorkshire announces partnership with second overseas clubMan denies intent to cause criminal damage over protest at Sajid Javid’s homeRail firm uses more than , litres of cleaning solution in just  months,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

These revelations extend far beyond the gardens of No. .In Northern Ireland, Sinn Fein ministers took to the streets of West Belfast for the funeral of an IRA man Bobby Storey in flagrant breach of the very Covid regulations that they were responsible for writing.”He added: “The DUP supports the call for a comprehensive public inquiry into the handling of the Covid- response right across our United Kingdom.This is needed to ensure mistakes are not repeated in future crises. Actions by government ministers and senior officials should not be out of reach of such an investigation. Indeed, no decision, policy or position should be off limits.”SDLP leader Colum Eastwood renewed calls for Boris Johnson to resign as Prime Minister following the publication of the report.The Foyle MP said that Mr Johnson must accept responsibility for the “clear wrongdoing and failure of leadership” which has eroded public confidence and corroded the institutions of government.“Any objective reading of Sue Gray’s update demonstrates that the rules were broken,” he said.The only question for Boris Johnson now is whether he will follow the habit of a letime and blame everyone  for his pattern of wrongdoing or whether he will take responsibility, admit what he has done and resign.”But the PM said Mr Eastwood has “really got to read the report and he’s got to wait… everything he said I’m afraid is not substantiated by the report, he should look and wait for the police inquiry”.Alliance MP Stephen Farry said evasive responses from the Prime Minister suggested he wasn’t genuinely sorry.“Does he recognise the long-term damage he risks doing to historic norms of democracy  Is it right that they are sacriced in the interests of one man who refused to do what the country knows needs to happen ” he asked.“And can he point to one single example where he personally has improved standards in public le ”Mr Johnson responded: “How about honouring the wishes of the people by delivering Brexit in spite of attempts to subvert democracy”.Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis backed the embattled Prime Minister. He believes the PM was right to accept all of the findings in Ms Gray’s report and said he will act to make changes.Mr Lewis described as “nonsense” calls from Labour leader Keir Starmer for the PM to be ousted.

It granted limited autonomy to the Palestinian Authority at the height of the peace process in the s and withdrew its soldiers and settlers from Gaza in .But Amnesty and the other groups say the fragmentation of the territories in which Palestinians live is part of an overall regime of control designed to maintain Jewish hegemony from the Mediterranean to the Jordan River.They point to discriminatory policies within Israel and in annexed east Jerusalem Israel’s blockade of the Gaza Strip, which has been ruled by the Hamas militant group since  and its de facto annexation of the West Bank, where it exerts overall control and is actively building and expanding Jewish settlements that most of the international community considers illegal.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Palestinians have accused Israel of apartheid for decades. The Palestinian Authority, which administers parts of the occupied West Bank and co-operates with Israel on security, welcomed the report.Amnesty traces such policies back to the establishment of Israel in . Around , Palestinians fled or were expelled during the Arab-Israeli war surrounding Israel’s creation. They accounted for % of the Palestinian population in what is now Israel. Israel barred the refugees from ing in order to maintain its Jewish majority.Its extremist language and distortion of historical context were designed to demonise Israel and pour fuel onto the fire of antisemitismIsrael#s Foreign Ministry on Amnesty InternationalThe Palestinians remaining inside Israel lived under military rule until shortly before the  Middle East war, when Israel captured east Jerusalem, the West Bank and Gaza – territories the Palestinians want for their future state.Today, Palestinians inside Israel have citizenship, including the right to vote, and some have reached the upper echelons of business, law, medicine and entertainment. But overall, they face widespread discrimination in areas like the job and housing markets. Palestinians in the West Bank live under Israeli military rule, and those in Hamas-ruled Gaza also face a crippling Israeli and Egyptian blockade.Palestinians make up about % of Israel’s . million population, but the Jewish and Arab populations are roughly equal when including the West Bank and Gaza.“Since its establishment in , Israel has pursued a policy of establishing and maintaining a Jewish demographic hegemony and maximising its control over land to benefit Jewish Israelis while restricting the rights of Palestinians and preventing Palestinian refugees from ing to their homes,” Amnesty said. “Israel extended this policy to the West Bank and Gaza Strip, which it has occupied ever since.”Israel dismissed the previous reports as biased, but has adopted a far more adversarial stance toward Amnesty, accusing it of antisemitism and of delegitimising Israel’s existence even before the report was published.“Its extremist language and distortion of historical context were designed to demonise Israel and pour fuel onto the fire of antisemitism,” the Foreign Ministry said on Monday.It is dficult to distinguish between questions that have to do with security policy, with competing national claims, and what is a racist agendaYuval Shany, Israel Democracy InstituteAgnes Callamard, the secretary general of Amnesty, rejected those accusations as “baseless attacks” and “bare-faced lies”. She said Amnesty recognises the state of Israel and denounces antisemitism, and that accusations to the contrary are “nothing more than a desperate attempt to evade scrutinyert attention from our findings”.None of the reports compared Israel to apartheid South Africa, where a system based on white supremacy and racial segregation was in place from  until . Instead, they evaluated Israel’s policies based on international conventions like the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court . It defines apartheid as “an institutionalised regime of systematic oppression and domination by one racial group over any other racial group”.The ICC is already investigating potential war crimes committed by Israel and Palestinian militants in recent years. After last year’s Gaza war, the UN Human Rights Council set up a permanent commission of inquiry to investigate abuses against Palestinians in Israel, the West Bank and Gaza, including “systematic discrimination and repression based on national, ethnic, racial or religious identity”.Such a commission is the most intrusive type of investigative body the council can create, and for the first time, this one was given an “ongoing” or permanent mandate.Israel has accused the ICC and the UN rights body of being biased against it and of singling it out while other countries commit far worse violations.Yuval Shany, a senior fellow at the Israel Democracy Institute and member of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem Faculty of Law, said it is “highly unlikely” the ICC would pursue apartheid allegations given the complexities involved.\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news world-news ad .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_aaf-eb-be-a-befd_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news world-news ad .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_aaf-eb-be-a-befd_embedded w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeClose\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news world-news ad .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_aaf-eb-be-a-befd_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news world-news ad .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_aaf-eb-be-a-befd_embedded w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"A Palestinian family sits around wood set alight in a fireplace their home in a slum during a cold weather in Gaza City AP PA Images FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueA Palestinian family sits around wood set alight in a fireplace their home in a slum during a cold weather in Gaza City He said the apartheid claim is “extreme and quite unfounded” within Israel, despite there being discrimination. The situation in the territories “is much more complicated”.“There you do have elements which could qualy as discrimination, segregation and oppression, given theof the occupation,” he said. “It is dficult to distinguish between questions that have to do with security policy, with competing national claims, and what is a racist agenda.”Using the language of apartheid is “a bridge too far”, he said.Israeli foreign minister Yair Lapid told reporters last month that he expected intensied efforts this year to brand Israel as an apartheid state that could lead to it being banned from sporting or cultural events. He said that reviving a political process with the Palestinians would help to combat those efforts.The peace process ground to a halt more than a decade ago, and Israel’s current prime minister, Naftali Bennett, is opposed to Palestinian statehood. He heads an unwieldy coalition that includes more moderate members like Mr Lapid and even a small Arab party.In part because of its internal isions, the government has ruled out any major initiatives to resolve the conflict. But several top officials, including Mr Lapid and defence minister Benny Gantz, have met Palestinian leaders with the aim of boosting the Palestinian economy and laying the groundwork for negotiations in the future.Most ReadCondolences offered to Sir Jeffrey Donaldson following the death of his brother AndrewRevealed: The Northern Ireland charity chief paid as much as the First MinistersPSNI officers wear brand new unorm for first time in  yearsRarely-seen Bloody Sunday pictures: Twelve minutes that changed Derry foreverColeraine woman thanks shoppers who ‘saved her le’ in TescoTop VideosPlayPSNI officers wear brand new unorm for first time in  yearsPlayVideo: Jamie Dornan dismisses bond rumours at Belfast premiere PlayVideo: Veteran DUP politician Jim Wells aims his future sights on punditry Latest WorldViolence and protests mark anniversary of Myanmar army takeoverRussia denies responding to US proposal on Ukraine crisisUS military fired missiles during attack on UAE by Yemen’s Houthi rebelsIn Pictures: Colourful celebrations as people across world mark Lunar New YearDenmark ends most Covid- restrictionsLatestCulture Secretary Nadine Dorries announces ‘sector vision’ reviewThe Ulster Business Podcast: Episode  - Nuala Murphy, Diversity Mark NIYorkshire announces partnership with second overseas clubMan denies intent to cause criminal damage over protest at Sajid Javid’s homeRail firm uses more than , litres of cleaning solution in just  months,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

We have taken back control of our waters and a year on from the Trade and Co-operation Agreement a positive picture is emerging for our fishing industry, he continued.ldquoWe have seen an increase in quota that will amount to around poundm by  and are investing poundm into coastal communities so that they can benefit from better infrastructure, new jobs and investment in skills.Local councillor Dermot Curran is encouraging people to respond to the consultation exercise, to reduce the impact of fishing on the marine environment, as well as support the industry. And he hopes that all three Co Down fishing ports will benefit from the funding that is to be made available.ldquoI am keen to see more detail to see exactly how Ardglass in particular can benefit from financial support at a time when there is much focus on a range of work that is required at the village harbour, Cllr Curran continued.ldquoThe need to deepen the harbour to facilitate larger vessels is key moving forward, but the need to have a dedicated boat repair facility in the village has also been raised with me. Currently, vessels have to go where to be repaired.ldquoIf Ardglass had its own dedicated repair facility, it would not only be able to service local boats but those based in other ports. Investment to repair boats locally would also create jobs.Cllr Curran said everyone with an interest in the fishing industry should make the most of the opportunity to comment on the detail in the joint fisheries statement.ldquoConfirmation that poundm is being made available for fishing communities is excellent news and I hope that the ports of Ardglass, Kilkeel and Portavogie will be able to share this very welcome additional financial investment, he continued.ldquoThis is an important step forward and clearly Minister Poots is committed to the Co Down fishing industry and the processing industries and communities which rely heavily upon it. This new investment will help safeguard all their respective futures which is good news. The investment will boost the local and regional economy.Last year, it was revealed that investment in the region of poundm is needed to upgrade Ardglass harbour to help maximise the portrsquos future opportunities.The Fishing and Seafood Development Programme reportrsquos recommendations for Ardglass included enhancing capacity at the harbour to provide security for fishing and processing businesses,The report revealed that a survey of the harbour walls in Ardglass showed that some repairs may be required within the next one to two years but their condition will not prevent the deepening of the harbour mdash to nine metres below the waterline mdashthey are stabilised and protected from undermining prior to dredging operations.It says the current water depth and quaysideprevents larger fishing vessels from landing at Ardglass with tankers transporting fish landed in Belfast to the village for processing. Mackerel and Irish Sea herring continue to be landed in Ardglass.The report said there is inadequate space for growing the inshore fleet at the port as the quayside is dominated by the larger demersal fleet and occasional visiting pelagic vessels, with the adjoining marina for the exclusive use of leisure craft.It was also noted that a constraint to the landside development of the harbourrsquos estate is the mixed ownership of existing properties which prevents the Fishery Harbour Authority from having full control over activities at the port and limits the ability to plan strategically..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/26_January2022_Caoimhe.jpg","title":"Caoimhe raises £900 for turtle rehabilation scheme in Maldives  ","story":"WHEN it comes to conservation, Downpatrick woman Caoimhe Morgan-Burns practices what she preaches.The  year-old has raised pound by collecting rubbish from the sides of the Ardglass Road and Ballysallagh Road.The money is to go towards the cost of a pound, trip to Naaru Island in the Males in June where Caoimhe will devote four weeks of her time to volunteer at a sea turtle rehabilitation centre.The trip will mean a lot to Caoimhe, a former pupil at Shimna Integrated College in Newcastle, as she will head to Bristol University in September to study Wildle Ecology and Conservation Science.Caoimhe plans to plant some trees on her familyrsquos land so and is thinking up of other fund-raising initiatives towards the cost of the trip.She spent over five hours removing rubbish from the edges of the road and was dismayed by how much she collected from her own home road.ldquoI collected  bin bags full of rubbish.

The winning schools each received pound of NIFQA beef and lamb, kindly sponsored by ABP Food Group.Livestock and Meat Commission education and consumer promotions manager, Sarah Toland, explained that one of the key drivers for the competition was to encourage the use of NIFQA beef and lamb in schools and to complement the organisationrsquos existing schools programme.ldquoWith this in mind we specically targeted food and nutrition teachers and their students when drawing up the criteria for the project, she said.Sarah congratulated the winning schools, noting that as the competition received an encouraging number of entries, to select the top three was no easy task.De La Salle teacher Irene Stokes said the competition helped increase awareness of the importance of sourcing local NIFQA produce.She added: ldquoThis competition allowed our students an opportunity to highlight the vital nutrients that beef and lamb provide and how both can add iety, colour,flavour and texture to any dish. ldquoOur students are also becoming increasingly aware of sourcing meats that have the NIFQA symbol and the impact this has on the local economy.Down High teacher Sharon McKee said the competition was a ldquofabulous way of encouraging students to consider the valuable contribution of red meat in their diet.She added: ldquoOur Year  pupils are currently investigating the nutritional and dietary needs of adolescence so this competition fitted well into our curriculum and brought the theory to le..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/26_January2022_Downe.jpg","title":"Downe partnership to help map future  ","story":"THE first meeting of a new forum involving health chiefs, hospital campaigners, trade unions and politicians to oversee service provision at the Downe hospital is expected to take place in the spring.The South Eastern Trust mdash which is responsible for the hospital and the delivery of a raft of health and social services across the community mdash has described the creation of the new Downe Health and Care Partnership Forum as exciting.Last summer, South Down MP Chris Hazzard suggested to senior health chiefs that a new partnership involving a range of key players should be established to help map out the most appropriate model of health care for the area and it will soon become a reality.Health chiefs said the forum, which is the first of its kind in Northern Ireland, said the two key objectives are to plan for the future with everyone who uses services in the area and work in partnership to improve the health and wellbeing of the community.The health trust said this is in line with the organisationrsquos so-called ldquoquality  all strategy which puts excellent care at the centre of what it does.Officials say the new forum will consider local population health and social care needs, support people to lead healthier lives and take action to reduce health inequalities.Health trust chief executive, Roisin Coulter, said the organisation wants to work collaboratively with the local community regarding existing health and social care services to plan and design for the future.ldquoWorking in partnership with a wide range of key stakeholders will be vital to the forumrsquos success.

I accused the departmental officials of paralysis by analysis and unfortunately that has proved to be true.ldquoSince then, of course, the traffic congestion, which is now traffic chaos, has been greatly increased by the Irish Street closure, and it should be noted that not a single traffic management action has been initiated in the interval, he continued.NEWCASTLE ndash A cross-community unity campaign has been launched to save Newcastlersquos only public residential home from closure.Mourne House has been targeted for closed by the Eastern Health and Social Services Board but this week local politicians have joined with the Friends of Mourne House in mobilising public support against the plan.Representatives from the Friends group have already met with Board officials in a bid to persuade them to adopt a proposal from the charity, Age Concern, which is offering to take over the management of the  year-old home.DUNDRUM ndash Over pound, damage has been caused in another arson attack in Dundrum.Two caravans were completely destroyed and another badly damaged in the attack at the Bayview Caravan Site off the Dromara Road early on Saturday morning.It is believed the blazes were started in the early hours and two of the caravans were well alight by the time fire crews arrived on the scene.The incident is the latest in a long line of malicious arson attacks in the village which police believe are the work of a pyromaniac.Just before Christmas the villagersquos two primary schools were targeted with the Downshire Primary School sustaining over pound, damage. The arsonist has also attacked Dundrum cricket club, the orange hall and the parochial hall.BRYANSFORD ndash Plans have been announced to convert one of Bryansfordrsquos most historic landmarks into apartments, a craft shop and a restaurant.The former home of the Earl of Roden, close to the gates of Tollymore Park, will be converted into eight apartments, and an outbuilding will be extended to form a craft shop and restaurant facilityplanning permission is granted by the DoE.A further planning application proposes to build a number of luxury apartments on a site to the rear of the building, with an access from the nearby Burrenreagh Road.The building, which comprises extensive outbuildings and a courtyard, was used as a travellersrsquo inn during the last century when the Roden family lived in Tollymore House in the forest park.Since the destruction of Tollymore House the inn has been the home of the present Earl of Roden. In  it was the scene of an antiques robbery in which Lord Roden was tied up and threatened as raiders stole valuable paintings and antiques.Part of the outbuildings were regularly used by youth groups for residential weekends in the Mournes.BALLYNAHINCH ndash The job losses at the Ballynahinch GPT plant mean the lsquoBig Threersquo players in Down District industry no longer top the  jobs mark.GEC Plessey Telecommunications was the last of the lsquoBig Threersquo to employ more than  on one site.The lay-offs mean there are virtually no large-scale industrial employers left in Down.The GPT plant has been set on a steady course of expansion, even after the amalgamation of Plessey, as it then was, with GEC in .

Although it re-opened later that year, the numbers employed has been dramatically scaled down.The decline in the numbers is even more pronounced when it is considered that in its heyday in the late rsquos, the tannery employed up to  people.STRANGFORD ndash There has been a renewed call for a bridge linking Strangford and Portaferry.The newly-formed Strangford Lough Bridge Project Group says a bridge across the Strangford Narrows is the only means of guaranteeing a continuous link across the lough.However, the group accepts that a scheme involving a barrage to harness tidal power would be environmentally unacceptable.Group chairman, Mr James McMullan, from Portaferry, said ldquoI believe there is overwhelming support for a bridge.ldquoPeople in Portaferry are concerned about the future of the DoE ferry service. A bridge has to be the ultimate answer. It would provide a link  hours a day and would not be subject to breakdowns, he continued.And Mr McMullan says he intends to seek the support of local councillors for his proposal.ldquoI accept a barrage would have environmental implications but a bridge on its own would benefit communities on both sides of the lough, he added.RACING ndash A campaign to introduce Sunday horse racing in Britain could result in Sabbath day racing coming under starters orders at Downpatrick.Mr Iain Duff, course registrar at Downpatrick, has given his support to the Jockey Club campaign and is demanding sweeping changes in legislation which prohibits betting on a Sunday.Mr Duff says Downpatrick and Down Royal ndash the Provincersquos other racetrack ndash should be allowed to hold Sunday meetings.Mr Duff says the law could be changed easily by making an Order in Council which would then enable tracks to hold meetings when people are most prepared to go racing on Sunday.He believes the move is needed to bring racing here into line with the Republic where Sunday racing was introduced some years ago.ldquoSunday racing in the Republic has proved to be a wholesale success. Surveys have shown more people go racing on a Sunday than on any other day, he remarked.ldquoYet the Northern Ireland Minister of Agriculture last November rejected the appeals of deputations representation Downpatrick and Down Royal seeking an equal opportunity.Mr Duff said thatSunday racing is permitted, the law relating to gambling would have to be changed.Mr Duff added: ldquoEverybody in racing respects the views of people who may be against Sunday racing, but I donrsquot think they should be allowed to dictate to the majority..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/26_January2022_Matt.jpg","title":"Matthew survives on Dancing With The Stars  ","story":"LOVE Islander Matthew MacNabb survived the first public vote in RTErsquos Dancing With The Stars mdash despite gaining the lowest number of points.The Downpatrick man was faced with the challenge of dancing the jive on Sundayrsquos show, known to be notoriously dficult for tall male dancers.Standing at ft in, the  year-old admitted it was tough going, but was personally delighted with his effort with professional dance partner Laura Nolan.Speaking from Dublin on Monday, Matthew told the Recorder: ldquoI was happy with my dance last night as I had a nightmare with it all week trying to get the timing and coordination down.ldquoThat was the best I danced it and I worked so hard all week but I guess giraffes arenrsquot meant to jive.In the end, it was novelist Cathy Kelly who was the first celebrity to leave the show.The local GAA player and digital marketing consultant said he had been overwhelmed by the support and votes he had received.He said: ldquoTo be bottom and to get through shows how amazing people are to vote for me and I really appreciate it.

THE big match of the week saw the top two teams face off against each other as the league leaders from Killyleagh made the trip to Spa to face the only team to have beaten them this year.They were just left to pick up the crumbs as the hosts continued their unbeaten run which led to this big win that no makes them favourites for the league with two games in hand and only eleven points behind with four rounds left to play.Davy Cavan, Paul and Don McNamara were up against Stevie Brown, Kieran McMullan and Ricky Cathcart and after four ends it was all square at -. But then Don upped the pressure and the hosts dominated thefinal ends to run out - winners.On the other mat the home triple of Hilary Cavan, Robin Horner and Graham Christie were playing some great bowls against Paddy Murray and after lting a count of six on the third end would only lose three ends in their - win. At the break the home side had a -shot overall lead.The Saints made a slight comeback in the third game as Philip Woodside, David Anderson and Neil Brown continued their good run of form against Frances and Derek McCann and skip Alan Laughlin, who after losing the first two ends won the next three to go - up before Alan hit back to make it it - after seven ends.This would be as good as it would get as the visitors won the last three ends to finish - winners to secure the only away points of the match.A mention must go to this triple for playing and controlling this game so well, especially as Philip had a throwback to past times with the quality of lead bowls.The last game of the night saw Rose Marie Wylie, Davy Vance and Peter Christie score seven shots from the first two ends against Terry Quinn, Nigel Brown and Tony Ward.They never relinguished this lead as the game finished - in their favour to secure another great win.Surely now no-one can stop Spa from continuing on and finish the season unbeaten and as champions.DROMARA.....................

Dromararsquos Denis Kane, Richard Kelly and JamesMcKinney took control of their game against Haydn Tumelty, Dermot Rooney and Liam Higgins and even though they won only four ends and scored  shots to win -, this left Dromara with a five-shot lead in the overall.Owenbeg finally got going in the final game as Nathan Tumelty, Alan Telford and Collie Gibson really put Marie McNeill, Phil and Eamon Kelly to the sword.They only let their opponents score two shots as they scored steadily and heavily to run out victors by a - margin.It has to be said that Nathan was giving his team-mates an easy time with his standard of lead bowls on what are tricky mats.This win was enough to get Owenbeg the extra points and scrape an overall draw.ST MACARTANrsquoS...........

How are your New Year resolutions going How many times do you decide to lsquostop thisrsquo, lsquostart thatrsquo, and find a few weeks later that you have blown it and feel guilty and frustrated with yourself Starting all over again on the back of frustration and then pushing yourself even harder, making it increasingly dficult to stick to your resolution Breaking habits or quitting something on the surface seem like great ideas when wanting to improve your health and well-being. Irsquod love to introduce you to approaches that are foundations that last and make you feel empowered and happier in  and beyond.What I think is essential, when we want to stop a bad habit or make a change in our lives, is to make sure that we are on our own side.Self-compassion is basically being your own best friend. When we are with our best friend, we listen to them. We comfort them and speak on their behalfthey ask us to help them. To get the cogs in motion,answer yes or no to the following questions:Do you find it hard to say no Do you find it dficult to take a compliment Do you criticise yourself often Do you compare yourself to others Do you worry about what others think about you How many were answered lsquoyesrsquo Maybe after everything that we all have been through over the last couple of years,  has the possibility to be the year that you remember as the year you began to take control, to recover and heal.  could be the year when you started loving yourself more.There are three elements that I would like to introduce today that are to be consideredyou want to feel empowered and active in real self-care.AwarenessAwareness begins with the practice of noticing. It helps us be in the present moment and be calm as we take in the sights, sounds and touch mdash even taste mdash around us.Mindfulness and meditation have been trendy in recent years, but from my one-to-one counselling work, quite a few people have said that ldquoit didnrsquot work for them, or ldquoI didnrsquot really see the benefits.Once we talked about that more, we came to the realisation that they were practicing mindfulness to not feel, to escape feeling uncomfortable or to push away dficult or negative thoughts. As a practice, things changed for the better once my clients were made aware that mindfulness was to observe their feelings and observe their thoughts with an open mind as attention was gently brought back to the breath.Taking little pockets of time in our day to consciously pause, taking a few breaths in and out and observe, can immediately let our bodies and minds be calm and focused.The small daily things are the most important things to ensure real change. You can try this little exercise and be aware how your body and mind feels:S  ndash Step back.T ndash Take three deep breaths in and three slow breaths out.O  ndash Observe the thoughts and feelings in that very moment.P ndash Proceed.Awareness also involves being able to see patterns that arise in our thoughts and feelings, as well as the behavioural outcome. Kind of like detective work, we are then able to reframe our thinking, as well as breaking the familiar cycle of judgement and frustration. Just a wee word about practicing awareness mdash it is not about self control. Awareness helps us to begin to understand ourselves and develop self compassion and practice patience .Essentially, self awareness is about empowering ourselves and providing regulation of our body and mind. Self-regulation in turn, seeks to identy and reduce the causes of problems in mood, thought and behaviour.Self-control seeks to inhibit or manage such problems only when they arise. Self-control looks at old methods of punishment and reward to manage behaviour ndash maybe like the way we begin every New Year resolution mdash or every Monday, etc.AcceptanceEspecially when a New Year starts ndash therersquos this pressure to go to extreme measures, with this notion of being accepted more, to be seen and or valued more. But pretty much into the month of January we notice how it can rob us of truly living.We are not human DOINGS ndash we are human BEINGS. I have worked over the last  years as a counsellor and have heard people talk about trying to control their lives, but feeling like it was evading them more and more.Clients found themselves going harder, pushing harder, feeling exhausted, feeling helpless ndash then pulling up their socks and trying again. Although it may go against the grain of whatrsquos familiar, itrsquos healing to ease ourselves from a place of trying mdash to be perfect, as good as others, etc mdash to self-acceptance.Accepting lessens the pressure and helps us go with the flow.Self-acceptance is a journey. If anyone  needs to put pressure on us, itrsquos them who needs to deal with their own expectations mdash not us. Acceptance challenges deeply held beliefs that we are not lsquoworthyrsquo enough or lsquogoodrsquo enough to be whole. Like awareness, acceptance develops self compassion ndash a connected relationship with ourselves.In Dialectical Behavioural Therapy, there is a theory called Radical Acceptance developed by Martina Linehan, who quotes: ldquoRejecting reality turns pain into suffering.It is really tough to accept things how they are, from childhood trauma to unexpected traffic jams. It is really such a relief and sense of clarity when we realise and accept things that we are not in control of.It is absolutely OK to feel whatever we feel in the moment. Itrsquos not just sitting back and letting bad things happen of course. It is quite pro-active from problem solving based on how things actually are, self compassion when paying attention to how we feel in the moment. Meeting emotional pain head on, after all, it is what it is. Acceptance means no more unnecessary suffering.AssertionGabor Mate talks about assertion as a declaration to ourselves and to the world that lsquowe arersquo and that lsquowe are who we arersquo. Itrsquos not being simply able to stand up for ourselves mdash therersquos something more heartfelt than that.Assertion challenges the all too common belief that we must somehow justy our existence. There are lots of things that we can learn about and practice when it comes to assertion in itself, but maybe after reading the first two elements you are realising that our inidual minds, bodies and spirit are all so important.Making decisions about diets, relationships, careers, etc, usually get focused on a lot more during the month of January, as well as quitting things and going cold turkey on habits that have been part of our lives for years.Assertion isnrsquot just a quick course from a manual or podcast about tips and tricks. It is a really important statement of our being. It is a positive valuation of ourselves mdash independent of our history, abilities, personality or the worldrsquos perception of us.In regards to resolutions, assertion doesnrsquot involve action or reaction. Like I said before, it is our BEING, no matterwe take action or not. Assertion helps us be crystal clear about what we value and what is not OK with us as iniduals.From our values we can develop boundaries. Yes, let the rest of the world cope with that, or not. In fact, assertion may be the very opposite of action, not only in the sense of refusing to do something that we do not wish to do, but letting go of the very need to act at all.I really do hope that  gives you gts and wonderful surprises, as well as the comfort and support over dficult times. If you feel that you like to find out more about ways of real self care, developing good habits and creating change, you can contact me on  .For the month of January, I am offering free -minute assessment sessions.

Thirty eight percent of drivers were detected driving at between mph and mph.The provision of the series of electronic devices was in response to community concern about speeding across the district and viewed as part of a major offensive on those who break the law and to encourage drivers to slow down.PCSP officials say the average speeds recorded in Downpatrick, Killyleagh and Newcastle have reduced with no change in Newcastle. However, concern remains about the dangerous speeds that continue to be recorded with some drivers showing a blatant disregard for the speed limits in place.The highest speed recorded at the Strangford Road in Downpatrick was mph in the mph zone at am, with  drivers detected travelling at over mph. Previous speeds recorded at the built-up area have peaked at mph.Residents in the built-up area, which includes a signicant number of houses, a nursing home and local authority depot, have continually expressed concern about the speed of drivers who use the busy road and argue that the speed sign needs to be relocated further back towards the Lecale Park entrance.The highest speed recorded at the Dublin Road in Castlewellan was mph at am, with  drivers recorded travelling in excess of mph, with % of drivers detected travelling between mph and mph.Elsewhere, one driver was detected travelling at mph in the mph zone at the Dundrum Road in Clough at am, with one driver clocked driving in excess of mph.In Killyleagh, a driver was detected travelling at mph in the mph zone on the approach to the townrsquos Integrated Primary School, with  drivers clocked at over mph.

The average speed of cars travellingpast each sign was mph in Ardglass and Clough, mph in Castlewellan, mph in Downpatrick, mph in Newcastle and mph in Newcastle.The PCSP is planning to install seven more speed indicator signs with demand for the devices described as ldquohigh with particular interest from residents and councillors in the Downpatrick, Rowallane, Slieve Croob and Mournes district electoral areas.Local councillor Dermot Curran, who lives in Ardglass, has described the mph speed recorded at the Downpatrick Road in the village as ldquotruly shocking.He said while the number of drivers breaking the ious speed limits is reducing, there were a number ldquothumbing their noses at the restrictions in place and posing a serious danger to other road users and pedestrians.ldquoThe fact that drivers are not slowing down in built-up areas, regardless of the time of day, is a real worry.

She lived in the period -AD and was a visionary spiritual leader and inspirational woman, she explained.ldquoBrigid was recognised as a saint from around the seventh century and seven dferent lsquolivesrsquo of St Brigid were written which is indicative of the cult following she had.ldquoHer feast day is on February which is the first day of spring mdash Imbolc in the Celtic calendar. There are three other feasts in the Celtic calendar mdash May , Bealtaine August , Luacutenasa and November,  Samhain. Each of the feasts has associated with it a specic set of beliefs and customs.ldquoThere was a pre-Christian aspect to the feast on February . The main importance of the feast of St Brigid would appear to be that it was a christianisation of one of the key dates in the farming year in Ireland. In earlier centuries in Ireland and in many areas St Brigidrsquos day was observed as a holiday and some farming related activities were not permitted. In , the government of the Republic of Ireland decided to make the February  a bank holiday. This is an inspired choice of date for the new bank holiday.Brigid said the main customs associated with St Brigidrsquos Day are the making of St Brigidrsquos crosses the Briacutedeoacuteg and the Brat Briacutede. These customs were traditionally practiced on the eve of St Brigidrsquos feast day as according to Celtic timing, night came before day.The custom of making St Brigidrsquos crosses is still widespread throughout Ireland. There are regional iations across Ireland in the design and composition of the cross. The most common one is the simple four armed cross.ldquoThe explanation of the custom is that St Brigid made the cross when she was comforting a dying man who wished to convert to Christianity. She placed it in his hands, explained Brigid. ldquoPeople believe that the St Brigidrsquos cross offers protection from sickness and other forms of adversity for their homes, family and animals.ldquoToday in Co Down farming and non-farming families still want to get a St Brigidrsquos cross for this reason. In Ulster, a three-armed cross was placed in the stable or byre for the protection of animals. Throughout my le I have made St Brigid crosses for our home.ldquoAs a teacher I have taught groups of pupils how to make the cross. It is important that we pass on customs and traditions to the next generation and do not lose the wealth of culture we have in Ireland.She said that the Briacutedeoacuteg is another custom associated with St Brigidrsquos Day. It consisted, or consists, of a group of young people called briacutedeoga, lsquobiddiesrsquoor biddy-boys going from house to house carrying an effigy of St Brigid .The children received some donation at each house visited. Often a doll was made for the occasion. The body of the doll may have been made from a sheaf of straw. A ball of hay, straw or turnip was used to represent the head. It was usually constructed with a strong stick or churn-dash at its core.The use of the churn dash was thought to reflect the saintrsquos association with dairying. A purchased rag doll might be used. Whether a doll was made or purchased, it was a representation of St Brigid and was dressed in white.The original objective of the exercise was the collection of alms for the poor. The group always provided some entertainment for the homes visited with singing or music. The girls and boys in the group dressed up in disguise for the occasion. The custom lasted longest in Co Kerry and still survives today in a few areas.The third important custom which was widespread throughout Ireland is known as the brat Briacutede . A piece of cloth, larger than a hankerchief, was put on a bush outside the home on the eve of St Brigidrsquos feast day and it was not usually brought in until morning.Brigid added: ldquoThe belief was that when St Brigid was travelling around the country that night and she came across the cloth, she blessed it with the curative powers of her cloak. It was put away and used as a healing cloth throughout the year for sickness, pain and as protection against harm. With changes in society this custom has only survived in some areas including the south and west of Ireland.The historian said that Saint Brigid, who is strongly associated with nature and farming, is ldquoa saint for our times. With the environmental crisis facing us we can learn from the reverence which the early Celtic saints, including St Brigid, showed towards nature. They appreciated the fundamental importance of nature to humanity.ldquoThe challenges we face today are much greater than those in the th and th centuries but the need for social justice is the same. May the le of St Brigid be an inspiration to all to take action for a better world.When she died St Brigid was buried beside the high altar in the church in Kildare.

I took up art, I did it for about a year and that was the end of that.“Then about five years ago, my sister’s husband had died and we were clearing out the house. I found that she’d kept all of the sketches I’d done when I was  in an envelope. “I started looked at them, messing around with them, I bought some paints and started colouring them in.Clubsound in the s. PACEMAKER PRESS BELFAST“The nights I wasn’t working I was painting. In two years I must have done about  paintings for people.“It’s a blessing for me, it kept me sane, when you play every week and suddenly you stop, it hits you hard.“It relieved the boredom, it gave me something to focus on, when a painting turned out successful you felt you’d achieved something.“My biggest satisfaction is that I’ve painted memories for people that are now hanging in their house.George Jones started and finished his radio career with Downtown. Picture by CHARLES MCQUILLAN PACEMAKER.“It’s another sense of entertainment I suppose, another string to my bow. If my sister hadn’t kept those sketches I wouldn’t have all of this.”George recalled his sister’s influence on his musical career: “The first two records my sister brought in that started me on music when I was about nine or  were Little Richard ‘Long Tall Sally’ and Elvis ‘All Shook Up’. “In those days it wasn’t vinyl, it was  bakelite – it looked the same as vinyl butyou’d dropped it, it would have smashed. “I listened to them non-stop and then she bought me my first guitar at .”George said he formed skfle groups with boys of his age in the Bloomfield area of east Belfast. One of them was Van Morrison, whom George went on to tour with as The Monarchs.He said: “I go to lunch with Van Morrison quite a lot. The Monarchs were the first band to go to Germany. We had a hit record in  when the Beatles were still hovering around Germany.“Van has been trying to find the rights to it to repress it and put it out as a single on vinyl. I sung on it and he played saxophone – a bit of rock and roll.”George, who has been part of the successful ‘Do You Come Here Often ’ and ‘Rock ‘n Roll Years and Dance Hall Days’ shows, started learning the guitar at . He believes that might be the magic number: “I’ve interviewed so many people in my years on the radio who started the exact same way. “I’m hesitant to ask when they started to play the guitar – it’s always . So many great guitarists I interviewed, the likes of Hank B Marvin, started at .”Having found his first chords at  George is still going strong at .He said: “For me it’s been an incredible le, just when you think it’s all over, Clubsound have found a new lease of le.“We’ve found out that young people have started listening to the albums their parents have. I hesitate to use the term, but you become a cult.“Young ones come up to me and say ‘Yeoooo, Shankill Airways, my mum plays that all the time’.”George said the state modern music meant that people are yearning for songs from bygone days, especially the fties and sixties: “It was real music, there was no electronics – it was guitars, live drums, you were getting the whole live vibe.“In our day you just piled in, there was no such thing as tickets, you paid at the door and they squeezed in as many as they could.That added to the experience.”George plans to publish his memoirs as a book. In it he plans to recount his first meetings with Rory Gallagher and an incredibly green Gary Moore, of whom he told his father, ‘that wee lad will never be a guitar player’.‘It took a long time but I’m now over shock exit from Radio Ulster’George said that when he made his radio debut with Downtown his plan wasn’t to dilute his Clubsound persona too much.He said: “I used to bring what I did on stage onto the radio. I used to bring these we characters like Sadie that I did the voices for – she got more mail that I did. Radio needs to entertain,you’re on for two hours you’re not just sitting there spinning dics, you have to draw people in.”It wasn’t long before George was snapped up by Radio Ulster where he delivered ‘Just Jones’ for an amazing  years. Then one fateful day he was told he was surplus to requirements despite his popularity.George said: “People come up to me to this day, saying, ‘we miss you on the raido’ and ‘why did they do that to you’. “It was a big change in my le, it brought me down to earth more than anything. I thought those days were over – about two more times before that we were down and out and started over again, especially after the Miami thing and in South Africa my son nearly died of typhoid.“There were downs, but this was one I didn’t expect. I felt I was doing a good job.“During my six month notice period the public lted me to heights I never would believe. On the last week I was there I got nearly , emails from all over the world. I walked out of there about  feet tall. That was the bonus.”He said: “My we and family have helped me put it behind me. It took a long time because I was hurting.“I took up U with good success. It was water under the bridge and I had to put it under the bridge. I finished up in Downtown where I’d started in the s. Then I said to myself, radio is changing but it’s time for me to step aside.“When I look back now at radio in general, it’s like looking back to the wonder years of music, it saddens me – why has it changed so much  The commercial radio stations are just advertising boards with bits of music. “The word entertainment has disappeared from broadcasting. You couldn’t sit and listen to a radio show for two hours now, whereas before you’d have people would have been glad of that two hours of company.”Asked who he listens to on the ‘wireless’ George said: “Ken Bruce is still one of the old school and he makes me laugh. He still plays the oldies. Steve Wright still plays oldies. Asides from that it’s Classic FM.“It breaks my heart but I wouldn’t listen to any local radio stations.”Where to see George and Clubsound in actionClubsound’s current line-up of George Jones, David McKnight, Barry Woods, Alan McCartney and Jimmy Black will be on the road this spring including gigs at Theatre at The Mill in Newtownabbey on Saturday, March , Armagh’s Market Place Theatre on Saturday, April  and the Portico Arts and Heritage Centre in Portaferry on Monday, April .

They say that the beach is a sand and shingle beach and has a reputation for being one of the cleanest in the region. There is a coastal walk, chance to go fishing, surfing and views of Tusker Rock.For those owners who may not yet have ventured to the beach with their pups or are concerned about behaviour while at the beach, Wood Green’s dog behaviour and training specialist, Wendy Kruger, has provided some tips to prepare your dog for the beach.• Ensure your dog’s microchip and collar tag details are up to date – just in case.• Get used to checking ground surface temperatures before you take your dog out, as dry sand can be too hot for dogs’ paws on sunny days. To check the ground temperature, place the back of your hand on the ground. If its too hot to hold comfortably for five seconds, it’s too hot for dogs’ paws..remove• Practise basic, reward-based training when out and about to help your dog to maintain focus and engagement on walks.• Recall is also an area that needs particular attention. Evenyour dog has a great recall at home, its not something that can be guaranteed in unfamiliar environments with exciting new distractions. Games with toys are a fantastic way to help your dog engage with you when there are other distractions around. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

With many schools, libraries and colleges in Northern Ireland contributing to the Pension Scheme, estment would not only ensure a greener future but also protect people’s pensions from future losses.       \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"     \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily NorthernIrelandWorld Today newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.The motion brought before Mid Ulster Council, which was passed on January , was proposed by Independent Councillor Dan Kerr and read as follows:“This Council calls on the Northern Ireland Local Government Officers Superannuation Committeeto est the Local Government Pension Scheme from any fossil fuel companies within two years. \"This will give NILGOSC ample time to exit the market at the best time ensuring no adverse impact on the pension fund.”Mid Ulster’s motion was preceded on  th January by a motion passed by Lisburn and Castlereagh City Council. This motion was proposed by Green Party Councillor Simon Lee, and called upon NILGOSC to:“Outline their plans for esting from fossil fuels, including timelines, and request that they meet with Officers, Trade Unions and Elected Members to present these plans.”While stopping short of calling for immediate estment, the motion passed by Lisburn and Castlereagh City represents another step forward, and means that a majority of councils inNorthern Irelandnow wish NILGOSC to undertake actions to bring about estment. Motions calling for full and imminent estment have previously been passed by Newry Mourne and Down, Belfast City, Fermanagh and Omagh, and Derry City and Strabane. Councillors proposing such motions have been supported in their efforts by Fossil Free NI, a grassroots group which has been campaigning for estment since .Commenting on the passing of the motion at Mid Ulster Council, Councillor Dan Kerr said: “I am glad that the council unanimously supported the estment motion, and that we, alongwith many other local authorities both nationally and internationally, have added weight to this campaign. We hope that it can highlight the unethical nature of continued investment inthe fossil fuel industry, and also that with practical action we can strive for a better world for both present and future generations.”Dr Seamus Campbell of Fossil Free NI also expressed his delight at the passing of the motions, adding: “With COP highlighting the necessity of urgent climate action, it isimperative that our communities are not fuelling climate catastrophe. Calling upon NILGOSC to est from the fossil fuel industry is one way to do this. We are delighted that our localrepresentatives and have passed these motions and sent a clear message that business as usual in longer an option. We hope it will encourage other councils to pass similar motions,thereby demonstrating strong community support for estment and actions which benefit both people and the planet”.Castlereagh City CouncilLisburnCouncillorsMid UlsterCouncil  \"       \"   for the newsletterKeep up with the latest news and views from NorthernIrelandWorldSign Up       \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"    ]]Most PopularPipe bomb attack confirmed after loud blast heard across Lur...NewsPSNI officers wearing new style of unorm from today...NewsFormer employee awarded £k after suing Carrick firm over ...NewsSuspected puppy farmed dog found in a Co Armagh ditch had gi...NewsDrugs seized by Carrickfergus and Larne PSNI team during wee...NewsMost PopularBest baby prams UK : we review travel systems and pushch...RecommendedBest boxed mattress deals for January: discounts on Emma, S...RecommendedBest pancake pans UK : from non-stick to cast iron, thes...RecommendedSmart smoke alarms UK: what do you need to keep your home sa...Recommended                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportWhats OnLestyleYour Northern IrelandRecommendedMore from Northern Ireland WorldAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoNewspaper ArchiveUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessArchiveSubscribeEventsPlace your AdReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-fbyfCU sc-GEbAx ueSoA gsnYBQ\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyModern Slavery Statement       \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"    Sign in   \"    Welcome backEdit Account-Sign OutNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsCoronavirusTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsHealthBusinessEducationEnvironmentPeopleRead ThisFootball\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      FootballIrish League FootballSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportMotorcyclingIce HockeyOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleFood and DrinkTravelHomes and GardensCarsFamilyRetroOpinionYour NI\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Your NI​Antrim and NewtownabbeyArmagh Banbridge and CraigavonBelfastCauseway Coast and GlensLondonderry Derry City and StrabaneLisburn and CastlereaghMid and East AntrimMid UlsterFermanagh and OmaghNewry Mourne and DownArds and North DownMust ReadContact usAdvertise My BusinessFollow us           \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"     \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily NorthernIrelandWorld Today newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Me and Chris were in the car and we heard a couple of bands we like, Blink  and Yellowcard. Listening to Blink  ‘I Miss You’ and hearing the piano and we thought ‘wouldn’t it be great to have a song with piano like this ’“We’ve been able to do that, but still making it sound like our own sound. People who have heard it say it sounds like something from circa  and we’ve hit the nail on the head.“It was recorded at Halfbap Studios in Belfast with Graham Davidson as producer. We loved the work he did with us for our first single.”Detailing how the band now has a fourth member, Daniel added: “Jordan has been playing since   and we’ve known him for a good while. He adds another dimension to what we’re doing.“Chris will play the piano and lead guitar, while our drummer Thomas designed the artwork for the cover. He surprised us all by getting the name of the song tattooed on his leg and that will feature on the cover.”Looking ahead to the further easing of Covid- lockdown restrictions, Daniel said: “We performed in Belfast in December and we’re arranging shows at venues across the island.”The song will be available on streaming sites including Amazon and Apple.----Read More Read MoreEast Antrim band Cavalier Attitude to release new singleBelfastAntrimEast Antrim  \"       \"   for the newsletterKeep up with the latest news and views from NorthernIrelandWorldSign Up       \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"    ]]Most PopularPipe bomb attack confirmed after loud blast heard across Lur...NewsPSNI officers wearing new style of unorm from today...NewsFormer employee awarded £k after suing Carrick firm over ...NewsSuspected puppy farmed dog found in a Co Armagh ditch had gi...NewsDrugs seized by Carrickfergus and Larne PSNI team during wee...NewsMost PopularBest baby prams UK : we review travel systems and pushch...RecommendedBest boxed mattress deals for January: discounts on Emma, S...RecommendedBest pancake pans UK : from non-stick to cast iron, thes...RecommendedSmart smoke alarms UK: what do you need to keep your home sa...Recommended                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportWhats OnLestyleYour Northern IrelandRecommendedMore from Northern Ireland WorldAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoNewspaper ArchiveUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessArchiveSubscribeEventsPlace your AdReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-fbyfCU sc-GEbAx ueSoA gsnYBQ\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyModern Slavery Statement       \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"    Sign in   \"    Welcome backEdit Account-Sign OutNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsCoronavirusTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsHealthBusinessEducationEnvironmentPeopleRead ThisFootball\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      FootballIrish League FootballSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportMotorcyclingIce HockeyOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleFood and DrinkTravelHomes and GardensCarsFamilyRetroOpinionYour NI\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Your NI​Antrim and NewtownabbeyArmagh Banbridge and CraigavonBelfastCauseway Coast and GlensLondonderry Derry City and StrabaneLisburn and CastlereaghMid and East AntrimMid UlsterFermanagh and OmaghNewry Mourne and DownArds and North DownMust ReadContact usAdvertise My BusinessFollow us           \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"     \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily NorthernIrelandWorld Today newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.
