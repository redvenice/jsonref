Garden raid suspect Michael Seed known Basil wearing hat wig trial hears","story":"    Images of Michael Seed (left) with alleged accomplice John Collins were shown to the courtThe Hatton Garden suspect believed to be infamous gang member \u0027Basil\u0027 appeared in court today as prosecutors said police had finally unmasked him.Michael Seed, 58, is on trial for his alleged involvement in the Hatton Garden burglary, which shook London\u0027s diamond district over the 2015 Easter weekend. Seed, of Islington, north London, is accused of being \u0027Basil\u0027 - the only member of the gang who has never been caught. Experts said in court today Seed has the same \u0027walk\u0027 as Basil, and that when carrying out surveillance they saw him with John Collins before he was sentenced to seven years in prison for his role in the crime.Mr Seed also had 1,015 items from the raid in his bedroom, which would have sold for £143,000 at auction, Woolwich Crown Court heard today.  The prosecution says it was Seed who was captured on camera wearing a wig and a hat as he expertly disabled alarms at the Hatton Garden Safe Deposit Ltd complex that evening.The burglars succeeded in stealing millions in precious jewels and metals because the security system mistakenly informed the owners the police were on scene - when they did not arrive until after they had gone.   In court Metropolitan Police surveillance footage was shown as Mr Seed, (left) 58, is accused of two charges of conspiracy to commit burglary and one charge of conspiracy to convert or transfer criminal property in relation to the Hatton Garden heist in 2015  Michael Seed, 58, was allegedly caught on CCTV (right) during the Hatton Garden burglary wearing a wig and a hat as he held the door open for his elderly fellow gang members.

The prosecution say Seed was involved in the burglary of Hatton Garden and the subsequent laundering of the proceeds.\u0027Seed is also accused of taking part in a \u0027strikingly similar\u0027 £1million raid on Amal Clooney\u0027s wedding jewellers, Chatila, in London\u0027s Mayfair during the August Bank Holiday weekend of 2010.      Gold jewellery and precious and semi-precious stones were found in Michael Seed\u0027s home, the court was shown          Police took images of Michael Seed\u0027s bedroom which showed electronic equipment gatheredHatton Garden \u0027suspect known as Basil who teamed up with...\u0027My babies, my babies\u0027: Agony of mother who survived \u0027gas...Share this articleMr Evans, QC, told Woolwich Crown Court: \u0027A total of 1015 items of jewellery, gold, watches, and bundles precious or semi-precious stones were recovered at the property, all of it in Mr Seed\u0027s bedroom with the exception of a deconstructed eternity ring.\u0027There were 43 victims of the Hatton Garden burglary. The police requested that they attend the police station in order to view the items seized and identify whether or not the itemsbundles recovered belonged to them.\u0027Only 30 victims responded and 22 attended the police station.\u0027789 of those items were positively identified by owners of safety deposit boxes as having been stolen from their boxes during the Hatton Garden burglary.\u0027A further 144 of those items were identified by owners of safety deposit boxes as being consistent with items that had been stolen from their boxes during the Hatton Garden burglary.\u0027Therefore, a total of 92 per cent of the items were, or potentially were, items stolen from safety deposit boxes during the Hatton Garden Burglary. 82 items remain unidentified.\u0027The items have been valued at £143,129,74 by Wilsons Auctioneers. This is the price the bundles would be expected to achieve at auction.          Michael Seed, believed to be Basil (court sketch pictured) is on trial for his alleged involvement in the Hatton Garden burglary, which became the biggest jewellery heist ever to be pulled off when it happened over the Easter weekend in 2015\u0027The wholesale value of the items has not been calculated, but it would be less.\u0027The majority of the jewellery was sealed in self-seal bags but also in Tupperware boxes, found both on the work bench and also in a wardrobe. \u0027Some jewellery was still intact, and a fair quantity displayed price tags and references.\u0027There was also some jewellery found in the wardrobe that appears to have been deconstructed ready for smelting the metal.A total of 835 Euros in cash was found in suit jacket pocket in the bedroom wardrobe, along with 35 Euros found along with money bands in a box on a shelf.\u0027The money bands are of the type that are used to hold bundles of denominations together.\u0027There were a number of tools such as pliers, precision drills, tweezers, soldering irons, and a smelting pot found capable of being used to deconstruct jewellery in order to separate precious stones from yellow and silver metals.            Chatila made the jewellery for Amal Clooney\u0027s wedding to her film star husband George\u0027Inside the front room was an amount of shelving containing large number of books about electronics and surveillance.\u0027That included in-depth and technical information in the area of electronics and radio frequencies as well as several manuals on anti-surveillance and anti-intrusive audio techniques.\u0027There were also products and devices found that do not appear to have been purchased in their current form, but rather have been built or adapted to meet specific requirements.\u0027There were devices that can covertly monitor movements and sounds by way of audio and vibration recordings. These products were found both in the front room and the bedroom.\u0027The Crown allege that the electronic devices found demonstrate that Mr Seed\u0027s role during the Hatton Garden burglary was a crucial one: the disabling of the security system, as was mentioned by the other conspirators in the covert recordings.\u0027Combined with the manner in which the items were ided up, this further points towards Seed\u0027s leading role in the conspiracy.\u0027Clothing was found in the bedroom for which Mr Seed would have no legitimate use but could be used to gain illegitimate access to premises, for example for reconnaissance purposes: a \u0027BT\u0027 Hi-Vis jacket, a \u0027Royal Mail\u0027 Hi-Viz jacket and a \u0027BT Open Reach\u0027 Blue T-Shirt.\u0027In the front room there are a large number of very high-level knowledge-based books on various electronic devices.\u0027In addition, there are a number of books in relation to anti-surveillance techniques including one that instructs the reader on how to defeat audio devices.\u0027          The burglars spent the evening of April 2 2015 drilling three holes (pictured) so they could get into the vault at the Hatton Garden jewellery shop, the jury heard Jurors also heard a glove discovered at the scene of the Chatila burglary links Seed to the raid.Me Evans said: \u0027Following Mr Seed\u0027s arrest on 27 March 2018 in respect of the offence at Hatton Garden Safe Deposit Ltd, his DNA was compared to the samples retained from the offence at Chatila.\u0027You\u0027ll remember there was a glove found in the electrical alarm cupboard at Chatila. \u0027That glove had a mixture of DNA from at least four people inside it and the majority profile was a partial match for Danny Jones, 61 (already convicted for his part in the raid).\u0027The chances of it coming from someone other than Jones was one in a billion and you\u0027ll remember that Jones pleaded guilty to taking part in this burglary.\u0027Among the DNA remaining it was discovered that Mr Seed\u0027s DNA profile was almost completely represented within it as well.\u0027The re-testing of the glove in 2018 used a more advanced method DNA LiRa. That method tested two propositions against each other: The DNA came from Jones, Seed, and two others The DNA came from Jones and three other people all of whom were unrelated to Seed.\u0027It was concluded that it was 6,600 times more likely that the first proposition was true - namely that the DNA inside the glove was obtained from Jones, Seed and two other people.\u0027The similarities between the burglary at Chatila and the burglary at Hatton Garden Safe Deposit are striking and compelling. \u0027The Crown says that those similarities are explained not by coincidence but because the same people were involved in both.\u0027Jurors were shown CCTV of the man alleged to be Seed entering the premises at 9.20pm that evening.  The prosecution claims that once inside the gang disabled the lift and lowered themselves down the shaft to the basement.The lock on the door was then snapped off leaving a hole to get in and out of the vault.They damaged the alarm by cutting the telephone wires and the GPS aerial was deactivated.But the damaged alarm sent a message to security when the outer gate of the vault was opened shortly after midnight, the court heard. Mr Evans said: \u0027A director of Hatton Garden Safety Deposit received a call from the monitoring company almost immediately.\u0027He was told that the alarm was signalling and that the police were on scene. \u0027The latter part of the message was wrong: the police did not come until later.          He is accused of being part of a gang which raided Hatton Garden Safe Deposit Ltd in 2015\u0027The director arranged for one of the security guards to attend the scene and he decided to go himself as well. \u0027At about 01:15 the security guard arrived at Hatton Garden. He inspected the exterior of the premises only. \u0027He called the director, who was by then five minutes away, and he called him to say that the main door and the fire exit appeared secure.\u0027He informed him, wrongly, that it was a false alarm, and both men returned home. The attempts to access the vault continued inside.\u0027The men then spent the night cutting through the second sliding iron gate and then drilling three adjoining and circular holes in the thick wall to the vault.\u0027The prosecution claims Basil and Jones were the only ones who could have fitted into the vault. He added: \u0027It seems likely that Perkins - already jailed over the burglary - would have been unable to fit through the hole of that nature and so it would appear that Jones and \u0027Basil\u0027 were the ones who actually entered the vault itself.\u0027Once inside the vault, the burglars jemmied open 73 of the 999 safe deposit boxes, which they proceeded to ransack.\u0027No doubt, if they had had more time, and more people to assist them, they would have opened more, and stolen more.\u0027 The prosecution then claimed expert evidence proves Seed is Basil from the way the man in the CCTV footage walks.    Seed, of Islington, north London, is also accused of taking part in a \u0027strikingly similar\u0027 £1million raid on Amal Clooney\u0027s wedding jewellers, Chatila (pictured) in London\u0027s Mayfair during the August Bank Holiday weekend of 2010Mr Evans added: \u0027The expert noted the right leg movement and the position of the foot and lower limb have a similar appearance at various stages of the gait cycle in both sets of footage, consistent over time and repeatable and reliable characteristics.\u0027In other words, the different parts of the leg movements when the two iniduals walk - \u0027Basil\u0027 in the Hatton Garden footage and Seed after Hatton Garden - are consistent.\u0027It is the experts\u0027 opinion that there is strong evidence to support the proposition that Seed is Basil.\u0027Both sets of footage have also been reviewed by an expert ChiropodistPodiatrist.\u0027He concluded that the \u0027Basil\u0027 footage showed someone with a particular habitual gait - an abnormality in his right leg.\u0027 According to a covert recording of fellow gang members Daniel Jones, 61, and 78-year-old John Collins, Basil was the only one who knew enough about alarms to disable them.Jurors heard Jones tell Collins: \u0027I don\u0027t know enough to challenge him you know what I mean? Like say nah that ain\u0027t right... He can baffle me with b*******.\u0027Mr Evans also said: \u0027It appears that the burglars were highly forensically aware. No fingerprints or DNA traces were detectable on items left at the scene, or the walls and floor.\u0027Furthermore, a milky-white fluid, later determined to be bleach, had been sprayed on surfaces, indicating that a significant degree of cleaning, designed to prevent any evidence being left behind, had taken place.\u0027After the break-in \u0027a white-male\u0027 was seen speaking to Collins in parks near to Seed\u0027s home address who prosecutors claim is \u0027Basil\u0027. Mr Evans went on to describe Seed\u0027s alleged disguise: \u0027He has got some sort of hat on and some sort of wig.\u0027Basil can be seen with his face covered, with white gloves on and headphones in his ears, according to the prosecutor. The court heard the burglars used a Hilti DD350 drill they had brought with them to cut three holes.Mr Evans continued: \u0027They 25cm by 45cm breach in that wall.          Accused: Michael \u0027Basil\u0027 Seed, 58, of Islington, north London is on trial at Woolwich Crown Court\u0027They would at this point have encountered the back of the heavy metal cabinet housing the safe deposit boxes which was fixed both to the floor and ceiling.\u0027It appears that they had with them on that first night a Clarke pump and hose, which included a 10-ton hydraulic ram.\u0027For some reason, the burglary was not completed that night. It seems, from what happened in the following days, that there had been a problem with the pump and hose.\u0027What that problem was is not immediately clear, but it seems it did not do its job and stopped them from moving the metal cabinets, and ultimately stopped them getting through that hole, remember those metal cabinets were bolted to the floor and ceiling.\u0027Jurors were shown an exact model of the hole drilled into the vault at Hatton Garden which the raiders used to loot the safes inside.Seed denies two counts of conspiracy to burgle and one count of conspiracy to conceal or disguise criminal property.Earlier trials have seen the convictions of Danny Jones, 61, Terry Perkins, John Kenneth Collins, 78, \u0027Kenny\u0027, Carl Wood, 58, and Brian Reader, 79, in connection with the Hatton Garden job.Perkins, 69, died in prison ahead of his trial for involvement in the Chatila raid and Jones admitted his role in the heist last year.William Lincoln, 63, Hugh Doyle, 51, Terri Robinson, 37, and Bren Walters, 45, were also convicted for conspiring to conceal criminal property.Charles Matthews, 55, was convicted of handling stolen goods from the Chatila burglary.Seed\u0027s trial continues."},{"url":null,"title":"Winds change Iconic RAF Tornado jets make final flight home 40 years","story":"    Magnificent Flying Machines: The RAF Tornado GR4, initially introduced in 1979 and first in service in 1982, has now been retired.

The Tornado can trace its DNA all the way back to work by Sir Barnes Wallis, better known for developing the ‘bouncing bomb’ used by 617 Sqn ‘The Dambusters’ in 1943, who began work on variable geometry (VG) wing designs in the 1950s. He realised with a VG aircraft’s wings swept forwards - spread wide - it could use shorter runways and display greater manoeuvrability, and by sweeping them back could achieve maximum high-speed performance.Although no planes were built from his designs, VG wings became commonly used on fighter aircraft through the latter half of the twentieth century, including on the Tornado.It was initially created by a British-German-Italian conglomerate, Panavia, which was set up in Germany to build the craft.The Tornado programme was initiated in 1968, and the first prototype flew on 14 August 1974. The initial RAF requirement was for 220 aircraft, and the first of these was delivered to RAF Cottesmore in July 1980, becoming the mainstay of the RAF strike force in June 1982. RAF Tornados took part in the 1999 Kosovo war and the GR4 upgrade was completed in time for Operation Telic, the UK\u0027s deployment in Iraq from 2003 to 2011. Tornados were used in Afghanistan from 2009 until the withdrawal of UK forces in 2014. According to the Ministry of Defence, they flew over 5,000 sorties and logged more than 33,500 flight hours during this time.           The sun sets on the Tornado: The powerful jets were conceived in the late 1960s, based on previous work by Sir Barnes Wallis of \u0027Dambusters\u0027 fame.  They flew for the first time in 1974 and entered service in 1979.

The family did not report Amber missing until they had \u0027been to Tesco and had their tea\u0027. Pictured above the missing poster which was put up once it had been reported that Amber was missing Ms Bower was told two calls were made from Queen Elizabeth School in Mansfield, which Amber attended at the time of her death, to MASH before the tragedy – one in September 2014, and another six months later.Both times a worker took information from the callers – one of whom was a key worker at the school and the other its vice principal - and handed it on to a qualified social worker.But the inquest was told the case didn\u0027t pass a \u0027threshold\u0027 that would have triggered statutory social services intervention.On the second occasion the caller from the school was told to go back to Amber\u0027s parents and \u0027discuss\u0027 the claims she had made without any evidence the potential impact on her of doing so had been assessed – something Ms Bower said \u0027shocked\u0027 her.The coroner told MASH group manager Teresa Godfrey: \u0027In the world of safeguarding there should have been an explicit conversation about risk.\u0027The first call to the safeguarding unit was made by Queen Elizabeth vice principal Karen Green.But MASH officer Elizabeth Fisher, who took the call, said the information provided was \u0027limited\u0027 and \u0027without context\u0027 – and didn\u0027t satisfy the criteria for a full social services referral. Instead, the school was advised to carry out an \u0027Early Help\u0027 assessment – something it ultimately didn\u0027t do.However, Mrs Fisher did accept a suggestion from Ms Bower that she could have asked more questions and \u0027dug a little deeper\u0027 to gain a wider picture of the situation. She said evidence she had heard during the inquest about Amber while sat in the public gallery had left her \u0027shocked\u0027.A second call was made to the MASH team in March 2015, two months before Amber\u0027s death, by her school key worker Sharon Clay.She reported concerns over Amber wearing ill-fitting tracksuit bottoms to school, which the inquest has previously heard she was made to do by Mr Peat after failing to put her normal trousers in the wash, and bringing her items in a cheap plastic bag.Ms Clay added that she thought Amber was being \u0027emotionally abused\u0027 by her stepdad, who had also ordered her to wash the floors at 11.30pm at night.However, the concerns again weren\u0027t enough to merit the involvement of social services.MASH worker Joanna Shepherd, who took the call, said \u0027you would need more incidents over a period of time\u0027 – adding she was not aware at the time of the \u0027bigger picture\u0027 surrounding Amber.The inquest heard Mrs Shepherd had no knowledge of the earlier call. She told the hearing she could have asked for more details – but would have expected the caller to give a \u0027full picture\u0027.After getting the advice of a social worker, Mrs Shepherd told Ms Clay the school should go back and discuss the matter with Amber\u0027s mum.But Ms Bower asked if any thought had been given to the impact it could have on Amber if the disclosures she\u0027d made to her teacher were passed back to her parents, adding: \u0027As we discuss this now, do you see the concerns I am raising?\u0027Mrs Shepherd replied: \u0027Yes.

He also has twin sisters in London. Attorneys for the rapper said on Monday that he had been arrested based on incorrect information about his criminal record and should be released while awaiting court proceedings.On Tuesday, campaigners from Black Lives Matter said his arrest is part of an epidemic of \u0027racist\u0027 arrests by ICE and their Free 21 Savage petition has been signed by 115,000 in 24 hours. His fans are in shock because they believed he was born and raised in Atlanta - due to his thick accent and the fact that he has never denied claims he was a native of the city.An ICE spokesman said: \u0027His whole public persona is false.

He has inspired and infuriated generations of listeners and we’ll miss him. He represents something increasingly rare.People who don’t listen much to the programme sometimes read stories about complaints over his interviewing style, and assume this is some musty old gammon, an upmarket patriarch. Not so: the essence of John Humphrys is a bounding, hybrid vigour.If the BBC was a dog show, its public-school Dimblebys, Vines and Edward Stourtons would be high-bred, languid Great Danes or well-trained gundogs (and Paxo a pedigree Alsatian of elegant appearance but uncertain temperament).Humphrys would be a scrappy, scruffy mongrel terrier. Off he’d go, chasing every rabbit, catching every ball, leaping on the grandest sofa with mud on his paws and a bark of amused defiance.Here is the news: John Humphrys to QUIT the Today programme...From rustling sweet wrappers in cinemas to those ‘sorry you...BBC\u0027s focus on \u0027erse\u0027 comedy is just \u0027PC panic\u0027 that...The vulnerable teenager abused and discarded by powerful men...Share this articleIt is quite wrong to identify him with what the BBC calls ‘a babble of poshness’ in its absurd new recruitment ad to attract journalists from erse backgrounds.He was born in Cardiff to a family that knew hunger one great-grandmother, he discovered, was in the workhouse. He left school at 15 despite a grammar-school scholarship and did paper rounds (his first pay packet in the Fifties was £1.17s.6d on the Penarth Times, less than he got from the paper round so he kept that going, too).John was the first reporter at the Aberfan disaster when 116 children and 28 adults died as a junior school was engulfed by a coal tip.The trouble with such ‘great moments’ in journalism, he reflected, is that they are also great tragedies: for all his toughness, there is deep and honest sentiment in him. He worked as a foreign correspondent, set up the BBC New York bureau — a boozy, raucous time by all accounts.On the road, he reported on everything from Britain’s dock strikes in the Seventies to Nixon’s resignation and the moment when Rhodesia became Zimbabwe.          On the road, he reported on everything from Britain’s dock strikes in the Seventies to Nixon’s resignation and the moment when Rhodesia became ZimbabweHe was diplomatic correspondent, then for a few years anchored the Nine O’Clock News at the point when newsreaders, for the first time on the BBC, doubled as writer-editors (in the cut-glass days of Angela Rippon, they didn’t).But his arrival on Today to join Brian Redhead sparked a love affair with the job: he revels in the sheer fun of being first up in the morning with a story to tell.He reads the papers with fierce attention and swallows complex briefs fast.Aggressive at times, contrary quite often, he is fuelled by the adrenaline of news and genuine interest. Inside him vibrates the inquisitive, argumentative, determined cub reporter he was, loving intellectual friction. There is nothing smug or entitled he does not trade in long, self-important complicated questions but often in alarmingly brusque simple ones.His stamina is amazing: I presented Today four days a week for three-and-a-half years up to 1981, and remember the 3.30am alarm clocks, the briefings read with bleary eyes, the empty stomach assaulted by too much coffee.But he thrives: in recent years I had to visit the Today studio for the live trail of Midweek, and it was always bouncier when John was on. He would take his eyes off the ubiquitous prompt-and-briefing screens to crack some joke during a tape, or shove me a flippant note during the sports news.After one particularly gruelling live political interview, the note told me how he was feeling: ‘Always terrified after all these years.’That is the essence of Humphrys: taking nothing for granted, including his own abilities.As for the money, he was much maligned during the row about the gender pay gap at the Beeb. Executives will confirm that he never asked for the absurd sums which the BBC at one point paid him — reportedly £600,000 a year.He spends millions on his Kitchen Table Charities Trust, supporting small causes including sanitation and dignity projects for teenage girls in sub-Saharan Africa.He willingly halved his salary when the BBC anxiety about pay began. But after former China editor Carrie Gracie returned to the BBC newsroom and justifiably complained about insulting inequalities in pay, some mean spirit leaked a tape of John teasing North America editor Jon Sopel.‘How much of your salary are you prepared to hand over to Carrie . . .’ he was recorded saying. ‘I’ve handed over more than you f***ing earn but I’m still left with more than anybody else . . .’There was confected outrage against him — the then Loneliness Minister, the ridiculous Tracey Crouch even refused to be interviewed by him about anything.But if you actually listen, it is clear that Humphrys is sending up and winding up his soberer colleague, pretending he would ask him about it on air while Sopel was reporting on Trump. It’s quite funny: newsroom banter. Women do that, too, you know.But in any case, money is not what drives Humphrys: the fun of the job does. He won’t much like it when he does retire.Curiosity, enjoyment and a bit of nerviness give him his edge. Live radio is both fun and alarming if you lack a carapace of smug over-confidence.If he has seemed belligerent at times, deploying his full armoury on too small a target, as a listener I generally put it down to a sort of overspill of frustration with the absurdity of the whole world: ‘Lord, what fools these mortals be!’As for his mild — and I suspect deliberately clowning — bafflement of popular culture, either you laugh with him and mutter, ‘Keep up, grandpa!’ or be po-facedly offended.I, too, have shouted at him for interrupting someone really harmless, and as Today’s editor, Sarah Sands, weakly murmured after one entertaining car-crash moment with former Vogue editor Alexandra Shulman: ‘Fashion isn’t John’s area of expertise.’He had teased Shulman about unhealthy body shapes and uncomfortable shoes, and she lamented: ‘I was confronted by a grey-haired guy in chinos hectoring me on the business I had worked in for a quarter of a century and which he neither knew, nor cared, much about.’          That is the essence of Humphrys: taking nothing for granted, including his own abilitiesBut who could resist his blokey challenge to absurd fashion columns about the French tuck (leaving half your shirt hanging out like Meghan Markle). When men do it, they’re slobs, he said, but with women it’s fashion, adding: ‘As for ripped jeans. I rest my case.’Another pointless row came after he asked actor Rupert Everett whether he regretted, for career reasons, having come out as gay.There was prim fury all over Twitter, but Everett had talked about this before, and made it clear that, yes, it had damaged him. And he was on Today to discuss his film about Oscar Wilde’s disgrace.Would you prefer a veneer of pretend respect for everything, or a bit of grit? Is it not worth it for moments like Humphrys’ ferocious demolition over Jimmy Savile of BBC Director-General George Entwistle — Humphrys’ ultimate boss at the time?Or DUP politician Nelson McCausland’s comment that his was ‘a compassionate party’, only to have Humphrys respond: ‘Compassionate? I think if you were a gay person or a woman wanting an abortion . . .’Maybe our appreciation will grow with memory, and many of the charges against him weaken on examination: Former Home Office minister Hazel Blears was indeed interrupted several times in an interview about police intelligence failures, but reading the transcript you notice she simply isn’t answering a straight question.And misogynism? Nothing could be further from the truth. He cheered me on during my BBC years to the end, and long maintained that Today needs a woman editor.As for his most furious detractor, Tory minister Jonathan Aitken did accuse him of ‘poisoning the well of democratic debate’. But four years later was himself jailed for perverting the course of justice.No, on balance John Humphrys has been, for more than 30 years, a tonic — like a cold, clean, bracing morning dip. And we’re all the better for that."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/15/11/503234A700000578-0-image-m-26_1537005986869.jpg","title":"Minister NOT crack toxic leasehold deals trap families blames excited buyers","story":"    Heather Wheeler MP, Minister for Housing, speaking at the Housing, Communities and Local Government CommitteeSome double charges every decade, while other freeholds are sold on to third parties who only allow homeowners to buy them out for exorbitant fees.Ministers have pledged to outlaw the sale of newly built homes with leases following a public outcry. But Mrs Wheeler\u0027s comments suggest those already hit by the problem will be left to fend for themselves.Speaking at a Commons committee, Mrs Wheeler said legal advice showed legislation would be \u0027horrendously expensive\u0027, adding: \u0027I\u0027d much rather go down the voluntary route. There have been agreements between freeholders and leaseholders and clearly we want that momentum to carry on.\u0027The Mail has led the way in exposing the leasehold scandal, including where clauses make ground rents double every decade.The issue has been dubbed \u0027the PPI of the housebuilding industry\u0027 – a reference to the mis-selling of payment protection insurance by banks.     Joanne Darbyshire said she was mis-sold her home because of hidden and excessive ground rentsCampaigners say developers used the \u0027feudal\u0027 agreements to squeeze extra cash out of families desperate to get on the housing ladder – many with the support of the taxpayer through Help to Buy. Katie Kendrick, founder of the National Leasehold Campaign, said: \u0027Heather Wheeler\u0027s performance was absolutely appalling.\u0027Leaseholders are in uproar about this. When your life has been blighted by this scandal and you are still living this nightmare daily, and you hear what she is saying, it is just not acceptable.          Joanne Darbyshire (pictured) claims she was mis-sold her home in Bolton because of hidden ground rentsThey have since been given a quote of between £23,000 and £33,000 to buy their home in Lostock, Bolton, outright.They have been offered an RPI-linked ground rent contract by Taylor Wimpey but say this would still mean paying £10,000 to buy the freehold.Mrs Darbyshire, right, says: \u0027There\u0027s no end in sight. People say to me you should have read the small print but none of these things were in there.\u0027Andrea Harris bought a three-bedroom terraced house from Taylor Wimpey – but says she wasn\u0027t told about ground rent.The 39-year-old purchased the property for £160,000 with her former partner in 2008.          Andrea Harris (pictured) also claimed she was not told about the ground rent However, she was then hit with an annual ground rent bill of £200, which doubled to £400 last year. In another ten years it could double again to £800. Miss Harris, who lives in Radcliffe, Greater Manchester, now says she cannot sell the house and cannot afford to pay down the mortgage or buy the freehold.She says she is stuck making mortgage interest payments on a home she fears she\u0027ll never be able to pass on to her daughter Gabriella, eight, pictured left with her mother.Miss Harris said: \u0027I wanted this to be a family home that I could pass on ... but now I will never be able to do that.\u0027The Government isn\u0027t doing anything to help people like me – we\u0027re still stuck with crippling ground rents every year.\u0027                                                    Home Secretary Sajid Javid vowed when he held the housing portfolio to outlaw the use of leaseholds on newly-built homes in December 2017, branding the practice \u0027feudal\u0027.But more than a year later, campaigners say those trapped in toxic contracts are no closer to escaping them.Despite many leaseholders claiming they were not made aware of the full terms of their contracts, and suggestions it was similar to the PPI scandal, Mrs Wheeler said she did not agree it was an example of mis-selling.The 59-year-old, who owns her constituency home in Burton-on-Trent outright according to the Land Registry, previously sparked controversy when she tweeted that the \u0027British Empire\u0027 came first with 396 medals in the Rio Olympics, referring to Britain and countries that were formerly its colonies.Mrs Wheeler told MPs the comparison to PPI was difficult \u0027because in effect with PPI you were sold something you really didn\u0027t need, whereas this is completely different\u0027. She added: \u0027There is a contract, there was legal advice but perhaps people are caught up in the moment because it is their first purchase and it is incredibly exciting.\u0027\u0027We\u0027ve been fleeced for years and it\u0027s come to an end\u0027:...Wimbledon tennis chiefs are on the brink of buying...Fleeced on their leases: The families being hit with soaring...Flat owner who had new kitchen and bathroom fitted has...Share this article"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/27/01/4B97F2A900000578-0-image-m-87_1524789657174.jpg","title":"UN experts say North Korea shielding missiles airports","story":"    Hide and seek: Kim Jong-un\u0027s nuclear missile programme remains intact despite the deal signed with Donald Trump\u0027The Democratic People\u0027s Republic of Korea\u0027s nuclear and ballistic missile programmes remain intact,\u0027 said the report, using the official name for North Korea.\u0027The panel found that the DPRK is using civilian facilities, including airports for ballistic missile assembly and testing with the goal of effectively preventing \u0027decapitation\u0027 strikes.\u0027The Trump administration has led the drive at the United Nations to impose a series of tough economic sanctions on North Korea in response to its nuclear tests and missile launches in 2017.But North Korea has resorted to illegal transfers of oil, fuel and coal using a network of ships at sea to circumvent the UN-imposed measures aimed at depriving Pyongyang of revenue to build up its weapons programmes.\u0027These violations render the latest United Nations sanctions ineffective by flouting the caps on the DPRK\u0027s import of petroleum products and crude oil as well as the coal ban imposed in 2017,\u0027 said the report.          North Korea\u0027s nuclear and ballistic missiles have been hidden by airports and other facilities, UN experts have warned UN sanctions resolutions have set ceilings for North Korea of four million barrels of crude oil per year and 500,000 barrels of refined oil products.\u0027The panel found that DPRK ports and airports are used for rampant violations of the resolution ranging from illegal oil imports and coal exports to the smuggling of bulk cash by DPRK nationals,\u0027 said the report.North Korea continues to violate an arms embargo and attempted to supply light weapons to Syria, the Huthi rebels in Yemen, Libya and Sudan, it added.A bromance blossoms as Kim and Moon hold hands during...\u0027I want to be able to watch Iran\u0027: Trump says he\u0027s keeping...Trump boasts that the Taliban are only talking peace because...\u0027They said they were totally misquoted,\u0027 Trump brushes off...Share this article\u0027Financial sanctions remain some of the most poorly implemented and actively evaded measures of the sanctions regime,\u0027 said the panel.North Korean financial institutions operate in at least five countries, despite UN-imposed restrictions, while the country\u0027s diplomats help their country evade sanctions by controlling bank accounts in multiple countries.  The UN panel found that Pyongyang is using civilian facilities, including airports, for the assembly of ballistic missiles, like the Hwasong-14 pictured at its launch in July 2017The panel\u0027s findings were in line with US intelligence assessments that North Korea is unlikely to scrap its weapons programmes but may offer to scale back its activities to win sanctions relief.Last October dictator Kim Jong-un agreed to get rid of all the rogue state\u0027s nuclear weapons, according to a deal he signed at a summit with South Korean President Moon Jae-in.The hermit kingdom pledged to abolish all nuclear materials and facilities to achieve \u0027complete\u0027 denuclearisation,  Moon Jae-in has claimed after the pair\u0027s meeting three months ago.Kim and US President Donald Trump pledged to work towards denuclearisation at their landmark summit in June last year in Singapore, but the agreement was short on specific details. After his third summit in Pyongyang, Moon said the North was ready to invite international experts to watch the dismantling of a key missile site and would close the main Yongbyon nuclear complex if Washington took reciprocal actions.

The small crown was “the jewel of the young Queen” and shines fascinating light on the Victoria and Albert love story, says Richard Edgcumbe, the London museum’s curator of jewellery.“The story is fantastic – but even if it was not the Queen’s it would be a remarkable piece of work because it is so beautifully made. It is not a great fender of a thing, it is delicate … it flows through your hands like a piece of silk.”The coronet, he said, was incredibly flexible and “you can wiggle it and bend it to and fro” from being a small coronet to being a slightly wider tiara to being a full-scale bandeau.It was designed by Albert in 1840, the couple’s wedding year, and was made by Joseph Kitching, of Kitching and Abud, the Queen’s jewellers.In 1842, Victoria wore it in an important portrait of her by Franz Xaver Winterhalter, where, unconventionally, she had it on the back of her bobbed hair. The coronet was so important to Victoria that when in 1866, after five years of mourning Albert’s death, she felt she was up to opening parliament, she wore it instead of her crown.The coronet was passed down through the royal family, first to Edward VII and then George V and Queen Mary. They gifted it to their daughter Princess Mary, who can be seen wearing it in photographs. It was passed through her family until it was acquired most recently by an overseas private buyer.Because of its importance an export bar was placed on it by the government in 2016 to allow interested parties to match the £5m asking price. The Bollinger family came up with the money, an undisclosed sum, and gifted it to the nation.Its display at the V\u0026ampA was delayed to coincide with the refurbishment of the gallery, which is due to be completed by April.In total, 80 new items will join the William and Judith Bollinger gallery display. They include 49 art deco vanity cases collected by Freddie Mercury’s sister, Kashmira Cooke, and loaned to the museum in the singer’s memory with the prospect of it becoming a permanent gift."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f98bef9f447d083e0acc77ada913fb0673426a05/30_178_2020_1212/master/2020.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5babe4bcac0cbe7da3487af9c5f55ef9","title":"the transcontinental railroad at 150 in pictures","story":"In a new travelling exhibition, the significance of the transcontinental railroad, finished in 1869, will be celebrated in a series of images capturing its arduous construction through to its triumphant completion.

She had spent time in the Middle East, researching a biography of Lady Hester Stanhope (she has also written a novel, and a biography of Rebecca West). Gibb had some idea, she thought, of what to expect. But she was not prepared for the degree to which a woman only made sense in that culture if she could give birth. Gibb describes the strategies she developed to explain, to deflect finally she meets Halima, seemingly the mother of one of her students, but, in fact, only a first wife: when she was unable to conceive, her husband married again, and all four family members lived together. Halima points at the dusty ground. “I am like that,” she says with breath-stopping bluntness, “the barren place where nothing grows. Ayesha is like the palm trees … See how the green parakeets congregate and sing and nest in her branches.”This is a book so much more powerful for Gibb having searched the world for childless voices. It tells the author’s own story, too, as one voice among many: her far from unusual history of undiagnosed endometriosis. “Some women just have bad periods,” as one doctor put it. These “periods” were in reality various organs bleeding in turn, causing so much internal damage that she occasionally collapsed from the pain. Gibb’s account is restrained, coloured with love and gratitude – for the husband who stands by her through her illness (she knows how many millions of men do not) for the fact that early menopause means “I have not had endometriosis for 10 years now and I know how fortunate that makes me”. But at the same time it takes years to come to terms with childlessness: “There is no sleep so deep I will not find you there,” she writes, drawing on Beckett’s Footfalls. “My unborn child, the one who will never be, finds me even in sleep.”In Ghana childless women can be called witches, or are believed to have been cursed by witches they can be sent to “witch camps”, where they are safe but exiled. Everywhere, childless women are abused (often after the first year of marriage, when the issue – always the woman’s – starts to become clear). Over and over again, they blame themselves shockingly often they choose not to continue living. During the Sri Lankan war the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Elam fielded combat units of suicide bombers of both sexes the women, called Black Tigresses, were often childless because, as one peace campaigner puts it, “acting as a human bomb is an understood and accepted offering for a woman who will never be a mother”. In the west, Gibb argues, the punishments include working pay (fathers in Britain earn a fifth more than childless men) longer hours, blatantly inequitable taxation and political discourse that ennobles “hard‑working families”.Gibb directs a rare outburst of fury at the TV journalist Victoria Derbyshire, who prefaced an interview about the three-year-old Syrian boy Alan Kurdi, who was found drowned on a Turkish beach, with the words: “If you’re a parent, you might find this upsetting.” What was the assumption, that if you had no child you were somehow “less caring, less kind, and consequently of less value”? In 2015 Pope Francis was only restating a common prejudice when he said in St Peter’s Square that “the choice to not have children is selfish”. The Yoruba stricture that only admits a woman to full adulthood when she has a child is just an overt codification of an internationally prevalent assumption, that the childless are in some fundamental way not properly grown up, without an equal stake or voice. When Andrea Leadsom, running against Theresa May for the Tory leadership, suggested she had “a very real stake” in the future of the country because she was a parent, Gibb found she was “untethered by something illogical, even cruel … and I am lessened in my own eyes”.The world has devised some patchwork solutions. In the Balkans there are the burrneshas, women who have forsworn sex and in return are allowed to live as men. Gibb discusses Catholic nuns, and the argument that they are spiritual mothers. There are the Kikuyu in Kenya, among more than 30 sub‑Saharan groups who officially acknowledge marriages in which two women form a family together: “You must make yourself a queen,” says one Kikuyu woman. And Gibb offers this book, too, as a small step forward, hoping that, in her acts of listening, fastidious exactitude and unflinching accounts of tragedy (it’s a hard book to read without crying at least once), she can make the case for empathy, imagination and respect as the most viable beginnings.• Aida Edemariam’s The Wife’s Tale is out in paperback (4th Estate).

Here’s our roundup of your comments and photos from last week.“Jesus, that was a dark and disturbing slice of French noir,” says Tom Mooney, who has been reading The Executioner Weeps by Frederic Dard:Daniel, a French artist, is on a break near Barcelona. Driving down a road one night, a young woman throws herself in front of his car in an apparent act of suicide. When he goes to the body, however, he realises she is still alive. Fearful of the consequences, he takes the girl back to his hotel. She awakes with severe amnesia, remembering nothing of her previous life. Daniel then becomes obsessed with her, instilling himself as her boyfriend and the central character in her new life. But, as he delves deeper into her forgotten past, he discovers the real, shocking reason she threw herself in front of his car.Grisly, grim and weaving from noir into horror, this is a very effective and highly creepy novel.Isabelle Leinster has been reading and “loving” Once Upon A River by Diane Setterfield:I have no connection to the River Thames but her description of the many stages of the river and the folk who live along its banks is captivating. The mystery of how a 4-year-old girl ended up in the river and was rescued and where she came from are central and I can’t wait to find out.“I saw somewhere that 2019 is the 50th anniversary of the first book in the Flashman series,” says RedmonT. “While I couldn’t care less about that, it did remind me how long it has been since I read them, so I’ve ed back in”:This morning, I finished the third in the series - Flash for Freedom - and am now about to start Flashman at the Charge. I think Royal Flash is by far the weakest of the series (though still brilliant) and Flashman and the Redskins the best. I urge you all to have a go at reading them if you haven’t already. As well as being extremely funny, they work as a highly entertaining history lesson - even down to the way people spoke in the mid-to-late nineteenth century2manyb00ks is enjoying The Lightning Men by Thomas Mullen, the second in the Darktown series:Crime fiction set in 1950 in Atlanta when African Americans have just joined the police force. The crime part is great but what is really interesting is how society is shifting and changing. The three main characters are well drawn and all making compromises between the law, their ethics and their families.Frontier by Can Xue has impressed Will1900:A vast, strangely ambiguous tale of people who find themselves in a dreamlike frontier town in China. Of all of her books, this one felt most like a collection of folk tales, run through with mysticism, and strange natural phenomena- for all its modernity it felt like discovering an ancient text.Yosserian has just finished Patrimony: A True Story, by Philip Roth:A memoir about his father, Herman Roth, and his death from a brain tumour. Roth has a straightforward way of telling the story of father and son, eschewing prose fireworks, as so far has all of his books I’ve read. It is poignant, and at times wryly funny. A commenter on Goodreads said that Roth showed how to be a good son. That despite Roth junior, or perhaps because of, being so keen to leave home and Roth senior, and establish his independence, he is able to loop back, and be there for his father later in life.Finally, a (beautifully written) confession by nosuchzone:I quite like being the last possible reader of a paperback - I bought the orange-banded Penguins that Margery Allingham wrote during wartime (it was a sudden interest) and, like the blitz-zones of London, Coventry, etc, they cracked at the spines, shedding pages, or clumps of them, as the reading progressed. The desiccated glue, that powders your fingers as you brush it’s scales aside, has a faintly seaweedy smell, I noticed. They’re still on a shelf, albeit lain flat (they wouldn’t hold together stood upright - ah, it comes to us all).Me, I buy second-hand cloth-bound hardcovers if I can and almost always throw the dust jackets away at once. What I like to read most is an old hardback that’s long lost it’s jacket, and has, at some point in its long life, been left skew-whiff on a pile near a window for a summer or two - so that the sun-bleaching of the cloth on the front cover is a rhomboid ghost-margin to its darker interior. Preferably in Trafalgar Blue, as it was called. It adds a spiritual dimension. Well, I find it does.You throw the dust jackets away?!

He’s also a Breton. So when he decided to leave his top ision team to join a small team based in Brittany for the 2018 season, most of his countrymen offered understanding Gallic nods. After all, cycling is in the blood of residents of this north-west region in France. Neighbouring Normandy isn’t far behind in its love of all things two-wheeled. And it’s little wonder – there are few areas better suited to exploration from the saddle.With hundreds of kilometres of voies vertes – greenways accessible only to those on two wheels, two feet, or a horse – there are plenty of options for families as well as Lycra-clad fanatics.Each of these routes is easily accessible from Cherbourg, Le Havre or Caen. So grab your bike, hop on the ferry, and get ready for some truly memorable cycling adventures.Cherbourg to Querqueville and back (nine miles14.5km)Best for: families looking for a safe and easy route to peddle.Highlights: stunning views out to sea.Start near La Cité de la Mer – Cherbourg’s maritime museum and well worth a visit – and take the cycle path alongside Boulevard de La Saline towards Querqueville.

Their capture of a bridge over the canal was a crucial strategic victory during the Normandy landings.This path is entirely along a signposted greenway, from Caen’s ferry port into the city itself, and will only take an hour or two to cover. It forms the opening portion of La Vélo Francette cycle route, which runs to La Rochelle.Caen to Bayeux via Juno beach and Arromanches (28.5 miles46km)Best for: the more confident cyclist, as much of the route is along shared roads.Highlights: arromanches 360° circular cinema, which tells the story of the Battle of Normandy.From Caen, take the cycle path north to Langrune-sur-Mer. Then head west along the coast towards Courseulles-sur-Mer, home to Juno beach on which Canadian forces landed during D-Day – a museum there commemorates their heroism. Then it’s the D112B south towards Crépon, then north towards Arromanches. From there, take the D87 to Bayeux – home to the famed 70 metre-long Bayeux Tapestry, and only seven miles away.Cherbourg to Carentan (34 miles55km)Best for: cyclists who are growing in confidence.Highlights: the wildlife-filled marshlands of the Parc naturel regional des Marais du Cotentin et du Bessin.This is an established and well-signposted route, with no shortage of history along the way. It takes in the medieval cobbled town of La Haye-du-Puits and the châteaux ruins of Brix and Bricquebec.Ouistreham to Domfront (62 miles100km)Best for: confident cyclists, thanks to some steep sections.Highlights: the gorges of the Orne Valle, which offer multiple photo opportunities.This is the first full section of La Vélo Francette and offers its share of undulating terrain. From Caen it’s on to Thury-Harcourt, then the riverside village of Pont-d’Ouilly, Flers – home to a very pretty château – and finally on to historic Domfront, with its 11th-century castle.La Véloroute du Littoral de la Côte d’Albâtre: Le Havre to Le Tréport (about 100miles160km)Highlights: the stunning coastal views.This route follows the Alabaster Coast, with glorious views rewarding those confident enough to take on its undulations. It passes through Étretat – which provided inspiration for impressionist painters including Claude Monet – as well as Fécamp, home to a Benedictine abbey and a useful option for an overnight stay.Tour de Manche: Cherbourg to Roscoff (440miles708km)Best for: experienced riders who want a multi-stage adventure.Highlights: Mont St-Michel, Parc naturel regional des Marais du Cotentin et du Bessin and the waterfalls in Mortain are all glorious.You may not quite be ready for the Tour de France, but how about the Tour de Manche, a cycling adventure that links France and England?

Foodies read on …MarketsAcross France, Normandy is esteemed for its abundance of quality produce and rich gastronomic history. Dozens of traditional markets showcase the best of these, with further specialist markets dedicated to fish, organic produce and local crafts. Whatever the day of the week, wherever you happen to be, you’ll never be far from one.Perhaps the most picturesque of these is to be found in the medieval “halles” in Dives-sur-Mer on a Monday. You can wander around the 14th-century half-timbered building, which is packed to bursting with stalls, and chat to dozens of local producers. Sundays in Trouville-sur-Mer are equally popular with locals and visitors looking for top-notch fresh bread, cheeses, meat and charcuterie – local farmers lay out their vegetables and homemade preserves, vinegar and pickles, too.In the surrounds of glamorous Deauville, regular gourmet food markets take place at Place du Marché (Tuesday, Friday, Saturday) and the abundant high-end restaurants and Parisian-style cafes are ripe for celeb-spotting during Deauville’s American film festival in September. If poisson is your passion, Trouville, the adjacent 17th-century port town, boasts a daily market on the quay with numerous terrace cafes and grills for feasting on seafood.Rouen and the Seine valley are renowned for the quality of their markets. For cheeses, fish and seafood, and local specialities such as pressed duck, check out Clos Saint-Marc (Saturday), Vieux-Marché (Sun-Fri and brocante or flea market on Saturday) and les Emmurées (Tuesday, Saturday) and the 250-stall Sotteville-les-Rouen (Thursday, Sunday).Regional specialities and where to sample themDairy herds were introduced to Normandy by the Vikings and the region has long produced world-class cheeses for the Paris market. You can buy camembert, Livarot, Pont-l’Evêque and Neufchâtel in shops and supermarkets, but to try small-batch artisan cheeses, head for the markets and specialist fromageries – notably in the Pays d’Auge and smaller Le Pays de Bray regions. At Isigny sur Mer, west of Caen, you can also enjoy a tour and tasting at Sainte Mére cheese factory.As you’d expect, the coastal towns and villages are awash with fabulous fish and seafood. Inland, look out for exceptional beef and veal, and the duck – canard de Rouen – appears on lots of menus.If you’ve a sweet tooth, don’t visit the region without trying a traditional tarte Normande, a rich shortcrust pastry tart filled with creamy egg custard and almonds, and topped with slices of caramelised apple. RestaurantsSmart, family-friendly eateries serving simple, seasonal produce are plentiful in Normandy. For fresh “surf and turf” with a sensational sea view, Hôtel des Isles in Barneville-Carteret, just south of Cherbourg, offers a land and sea starter buffet with seafood platters, grilled or plancha-seared fish and traditional stewed meats for main.If you’re after a traditional experience inland, try Brasserie Paul in Rouen where fresh regional specialities such as rabbit pâté, Normandy snails, local farm chicken and fine cheeses are on the menu.Rouen also offers stylish two-Michelin-starred dining at Gill – pigeon is a speciality – or the more affordable but still sleekly decorated sister restaurant, Gill Côté Bistro.DrinkingCalvados (apple brandies) and cider are the region’s two signature drinks. Three controlled appellations produce the former, one of which is Pays d’Auge, where copper alembic pot stills are used. On the 25-mile (40km) cider route east of Caen, you can visit more than 20 establishments producing one or both of these, as well as pommeau – made by mixing apple juice with brandy. Many of the distilleries and cidermakers occupy picture-postcard houses set amid apple orchards and lush pastures.MarketsFrom the bustling Sunday market at Carnac to Vannes’s fish market (four days a week, as well as a traditional market on Wednesdays) to the astonishing 20 neighbourhood markets that are spread around Rennes, Brittany is a region brimming with food and produce, crafts and culture. Whether you’re looking for crisp apples and freshly picked strawberries or more gastro items such as rare poultry and artisanal butters, you’ll find them on a stall – Breton chefs do their shopping here … and they know a thing or two.At charming Pontivy, by the river Blavet and the Nantes-to-Brest canal, you can drop in at the Monday market before exploring the medieval castle and the maze of winding streets. The town also has a thriving antiques trade and there are regular flea markets.Quaint Bécherel, between Saint-Malo and Rennes, has a buzzing Saturday food and household goods market and is also one of France’s best-loved book towns. There are more than a dozen bookshops, a book market on the first Sunday of the month and a lively schedule of literary events, including a fête du livre (book fair) every Easter.In the summer months, you can find night markets in Carnac and Quiberon, and enjoy classic Breton musical entertainment with bombarde (woodwind) players while you browse.Regional specialities and where to sample themIf you’re self-catering in Brittany you’re in luck. With 1,740 miles of coastline, you can pick up some of the best fish and shellfish in Europe. Brittany is the powerhouse of France’s oyster trade, providing one-third of the nation’s yield – Cancale is its capital. Look out, too, for delicious mussels, scallops, clams, lobster, and langoustines, as well as more exotic items such as organic abalones.Breton producers are very proud of their pork – saucissons of all kinds abound, while audouille – a sausage made from smoked chitterling – has its semi-official capital in Guéméné-sur-Scorff. Across the region, look out for local onions and organic honey.If you’re big on pastry, kouign amann – which translates as “butter cake” – is a Breton speciality. Created in 1860 in the town of Douarnenez, this gooey, layered confection is sold by weight in traditional patisseries the very definition of “naughty but nice”.RestaurantsIf ever you’re in need of a tasty snack between meals, a regional comfort food is the crepe, both the sweet kind and savoury galettes. They are served in restaurants and occasionally on the street. At the Creperie Ti Saozon, in Roscoff, chef Estelle Combot prepares sublime crepes with fish, as well as dessert crepes that get even the locals queuing around brunchtime.Seafood restaurants dot the coast. La Côte, close to Carnac’s famous menhirs, occupies a large, old house in a delightful setting, with a terrace overlooking a carp-filled pond. Try the squid with pig’s trotters or the lobster.L’Amphytrion in Lorient has two Michelin stars and a chic ambience. Acclaimed chef Jean-Paul Abadie creates fine art with spider crab, mackerel, sea urchins and local fish such as red mullet.DrinkingCider is the “wine” of Brittany. Cornouaille was the first French cider to be recognised with an appellation controlee label. Look out for the 10 AOC cider-makers and six non-AOC producers listed on the CIDREF website.

It is time for bookmakers and gambling operators to put the vulnerable, customers and staff ahead of cold hearted profit.”According to comments on an internal Ladbrokes Coral message board, shared with the  by an anonymous staff member, many employees are unhappy that they are to be judged on encouraging gamblers to set up online accounts.Other employees pointed out that staff who work in busy shops with a lot of passing trade might be at an advantage when it comes to signing customers up to online accounts.In the memo to staff, Ladbrokes said it would not take any decision on which shops to close until it had finished a 45-day period of “collective consultation”.No dismissals will happen before 1 May, within days of legislation coming into force that cuts the maximum stake on FOBTs from £100 to £2, effectively rendering them uneconomic.While some staff will be made redundant, others will have their contracts reduced to 36 hours a week.A Ladbrokes spokesperson said shop closures were “an inevitable outcome of the changes to FOBT regulation”.“We are fully committed to running a fair and transparent consultation process with our shop colleagues. Given the regulatory environment, our aim is to keep the maximum number of shops open, job losses to a minimum, and to continue to build a responsible and vibrant multi-channel environment in our shops where customers can transact with us seamlessly in our shops or online.”Betting shop trade union Community said the cuts would be “deeply worrying” for Ladbrokes employees, adding that front line staff should not bear the brunt of the impact.“The company’s consultation document has caused real concern among our members, with many believing that decisions have already been made to target those workers in betting shops outside the city centres,” said operations director Tom Blenkinsop.“Ladbrokes must immediately engage with Community, the union for betting shop workers, to see if an alternative plan can be found to avoid job losses. The government also has a role to play, and must look at what support they can offer to workers whose jobs are at risk as an unintended consequence of changes to the law.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3075585869bb90cf569a4388fc10348b872f59ce/147_84_1757_1053/master/1757.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aef9c696483c33cb068bf32dfd126ead","title":"statue margaret thatcher cue vandals","story":"Place an obstacle in the path and many people will seek to overcome it. Urban planners build footpaths, pedestrians forge their own desire lines. Hanging a “Do not climb” plaque is often a psychological incentive for people to clamber on to the forbidden edifice. This aspect of human nature should have occurred to the people behind the proposed installation of an enormous Margaret Thatcher statue in her home town, Grantham, in Lincolnshire. In order to prevent the statue being besieged by vandals, it will have to stand atop a three-metre (10ft) plinth.Creative critics of Thatcher’s legacy have already proposed workarounds: paintball target practice, hammer-throwing competitions, and the simple but trusty ladder. The depth of antipathy to the former prime minister means no matter what is built in her honour, it will draw vandals and dissenters. Knowing in advance that a statue commemorating her is likely to be defaced immediately, it is mystifying to insist on erecting it at all. Thatcher’s legacy remains with us today, and is still comfortably within living memory: that history, therefore, is still contested and fought over. Her fans and critics are embroiled in a battle to have their perspective recognised and recorded in history’s narrative.The inevitable vandalism will accurately reflect a toxic political legacy: the UK has long been cleaved by a social and class ide. Traditionally, the Conservatives have represented the interests of the ruling class and elite, and Labour the working class and more vulnerable. That two camps have such ergent views on the leader of one party is hardly a surprise. It is very likely that a statue of Tony Blair would also be immediately emblazoned with a spray-painted reference to war crimes for his role in the Iraq war. Freedom of expression isn’t always entirely polite, because feelings and emotions run deep, especially when people’s communities, livelihoods and loved ones have been jeopardised or harmed by the policies of these iniduals and their parties. Some councils operate a 10-year rule, to allow “passions to cool” before erecting a statue. Nonetheless, just this Monday Karl Marx’s memorial in Highgate cemetery was found vandalised.Perhaps statues have had their day. London in particular seems haunted by dark, metal figures of long-dead men, most with deep involvement in the bloody British colonial project, high-up roles in short wars, or simply the great fortune to be born into wealthy families. What do they teach us about history? Practically nothing. Barely anyone searches the background of a statue commemorating some man they’ve never heard of. These shadowy figures exist mostly to maintain the dominance of an inidual’s memory posthumously, or are erected in exchange for sizable bequests.Public sentiment around statues appears to be shifting. In 2018 a statue of Thatcher was rejected by Westminster council, despite being fitted with a hard-to-climb plinth and integral sockets for scaffolding to protect it during protests. The #RhodesMustFall movements in South Africa and Oxford, in the UK, forced some uncomfortable conversations about the degree to which colonial history is embedded in the architectural landscape of many institutions. Even when statues are not politically sensitive, they are not always welcome additions to the cultural landscape. The flat-out ridicule levelled at one of Cristiano Ronaldo, and another of Victoria Wood, shows the perils of trying to honour people in such a form: commemoration via statue can be high risk when capturing a likeness is the only point of the metal lump.Statues are only one way to tell us about history, and not even a good one. Murals, plaques marking important events, and public photographic exhibitions are more informative. History deserves to be in the public space and debated in the public realm. Growing up, I learned much about local history from murals commemorating the Chartist uprising and immediate murderous suppression of protestors in Newport, and a huge amount from almost every gable wall in Belfast. A statue of a prime minister has never taught me anything, bar the fact that too many of these people looked the same.If statues continue to play a part in public life, expect the public to engage with them, and not always with respect. In parliament, a bust of Oliver Cromwell was recently fitted with sensors after one or more MPs constantly turned it to face the wall in retaliation for his actions in Ireland. If Thatcher is hoisted atop a 10ft plinth, expect her to receive similar treatment. The will to vandalise her likeness is as much a part of the contestation of history as the right to leave her a bouquet of flowers.• Dawn Foster is a  columnist who writes on politics, social affairs and economics"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fd453665de51381ba0da8b57a8a972803ff43237/0_91_5195_3118/master/5195.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=003b536eabaa29066fda7b1eb8b59a98","title":"the guardian view on brexit and ireland the forging of folly","story":"Brexit is about drawing lines on maps and hearts. In that respect it is at odds with the 1998 Good Friday agreement which sought to erase them. Key to ending the Troubles was the removal of the hard border between the north and south of Ireland. Theresa May’s problem is that she has committed to leaving the European Union while respecting the peace deal that depended on both London and Dublin being part of it. The agreement made less salient the questions of identity: under its provisions people in Northern Ireland could be, uncontroversially, citizens of Britain or Ireland. What did it matter if they were part of a club that allowed people to travel, work and reside anywhere? North-south institutions were set up to oversee common endeavours. The agreement was sold as a “stepping stone to a united Ireland” to republicans, while unionists held that it was “securing the union”. The symbolism was key: with a hard border you can see that the island is partitioned, without it you cannot.Aware of this, London and Dublin committed not to return to the days of border checkpoints, which would risk undermining the peace deal’s principles. Mrs May’s withdrawal agreement enshrines this in law in the form of an insurance policy: to maintain an open border on the island of Ireland in the event that the UK leaves the EU without securing an all-encompassing deal, there would be a backstop arrangement to allow for frictionless trade. Fanatical rightwing anti-EU Tory MPs were not bothered about the peace process, or the aspirations of fellow subjects. Instead, they saw in the insurance policy a devious mechanism to force Britain to march in lockstep with EU regulations that hard Brexiters were desperate to get out of. To reverse her government’s historic Commons defeat, Mrs May voted to replace the backstop. She did so to win over the Democratic Unionist party, but her actions enraged businesses in Northern Ireland which had publicly backed her deal.In Belfast on Tuesday, the prime minister was back to the push-me-pull-you politics of Brexit. She signalled that, rather than the “alternative arrangements” to the backstop floated previously, she was edging towards an insurance policy that could either be time-limited or allow for a unilateral withdrawal. The prime minister may have said more than she intended, as a group of her MPs considering “alternative arrangements” were meeting in London as she spoke. Neither of Mrs May’s offers seem possible in a strictly legal sense, but both could be rendered in political terms. Almost everyone agrees that the backstop must be a temporary measure, but no one wants to say so in law. On such anvils, political follies can be forged. Mrs May’s problem stems from the fact that the only Northern Ireland party represented in the Commons is the DUP. The party’s role in itself undermines a core principle of the Good Friday agreement, that the position of the British government would be “neutral” – it had no selfish, strategic or economic interest in Northern Ireland and would accept the unification of Ireland by consent. The DUP-Conservative pact, a result of the 2017 election, calls this aspect into question. The DUP represents only a third of votes cast in 2017."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e6ade12fa2343560ae1185a2330a254d50f83018/0_18_5070_3044/master/5070.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2b74b4dbfe34d1a188ad03961d05b967","title":"eu far right steve bannon citizen debates","story":"The story of my life is, in some ways, the story of Europe. My father emigrated from Egypt to France in 1986, one month before I was born. My French mother fulfilled her dreams of becoming an English teacher after having grown up in the Calais region looking at the cliffs of Dover. Together they worked hard to give their children a bright future in a free, borderless, united Europe. I grew up with this dream, which has partly become a reality. But I’m not sure my own children will get to enjoy the privileges of belonging to the EU in the same way – if at all.So I decided to go on a debating tour of France, to better understand what makes us still believe in the strengths of the EU, as well as the fears some people have. I quit my job in Brussels at the European parliament to travel to small towns and villages in 30 of France’s départements and take part in discussions with local people about Europe, immigration, Brexit and Frexit. I’ve now held more than 60 such debates, ahead of the EU-wide elections due in May. Here are some of the lessons I’d like to share, and which must surely hold true elsewhere in Europe too.I once found myself listening to an angry man telling me how “African and Arab immigrants can’t integrate”.All the while, I thought of my Arab, Muslim, immigrant father who wakes up every day before I do, works six days a week saving children’s lives as a doctor, his accent an endearing reminder of Egypt. I sat there and listened to the man’s concerns and then respectfully confronted his arguments with facts such as there is no connection between race and crime. But the truth is, I was lucky enough that he’d shared his views in the first place. This at least allowed for a genuine exchange of ideas, and it made him feel listened to.Bridging the gap between EU institutions and citizens requires better work at a grassroots level. I know from working in the European parliament, at the heart of Europe’s democracy, how worried most people are about the rise of xenophobia and Euroscepticism, and how hesitant they are about addressing this head-on. But travelling to reach out to voters can contribute to shifting their mindsets. Shunning that effort and keeping to the “Brussels bubble” is a huge mistake because it allows the far right to monopolise public discourse, or set its terms.After David Cameron called for a referendum on EU membership, the Scottish MEP for whom I then worked, Alyn Smith, switched from his parliamentary work to travel across Scotland, listening and speaking to people from all backgrounds in dozens of events about the benefits of belonging to the EU. There has to be more of this kind of outreach across the continent.The European parliament has direct, tangible effects on our lives. It can weigh on financial markets, on climate change, on the tech giants. It is relevant in so many positive ways – not a hotbed of bureaucrats. Discussing its role with people in local communities can shift perceptions. During a debate in the region of Savoie, in the French Alps, one lady told me she had no interest whatsoever in the EU elections. I mentioned Europe’s role in defending minority and women rights, and it meant a lot to me that she left the meeting saying she’d cast a vote for her “children’s future”. Likewise, in discussions with supporters of the gilets jaunes movement, I saw how making the case for citizens’ empowerment could actually convince people to vote in the EU elections, not just stand in the cold at roundabouts complaining about “elites”.At the heart of the European project is an endeavour to build a better future for us all. If Islamophobia is on the rise, we should fight it with just as much energy as we do antisemitism, and vice versa. Indifference is a recipe for collective failure. If you’re a citizen of an EU country, get involved. Call your MEP, write a petition, support a citizens’ initiative, join a party or an NGO you believe in. Engage with your community, especially in the face of hardship. After the November 2015 terrorist attacks in Paris, I organised a gathering around a group of Syrian refugee musicians who’d arrived in Europe on rafts. Together we founded Syrians Got Talent, who have since given 19 concerts across Europe. We were disparaged by Breitbart News, the far-right website set up by Donald Trump’s then presidential campaign strategist, Steve Bannon. We just went on, building trust between locals and refugees.The fight for a united and strong EU is a worthwhile one. Debating with people in small localities throughout France has reminded me – and hopefully others – that the power of the European project lies in its citizens, in transcending national borders so that we can live together. Now is the time to stand up to the anti-EU push Bannon has launched. This May, for the first time in its history, the European parliament risks becoming a fulcrum for the far right. The significance of this should not be underestimated.• Schams El Ghoneimi is a French-Egyptian pro-EU activist based in Paris he has worked for the European parliament and founded Syrians Got Talent, a Syrian refugee musical group"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/80b542e7713dcec1dad1aa276f1f130813cfb156/0_0_941_574/master/941.jpg?width=645\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=df10dc63614f0c452c94bd4f75c6a2a9 645w","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of pleasure","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘pleasure’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment, published in print in the Observer New Review is ‘pleasure’.Share your photos of what pleasure means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.The closing date is Wednesday 6 February at 10am.

In the case of China, the furore around the cancelled Dolce \u0026amp Gabbana show in Shanghai last November amid allegations of racism related to the accompanying campaign did just that – but not just for the obvious reasons.They are statistics that the fashion industry isn’t unaware of. The British Fashion Council has partnered with China’s largest retailer, JD, since 2017 to help introduce British designers to the lucrative market as well as fund its annual Vogue and GQ prizes. Its partner and supporter, the Value Retail-owned outlet Bicester Village, is also more than aware of the numbers.Lau has selected an edit from the brands Huishan Zhang, Ryan Lo, Anais Jourden, Mukzin, I Am Chen, Marie Yat, Xu Zhi, Matter Matter, Yang Li and Snow Xue Gao to showcase in the shop. Not all designers hail from China, some have Chinese heritage and have grown up and studied elsewhere. They are all names that Lau has been tracking for a while.“There has never been a better time to show off beautiful, slightly lesser known fashion brands as the increasing appetite for ‘newness’ is omnipresent,” says the Bicester Village business director John Durnin. “We have always been keen to nurture up-and-coming talent, offering these young designers a platform to showcase their collections to a UK and global audience, introducing them to new customers from around the world.”Following its official launch, the pop-up is already off to a good start, with Lau’s edit offering something different to what else is on offer at Bicester, she says.“It’s a great platform for those designers – the people that are coming in know their stuff and are very discerning. This specific mix of names reflect where Chinese fashion is at today and there’s something for everyone.

I have always thought so – and that time and place is if you are Richey Edwards in the Manic Street Preachers circa 1993. Outside of that context, leopard print is intimidating. It is a statement of the kind most men get self-conscious about. Yes, it looks great on Keith Richards, but it also looks faintly ridiculous when you are mooching around the tea point at the .There were, inevitably, some funny looks when I wore it for a day at work. But was that the print? Or because I was wearing a blousey number with half my chest on show in the middle of winter? It’s hard to say. But after half an hour, I started to relax into it. And then I noticed all the women in the office effortlessly wearing their animal-print skirts, scarves and dresses. Surely us guys should get to enjoy it, too, without freaking out?I decide that I would definitely give leopard print another go. I could imagine wearing it as a coat lining, or on a slightly more suitably tailored shirt … maybe even on a luxurious sweater. It might be a little while before I treat my colleagues to a second look, though. Tim JonzeThere was a moment in January, about halfway through the Versace menswear show, when a model emerged in a larger-than-life leopard-print coat complete with a coordinating hairdo. Yes, that’s right. Leopard hair. Later, on her Instagram feed, Donatella Versace posted a shot of herself and said model with the caption “the hair-coat match was everything”.Despite many of the recent autumn shows being tales of sedate elegance where suits were front and centre, animal patterns, in particular leopard, offered a necessary bite. Raf Simons showed an almost floor-length coat of leopard in a ballroom in Paris. At Marni, leopard appeared on loosely shaped trousers as coats, trims, hats and shirt hems peeked out from beneath knitted layers. Hedi Slimane’s debut men’s collection for Celine also included a leopard coat, while a selection of footwear featured this splashy pattern.As someone who has never entertained leopard, and pretty much lives in jeans, it threw me.Of course, the idea of men wearing leopard print is not unheard of. But, like many things in men’s fashion that deviate from the conservative, it still has the potential to raise eyebrows. Yes, we have all seen Rod Stewart, Brian Eno and Bryan Ferry working leopard print, while images by Jesse Frohman of Kurt Cobain in a leopard coat, jeans, trapper hat and white sunglasses prove that leopard and denim are excellent bedfellows. But still ...Regardless of what you think, it’s happening. At Asos, there are 143 items listed (you will need to mentally prepare yourself for the sight of leopard briefs). Zara’s classic leopard shirt would work over a white T-shirt or under a grey V-neck knit, untucked, a tad grungy. Or perhaps a muted leopard Our Legacy cardigan, thrown over a denim shirt, is another easy way in. See also All Saints, known for indie lead-singer tendencies, whose animal-print offerings include a simple leopard T-shirt.I am definitely intrigued. And I definitely want to try that Simons coat on with some urgency. Whether that means I am sold remains to be seen. But if the likes of Timothée Chalamet and Michael B Jordan can wear designer harnesses on the red carpet, why not leopard print? Roll on Oscar night. Chalamet in Raf Simons leopard? Oh, go on then.

Treat with caution.Though it can be tailored to just about any protein you like, I think the juicy texture of pork works particularly well in this dish and, according to YouTubers Steph and Chris of Chinese Cooking Demystified, “older variants… use pork belly instead of loin. At most restaurants nowadays, you’ll see this with lean meat, though, and we do prefer it here.” I’m inclined to agree: the edge of the fat on the pork belly used by Yan-Kit So in her Classic Chinese Cookbook goes deliciously crisp in the fryer, but the rest becomes annoyingly chewy belly is a cut better slow cooked.To my surprise, however, the spare ribs used in Kei Lum and Diora Fong Chan’s China: The Cookbook work much better, the meat remaining soft and juicy, while the bony bits are little more than vehicles for batter. Some of my testers find them a bit fiddly, however, so I’m going to stick with loin, though I would urge anyone who doesn’t mind getting up close and personal with some bones to give them a try (get your butcher to chop them up first they’re pretty hard on the old cleaver).Cut the meat nice and small Anglo-Chinese food writer Lizzie Mabbott muses: “I would go with pork shoulder strips. Chunks seem only appropriate for chicken, but I can’t explain why.” Having chewed my way through the great Ken Hom’s mighty 5cm cubes of fatty pork neck, I can explain why: chicken is a softer meat, pork has more heft to it.Loin might not need much in the way of tenderising, but a brief marinade will always add flavour we particularly like the garlicky soy mixture used by Amy and Julie Zhang in their Dumpling Sisters Cookbook. I don’t think you need to add any sugar at this point, because the sauce will be sweet anyway, but testers do enjoy the warmth of Chinese five spice in the recipe in Charmaine Solomon’s Complete Asian Cookbook.Slimmers stop reading now: though you can find recipes, like that from Ching He Huang, which simply stir-fry the meat, this is not health food – most sweet and sour pork is deep-fried, often doubly so, to make it “very crisp”, as Solomon puts it. You could skip the initial fry and blanch the pork first instead, as the Zhangs suggest, but that’s a bit of a faff, and I think has a tendency to make the meat slightly tough. Plus it means another pan to wash up.The protein is a movable feast, however you could probably even make this dish from battered Mars bars if you wanted, because the important thing is the sauce. Chef Jeremy Pang of School of Wok writes in his book Chinese Unchopped: “In the old days (way before the internet), sweet and sour was not red in colour at all, as it was predominantly made up of vinegar, sugar and dark soy sauce. However, with the heavy influence western culture now has, the Cantonese have found that ketchup provides the perfect balance and wrapping consistency for this dish. Who’s to say this recipe upgrade isn’t just as authentic as the old ways? As with any culture as it changes and adapts, it doesn’t make its expressions any less authentic it just makes them a product of the times.”They concede, however, that “if you don’t feel like screwing around with these fruit pastes, obviously don’t hesitate to reach for the ketchup. Basically every restaurant in Guangdong uses it, the vast majority of families use it … it’s absolutely an authentic addition to the dish.” I try a dollop of trusty Heinz in the Zhangs, So and Solomon’s recipes, and find that, when mixed with extra vinegar and sugar, it does indeed produce a sauce very close to the stuff I remember from restaurants – though not, it must be noted, quite as sweet and orange and gloopy as the glorious “proper sweet and sour sauce, like you get from a takeaway” made by chefs Chin and Choo Ziang using distilled malt vinegar and orange squash – “if you’ve ever wondered what that flavour is you can’t quite grasp, it’s orange squash”.Ken Hom, meanwhile, uses fresh orange juice, and So puts in pineapple juice – the extra citrussy tang of all of the versions using fruit prove more popular than the tasty but somewhat one-dimensional ketchup-only recipes, but most popular of all is the jam mixture, which has a fruity depth to it that the others lack, with a distinct berry sharpness from the cranberries. As I don’t have a particularly sweet tooth, I’m going to cut back on the sugar slightly (soft light brown makes a decent substitute for palm sugar here) – though feel free to adjust to your taste – and add a dash of soy sauce and Hom’s red rather than white vinegar, to help balance the potentially cloying sweet and sour flavours.Once you’re happy with the flavour, you’ll need to thicken it: both cornflour and potato starch work fine for this purpose.Many sweet and sour recipes are very simple indeed: Hom’s contains just shallots in the way of vegetable matter, and the Zhangs stick with the classic pineapple flavoured with ginger and garlic, but I think it’s far more interesting with a few other contrasting flavours and textures. I try spring onions, peas and water chestnuts, but come back to the traditional onion and green pepper pairing favoured by So, with extra pineapple – because, let’s be honest, it’s delicious – plus a sprinkling of Steph and Chris’s mild red chilli for warmth and colour. Use whatever you like, but just make sure you cut it fairly small so it stir-fries evenly.200g pork loin or lean shoulder1 garlic clove, peeled and crushed1 tbsp light soy sauce1 tbsp rice wine or dry sherry½ tsp salt¼ tsp Chinese five-spice powder (optional)To cook1 onion1 green pepper1 mild red chilli1 egg60g cornflour, plus extra to coatVegetable oil, to fry100g pineapple chunksFor the sauce2 tbsp apricot jam – the lower in sugar, the better1 tbsp cranberry sauce, ditto1 good squeeze lemon or lime juice25-40g soft light brown sugar2.5 tbsp Chinese red vinegar (ideally), or rice vinegar1 tbsp light soy sauce1 tsp cornflourServe with egg fried rice and probably something fresh and greenCut the pork into strips about 1cm wide.

But having seen his players progress all the way from beating their fellow National League side Braintree Town in the fourth qualifying round back in October to beating Sheffield United in round three, Currie could still afford to smile at the final whistle after a spirited performance from his team that could easily have yielded another shock.“They’re disappointed but when we look at it in a few days they will realise what they have achieved,” said the former midfielder. “If we had got our goal at 2-0 it could have been a different story. But I’m immensely proud of how they performed.”After a brilliant free kick from Dan Sparkes had forced a replay in front of a record crowd at the Hive two weekends ago, Barnet were attempting to go further in this competition than they have ever been against a side who are more than 70 places above them in the league pyramid.In protest against Brentford’s decision to only allow 1,600 visiting supporters – 300 fewer than the maximum permitted – Kleanthous watched the game in the club bar nine miles away because he “didn’t feel comfortable sitting with the prawn sandwich brigade” when so many fans had missed out on such an important occasion.With swathes of red seats in the main stand remaining unoccupied as the match kicked off, it seemed a shame a compromise couldn’t have been reached by two sides who also share a nickname. Yet the group of supporters stationed behind Barnet’s goalkeeper, Mark Cousins, for the first half more than made up for it in terms of atmosphere.Even the opening goal after seven minutes from Sergi Canós didn’t seem to dampen their enthusiasm, with the Spaniard confidently tucking home Benrahma’s cutback following an innovative corner routine for his third goal in as many matches.Brentford have been revitalised in recent weeks under the head coach Thomas Franks, having not lost in 10 matches since mid-December – a run that has lifted them well away from the bottom three in the Championship. A talented side packed with players who are comfortable on the ball, they will move to a new 17,250-capacity stadium up the road at the end of next season and could be real contenders to reach the top flight for the first time since before the second world war if they continue their upward trajectory. The only issue for their chairman Matthew Benham will be retaining his best players, with Chris Mepham having become the latest to leave last month for Bournemouth.Neal Maupay – the former France Under-21 who ended up in west London after a spell at Saint-Etienne – could be the next to fly the nest, while Algeria international Benrahma, a fellow graduate from Nice’s academy, also looks good enough to play at a higher level.His pinpoint delivery from a free-kick allowed Julian Jeanvier to volley home the second and it suddenly felt a long way back for Currie’s team. But if Brentford thought their opponents would simply roll over in the second half, they were mistaken. Within two minutes of the restart, a near 22-man brawl ensued that threatened to spill into the stands after Barnet’s Medy Elito slid in recklessly on Canós before falling to the ground when his opponent squared up to him.Both escaped with bookings but the bad feeling lingered throughout the second half. Sparkes came off the bench to curl a free kick just over from almost the same position as his equaliser in the first match before Craig Robson’s header struck the woodwork from a free-kick.Another flowing move eventually saw Maupay score his 20th goal of the season to put the tie beyond Barnet before David Tutonda’s consolation ensured their supporters could make the short journey home with their heads held high. “It’s 30 years since we have been in a quarter-final so it would be nice to do that again,” said Franks. Playing like this, Brentford will be a match for anyone.Second-half goals from Nahki Wells and Matt Smith proved the difference as QPR made it through to the fifth round of the FA Cup for the first time in 22 years with a 2-0 win at the expense of Portsmouth at Loftus Road.In a quiet first period, Darnell Furlong’s header against the bar from Luke Freeman’s centre was the pick of the chances. Extra time looked a distinct possibility heading into the break, but Wells, QPR’s top-scorer, broke the deadlock with 20 minutes left, capitalising on chaos at a corner to bundle in from a yard out.The result was then made safe seven minutes later as the talismanic Freeman delivered a sumptuous free-kick which Smith powered home to set up a home tie against Watford on 15 February."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/80f7ebf84a6aba7a6d0f06eb321b3585653fd5e2/0_171_5310_3186/master/5310.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4c5c5e6d12b87e090bba35a34e245e88","title":"newport county middlesbrough fa cup fourth round replay match report","story":"When Robbie Willmott belly-flopped on to a mudbath of a pitch, the Newport County party was only just getting started. The League Two club’s romance with the FA Cup continued as they overcame Middlesbrough at a rain-soaked Rodney Parade to tee up a dream fifth-round date with Manchester City.But the goalkeeper, Joe Day, had other things on his mind at the final whistle. As Newport’s players basked in perhaps their finest hour, the club reaching the fifth round for the first time since 1948-49, Day sprinted down the tunnel in order to get to hospital, with his wife, Lizzie, having gone into labour with twins.As for Willmott, the winger has the kind of backstory that belongs to the Cup, given he was stacking shelves in Tesco two years ago, rejoining Newport to help retain their league status last year. It was the perfect Cup tie, one that had all the ingredients for an upset from the moment the rain started pouring down. Willmott’s thumping effort from 25 yards earned Newport – mid-table in the fourth tier – the lead before Padraig Amond doubled the advantage.Flynn said he gave the prospect of entertaining the Premier League champions little thought, citing the Bullseye gameshow and how his players could have ended up with a consolation prize akin to a rubber dinghy. But instead their reward after a deserved victory in which they outclassed a Championship side chasing promotion is a date with Pep Guardiola and co.The gulf between the teams is huge City’s most recent starting XI cost £470m, Newport’s a mere £50,000. Still, “Manchester City, we’re coming for you” was the chorus that reverberated around a rocking sold-out stadium at the final whistle.Whatever the result here, there was always going to be cause for celebration given that both Flynn and Tony Pulis are sons of Pillgwenlly, a district of the city on the other side of the river Usk. It was Matt Dolan, a former Middlesbrough trainee, who forced the replay 10 days earlier, meaning Pulis – who has managed in excess of 1,000 matches – faced Newport in the city where he grew up for the first time.Dolan again began on the bench against Boro, who made five changes from their league win at West Brom last weekend. The lashing rain made life interesting on a pitch that is also home to two rugby union sides, Newport RFC and the Gwent-Dragons, with this the 59th match to take place here this season.Newport were unfazed by the growing pool of surface water, making a barnstorming start, and Boro were, by contrast, stuck in the mud. The referee, Stuart Attwell, should have awarded the home side an early penalty too, but he waved away appeals when Adam Clayton handballed a cross into the box by Regan Poole.Somehow, though, Boro headed down the tunnel at the interval with the score goalless. Pulis introduced Rajiv van La Parra thereafter but before the winger even had time to get his bearings, Newport finally had the ball in the net.Willmott charged towards the opposition box from deep with Amond for company – though the winger did not need him. Willmott dropped his shoulder to buy himself another yard of space as Boro backed off, with his swerving shot eluding the 40-year-old Dimi Konstantopoulos, who could only get a weak right hand to it. Newport were deservedly in front, Boro in trouble – and still to register a shot on target – prompting Pulis to throw on Rudy Gestede and Ashley Fletcher.But as the rain continued to come down, things went from bad to worse for Boro when Newport doubled their lead after 67 minutes. The visitors were bamboozled by a training-ground corner routine, with Amond darting to the front post to bury Willmott’s inswinging ball. Boro’s players looked at one another for answers as Amond ran off, sparking delirium among the home fans."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bb42abd50dbfc0f72e24b4213cfa2b073e19ed81/0_149_4132_2480/master/4132.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b837de7e0ca44c8bf237cd35c435c970","title":"pep guardiola insists manchester city remain calm title run in football","story":"• Champions will return to top with win over Everton• City’s goal difference is five better than that of rivals LiverpoolPep Guardiola has urged Manchester City to score as many goals as possible in the knowledge that it could decide the title race.

I have made a decision,” Hazard told the French radio station RMC, although he did not elaborate.The interview was recorded two months ago as part of a documentary about his career, but it was only released this week and may colour the context of the guessing games that have continued to follow Hazard’s every move.Uncertainty over the 28-year-old Belgian’s plans has been an unwelcome undercurrent to Chelsea’s season. Hazard has publicly admitted being torn between staying at Stamford Bridge and the “dream” switch to Real, a club he referred to in October as “the best club in the world”. The manager, Maurizio Sarri, said in December that it was “time to decide” the issue but also accepts that his star player should leave if that is his wish. “If he wants to go, he has to go,” Sarri said last week.The situation is particularly pressing given Hazard’s contract expires in June 2020 and he is yet to entertain new terms.

However, he has said that all options are open in the cases of three – Alistair Tamlit, Mel Strickland and Edward Thacker – who were previously convicted for taking part in an action at Heathrow airport in 2016.Most of those due to be flown on the Stansted flight have since been removed from the country, however 11 remain, with two granted leave to remain and one a resident’s card. Eight have ongoing cases with the Home Office, according to End Deportations, the activist group to which the Stansted 15 belong.A spokesman for End Deportations said: “Whatever the sentences handed down by Judge Christopher Morgan, the terror convictions have profound implications for the lives of the Stansted 15, severely restricting their ability to work, travel and take part in everyday life.“The convictions themselves are the first use of controversial terror legislation passed in the aftermath of the Lockerbie bombing against peaceful protesters and, whatever happens with the sentencing, they have profound implications for the right to peaceful protest in the UK, and for democracy.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4a4104bb854e1c5d1ec958d45ccf5af46e52338f/200_402_5560_3336/master/5560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=39df3684f5ff30d19d91efdd6dd8fab1","title":"ebola drc democratic republic of the congo","story":"More than 750 people have died of Ebola in recent months in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, with efforts to contain the outbreak hampered by conflict – and fear of treatment centresPhotographs by Kate HoltMedair"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/27a288dfe6ce1ac3a797f6f1944db6c222199eda/0_365_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bf65eb8ac00fde1a6ef68e56290a0cd7","title":"football fans health benefits fitness scheme eurofit men","story":"Study found that men’s loyalty to their team encouraged them to attend classes at stadiumsMen who love their football club enough to attend lifestyle advice sessions at its stadium lost weight, ate more healthily and reduced their risk of dying, according to a study.Fans of teams including Arsenal, Everton and Manchester City enjoyed a significant boost to their health after 12 90-minute classes at their grounds.The study looked at 1,113 men aged between 30 and 65 who follow 15 clubs in England, Portugal, the Netherlands and Norway. Participants saw “significant improvements in diet, weight, wellbeing, self-esteem, vitality and biomarkers of cardiometabolic health”, the authors found.Men attended the sessions as part of the EU-funded EuroFIT programme, which aims to use football’s strong appeal to persuade men to overhaul their lifestyles. It uses the lustre of their club and the venue where they usually go as a fan to cheer them on to encourage participation.Fans of Newcastle United and Stoke City were also involved in the scheme, which is being extended to more European countries.In a paper in the journal PLOS Medicine, the study’s authors say their findings confirm that “engaging men in physical activity through programmes that work with existing constructs of masculinity is a promising route for promoting men’s health”.They found that participants in the randomised control trial began walking an average of 678 steps a day more than those who were waiting to join the programme as a result of coming to the sessions, which they termed a “substantial” increase. Doctors generally recommend at least 10,000 steps a day to promote good health.Participants’ activity levels were monitored by a device called a SitFIT which they carried in their pocket. In addition, a game-based app called MatchFIT encouraged them to meet and undertake activities together in between the sessions, which were delivered by football coaches.The scheme is designed to help men reduce their risk of developing type 2 diabetes or having a heart attack or stroke, rather than treating an existing condition.Sally Wyke, the programme’s principal investigator, who is a professor of health and wellbeing at the University of Glasgow, said: “Gender-sensitised lifestyle programmes delivered in professional football clubs show great promise in Europe and could play an important health role in engaging under-served men.”When attendees were monitored a year after they had finished the scheme, efforts to overhaul the men’s diets had worked. Participants continued to eat more fruit and vegetables and less fat and sugar.However, other benefits of the scheme were less enduring. The participants were no longer any more active than men who had not yet been on the programme. They also said they had not experienced any increase in their quality of life."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/012c0f604a9b73c7eb06d18ed1f74f2f3527b604/0_3368_3840_2304/master/3840.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a5c3d5761975cdaf8d7f36de6542b5ea","title":"pope francis offered 1m charity donation to go vegan for lent","story":"Campaign targets pope because of his environmental leadership and influence over 1.2bn CatholicsEnvironmental campaigners have issued a challenge to Pope Francis: go vegan for Lent and receive $1m for the charity of his choice.The purpose of the Million Dollar Vegan campaign, led by 12-year-old Genesis Butler, is to encourage people to eat less meat and dairy in order to fight climate change. Global warming cannot be beaten without huge cuts in meat eating in rich nations, research shows, while reducing consumption of animal products also tackles pollution and the destruction of forests and wildlife.Butler, from Long Beach, California, has been vegan since the age of six and has staged many protests against animal cruelty. She said there were many reasons for eating a plant-based diet.“There is an animal side, a health side and an environmental side,” she told the . “If I tell people about the damage that the animal agriculture industry is doing to the planet, then some of them want to go vegan. I also tell them about health and how when you go vegan it can help prevent cancer, heart, disease and diabetes, or how animals have to die or suffer.”The campaign is backed by celebrities including Paul McCartney, the actor Mena Suvari, the musician Moby and naturalist and TV presenter Chris Packham. Young environmental protesters are becoming increasingly high profile, with Greta Thunberg’s school strikes for climate inspiring tens of thousands of other students to follow suit.In her message to Pope Francis, Butler says: “In your encyclical letter, Laudato si’, you stated that every effort to protect and improve our world will involve changes in lifestyle, production, and consumption. I agree with all my heart and seek your support in tackling one of the largest underlying causes of the problems we face: animal agriculture.”Matthew Glover, CEO of Million Dollar Vegan and who co-founded the Veganuary campaign, said the Pope had been selected for his environmental leadership and influence, particularly in South America, where great forests continue to be cut down.“We are launching this deliberately bold, audacious campaign to jolt our world leaders from their complacency,” Glover said. “We are thankful that Pope Francis has spoken out and that is why we are humbly asking him to try vegan for Lent, and set an example of how each of us can align our principles of caring and compassion with our actions.”The $1m has been donated by the Blue Horizon International Foundation, the charitable arm of the Blue Horizon Corporation, which invests in companies producing plant-based foods and aims to “accelerate the removal of animals from the global food chain”.Lent is a period of about 40 days that ends just before Easter and during which many Christians practise abstinence of some kind. It reflects the Bible story of the 40 days Jesus spent fasting in the desert and in 2019 runs from 6 March to 18 April. The Vatican had not responded to a request for comment at the time of publication.Daniel Hale, at the Catholic aid agency Cafod, said: “Pope Francis has been the standout world leader on climate change this decade. Like all Christians, the Holy Father will make his own choices about how to give, act and pray this Lent.“It’s a period of reflection for all Catholics and a chance for us to respond to the Pope’s call for us to live a simpler and more sustainable lifestyle in various ways,” he said. “For some, that will mean cutting down on meat, while others are switching to renewable energy or campaigning for action to reduce emissions.”Butler’s activism began early. “When I was about to turn four I asked my mom about where we got our chicken nuggets from, because I would always eat them,” she said. “I was devastated. I told her that I never wanted to eat meat again.

That’s what I’m assuming, but I haven’t fixed a date,” the broadcaster told the Daily Mail. He said he had previously believed he would carry on doing the job “either until they threw me out or had enough of me, or that I’d got bored of it or stopped enjoying it, but none of those things have happened.”He added: “I still enjoy it enormously. I know that sounds ridiculous. There are mornings in mid-February when you don’t want to get up at half past three. But, equally, there are other things I want to do with my life, and one has to make the decision sooner or later.”The presenter’s supposedly imminent retirement has been the subject of media speculation for more than a decade. Much of this has been stoked by Humphrys himself, who would give interviews predicting his own departure before going on to sign a contract extension.This time it appears he really is on the way to the exit, with the Today programme editor, Sarah Sands, saying: “Enjoy John’s lap of honour this year. Totally uninterested in his own publicity. A king of broadcasting.”If the 75-year-old does depart after almost a third a of century with the same programme then it would end a high-profile and often controversial stint on the airwaves, during which he shaped the reporting of British politics. His aggressive interview style on the programme won both fans and detractors, with his political stance coming under particular scrutiny following the Brexit referendum.Humphrys, who as a young journalist reported on the 1966 Aberfan mining disaster, later joined the BBC where he worked as a foreign correspondent before becoming lead presenter on the Nine O’Clock News. He then transferred to the Today programme in 1987, where he has covered the administrations of six different prime ministers for the Radio 4 show.In recent years, he has been writing a book on his times with the programme entitled The Today Files, and could find it hard to promote the inside story of the programme while still appearing on the airwaves.Last year, he was at the centre of an equal pay row after a recording leaked of him making off-air comments about the BBC’s gender pay gap, following the resignation of the BBC China editor, Carrie Gracie, in protest at inequality at the corporation.BBC pay disclosure figures revealed that in 2017 Humphrys received between £600,000 and £649,999 from the corporation for his work on the Today programme and presenting the quiz show Mastermind. Following an outcry he agreed to take a substantial pay cut, with his combined salary set to fall below £300,000 by next year.The pay disclosure caused ructions within the Today presenters, with Humphrys’ longtime colleague Sarah Montague leaving the programme after discovering she was paid substantially less than her on-air colleagues.Humphrys’ departure would open up a presenting slot on the programme alongside fellow hosts Nick Robinson, Mishal Husain, Martha Kearney, and Justin Webb. The appointment could be one of the first decisions for the new Radio 4 controller.Sands has previously described Humphrys as a “listeners’ champion”, and said “he will know when it feels right” to leave.“He’s extremely curious, he’s extremely engaged, fantastically interested in new subjects and new people and real people. The overall purpose in him is pursuit of truth,” she said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f6f84e733526d67ba0ae91daa75d92f76e25032c/0_153_4060_2436/master/4060.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a383a839d61adf38b632ac036a5c4c50","title":"is climate change way worse than we realise today in focus podcast","story":"David Wallace-Wells, the author of new book The Uninhabitable Earth, depicts a world ravaged by climate chaos.

Donald Tusk. Both Tusk and Juncker have been adamant that the withdrawal agreement will not be reopened.Number 10 sources suggested they did not expect a warm reception, but that it would signal the start of a new diplomatic process, involving proposals on the backstop worked on by MPs and ministers.Earlier on Tuesday, May told her cabinet she would not countenance any delay to the UK’s exit on 29 March, a message to ministers such as Jeremy Hunt and Sajid Javid who have suggested at least some delay might now be inevitable. Ministers who are more pessimistic about the prospects of the UK leaving on time with a deal held their tongues in the meeting after May’s warning.“She was pretty clear she had no time for anyone calling for it to be extended,” one cabinet source said.However, senior government sources increasingly believe the impasse may not be resolved until March, given no full EU council summit is due until late that month. That may ultimately become an excuse, some believe, for the prime minister to delay the UK’s exit in order to finalise any compromise.In cabinet, ministers including Amber Rudd and Michael Gove are understood to have underlined how they did not believe the UK public had fully comprehended the severe damage no deal would do.May did not set out explicitly to her cabinet the changes she would seek when she meets EU leaders.However, speaking in Belfast, May said she knew there were anxieties in Northern Ireland about replacing the backstop arrangement and said there would always be an insurance option to prevent a hard border contained within the withdrawal agreement.“I’m not proposing to persuade people to accept a deal that does not contain that insurance policy for the future,” she said.“There is no suggestion that we are not going to ensure that in the future there is provision for this – it has been called an insurance policy, the backstop – that ensures that if the future relationship is not in place by the end of the implementation period, there will be arrangements in place to ensure that we deliver no hard border.”Earlier in her speech, May also sounded a note of caution about the alternative arrangements that some MPs have been working on to replace the backstop. She said a seamless border was “the cornerstone around which the community in Northern Ireland has come together to deliver peace and prosperity”.“I will not do anything to put that at risk,” she said. “So while I have said that technology could play a part, and that we will look at alternative arrangements, these must be ones that can be made to work for the particular circumstances of Northern Ireland.”Tory MPs from a number of different Brexit factions are working on a proposal for alternative technological arrangements to the backstop, known as the Malthouse compromise after the housing minister, Kit Malthouse, who brought the groups together.Members of the European Research Group, which is made up of Eurosceptic Tory backbenchers, agreed to back a compromise amendment last week on changes to the backstop after assurances from May that it would mean reopening the withdrawal agreement.Downing Street would not say if work by the Brexit secretary Steve Barclay, who is working with Conservative backbenchers on the Malthouse compromise, would conclude by the end of Wednesday.The attorney general, Geoffrey Cox, is also drawing up a proposal on legally binding limits to the backstop.At her speech in Belfast, May said she would never allow a hard border to be erected on the island of Ireland.“Northern Ireland does not have to rely on the Irish government or the European Union to prevent a return to borders of the past,” she said at a speech in Belfast. “The UK government will not let that happen. I will not let that happen.”May said she understood that the “prospect of changing the backstop and reopening the withdrawal agreement creates real anxiety” in Northern Ireland but it was necessary to get the deal through the Commons.The audience of Northern Ireland business owners and executives gave lukewarm applause to her speech. Several said they were frustrated that her plan to avoid a hard border and disruption to trade remained unclear.Aodhán Connolly, director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium, said he hoped a meeting with May after her speech would clarify how she intended to reconcile promises on the backstop with avoiding a hard border.“You’re talking about the disintegration of the supply chain. Northern Ireland is in the eye of the storm,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/efa4ac3943ec0d6ebb1714f6486608c35012552c/624_63_2655_1593/master/2655.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=da9069481f7ea854a5946bee9b229811","title":"chris grayling not welcome in calais says ports chairman","story":"Jean-Marc Puissesseau reportedly accuses transport secretary of disrespectThe transport secretary, Chris Grayling, is no longer welcome in Calais, according to the port’s chairman, who has been angered by British plans to ert some sea traffic in the event of a no-deal Brexit.Jean-Marc Puissesseau reportedly accused the UK cabinet minister of behaving in a “completely disrespectful” manner on Tuesday.“It is not fair at all, it is completely disrespectful. I don’t want to see him again,” Puissesseau told the Daily .The UK government has awarded contracts to three firms as it seeks to bypass congestion it predicts will mount up in Calais as a result of extra customs checks, which ministers believe will need to be carried out following a no-deal Brexit.Without contingency plans, the government fears deliveries of food and medicine could be delayed.Puissesseau has previously insisted no such disruption is likely because Calais has been planning for a no-deal Brexit for a year. In January, he told the BBC: “It’s wrong, it’s not true that there will not be more delay … The only thing we will be asking of the driver is that they have their customs declarations, but we will not stop and ask more than we are doing today.”And, speaking to the  on Tuesday, he added: “We didn’t ask for Brexit, but we have spent the money for traffic to flow regularly.”Puissesseau has not been the only one to express displeasure at the UK government’s plans. Jacques Gounon, the chief executive of Eurotunnel’s parent company, has said the awarding of the ferry operator contracts was “distortionary and anti-competitive” and would be a “unilateral breach not only of the concession agreement with Eurotunnel, but more widely of existing competition and state aid law”.It has been reported that the government plans to pay a law firm £800,000 for advice in anticipation of a legal action brought by the company.Reacting to Puissesseau’s comments on Tuesday, the Labour MP and supporter of the pro-EU Best for Britain campaign, Virendra Sharma, said: “Surely this is peak Chris Grayling, only this time he’s gone international. All he needs to do now is release a statement blaming everyone else and his predictable path of chaos will be complete.”A Department for Transport spokesman said: “While the transport secretary strongly supports work across government with the EU to ensure a deal is reached, he will also continue to lead the DfT to ensure all contingencies are prepared for concerning Brexit.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/683b7869efba34d04aef91ee29206764542adc0e/0_388_4134_2480/master/4134.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bcad02b45a94fac5ff2018b87b9cd32b","title":"uk can avoid no deal brexit recession says economic forecaster","story":"Blow to economy could be softened with planning from government and EU, claims the NIESRBritain could avoid slumping into a recession in the aftermath of a no-deal Brexit, according to one of Britain’s leading economics forecasters.The National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR) said the blow to the economy from a disorderly departure from the EU could be softened by contingency plans being put in place by the government and by Brussels. Ministers could also reduce the impact with tax cuts and additional public spending, further limiting the damage.Britain’s oldest independent economics research institute – in forecasts likely to embolden Brexit supporters urging Theresa May to pursue a “managed no-deal” – said that economic growth would come close to zero in the first two years after a no-deal Brexit. However, it would avoid the recession that has been forecast by some experts.Although warning that every Brexit outcome would still be worse for the UK economy than remaining in the EU, it said there was sufficient headroom for the government to stabilise the economy in the short term.“Were the UK to exit the EU without a deal in March, we would expect a sharper slowdown in economic activity than in the central case,” NIESR said in a report published on Wednesday, adding: “How much the economy responds would depend on the extent to which policy steps in and eases the transition.”The report comes after the Bank of England warned that Britain could plunge straight into a recession worse than the one that immediately followed the financial crisis 10 years ago, a scenario which has been used by the prime minister as a warning to MPs to vote for her EU withdrawal agreement to avoid inflicting significant damage on the economy.While some measures have been proposed by both Britain and the EU to offset the impact of a no-deal scenario, many analysts warn that time is running out and that they may not be agreed upon in time.However, offering a possible route-map for a no-deal scenario, the NIESR analysis said that additional support could be put in place by ministers and the Bank of England to curb the short-term impact to the economy.Such interventions would, however, come with a cost. The NIESR report said unfurling such a package could add as much as £60bn to government borrowing by 2023-24. It also warned that inflation could accelerate, eroding real wages and acting as a brake on the economy in future.Amit Kara, head of UK macroeconomics at NIESR, said: “All this is not to say there will not be long-term economic costs. Those costs remain intact. These are just mitigating measures.“Whilst it does make headlines or sensational news to suggest the economy will go into recession or not, I don’t think economists have the tools to be that precise. The big picture is I think there really will be a material slowdown,” he added."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a69194dd7d10e86f0a1c2d48f365efef63c61a5a/299_604_3845_2308/master/3845.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3a02b3473bc0c33bff7f03d5c04775da","title":"judges reject bias claim jewish housing association agudas israel","story":"Agudas Israel within its rights because Orthodox Jews have different needs, court rulesA row about allocation of scarce housing could be heading for the court of appeal after judges rejected a claim that a housing association broke equality laws with its policy of providing homes only to Orthodox Jews.The Agudas Israel Housing Association, in Stamford Hill, east London, was accused by lawyers acting for a single mother of four of allowing Orthodox Jewish families to “jump the queue”.The woman, who is not being named and is not Jewish, had seen a property listed on Hackney council’s housing system which stated: “Consideration only to the Orthodox Jewish community.”The woman was near the top of the council’s housing priority system and had been living with her children, two of whom are autistic, in temporary accommodation for 16 months, because their previous home was ruled unsafe.Her solicitor, Rebekah Carrier, had claimed that the housing association’s policy “smacked of ‘no blacks, no dogs, no Irish’,” a reference to signs pinned up by some landlords decades ago.“It was quite shocking to see it being offered not on the basis of need but on the basis of religion,” Carrier said. Hackney has a social housing waiting list of around 13,000 households.But the mother’s application for judicial review of the policy was dismissed in the high court, which ruled that the charity is within its rights to take positive action in favour of Orthodox Jews because they have different needs – in terms of following a way of life that requires them to live close by each other – and are themselves disadvantaged, in terms of suffering antisemitism generally and in the housing market, and in terms of overcrowding rates in Stamford Hill, which are more than double the rest of the borough.Lord Justice Lindblom and Sir Kenneth Parker ruled in favour of the charity and cited exemptions to the 2010 Equalities Act, which prevents discrimination based on religion or race, for charities in cases where discrimination allows an organisation to prevent or compensate for a disadvantage linked to a protected characteristic such as religion, but not colour.Applicants for one of the Orthodox Jewish charity’s 90 homes have to say whether they are strictly orthodox, in terms of observing the sabbath and strict dietary laws, as well as stating under the “ethnic origin” heading whether they are Ashkenazi or Sephardi. The waiting list for the homes includes more than 1,000 Orthodox families, and when it made new homes available last February up to 369 households bid for each property.The judges said the housing association was enabling Orthodox Jews to avoid disadvantage and meet their needs, including solving overcrowding which is a major problem in the area, which is Europe’s largest Haredi community. Haredi Jews tend to have more children than the average.They quoted Rabbi Abraham Pinter, a leading figure in Stamford Hill, who told the court: “Being part of a community, both physically and spiritually, is a prerequisite of fulfilling the life of an Orthodox Jew.” They also cited antisemitic threats and violence, quoting one tenant describing their terror when “one night two men came to our door and threw stones at our front door and windows”.Elliot Lister, solicitor for the housing association, said: “The court has endorsed the critical work of a charity established to fight antisemitism and discrimination in the face of allegation that it itself discriminates. The Jewish community, and even more so the obviously Orthodox Jewish community, faces an ongoing battle against antisemitism, recognised by their Lordships as widespread and increasing and overt.”Ita Cymerman-Symons, chief executive of the housing association, said: “I firmly believe that our work contributes to alleviating in our small way a national housing crisis, freeing up other social housing for others. We do not take properties from others, but we lessen the queue for other properties.”Carrier said: “My clients are disappointed in the judgment and it is our intention to appeal to the court of appeal. “Hackney has a housing allocation scheme that is designed to give the scarce resources of Stamford Hill to those in the greatest need. Orthodox Jews will be among them. But if somebody else, like my client who is struggling with disabled children and living where they are not safe, then they shouldn’t be queue-jumped on the basis of the religion. This isn’t about antisemitism. This is about a fair system for allocating housing. There are lots of BME and faith-based housing associations and they do not apply this strict criteria.”She said the judgment, if it stands, would have wider implications for the provision of services by charities in other sectors as well.Christopher Baker and Rea Murray, who appeared as counsel for the charity, said: “It will have particular significance for many organisations looking to undertake forms of positive action, and for charities seeking to restrict the benefits they provide, in favour of only certain limited descriptions of people with protected characteristics.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6cab9cff4ee7b7b4400779a5d44c24142bc1b23e/0_88_1931_1159/master/1931.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ac5bbfa4ce9ddc7fef96c6fe1f87dfa2","title":"teaching units for deaf children keep closing report finds","story":"Number of specialist teachers also falls, as pupils’ exam results sufferTen dedicated teaching units for deaf children in schools are being closed every year, according to a new report.The National Deaf Children’s Society said that deaf pupils who lose their unit or specialist teacher miss out on crucial one-to-one support at school, while teachers and teaching assistants were left without advice and training on teaching deaf children.They argued that specialist units gave deaf pupils the opportunity to be educated alongside pupils who could hear, while also providing them with a peer group of deaf friends.The charity warned that the cuts could lead deaf pupils to fall even further behind at school and reduce parental choice as to how their children were educated.They raised concerns that, in many areas, schools and local authorities were failing to inform parents of the existence of specialist units, which then allowed them to close them due to low pupil numbers.Susan Daniels, chief executive of the National Deaf Children’s Society, said the figures showed the pressures on the education of deaf children. “Their support is being reduced, their specialist teachers are being cut and, unsurprisingly, their grades at school have started to get worse,” she said.“This government has reformed special needs education and promised greater choice for parents and a world-class education for every child, yet deaf children are still falling a grade behind at GCSE.“There are many simple, cost-effective solutions available that would have an incredible impact on deaf children’s lives.

And listings for Six Nations games raise fresh doubts about whether the company is abiding by its terms.The trader with the highest combined ticket worth was listed as Enda Stanley who had 173 tickets for sale with a total asking price of £79,719 (including booking fees and delivery).While the CMA’s court order calls for traders’ full contact information to be advertised, entries for Stanley’s tickets simply listed his details as “Dublin”.The highest number of tickets for sale by an inidual trader was under the name of an Eileen Green, who listed 290 tickets with a combined price of £64,704.Another prolific seller, a company called Tick Tock Ltd that listed its address as Panama City, had 100 tickets the combined cost of which stood at £45,981. Another trader, Candy \u0026amp Co, gave a postbox address in Texas, while a fifth, Tyne and Wear Ltd, is based in Newcastle.The most expensive tickets, for sale by a trader listed as “harry tout” carried a total cost of £4,772 for two seats in the fourth row with a view of the tryline for the sold-out match between Scotland and Ireland at Murrayfield on 9 February.The tickets were marked as “Resale not allowed”.Despite the CMA’s court order, which demands that traders give their genuine contact details, the address for “harry tout” was given as the Scottish newspaper the Daily Record, which has campaigned virulently against ticket touting. The Daily Record said it had no involvement with the listing.None of the traders could be reached for comment.A spokesman for the Rugby Football Union said the use of secondary market websites to resell tickets is prohibited by the RFU’s ticket terms and conditions and that ticket holders known to have breached the terms and conditions would be refused entry.“Where tickets are resold on secondary market websites – especially at inflated prices – it is not just the genuine fans, but the wider game, whom suffer.”The Irish Rugby Football Union urged fans not to buy resold tickets, which they said might be cancelled. The Welsh Rugby Union also warned fans against buying from ticket resale companies, warning that buyers risked ejection from the ground.This stance does not appear to dissuade traders. Touts have 194 tickets for sale for Scotland vIreland alone with a combined ticket price of £57,758 which, if sold, will prove the most lucrative game of the tournament for traders.Traders are selling 223 tickets for sale for the Scotland v Wales match on 9 March with a combined value of £49,318.When contacted, Viagogo said it was “perfectly legal” to resell tickets and that any bought through its website were valid and should not result in fans being turned away.A spokesperson said: “Event organisers sometimes make claims that they will deny entry to people who have purchased resold tickets. These types of entry restrictions are highly unfair and in our view, unenforceable and illegal.“Therefore, as with all tickets on our platform, Viagogo customers should feel confident that they will gain entry to the event, and that is why we back every ticket with the Viagogo guarantee.”Under the terms of the CMA’s court order secured against the company, Viagogo has been obliged to publish not just names of touts but also more detailed information about what consumers are buying, such as seat number at the venue.But the  found dozens of cases that did not display the seat number.Tom Watson, the shadow secretary for digital, culture, media and sport and deputy Labour leader, said it was “disgraceful to see that ticket touts on Viagogo are still ripping off rugby fans”.“Viagogo has been told time and again that it needs to clean up its act. They are flagrantly disobeying the law and even ignoring a court order. It’s unacceptable that consumers may not be able to see basic details about their tickets, like the seller’s name and the seat number. Secondary ticketing platforms have been taking advantage of loyal fans for far too long.

Our writer pops byOn Oslo’s Victoria Terrasse there’s a white door marked 108. Behind it was once an office in the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, but before that, late in the 19th century, these rooms were occupied by a figure who has done more for Norway’s reputation abroad than all of its foreign ministers put together.This was the apartment of Henrik Ibsen, generally regarded as the second-greatest playwright ever, and the second most-performed dramatist in the world. In both these criteria he is bested only by Shakespeare.Ibsen’s living quarters have now become a significant venue in his thriving theatrical afterlife. For a week in January, two of Norway’s leading classical actors – Kåre Conradi and Pia Tjelta – were rehearsing here with a cast of Norwegian and UK-based actors for a bilingual production of Ibsen’s 1888 play The Lady from the Sea, which premieres this week in London.This cross-country staging is produced by the Norwegian Ibsen Company, founded by Conradi. The actor got government permission to rehearse The Lady from the Sea in the dramatist’s old flat, and hopes in the future to stage productions in its rooms, and a courtyard below. The company also hopes to tour Ibsen around the world, much like the Royal Shakespeare Company, with this London run a declaration of intent.“Ibsen is Norwegian by birth but in spirit international,” says Conradi, showing me around the rooms. What was once the Ibsens’ kitchen is now a government broom cupboard.The dramatist lived above Victoria Terrasse from 1891-95, a period that represents much of his creative life in Norway. Ibsen had left his homeland in 1864, disgusted by its politics and cultural conservatism. He exiled himself for 27 years to Italy and Germany, during which his dim view of Norwegian taste seemed to be confirmed when Ghosts, which dared to use inherited venereal disease as a metaphor for the damage families inflict, was rubbished on publication. His plays appeared in book form first and were not performed in Oslo until years later.“When he finally came home, it was to this flat,” says Conradi. His reception from Norwegians, he adds, was “so ecstatic that he wrote a poem that includes the line, ‘Perhaps I should have come sooner.’”In Oslo, Conradi has the level of fame and admiration Ralph Fiennes might have in Britain. Conradi also gets stopped and selfied by tourists, since he starred in the Netflix Viking drama Norsemen, and played Jens Smit, a Dutch PR visionary, in W1A.At the the read-through in Ibsen’s old living rooms, Conradi, Tjelta and another Norwegian actor, Øystein Røger, sit alongside four British performers. The Norwegian director, Marit Moum Aune, has boldly cast young performers with minimal stage experience.Molly Windsor won a Bafta for Three Girls, about the Rotherham grooming scandal Edward Ashley is soon to appear with Timothée Chalamet in The King and Marina Bye has featured in movies including Breathe. Even the most theatre-experienced, Adrian Rawlins, has recently spent most of his time on screen, including playing Harry Potter’s father, James.The Lady from the Sea dramatises the marriage between Dr Wangel, a widowed GP, and Ellida, reluctant stepmother to Hilde and Bolette, daughters from his first marriage. In this production the Wangels – played by Rawlins, Windsor and Bye – are expats from England, drawn to the north-west coast of Norway by the doctor’s relationship with Ellida, the part taken by Tjelta.Ashley plays Lyngstrand, a local artist. Conradi is Arnholm, Bolette’s former tutor, who visits the troubled family, with Røger as the Stranger, a sailor and fugitive from justice, who may have been Ellida’s lover. The play is about the carnage caused by partings. Ellida is haunted by a lost child, a lost lover and her stepdaughters’ lost mother, and is forced to decide between two versions of her life.In this dual-language production, the Wangels mainly speak English to each other, while Ellida talks Norwegian to Arnholm. In London, the Norwegian will be subtitled on the rear wall. For realism, the anglophone members of the Wangel family have to be able to speak the native language to locals, and to Ellida. Because the Stranger appears only late in the play, Røger has been using rehearsal breaks to tutor the visitors.“They record me, and then go away to practise,” he says. “I show them how you form your mouth to get the Norwegian sounds, which are different.” The letter O, which has four differently accented versions in Norwegian, is generally longer and rounder than the English equivalent.In return, because the Stranger is said have spent a lot of time sailing transatlantic routes, Bye, who has an American mother, has been teaching Røger US vowels. Rawlins and Tjelta have also worked on the way in which bilingual partners switch languages. “Mixed-nationality couples,” says Tjelta, “will change in the middle of a sentence, or suddenly use single words from the other language.”One of the Oslo rehearsal days ends early, so that the cast and production team can take a late-afternoon ferry around four nearby islands. This is not recreation but research: true to its title, the work had a water birth.Michael Meyer, the influential English translator and biographer, explains in a preface to his version of The Lady from the Sea that when living in Italy Ibsen used to complain that the Mediterranean was not a “real sea”, pining for Norwegian harbours, lakes and fjords. In 1885, two decades into his exile, he came home for a brief holiday, seeking the sort of Norwegian water he remembered from a childhood in seaside Skien.The writer travelled to Molde, a town on Norway’s north-west coast (whose football club has just lent its manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjær, to Manchester United). Ibsen reportedly spent much of his time in Molde staring lovingly at fjords and out at the crashing Atlantic waves. Locals told him stories of a woman persuaded by a charismatic sailor to leave her husband, and of a husband, presumed drowned, who returned years later to find his wife remarried. From those anecdotes – and the surroundings – the playwright seems to have begun to conceive a drama about people confined and defined by the sea.Two years later, during another seaside break in the Danish resort of Sæby, on the Jutland coast, the 59-year-old Ibsen developed one of the crushes on much younger women that marked his later years. He formed an intense friendship with Engelke Wulff, a 19-year-old, whose dreams of escaping the small town for large achievements elsewhere seem clearly to have helped him develop Hilde and Bolette Wangel, the yearning teenage sisters in The Lady from the Sea.Another source was Agnete og Havmanden, an 18th-century Danish folk-ballad about a wife who is seduced by a merman, with whom she has a sub-aquatic family, and forced to choose between her wet and dry lives.I had hoped that one of the Norwegian members of the company might sing me Agnete’s song on the ferry, but none knew it. As we stand on the deck to watch the spectacular russet sunset, mummifying my face with a scarf to protect against the freezing sea fret, I remember that Tennessee Williams, whose plays were set in the American south, once told a London cast that his work made sense only if the cast and audience understood the effect on the characters of the searing daily heat. When an English actress asked Williams why the women were so “languid”, he explained that, in that climate, it could sometimes be a struggle to breathe or move.Contrastingly, it struck me on the ferry deck that the plays of Ibsen are clarified by an understanding of how dark and cold it is in Norway most of the time, and especially in the north of the country, where The Lady from the Sea takes place.Gesturing at the Oslo dusk, Røger tells me: “If we were in the north now, this is as light as it would ever get during the day. You can see a little light from the sun but you can’t see the sun.”Back on land, we walk through Oslo, past the National Theatre. Above its door are carved in stone the names of the first three dramatists staged there during the gala opening week in 1899: Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson, Ludvig Holberg and Ibsen. Although they were seen at the time as a theatrical holy trinity, two of them are rarely performed in Norway now, while the play that represented Ibsen at the premiere – An Enemy of the People – seems, in its depiction of an expert clashing with populist opinion, to become ever more politically topical. And revived in this London production 130 years after its opening night in Denmark, The Lady from the Sea still feels timely in its presentation of women’s choices.“Someone once asked me, ‘So you’re an Ibsen expert?’” says Aune, who has directed most of the major plays, and is about to revive her ballet of Ibsen’s Hedda Gabler in Oslo. “And I said, ‘No, I’m Ibsen-experienced.’ I don’t think you can ever become an expert on him. There’s so much to find.”• The Lady from the Sea is at Print Room at the Coronet, London, 8 February–9 March."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aafc93df6d2e11a87e09d1debeebb3b0eb5e49da/201_135_1599_959/master/1599.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eae352cfdc7616184eddb69c7647be68","title":"the castle inn west lulworth cove dorset hotel review pub grub","story":"This traditional inn close to Lulworth Cove has played the renovation game, adding 12 boutique-hotel bedrooms and high-end pub grubA couple walk into a bar … and ask for a room. We wonder if the joke is on us when we arrive at the Castle Inn in West Lulworth because the door marked “hotel entrance” is locked. So we trundle our bags into the pub, which is heaving with happy customers on a Saturday afternoon. Eventually, we manage to tell the barmaid we’re here to check in and are steered away towards a tiny reception desk.Not the slick welcome of a smart hotel, then, but the Castle Inn – once a free house known for muddy dogs and real cider – is now steering a tricky course between country pub and boutique hotel.“Pub \u0026amp rooms” is the modest declaration on the outside wall, and it is hard to imagine a more inviting pub. A long, low thatched building, more than 400 years old but freshly whitewashed, with woodwork in duck-egg blue, it sits plum in the middle of the village, at the foot of historic Bindon Hill. Generations of farmers, fishermen and smugglers have sunk flagons of cider here over the centuries but customers these days are mainly day trippers going to Lulworth Cove, half a mile away.It is this market that Bristol-based Butcombe Brewery had in mind when it took over. A refurb finished last year included smartening up the 12 bedrooms and, to some local dismay, knocking together the ground floor’s dark bars and snugs to make a continuous bar-dining area with plenty of nooks and alcoves.We have no complaints: returning near dark after a walk round the cove, we settle with drinks and nibbles in one of two alcoves that are so snug you have to lift a hinged flap on the table to slot yourself in. I have a view through an arch to the main bar area, all handsome golden retrievers and moppets rosy-cheeked after a run on the beach. The ceilings are as low as ever, and Mind Your Head signs abound.Upstairs, things are more boutique hotel, with rooms named after local beauty spots. Ours is decorated in grey and dark greeny-blue with lots of reclaimed wood – design feature du jour – on walls and in the sleek, compact bathroom. (Can there be enough old floorboards in the country to satisfy interior designers. Are they secretly distressing new planks to meet demand?)We like the big bed, cute two-seater sofa in the bay and fresh milk in a fridge up the corridor. Some features seem to be whimsy for its own sake, though – the desk lamp is a grey ceramic puppy – and the metal cog light fittings are a bit industrial chic for this country setting.At dinner, it’s back to pub mode. Drinkers stand chatting by the bar, people are playing cards, and there’s no table service. You order drinks and food at a busy counter, collecting cutlery and napkins as you go. The old pub was known for welcoming man’s best friend and that hasn’t changed (six bedrooms are dog-friendly). I’m quite happy when a neighbouring table’s black retriever settles at my feet, though some might prefer a canine-free dining experience.The grub is high-end pubby: burgers, fish and chips, steak and “flatbread” pizzas. Starters of ham hock terrine studded with peas (£8) and potted chalk stream trout (£7.50) are imaginatively garnished with pickled bits and bobs, and husband’s main of Brixham Bay mussels with coconut milk (£12) is fresh and tasty. But a portion of sticky toffee pudding (£6) is served too tepid to melt the scoop of ice-cream on top.There’s plenty of heat upstairs, though! The inn’s thatched roof sits like a luxuriant monobrow over the first floor windows and we come to understand the advantages of this quaint feature. Central heating plus that thick hat of straw make the room so toasty we have to open windows to the January night.At breakfast there’s a return to trendy hotel territory. As well as the full English, there are two fishy and three veggie choices. I eschew the millennials’ favourite of avocado toast and go for excellent black bean hash with peppers, onions, spinach and poached eggs. An establishment with a split personality, then: chic rooms and on-trend breakfast but the offhand (though friendly) service of a busy pub.However, it’s a good-humoured, affordable bolthole in a gorgeous village walking distance from iconic coastal spots: the Cove is 15 minutes, Durdle Door about 45. And finding such a place in 2019 is no joke.• Accommodation was provided by the Castle Inn, Main Road, West Lulworth, Wareham, Dorset, which has doubles from £80 B\u0026ampBRob Rowe, landscape photographerMost people stick to the coastline when they come to Lulworth but Dorset also has beautiful inland walks.

We know what happened to the stars, but what about Fun Bobby, Jack Geller and the other characters?In May 1994, a then-unknown actor called Jennifer Aniston ran into a studio set made up to look like a Manhattan coffee house, and flopped on to a sofa. She wore a white wedding dress, her hair was wet from the rain, and she had just run out on her wedding. Around her, a group of relatively unknown actors – Matt LeBlanc, David Schwimmer, Lisa Kudrow, Matthew Perry and Courteney Cox – gawped. And so began the first episode of a sitcom about six friends, written by New York City playwrights David Crane and Marta Kauffman.Twenty-five years on, Friends is still one of the most successful television shows of all time. After it arrived on Netflix on New Year’s Day 2018, it became the most-streamed show on the internet. And, despite the fact that the final episode was broadcast in May 2004, long before the vast majority of them were born, it is the favourite TV programme of the UK’s five- to 16-year-olds.The show’s stars are now exceedingly famous and obscenely rich. By the final series, they were each being paid $1m an episode, making Aniston, Cox and Kudrow the highest-paid female TV actors of all time.But before Friends became a cultural phenomenon, before the “Which friend are you?” quizzes, the layered haircuts and the cries of: “We were on a break!” – and before the show became a trusted companion on hungover days spent in bed – Friends was just another television pilot being tested for NBC executives in the hope of being picked up.May 4, 1994: the Friends pilot is filmed on the Warner Bros lot in Burbank, California. In it, five friends – Monica Geller, Phoebe Buffay, Chandler Bing, Joey Tribbiani and Monica’s brother, Ross – are hanging out at their favourite coffee house when Rachel Green runs in. Ross has just separated from his wife, Carol, who has gone off with another woman. And Rachel has just stood up her fiance, Barry, at the altar and is in need of a place to stay. By the end of the episode, Rachel has moved in with Monica and started working at the coffee house.Mitchell Whitfield (Dr Barry Farber, Rachel’s orthodontist ex-fiance): It sounds a little egomaniacal to say that I’m the reason the show exists. But when you look at the pilot, with Rachel dumping me at the altar and coming in to meet everybody, that moment was the impetus for the show.Christina Pickles (Judy Geller, Ross’s and Monica’s mother): I knew Jennifer Aniston would be a huge success from the moment I saw her in rehearsals. But I didn’t know that the show would be. I’ve done so many pilots I thought were good that didn’t work, and so many that I thought were bad that did work. I just knew I was witnessing a really special actor at work.Mitchell Whitfield (Barry Farber): Back in the day, there used to be something called pilot season. Everyone wanted to test their pilots to see how audiences reacted to them. Actors would fly in from Chicago or New York and live in LA for the three months of pilot season, and audition every day, just hoping to get into one of those shows that would get picked up and made into a series. I got the script for Friends in the middle of the season. The second I read it, I called my agent and said: “We have to make this happen.”Vincent Ventresca (Fun Bobby, Monica’s on-off boyfriend in seasons one and two): I was so young and full of myself, and I’d just done a pilot for Fox’s new medical show. I thought I was the coolest person in the world. I was at home, and my agent said: “Hey, do you want to go and audition for this new show?” It was a really small part, so, of course, I’m whining like a little actor. But something inside me told me, just do it. So I went in and cried in front of Marta Kauffman, and she was like: “Great!”Directing the pilot is James Burrows, co-creator of Cheers.Elliott Gould (Jack Geller, Ross and Monica’s father): I wanted to work for Jim. I’d heard a lot about him: that he knew what he was doing, and he was smart. And he understood what was funny. At one point, I actually called casting because there were some people who said: “No, no, no. Friends is not enough money for you.” But I wanted to work and meet new people.Christina Pickles (Judy Geller): Burrows was instrumental in creating the atmosphere of Friends. He took the six leads to Vegas before they started working, and they all had a good time together. That was probably very helpful in cementing a sweetness about them.Casting for Friends takes months, and executive producers Kauffman and Crane, and fellow producer Kevin S Bright, see hundreds of hopefuls.Mitchell Whitfield (Barry Farber): I was brought in to audition for Ross and Chandler. I went back multiple times, and then they realised Ross was the role for me. I got down to the very end, and was testing for the show. At the last minute, they said: “We’re bringing in one more guy to read.” That guy turned out to be David Schwimmer.Mike Hagerty (Mr Treeger, the building superintendent): I knew Matt Perry socially a bit, years before. When he was a kid, he used to come into the Formosa bar on Santa Monica, which was a famous Hollywood hangout. I was a patron, and we’d chat. He was a really precocious kid – but very interesting. He’d done lots of pilots already, and was on the cusp of becoming a star.Cosimo Fusco (Paolo, Rachel’s Italian boyfriend in season one): They were all very normal. All of them had a great human side. They were very humble – and really trained. They’d spent years trying to get the right jobs.Christina Pickles (Judy Geller): At the beginning of Friends, Matt LeBlanc was anxious. Every time he did something, he would look for approval to the director, the producers or the writers if they were around. There would be a look of: “Am I doing this right?” He ended up being amazing. He was so perfect as Joey. He slowly built that character into a wonderful, real person.Mike Hagerty (Mr Treeger): Those kids were just ready to pop they were all good enough to have their own shows. And the casting people somehow put them together at the time, and they were all just ready to have something wonderful happen – and it did.After the pilot is taped, NBC orders a further 12 episodes.Cosimo Fusco (Paolo): When I taped my first episode, no one had seen it on TV yet. While we were filming, they announced the show had been commissioned for 12 episodes. Jennifer Aniston basically cried in my lap because nothing like that had ever happened to her before.Larry Hankin (Mr Heckles, Monica and Rachel’s irritable downstairs neighbour): I was there before it all started. I got there early and was watching rehearsals, and the show hadn’t been on the air yet, but I remember thinking: “These young actors are really talented.”Mitchell Whitfield (Barry Farber): There was this excitement. There was no ego on set. People had a sense of how good the project was.Jane Sibbett (Carol Willick): My son was born on 10 September 1994. The next day, my agent called and said: “Friends has come back around again they’ve let go of Anita Barone and would like you to take over the part tomorrow.” I said: “Wow, I’m kind of sore! I don’t think so.” But my agent said: “Jane, this is a huge offer. They’ve said they’ll go easy on you, and you can bring your nanny.” I said: “I don’t have a nanny! I’ve got my mom.” “So bring your mom!” So I sat down and nursed my son, and watched the pilot episode. And the moment I saw David Schwimmer do the longest take ever, I was hooked. I knew I had to work with him.Vincent Ventresca (Fun Bobby): I was starstruck by David Schwimmer. Of course, the girls were incredible and you sort of fell in love with them. But David was the one I desperately wanted to like me and he was the one most not interested in meeting anyone.Mitchell Whitfield (Barry Farber): Towards the end of the first season, I started getting people saying: “Oh, you’re that jerk on Friends.” That’s when I thought: “This thing is definitely starting to take off.”Friends airs on 22 September 1994. The initial critical response is lukewarm, but viewers like the show, and ratings are solid. By the end of the 1994-1995 season, Friends is the eighth most-watched show on air.Larry Hankin (Mr Heckles): I went home, and the show didn’t air for months, so I forgot about it. And then it came out, and it was a hit.Mike Hagerty (Mr Treeger): They weren’t stars when it all started. They were becoming very popular, and probably working on their contracts, but it wasn’t like you were walking into a room full of superstars. That came a bit later.Vincent Ventresca (Fun Bobby): I taped the first season, and there was a comic warming up the studio audience, and the energy was good. By the time we filmed the second year, it was like a circus. I remember metal detectors. The studio was packed with people. That was around the time that the Rolling Stone cover came out with all six of them – May 1995.Cosimo Fusco (Paolo): In season two, there was a change in everything. You’d notice it in the cars they would drive, or they’d talk about buying this or that. There was wealth coming in.Jane Sibbett (Carol Willick): Because I was part of the early days, they weren’t so private around me. But other guest stars would complain about how they didn’t have access to this or that area. They had to clamp down on security and be much tighter about who went up into the dressing rooms, and that kind of thing.Cosimo Fusco (Paolo): You know, someone’s life changes when they get a big paycheck. The money starts rolling in, and you’re obliged to spend it. They would be recognised and followed, and there would be paparazzi. It wasn’t easy for them to just have a coffee at the corner any more. But as people? They didn’t change. Not with me.Vincent Ventresca (Fun Bobby): The first season, they had a show that was doing pretty well on the air, and it looked like they were going to do more, but they weren’t the Beatles. And then they came back the second year, and they were the Beatles.By season three, the cast have made the decision to negotiate their contracts as a group, even though this means some members will take a pay cut. They continue negotiating as a group for the show’s entire run.Mike Hagerty (Mr Treeger): As a group, they decided it was time to get more of a share of the profits. It was quite a risk. They were putting it all on the line.Marlo Thomas (Sandra Green, Rachel’s mother): It’s unusual to do contracts together, and I think they set a standard for a lot of other shows to follow. When the network is negotiating against you, one at a time, things can become adversarial. But they all realised, to their benefit, that it took every single one of them to make the show that good.Jane Sibbett (Carol Willick): I was on the lot this one time. I’d just had lunch. And I came around the corner, and I see Jen, Lisa and Courteney. It had just rained, which is a rarity in LA, right? And they’re splashing in this puddle outside the sound stage. I was so struck by it because there was no one else around, and they were just falling around laughing with one another. That was the lightning in the bottle because they captured that joy of being friends, and that playfulness, and it was magic. The love this group had for one other was extraordinary.Christina Pickles (Judy Geller): They were a united group. They would watch each other’s work. If someone had a scene they weren’t in, the others would watch it and laugh. It’s very unusual to be so supportive of each other on set.Paget Brewster (Kathy, Joey and then Chandler’s girlfriend in season four): They would make fun of each other. If someone made a joke and it didn’t work, they’d all turn on the person and be like: “You blew it, Lisa!” They would bust each other’s balls. And they started adding this thing into the script that they did to each other in real life: one of them would be talking, and they’d all pretend to fall asleep.Vincent Ventresca (Fun Bobby): You’d do a pass of a scene. If the audience didn’t laugh, we’d huddle together and Matthew Perry would say: “What if we tried this?” And Matt LeBlanc would say: “Yeah!” And we’d break again and do the scene. It was like being at a football game.Paget Brewster (Kathy): Matthew Perry always had to have the last bit. If it was the end of the scene, he would consistently pitch something. They’d make fun of him for literally always wanting to have the last laugh.Christina Pickles (Judy Geller): Everything begins and ends with the writing. David and Marta didn’t write every show – they hired a lot of good writers – but they had the final say, and they had impeccable taste.Alexandra Holden (Elizabeth Stevens, Ross’s girlfriend in season six. She was one of his students, and Bruce Willis played her father): We’re in the cabin in one episode, and Ross and I are making out on the couch. He says: “I can’t stop thinking about your dad.” The writers stopped and said: “After he says that, why don’t you say: ‘Whatever works for you?’” We added the joke in at the last minute, and it was so funny. They could just come up with stuff like that on the spot.Christina Pickles (Judy Geller): David and Marta would come down from the office to watch the run-throughs, which was terrifying. They’d sit in a row of chairs, with the writers and NBC executives. And you could see they were thinking, and they’d give comments and then go back upstairs and change it all. David and Marta were the giant stars of the writing team.Jane Sibbett (Carol Willick): There was one joke we kept changing. We couldn’t get it right. It was the episode where Susan and I are celebrating our anniversary, and Ross comes over at an inopportune moment, and I had to telegraph to him that it isn’t a good time. So I removed a little pube from my tongue. That was the only time I pitched something that was really outrageous, and it actually got on air.With Friends’ increased popularity comes intense media scrutiny. But on set it’s business as usual.Aisha Tyler (Dr Charlie Wheeler, Joey and then Ross’s girlfriend): I remember walking into Monica’s apartment, and looking out of the window to see if I could see Ugly Naked Guy, but of course it’s just a hallway back there.Paget Brewster (Kathy): I was terrified of those guys. I hid in my room because they were so famous. It was the biggest show in the country.Aisha Tyler (Dr Charlie Wheeler): It was a very intimidating set to walk into. I think the cast had had some pretty notable experiences with guest actors coming in and struggling because of the pressure of having to be funny on the Friends set.Marlo Thomas (Sandra Green): It’s not always easy to walk into a show that has already been established and where everyone has their characters, and they’re a tight-knit family. Sometimes, it’s not roomy enough for a new person to come in. But they made it very roomy.Alexandra Holden (Elizabeth Stevens): I got called in to do a “chemistry read” with David Schwimmer. It was terrifying because the producers told me to come in looking “as hot as possible”. I didn’t know what to do with that information. It sent me into a tailspin. I stayed up all night trying to figure out what to wear … Now that I’m older, I wouldn’t be happy getting that message.By the time Friends wraps its final season in 2004, the lead actors have become some of the highest-paid TV stars of all time, earning $1m an episode.Mitchell Whitfield (Dr Barry Farber): My wife, she cringes a little bit because if I had ended up getting the part of Ross, I’d have made tens of millions of dollars. But I never think about that.Jane Sibbett (Carol Willick): I’m quite content. Obviously, I didn’t get paid the million-dollar paycheck, but I’ve had the best of Friends. I was able to raise my children and I got offered some really sweet projects.Cosimo Fusco (Paolo): I have a little bit of regret I feel like I could have capitalised more on the success of the show. I was having a orce, and was distracted by my personal life. I didn’t get a publicist, which I should have done.Mike Hagerty (Mr Treeger): People have a tendency to pigeonhole you a little bit, but it’s always good to have something that people can recognise you from.In the two and a half decades since Friends first aired, the show has been continually rerun. In recent years, critics have re-evaluated the show’s legacy, identifying problematic storylines and criticising Friends for its lack of ersity.Cosimo Fusco (Paolo): Today, one of the six would have to be black, of course.Aisha Tyler (Dr Charlie Wheeler): My character wasn’t written on the page to be a woman of colour, and I auditioned against a lot of other women of different ethnic backgrounds, so I like to think they picked me because I was the right person for the role. But I knew it was something new for the show, and it was really important because, the fact of the matter was, it was a show set in Manhattan that was almost entirely Caucasian. It was an unrealistic representation of what the real world looked like.Cosimo Fusco (Paolo): There was one scene where I was getting a massage, and I had to be this greasy guy who was touching Phoebe’s ass. I had a problem with how it portrayed me, as if guys from Italy are like that. What they wanted me to do was quite disrespectful. But I remember we were able to find a compromise, so I felt comfortable.Paget Brewster (Kathy): It’s so bizarre to compare the show at that time to what’s happening now on social media. No one can do anything right, ever. That’s basically where we are. Everything is people being questioned or attacked. Yeah, if you look at the world today, and you look at Friends, you go: “Oh, wow, there were gay jokes and they don’t have friends of colour.” But that’s what it was then.In 2018, Netflix acquired the rights to Friends in a $100m deal. Thanks to streaming, the show has become known to a new, younger audience.Vincent Ventresca (Fun Bobby): As an actor, you want to be a part of something: your work will be here when you’re gone. And you get an insight into that when a show that is 25 years old gets reissued on Netflix, and a whole new audience discovers it.Alexandra Holden (Elizabeth Stevens): My 12-year-old niece just asked me for a T-shirt with “Central Perk” on it. That’s so bizarre to me. She wasn’t even alive when I worked on the show.Christina Pickles (Judy Geller): Kids come up to me and recite the script.Paget Brewster (Kathy): People in their 20s recognise my voice. They turn around in supermarkets and say: “You’re Kathy!”Mitchell Whitfield (Dr Barry Farber): “Dude, what was it like? You got to kiss Jennifer Aniston!”Elliott Gould (Jack Geller): I met Taylor Swift, and she said: “I know you! I’m a Friends freak! You’re Mr Geller.”Cosimo Fusco (Paolo): I can work in the most exquisite film, but the minute people find out I was Paolo, they’re like: “Oh my God!”Now, 25 years since the show first aired, Friends is the most-streamed show in the UK, and perhaps even the most beloved TV show of all time.Paget Brewster (Kathy): A show like Friends was one in a million. Normally a pilot doesn’t go, or it goes and you shoot three episodes, or you make a year and it’s gone.Aisha Tyler (Dr Charlie Wheeler): There have been other shows that have advanced that concept of friends as chosen family, but Friends was just a perfect encapsulation of that idea.Marlo Thomas (Sandra Green): They’re independent, their parents aren’t telling them what to do, they’re making their own decisions, they’re making their own mistakes – and they’re succeeding at it! That’s aspirational for young people to see.Alexandra Holden (Elizabeth Stevens): Television was a very different thing back then. I don’t know if there will ever be another show as successful as Friends. I feel like there’s too much content out there now, and too much variety.Vincent Ventresca (Fun Bobby): I was so young. I was 27. I don’t remember feeling young then, but now it’s like looking back in time. But I love looking back at it. It’s a good memory, and it’s a reminder that time is passing. Not a lot of people get to look at where they were half their lifetime ago.Alexandra Holden (Elizabeth Stevens): It feels like a different life. When I watch Friends now, I think: “Was I really there? Did that really happen? Was I really part of this thing that’s become such a huge influence all these years later?” It’s kind of surreal.Marlo Thomas (Sandra Green): Everything you do is part of the tapestry of your career, and your life. Every little thread gets pulled in some way. And the Sandra Green thread is certainly a colour in my tapestry that people remember and have some affection for, as do I.Vincent Ventresca (Fun Bobby): When someone comes up to you and says: “Hey, you were good on Friends,” it connects you with them in a way. You were part of a thing that meant something to them, and that means something to me. It makes you feel like: “Maybe you didn’t really waste your life.”Elliott Gould (Jack Geller): I saw Matt LeBlanc at the studio recently, and we embraced. Without being pretentious, we’re all a part of each other.Vincent Ventresca (Fun Bobby): Things don’t change as much as you think they do. What’s important to us: friendship, family, community and laughing at silly situations. That’s what Friends is all about. And that’s timeless."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ca901788f39b5428c787161849411ec03bf1c04d/213_0_1614_968/master/1614.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=331f1105fdfd71e698b2cb7bf1f65a96","title":"surviving r kelly review disturbing but deeply flawed","story":"This documentary series shares the appalling stories of women who claim they have suffered at the R\u0026ampB star’s hands, but at times it feels exploitativeScales. Scales are what you think of when you watch the six hours – and it will be the entire six hours you watch, waiting for the moment that pulls the whole incredible, appalling story into a comprehensible shape – of Surviving R Kelly (Crime+Investigation).The scales of justice first. Where are they in this six-part documentary – already aired to much outrage and uproar in the US – that pulls together the rumours, allegations and court cases surrounding the talented, popular and lucrative phenomenon that is the R\u0026ampB star Robert Kelly over his 30-year career? They began, basically, as soon as he was old enough for an interest in underage girls to be possible. In his 20s, he was hanging around the local high school and picking up teenagers. As his success grew, it seems, so did his appetites. Surviving R Kelly illuminates the timeline with the testimony of women who claim in detail that they suffered at his hands. Tales of being approached at 14, 15, 16 or 17 by the star or his people and invited back to his mansion abound. Once there, they were frequently “trained” by him, they say: kept apart from each other and their families told not to talk back or talk at all told to ask for permission to go to the lavatory or to watch television told to have sex with him, and each other, whenever he felt like it. If they objected, they claim, they would be beaten, starved or ignored for days at a time.One can only assume that life went similarly for his wife, Aaliyah (who died in a plane crash in 2001), whom he first met when she was 12 and – thanks to forged papers – married when she was 15. Kelly wrote and produced her first album, Age Ain’t Nothing But a Number – recorded when she was 14 – about a young girl trying to persuade an older man to go to bed with her. One of the other girls – children – around at the time, Jovante Cunningham, recalls seeing them having sex in the tour bus and shakes her head as she says: “He destroyed a lot of people, a lot of people who loved and adored him. And I can’t stress to you enough how much people are still suffering.”Next, scales falling from people’s eyes. Cunningham says it happened for her on that bus, but for other people they clung on much longer. Demetrius Smith, who helped forge the papers and is one of several members of Kelly’s entourage interviewed for the series, remembers that Aaliyah looked “worried and scared” and that it “broke his heart” when he found out that Kelly had, contrary to what he had told him, “been messing with Aaliyah”.But Smith, and the rest of his people, stayed with Kelly. His record label didn’t bat an eye when a video emerged purporting to show their multimillion-dollar asset having sex with and urinating on an apparently underage girl, or when charges of “child pornography” were filed against him, or when allegations that he ran an abusive sex cult from his home were made. (Kelly denies he is the man in the video and was acquitted of all charges.) It is hard not to feel the power of the heartfelt denunciation of the mother of Dominique Gardner, who had not seen her daughter since she disappeared into Kelly’s world three years ago, that “money can buy you any fucking thing”.And so to the last set of scales. Let’s call them “the Cosby scales”. You put the alleged abuser’s fame and wealth on one side and keep adding – keep adding, keep adding – female testimony to the other and hope that one day the latter will outweigh the former and that proper investigation will ensue. If you are able to add high-profile reporting to the women’s words, your odds improve. This is how we live now.As a programme, Surviving R Kelly is deeply flawed. At best, it treads a fine line between attesting to the apparent pain of those taking part and exploiting it – and often gives in to temptation. The footage of Gardner’s mother rescuing her from the hotel where she discovered her daughter was staying is extraordinary, but the desperate, whispered exchanges between them as they arranged her escape are surely something for them alone.Perhaps more importantly, the programme doesn’t push any of Kelly’s entourage about alleged complicity. If you are going to show people’s pain like this, should it not be done in the service of some kind of reckoning?But since the documentary and the renewed energy of the activist group #MuteRKelly, his label has dropped him. The series may yet yield results that far outweigh its flaws. Let the scales start to slide."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3694b69aceaa044820d15541ec4abb9466480a85/0_118_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f5d8e6e79f1ed7aa71d9acfe42176428","title":"former ivory coast president","story":"Prosecution may appeal the acquittal by ICC on charges of crimes against humanityFormer Ivory Coast president Laurent Gbagbo has been released on bail to Belgium following his acquittal by the International Criminal Court in The Hague on charges of crimes against humanity, the court said Tuesday.Belgium said on Saturday that it had agreed in principle to host Gbagbo pending a possible prosecution appeal against his acquittal, but that final arrangements were being made.The 73-year-old former strongman and his aide Charles Blé Goudé have been staying in an undisclosed location since Friday, when The Hague tribunal freed them from detention.“Mr Gbagbo is now released under conditions in Belgium,” an ICC spokeswoman said, without giving further details.ICC judges acquitted Gbagbo and Blé Goudé on 15 January on charges stemming from a wave of violence after disputed elections in the west African nation in 2010.Around 3,000 people were killed in the violence. Gbagbo spent seven years behind bars and had been on trial since 2016.The delay in Gbagbo’s release was because prosecutors said that he should be kept in detention pending a possible appeal against his acquittal, arguing that he would not return to the court if there was a retrial.The release conditions include that Belgium will guarantee that Gbagbo would go back to the ICC if required.He must also surrender his travel documents, report to authorities weekly, avoid contacting witnesses in Ivory Coast and refrain from making public statements about the case, court documents said on Friday.The Belgian foreign minister, Didier Reynders, said on Saturday that there had been “a request from the court to host Mr Gbagbo simply because he has family in Belgium: his second wife, a child in Brussels”.“We have concluded that it is all right for him to stay in Belgium while on conditional release,” he said, adding: “There will be surveillance.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3184486453202a4724643187ef6478676f258b5e/0_204_4674_2804/master/4674.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=65ab2742110cda0eb717fe8001ce187e","title":"venezuela faes special forces nicolas maduro barrios","story":"Activists suspect Nicolás Maduro has tasked Faes with pacifying the city’s barrios in bid to snuff out protest in areas once considered the cradle of ChavismoA flickering candle and 19 rose petals – one for every year he lived – adorn a shrine in what used to be the home of Alixon Pisani.“We love you,” reads a note beside a black and white photograph of the recently killed teen.It was 10pm on the night of 22 January when friends arrived outside with the news that Pisani was dead gunned down as he demonstrated against Nicolás Maduro’s teetering regime in Catia, a traditionally working-class area of western Caracas.“He was still just a boy,” said the woman who raised him, his aunt, Nivea Pisani.“They are murderers … demons,” she said of her nephew’s killers. “He just went out to protest because we are going hungry. How many more will die if we carry on like this?”Pisani, an unemployed 45-year-old, is still waiting for an official explanation about who shot her nephew and why. His death certificate states he died from a firearm injury but offers no hint of the weapon used – or the motive.But she believes his killers were from Faes, a shadowy and fearsome special forces unit activists suspect Maduro has tasked with pacifying the city’s impoverished redbrick barrios in a bid to snuff out protest in areas once considered the cradle of Chavismo.“The poor areas are where most people live – and since we don’t support them any more I guess they want to kill us all,” said Pisani, who says witnesses told her Faes agents arrived at the protest shortly before her nephew was shot in the arm and chest.Hugo Chávez first took office in January 1999 – just a few months before Alixon Pisani was born – vowing to blaze a Boilvarian trail for Venezuela’s long-forgotten poor.In his first post-election speech, the comandante promised he would not rest while there were still children in the streets and families going hungry. “Today a new battle starts for the salvation of Venezuela,” Chávez said.In the early years of Chavismo, its leader won global accolades and a cult following for his crusade to help Venezuela’s poor. Social projects known as misiones brought healthcare and education to millions of disenfranchised citizens.But two decades after Chávez’s rise to power, Venezuela is on its knees, and many who were once loyalists have lost faith in his successor. And, increasingly, they are taking to the streets to demand change.“We’ve never had protests here in Catia – this is new,” said Pisani, attributing the shift to the country’s economic and social collapse under Chávez’s heir.“Before, I’d open my fridge and see ham, cheese, eggs, meat, chicken. These days there’s nothing but water – and sometimes we don’t even have that. It’s insanity – we never thought we’d be living like this,” she said.The day he died, Alixon Pisani – who worked in a local bakery – had gone out to protest the “beggary” into which their oil-rich nation has been plunged. “It’s as if there is no government in this country,” Pisani complained. “How can you not go out to protest?”Across town, in a sprawling eastern neighbourhood called José Félix Ribas, Venezuela’s special forces have also made their deadly presence felt in an apparent bid to crush dissent.“It’s the first time they’ve attacked with so much force,” said one local woman, too scared to be named, as she and other residents described a series of war-like operations in the days after opposition leader Juan Guaidó sparked the current political crisis by declaring himself Venezuela’s rightful president on 23 January.A second woman recalled balaclava-wearing, rifle-toting troops swarming into the labyrinthine community like an army of “little black ants”, kicking down doors and shooting.“We heard the bangs: tacka-tacka-tacka-tacka-tacka. It was horrible,” said the woman, whose home was stormed.“Even the Chavistas around here don’t agree with Nicolás Maduro,” said her 18-year-old son, who described narrowly escaping death during one operation, sprinting over rooftops and down alleys as the agents opened fire.The teenager, who now sleeps in another part of Caracas for fear of being killed, agreed the repression was designed to dissuade the urban poor from leaving their hilltop homes to join the revolt. “If the barrio goes down it will be like a nuclear bomb.”Things were not always thus, a group of locals explained as they sat around a wooden table in a kitchen equipped with nothing but a broken stove and an almost bare pantry.“Chávez would go into the barrios, into any house, and whichever house Chávez went into they’d say: ‘Have a little cup of coffee, my presidente,’” said the 18-year-old. “They adored him him. They loved him.”And what if Maduro came calling today?“I’d hit him with a chair,” he replied.“We’d keep him here for a week eating what we have to eat – lentils and beans – to see if he liked it,” his mother chuckled sarcastically.“Without any salt,” chipped in a third woman.Faes – the special action force – has earned notoriety since the uprising against Maduro began last month. Graffiti artists have daubed Caracas’ walls with messages denouncing its operatives as “murderers of the people”.But little is known about the elite group’s inner workings or even who exactly commands it. In a recent report, the Venezuelan human rights group Provea said Faes was created by Maduro in 2017 to fight “organized crime and terrorism” and was part of Venezuela’s national police force, although some stories in state-run media outlets describe it as being under the command of the Venezuelan military. By last year it boasted almost 1,300 agents.In a recent post on its Instagram account the group said its role was to “guarantee security, tranquility and peace” for all Venezuelans.But activists say it has taken on an explicitly political role since the the most severe challenge to Maduro’s rule erupted last month.In one Instagram video, a Faes commander urges troops to show “absolute loyalty to Maduro” given the “extremely difficult moments” his administration was facing. “As soldiers who are faithful to the revolution, let’s go for it, let’s really go for it – without hesitation,” he says.Provea’s coordinator, Rafael Uzcátegui, said: “What the government is trying to do is contain the discontent, to contain the anger – not by addressing the citizens’ concerns but by instilling terror and fear.”Uzcátegui said his group had counted 43 killings linked to the protests. It had not been possible to identify the perpetrators of each death but he believed Faes was the number one culprit, followed by the pro-government paramilitary groups known as colectivos. Faes’ role appeared to be “neutralizing the greatest possible number of people”, not bringing criminals to justice.Asked about alleged killings by the group on Venezuelan television last week, the attorney general, Tarek William Saab, said the criminal responsibility for such acts was “inidual. Those who commit violations ... will be prosecuted, whichever part of the police they are from.”On Monday, as she prepared for the last of nine evenings of mourning, Pisani said she felt uneasy about the prospect of foreign military intervention to unseat Maduro, but was adamant he had to step down.“I want him to go. He must realize this country is a disaster,” she said.Most of all, though, she wanted answers about the masked gunmen who had condemned her nephew to an unmarked concrete grave.Why did they kill him? What for?” she asked. “His life had hardly even begun.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9330e99791c0078469593cd4e8ac8c1fb370b1d8/0_701_3420_2052/master/3420.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=23c0a23532093e5b832c3a95cfff2e17","title":"working usb stick found in leopard seals year old frozen faeces","story":"New Zealand puts out call to find owner of memory stick spotted in frozen poo sample A functioning USB stick has been found in the scat of a rare Antarctic leopard seal, prompting New Zealand’s national science body to launch a hunt for the owner.Volunteers at the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research (Niwa) recovered the device while examining the animal’s frozen faeces – which had been sitting in a freezer for over a year.It revealed a video shot by a kayaker paddling around Porpoise Bay in the Caitlins at the bottom of the South Island. The kayaker is not visible, but the tip of their blue kayak is, as well as footage of leopard seals playing in the cold coastal waters, including a mother and its pup.Leopard seal scat is valuable to scientists because it holds a wealth of information about what the Antarctic predators eat, their general health and how long they have been in New Zealand waters.Around the country, volunteers comb the coastline collecting it for marine biologists, in a bid to learn more about the rare animals, which usually live and hunt in packs in Antarctic waters, but are increasingly heading north to New Zealand, puzzling experts.New Zealanders are also requested to report all sightings of the animals, document their location with videos and photographs, and call a dedicated leopard seal hotline.“It is very worrying that these amazing Antarctic animals have plastic like this inside them,” said Jodie Warren, a volunteer who was working in the lab of marine biologist Dr Krista Hupman when she recovered the USB stick.Warren left the stick to dry for weeks, curious to see if any data could be recovered.The research team are keen to find the owner of the USB stick – and recruit the keen seal watcher to their volunteer army combing the beaches for “golden” poo.A spokesperson for Niwa said there are been “no serious leads yet” on finding the owner, but it would keep trying."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e9bb7caff362af4cb96195c6848c5ed7aaea3dd8/60_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=811fe9d5de7f84bb9ab8d4ff1f20cb9c","title":"tell us about the issues men face today","story":"From mental health to relationships, we’d like to hear from men of all ages about what they are really thinkingThe debate around modern-day masculinity has intensified in the wake of the #MeToo movement, and we are asking men to tell us what they are really thinking.As the role of men and women in society continue to change, so too do the dynamics from the workplace to the bedroom and everywhere in between.

Photograph: Aidan CrawleyEPA Theresa May, as is her wont, was short on specifics about what she wants from Dublin and Brussels to resolve the Brexit logjam but it did seem implicit from her speech to Belfast businesspeople that a time-limited backstop would dig her out of an ever-deepening hole.That was backed up by Downing Street sources who said the “indefinite nature” of the backstop was the key reason the House of Commons rejected by a massive 230 votes the EU-UK withdrawal agreement last month. “We need to see change,” said one of the sources.The British prime minister indicated she wasn’t so much rejecting the backstop, or performing a U-turn, but rather she needed a modified backstop.“I’m not proposing to persuade people to accept a deal that doesn’t contain that insurance policy for the future,” she said.The business people she addressed in the Belfast office of the US insurance giant Allstate could have been forgiven for being rather miffed, considering many of them went out on a limb to endorse her original withdrawal agreement and its backstop proposal.That necessitated involving themselves in the tricky business of Northern Ireland politics and annoying the DUP in particular, who view the backstop as an unacceptable dilution of Northern Ireland’s constitutional position within the United Kingdom. No business leader wants to be in such a bind, but still they supported her.May made no apologies in Belfast while offering the excuse that she could “only deliver on the commitments we have made if I can get a deal through the UK parliament”.On Thursday in Brussels, May holds her first meeting with European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker since the withdrawal agreement agreed last November was soundly rejected by the House of Commons.Before Brussels, May will be at Stormont on Wednesday to meet the leaders of the North’s five main parties. Sinn Féin and the SDLP will demand that she hold firm on the current backstop while Arlene Foster and the DUP might allow that they could live with a time-limited backstop.There was absolutely no sense from her Belfast speech or from what Downing Street sources had to say that May will be producing any detailed plan to the North’s political leaders on Wednesday.Equally, no one is expecting the Brussels meeting to lead to a resolution but it was clear from her speech on Tuesday that she hopes for or maybe even expects some moderation of the EU’s current adamant position on the backstop, notwithstanding the EU and Dublin’s insistence that there is no room to manoeuvre.How that all pans out as March 29th – Brexit day – looms ever closer and closer is anybody’s guess. The message from May on Tuesday was that she wants the EU to blink.The prime minister did not appear perturbed by the prospect of former first minister David Trimble legally challenging the backstop because, he argues, it contravenes the Belfast Agreement. She said her attorney general Geoffrey Cox had made clear the backstop respected “all aspects of the Belfast Agreement”.And in words that would have pleased Dublin, she said the Belfast Agreement was “not just the bedrock of stability here in Northern Ireland” but that “its principles are fundamental to the security and success of the whole United Kingdom”.The prime minister also engaged in the impossible task of trying to please both unionists and nationalists. “A fundamental belief in the union of Great Britain and Northern Ireland is part of my political heritage as a Conservative and Unionist - and that will never change,” she said.“But the unionism I believe in is one that respects absolutely the central importance of Irish identity to those people in Northern Ireland who claim it.”May was mainly in reassuring mode in Belfast. In her speech she made several references to the British government ensuring there will be no hard border regardless of the outcome of the forthcoming negotiations.“Northern Ireland does not have to rely on the Irish Government or the European Union to prevent a return to borders of the past. The UK Government will not let that happen. I will not let that happen,” she pledged.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches. See more here.

Politicians can’t get enough of Kieran Mulvey. In their world, no other negotiator exists. From Bertie Ahern’s time to the present day, the former union boss and now retired head of the Labour Relations Commission is the go-to mediator for distressed Ministers afraid to act and frustrated Opposition leaders who want them to get on with it.The nurses are out on strike again. Tuesday marked their second full day on the picket lines. The Taoiseach is holding firm – his government can’t make an exception of the nurses and give them a pay rise without giving it across the board to all public sector employees who signed up to a wage agreement.Not good enough, thunder the Opposition.“Why not engage in mediation, Taoiseach, to create a meaningful process so that you can set in train a process that would come within the aegis of the industrial relations machinery?” suggested the Fianna Fáil leader, Micheál Martin, in the Dáil. “Why not deploy somebody, for example, of the calibre of Kieran Mulvey to engage with both sides to develop such a process that would bring the Government and the unions together under aegis of the industrial relations machinery to resolve this issue?”A klaxon went off deep in the bowels.Typical. Never a nurse when you need one.No. A klaxon went off deep in the bowels of Government Buildings at the mention of Mulvey. The boffins downed their sonic screwdrivers and, when the smoke cleared, they peered into the matter transformer capsules. But, yet again, their latest attempts to clone Kieran had ended with the same, baffling results.“More Colm Brophys,” sighed a white-coated lad assistant, shaking his head sadly, looking along the glass-fronted row of identical Fine Gael TDs for Dublin South West.“Never mind,” said the professor. “The Government is shipping heavy pressure because of the Brexit, the nurses strike and the cost overruns at the National Children’s Hospital. They need as many Colm Brophys as the machine can handle so he can sit on multiple radio and TV discussion panels, ignoring the barrage of criticism while blustering amiably until the closing credits.”The work goes on. The latest plan involves not constructing the prototype Mulveys from chocolate, as it is suspected that they may be eating themselves.Meanwhile, the Taoiseach was having a tough and uncomfortable Leaders’ Questions under intense scrutiny on both the nurses and the children’s hospital. When he came to answering questions on the hospital, he found himself in the unusual and somewhat unpleasant situation of having Opposition TDs openly laughing at him. That doesn’t happen too often.(And that was before Catherine Connolly, Independent TD for Galway, tore into him for the lack of progress on providing operating theatres in Merlin Park Hospital, his lack of up-to-date information on the situation and his sidestepping of the issue by repeating old information to her and the Dáil with details they already knew months ago.)Before that, Labour leader Brendan Howlin, a former minister for public expenditure and reform, was astonished at how long to took for his successor, Paschal Donohoe, to be informed of the humongous cost overrun on the children’s hospital.“Surely as the Minister overseeing public spending, he would have received monthly, if not weekly, updates on the progress of a project of this scale and significance. Why did it apparently take three months for the Minister for Health to inform the Minister for Public Expenditure about major cost overruns in the flagship programme of the Department of Health?”Brendan was almost speechless, but not quite. “It is unimaginable that the Minister for Public Expenditure was kept in complete ignorance of public expenditure,” he spluttered.We were reminded of Paschal, who will not have been happy at his treatment in the Irish Mirror on Tuesday, where they did a mock-up photo of him, complete with little black moustache, as Manuel, the Spanish waiter in Fawlty Towers whose catchphrase was: “I am from Barcelona. I know nothing.”On Morning Ireland on Monday, he rolled up his trademark cotton wool carpet of words, explaining his version of the cost explosion and how everything will be fine in the end.“As you know now, there is a review under way of all of these systems at the moment, led by PWC, and that will yield learnings for us regarding the nature of the governance that we had there,” he declared.Learnings? Never mind Manuel, that’s like something Borat would say.But back to the Taoiseach, who said during Leaders’ Questions: “When I found out about it in November, around the same time as the Minister for Public Expenditure, I responded in the same way as other people in this House. At first, disbelief, struggling to believe how the prices had gone up again.”Snorts of derision went up from the Opposition.“Three months,” marvelled the Fianna Fáil leader, as astonished as his Labour counterpart at the length of time it took for the people in charge of the budgetary bottom line to twig that the costs were spiralling.“Were ooo asleep?” asked Michael Healy-Rae, brandishing a copy of the Dáil record from March 2017 when the rural Independents lost a motion aimed at forcing the Government to pay closer scrutiny to the building project which was already worryingly over budget.“There’s a vast crater in St James’s and, having dug themselves into this hole, the Government seems to have no choice but to keep digging and try to find a way out,” was Brendan’s conclusion. For the rest of the exchange, Mattie McGrath, who favoured the green field site option off the M50 motorway for the project, kept shouting, “black hole . . . he’s falling into the hole,” and called for the health and public expenditure Ministers to be fired.The Taoiseach fell back to extolling all the wonderful facilities the hospital will have when built (and hang the cost).“This is a hundred-year project” he cried, although he may have meant the length of time the country will finish paying for it.And then it was time once more for Leo’s Wildean Reverse.“We must never forget the value of this project,” he told the Dáil. Again.Leo’s Wildean Reverse sets Oscar’s famous line about people “knowing the price of everything and the value of nothing” on its head.The Taoiseach and his Government, it seems, when it comes to the children’s hospital, know the value of everything but the cost of nothing."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3783361.1549396793!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"shane ross to outline brexit contingency travel plans","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMinister for Transport Shane Ross:  he will say EU no-deal plans will ensure continued air access between the EU27 member states and the UK for a limited period of 12 months.

Mr Ross is due to appear before the Oireachtas Committee on Transport, where he will discuss Brexit contingency plans and an omnibus Bill designed to prevent travel chaos if the UK crashes out of the EU without a deal.He will outline the key challenges for his department, including continued aviation connectivity, the potential impacts on ports and airports, as well as the impact on the UK “landbridge” – the journey across Britain taken by Irish hauliers on their way to the continent .In relation to aviation, Mr Ross will outline how “while not everything that the industry would wish for will be possible, the very real fears that aircraft might not be able to fly are being addressed”.He will outline how some 44 per cent of all flights to or from Ireland, approximately 113,000 flights per annum, are to or from the UK.Mr Ross will say EU no-deal plans will ensure continued air access between the EU27 member states and the UK for a limited period of 12 months.He will also outline how community air carriers may need more time to restructure their companies if there is a no-deal Brexit.Mr Ross will also discuss concerns around the landbridge, and legislation to ensure trains and buses can continue to travel cross-Border.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination. A fashion insider said: His brand is about female empowerment. That\u0027s his ethos. He couldn\u0027t go ahead with this, it wouldn\u0027t be a good look. It would be awkward. I can\u0027t imagine celebrities would want to be associated with Philip Green. He\u0027s in a tricky situation.

In these United States, when times are tough, we can persevere because our friends and neighbors will come for us.Ms Abrams was an unusual choice for the high-profile role in that she currently holds no elected office, having narrowly lost a controversial race for the governorship of Georgia in November.She had previously been elected to Georgia\u0027s state legislature in 2006, and has also written eight romantic novels under the pen name Selena Montgomery.Ms Abrams also has a law degree from Yale, and a masters from the University of Texas, and is considered a rising star within the Democratic Party.Ms Abrams has written eight romantic novels under the pen name Selena MontgomeryHad she won the Georgia race she would have been the first black female state governor in US history.She lost to Brian Kemp, her Republican opponent, after a protracted challenge over voting regulations.Ms Abrams refused to concede on election night and accused Mr Kemp of using his previous post, as Georgia\u0027s secretary of state, to deny thousands of voters access to the ballot box.A group backed by her has since launched a legal action claiming the state of Georgia deprived many low-income people and minorities of their voting rights.During the campaign Ms Abrams had emphasised the importance of expanding health care to Georgia\u0027s rural hospitals.Brian Kemp defeated Abrahams to the become governor of GeorgiaDuBose Porter, a former chairman of the party in Georgia, said: She will talk about the issues that really do matter to working Americans and families, who Stacey Abrams speaks for more than anyone else I know.Chuck Schumer, the Democrat leader in the US Senate, said: She is just a great spokesperson. She is an incredible leader. She has led the charge for voting rights, which is at the root of just about everything else. She knows what working people, the middle class, go through.The selection also reveals an important subplot at play concerning the 2020 election.The party hierachy wants Ms Abrams to stand for a Senate seat in Georgia in 2020. That seat is currently Republican and without flipping it the Democrats have virtually no chance of winning control of the US senate.Delivering the State of the Union response will give ss Abrams a launch pad for a senate campaign if she chooses to stand.If she stands it could also help to bring out Democrat voters in Georgia for the Democrat presidential candidate, perhaps delivering the state\u0027s 16 electoral college votes in the White House race.The State of the Union response often raises the profile of ambitious politicians, although not always in a beneficial way.Marco Rubio, the Republican senator, was widely lampooned for sneaking sips of water when he gave the response in 2013.State of the UnionState of the UnionPlease review our commenting policyTheresa May seeks Brexit breakthrough with DUP after saying she will not scrap the backstopComment: How Bob Mortimer proved to be the perfect castawayComment: Less is never more if there’s a chance  treasure might be involvedEight key lines from Donald Trump\u0026#39s State of the Union speech, and why they matterComment: Iran\u0026#39s cruel regime need not last another 40 yearsState of the Union address 2019: Donald Trump calls for unity and announces second summit with Kim Jong-unDonald Trump to meet Kim Jong-un in Vietnam - why choice of venue is highly symbolicJoshua Trump, a schoolboy bullied over his name, wins fans after falling asleep at State of UnionDonald Trump\u0026#39s State of the Union address 2019 - full transcriptDonald Trump warns \u0026#39ridiculous partisan\u0026#39 investigations could derail US economyDemocrat women wear white at Donald Trump\u0026#39s State of the Union addressColorado jogger chokes mountain lion to death after wild cat attacked him on mountain trailMinisters pledge to clamp down on incompetent NHS chiefs Driverless cars to be on Britain\u0026#39s roads by the end of the year, government reveals Occasional cannabis may boost men\u0026#39s fertility, new study suggestsMore than 50,000 die waiting for social care while ministers delay Social media firms face multi-million pound fines under Labour plan for new duty of care lawTeenager, 19, is stabbed to death close to Prince George\u0026#39s school in southwest LondonPolice to get new powers to evict travellers from private land, Sajid Javid announcesWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/02/05/17/artificial-intelligence-pictionary-ai-deepmind.jpg","title":"artificial intelligence deep thoughts ai pictionary deepmind","story":"IM Subscribe \u0026nbsp registerIM SubscribeCreated with Sketch.IM Join us?

The difficulty ranges from simple phrases like woman kicking the football, to more complex concepts like celebrating a festival.Crucially, the AI has never seen these phrases before and must either guess them from images drawn by the human player, or convey them to the human through its own series of images.The difficulty in teaching artificial intelligence common sense has proved to be one of the key stumbling blocks in developing chatbots and voice assistants that are genuinely multi-purpose.This is a first step toward exploiting common sense, said Aniruddha Kembhavi, a computer scientist who worked on the project.Fellow computer scientist Ali Farhadi added: We wanted to build an AI system that can collaborate with human beings, and at the same time is learning about how humans think, how they act...

And few can have more first-hand experience of the danger posed to that progress by Brexit.This week, Nissan U-turned on its decision to build the new X-Trail at its Sunderland plant.\u0026nbspFor Matthews, who worked his way up from an apprenticeship to become managing director at a key Nissan supplier, it hit close to home.\u0026nbspA\u0026nbsp£61m package of taxpayer-funded sweeteners offered to Nissan by the government proved not to be enough to counter the financial reality of investing in post-Brexit\u0026nbspBritain, the shape of which remains deeply uncertain. Despite its earlier assurances, the company crunched the numbers and decided it now made sense\u0026nbspto build its\u0026nbspnew model in Japan instead.\u0026nbspFor exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trial“I’m so disappointed for the plant,” says Matthews. “It’s such a pity.”Raised in Darlington, Matthews\u0026nbspdescribes himself as a “manufacturing guy through and through” with more than 30 years’ experience in the car industry.A toolmaker by trade, he is also one of the northeast’s most prominent business leaders, awarded an MBE in 2014 for the many years he has spent promoting the region.\u0026nbspWas Brexit behind Nissan’s decision not to build the X-Trail here?Before his resignation last month, he held the top job at\u0026nbspNifco, which designs and builds plastics components, and relies on Nissan for a quarter of its UK sales.In his view, the type of Brexit currently being pursued by Theresa May’s government damages the prospects not just for the UK’s biggest and most productive car factory but also the futures of tens of thousands of young people.“Nissan is such a fantastic organisation,” says Matthews. “What you don’t often hear about is the tens of thousands of people that Nissan has trained who have moved on and helped to build other companies.“As well as a car plant, they have become a talent factory. We need more companies like that in the UK because one of our biggest problems is a lack of skills. It is such a massive issue.”Created with Sketch. Show all 12Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Matthews is a clear example of how the talent factory spreads opportunities far beyond Nissan’s walls and all along the sprawling supply chain down to smaller firms that support close to 40,000 jobs between them.\u0026nbspHis own career has grown alongside Nissan’s presence in Sunderland, a city that is home to some of the UK’s most deprived areas. His apprenticeship at Nifco began\u0026nbspshortly after Nissan opened up its UK plant to great fanfare in 1986.Back then, Nissan had grown rapidly in its home market and sought to export the Japanese car industry’s hyper-efficient, just-in-time manufacturing model to Europe. Now that process is in danger of going into reverse.The Sunderland plant built 5,000 cars in its first year and employed 500 people. With the new X-Trail, that was to have grown to more than 600,000 cars and more than 7,000 employees.\u0026nbspSunderland was to have become, in Nissan’s words, a “super-plant”.The X-Trail decision may make little long-term difference to Nissan, which has plants all over the world. But its smaller suppliers across the northeast will forgo future growth much-needed jobs will not be created money will not be invested.Created with Sketch.

Towards the end of these cycles\u0026nbspdecisions are made about the production of the next iteration.He points out that more investment decisions will be made as models reach the end of their lives, meaning that the full impact of Brexit on manufacturing will not be known for some time. At this point it\u0026nbspis simple enough for a global company to choose one of its other sites.Japan’s freshly inked free trade deal with the EU means that by 2027 its car exports into the world’s largest single market will face zero tariffs compared to the 10 per cent the UK will face.Nissan is not alone. Jaguar Land Rover last year announced it would transfer production of the Discovery from the West Midlands to Slovakia, which, being\u0026nbspinside the EU, has tariff-free access.Just as opportunity cascades down the supply chain so does the negative impact of decisions like these, a fact which Matthews is keenly aware of.\u0026nbspIt’s been more than two years since Nissan announced it would make the X-Trail in Sunderland and many companies will have built their businesses and their sales forecasts around the decision, he says.“Now they will have gaps in their manufacturing that they have to fill somehow, which will be a huge challenge. They will have to look to other manufacturers.”That will of course prove difficult as other firms,\u0026nbspincluding JLR\u0026nbspand Ford, have scaled back their workforces in the UK amid continuing uncertainty not just around Brexit but diesel emissions too.Going the other way up the supply chain, the Port of Tyne’s chief executive Matthew Beeton is concerned by Nissan’s decision. The lack of clarity around Brexit means it “remains difficult to plan and invest for in the medium to long term – impacting on ... ports, business and indeed the wider economic position both regionally and nationally”,\u0026nbsphe said.Despite the risks, Matthews understands why many shop floor workers still want to leave the EU and he insists that the UK’s decision to do so must be respected.“I’ve spoken to a lot of people on the shop floor. Many\u0026nbspof them want to come out of the EU regardless.“They are very frustrated with our relationship with Europe. The majority of those on the shop floor want to leave.“The\u0026nbsppeople\u0026nbspwho are faced with managing global businesses take a different view.”He blames the EU for the current\u0026nbsplack of certainty on Brexit as much\u0026nbspas the UK government.\u0026nbsp“I voted remain and I have been very open about that but I also respect democracy. To protect manufacturing we need some form of customs union, but not at any cost.“The way we have been treated by the EU in the negotiations has led to an\u0026nbspincrease in nationalist tendencies that is causing big rifts that will still be here 10, 20, 30 years down the line.”Ministers condemned for hiding £61m aid package for NissanIn the more immediate term, Brexit is due to go ahead next month and manufacturers\u0026nbspare still a long way short of being ready.“How can you prepare when you don’t know what you are preparing for? We are coming out in a matter of weeks and we still don’t know.”The kind of just-in-time manufacturing operated by the UK car industry requires companies having stock on hand, Matthews explains. “But companies don’t know the lead times that they’re going to face after Brexit.\u0026nbsp“How can any business plan for that? It is a nightmare.”A lot of firms are building up stocks as much as they can to prepare for no deal but the other side of that is they spend a huge amount of money on warehousing which may have been wasted, says Matthews.With all of these problems to face, will other manufacturers follow Nissan and JLR by starting to shift production of certain models elsewhere?Matthews won’t be drawn.“If we come out of the EU and secure some kind of customs union that will be very good news for UK manufacturing,” says Matthews. “But I don’t have a crystal ball.”\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The Serbian guard commanders say they will open fire if they do. It’s Alex’s first operation and his group is vastly outnumbered on either side and so can’t physically drive the warring factions apart.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trial“Over 48 hours we had to persuade the Kosovans not to attempt a border break and the Serbians not to shoot,” he says. “I had my troops and the Serbians looking to me. I had to keep strong. I had to keep alert and focus on the end result.”The Serbians didn’t shoot and the Kosovans retreated, teaching him the importance of keeping calm which probably isn’t taught in business studies courses but really should be.After seven years of service, which included further tours of Macedonia and Iraq, Alex returned to his native Inverness and in 2015 set up a breakfast cereal business called FUEL10K, hoping to capitalise on the trend among younger customers to ditch conventional square boxed options.His 32-strong product range includes drinks in squeezable pouches, porridge pots and cookies and are stocked in Tesco, Asda, Sainsburys and Waitrose. Every year has seen double digit growth with sales now at £8m this year and expected to hit £10m next, all from a standing start and no outside investment. Last year he was named Entrepreneur of the Year by Heropreneurs, an organisation encouraging armed forces veterans to go into business on return to civilian life.The encouraging reality of corporate social responsibilityIt’s often said we can judge a country by how well it treats its prisoners. But how we treat our veterans is equally revealing, perhaps more so, given around 4 per cent of the prison population is made up of ex-military.Alex’s journey is a remarkable one, sadly not shared by many. Having worked with Help for Heroes and Combat Stress for a number of years, I’ve heard too many stories of returning servicemen being unprepared to come back to what they left often many years ago, beginning a cycle of family breakdown, homelessness, alcoholism, drugs, crime and imprisonment. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) means for many their only weekly activity is a counselling session.Sometimes crime and homelessness are ing factors to join the armed forces in the first place.“By the time I joined the army aged 21, I had lived on the streets aged 16, ran my first business, been on the run from the police for defrauding banks and catalogues, done drugs and employed a drug dealer,” Nick Wilson tells me.In the army he found he had a family who always looked out for each other. But in 2013, on return, he set up a chauffeur company which, while successful, left him with the feeling that many business owners face of isolation: “What got me through the really bad times was that sense of survival – knowing real hard times, horrendous, shit situations experienced whilst on operational tour, those that put life in perspective. The gritted, dogged determination that you needed to get through those days, weeks, months is what will get you through business.”After two years Nick sold his business for a profit just around the time he was diagnosed with PTSD. “I was having suicidal thoughts, the pain from my spinal injury was becoming a real problem with the meds and their side-effects causing me to lose grip on reality.”In 2016 he suffered a nervous breakdown but after rehabilitation was determined not to let mental health issues ruin his life. He set up Working Minds Matter – a consultancy firm helping business with mental wellbeing in the workplace.“I think it is important for a veteran who is looking to go into business for themselves to have a better understanding of who they are as a person, what makes them who they are, their values, their beliefs, their strengths and weaknesses. They are no longer a part of a large family unit, having to follow another leader or manager, working for an organisation’s values and beliefs rather than those of their own.”I first met Nick at an event Dragons Den star Peter Jones organised last summer at Buckingham University where 20 businesspeople speed mentored hundreds of schoolkids from around the country who all had entrepreneurial dreams.Our collective worry was that the education system would slowly sap that out of them. I observed\u0026nbspto Nick was that the army instils leadership skills and\u0026nbspI was surprised that there weren’t more veteran-owned businesses.Nick\u0026nbspthen put out a competition to his network to a make a short video presentation of their emerging or aspirant business idea and the most compelling one would win a year’s mentoring with me.Created with Sketch.The new army recruitment posters Show all 6Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The winner, Rob Dennison, joined the army in 2004, serving partly in Afghanistan. He still has recurring nightmares from when he visited the Helmand Province where he came across a child prostitution racket with many children lying dead. “When I returned I realised I’d gone from a high adrenalin career to nothing,” he says.He told his girlfriend that once he’d got into trouble for brewing some coffee when out on patrol and she convinced him to start his own coffee business which he’s called The 50cal Coffee Company. It will be a social enterprise – a series of cafes where veterans can not only get his own blends and brews but also have the opportunity to talk to someone in private about the problems they are facing, starting in his home town of Lincoln.In America there is much bigger public support for veterans and veteran-owned businesses than we have here. I’m hoping my year with Rob will help him get off the ground and get wider buy-in from the rest of us.It’s not just about what people like Alex, Nick and Rob have done for us in their past in the services but also for what they are able to do for us in the next phase of their lives.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

And few can have more first-hand experience of the danger posed to that progress by Brexit.This week, Nissan U-turned on its decision to build the new X-Trail at its Sunderland plant.\u0026nbspFor Matthews, who worked his way up from an apprenticeship to become managing director at a key Nissan supplier, it hit close to home.\u0026nbspA\u0026nbsp£61m package of taxpayer-funded sweeteners offered to Nissan by the government proved not to be enough to counter the financial reality of investing in post-Brexit\u0026nbspBritain, the shape of which remains deeply uncertain. Despite its earlier assurances, the company crunched the numbers and decided it now made sense\u0026nbspto build its\u0026nbspnew model in Japan instead.\u0026nbspFor exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trial“I’m so disappointed for the plant,” says Matthews. “It’s such a pity.”Raised in Darlington, Matthews\u0026nbspdescribes himself as a “manufacturing guy through and through” with more than 30 years’ experience in the car industry.A toolmaker by trade, he is also one of the northeast’s most prominent business leaders, awarded an MBE in 2014 for the many years he has spent promoting the region.\u0026nbspWas Brexit behind Nissan’s decision not to build the X-Trail here?Before his resignation last month, he held the top job at\u0026nbspNifco, which designs and builds plastics components, and relies on Nissan for a quarter of its UK sales.In his view, the type of Brexit currently being pursued by Theresa May’s government damages the prospects not just for the UK’s biggest and most productive car factory but also the futures of tens of thousands of young people.“Nissan is such a fantastic organisation,” says Matthews. “What you don’t often hear about is the tens of thousands of people that Nissan has trained who have moved on and helped to build other companies.“As well as a car plant, they have become a talent factory. We need more companies like that in the UK because one of our biggest problems is a lack of skills. It is such a massive issue.”Created with Sketch. Show all 12Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Matthews is a clear example of how the talent factory spreads opportunities far beyond Nissan’s walls and all along the sprawling supply chain down to smaller firms that support close to 40,000 jobs between them.\u0026nbspHis own career has grown alongside Nissan’s presence in Sunderland, a city that is home to some of the UK’s most deprived areas. His apprenticeship at Nifco began\u0026nbspshortly after Nissan opened up its UK plant to great fanfare in 1986.Back then, Nissan had grown rapidly in its home market and sought to export the Japanese car industry’s hyper-efficient, just-in-time manufacturing model to Europe. Now that process is in danger of going into reverse.The Sunderland plant built 5,000 cars in its first year and employed 500 people. With the new X-Trail, that was to have grown to more than 600,000 cars and more than 7,000 employees.\u0026nbspSunderland was to have become, in Nissan’s words, a “super-plant”.The X-Trail decision may make little long-term difference to Nissan, which has plants all over the world. But its smaller suppliers across the northeast will forgo future growth much-needed jobs will not be created money will not be invested.Created with Sketch.

Towards the end of these cycles\u0026nbspdecisions are made about the production of the next iteration.He points out that more investment decisions will be made as models reach the end of their lives, meaning that the full impact of Brexit on manufacturing will not be known for some time. At this point it\u0026nbspis simple enough for a global company to choose one of its other sites.Japan’s freshly inked free trade deal with the EU means that by 2027 its car exports into the world’s largest single market will face zero tariffs compared to the 10 per cent the UK will face.Nissan is not alone. Jaguar Land Rover last year announced it would transfer production of the Discovery from the West Midlands to Slovakia, which, being\u0026nbspinside the EU, has tariff-free access.Just as opportunity cascades down the supply chain so does the negative impact of decisions like these, a fact which Matthews is keenly aware of.\u0026nbspIt’s been more than two years since Nissan announced it would make the X-Trail in Sunderland and many companies will have built their businesses and their sales forecasts around the decision, he says.“Now they will have gaps in their manufacturing that they have to fill somehow, which will be a huge challenge. They will have to look to other manufacturers.”That will of course prove difficult as other firms,\u0026nbspincluding JLR\u0026nbspand Ford, have scaled back their workforces in the UK amid continuing uncertainty not just around Brexit but diesel emissions too.Going the other way up the supply chain, the Port of Tyne’s chief executive Matthew Beeton is concerned by Nissan’s decision. The lack of clarity around Brexit means it “remains difficult to plan and invest for in the medium to long term – impacting on ... ports, business and indeed the wider economic position both regionally and nationally”,\u0026nbsphe said.Despite the risks, Matthews understands why many shop floor workers still want to leave the EU and he insists that the UK’s decision to do so must be respected.“I’ve spoken to a lot of people on the shop floor. Many\u0026nbspof them want to come out of the EU regardless.“They are very frustrated with our relationship with Europe. The majority of those on the shop floor want to leave.“The\u0026nbsppeople\u0026nbspwho are faced with managing global businesses take a different view.”He blames the EU for the current\u0026nbsplack of certainty on Brexit as much\u0026nbspas the UK government.\u0026nbsp“I voted remain and I have been very open about that but I also respect democracy. To protect manufacturing we need some form of customs union, but not at any cost.“The way we have been treated by the EU in the negotiations has led to an\u0026nbspincrease in nationalist tendencies that is causing big rifts that will still be here 10, 20, 30 years down the line.”Ministers condemned for hiding £61m aid package for NissanIn the more immediate term, Brexit is due to go ahead next month and manufacturers\u0026nbspare still a long way short of being ready.“How can you prepare when you don’t know what you are preparing for? We are coming out in a matter of weeks and we still don’t know.”The kind of just-in-time manufacturing operated by the UK car industry requires companies having stock on hand, Matthews explains. “But companies don’t know the lead times that they’re going to face after Brexit.\u0026nbsp“How can any business plan for that? It is a nightmare.”A lot of firms are building up stocks as much as they can to prepare for no deal but the other side of that is they spend a huge amount of money on warehousing which may have been wasted, says Matthews.With all of these problems to face, will other manufacturers follow Nissan and JLR by starting to shift production of certain models elsewhere?Matthews won’t be drawn.“If we come out of the EU and secure some kind of customs union that will be very good news for UK manufacturing,” says Matthews. “But I don’t have a crystal ball.”\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Where are they going?A new survey has revealed what Britons hate the most about LondonThe cost of living in every part of the world in one infographicThe ‘Northern pound’ is “essentially a difference in the cost of living”, Mr Johnes said, and the fact that money goes further outside the capital explains why more than half (53 per cent) of Londoners said they would move away from the city and accept a lower salary elsewhere, while just 31 per cent in the North said they would consider moving. This benefits both jobseekers and employers, Mr Johnes said, because companies will find it easier to hire staff and workers will find their money goes further, even if they are being paid a smaller amount. “So it’s a win for consumers and a win for businesses,” he said. Martin Talbot, director at Totaljobs, added: “Gone are the days where a salary is enough to secure the best talent today’s jobseekers are increasingly valuing work-life balance and their wellbeing above all else. “Northern cities are seeing a rise in job opportunities as UK companies no longer think the capital is the be all and end all. Many northern cities offer lots of other advantages too, from a shorter (and cheaper) commute, great cultural scene, and a more affordable social life. “No matter where they’re based, it’s key for businesses to highlight not just their employer brand, but the lifestyle their local area can provide existing and potential employees.”However, the researchers noted that London is unlikely to be abandoned by UK workers. “London will be fine, London is still a great place to live. It has been and will continue to be a centre of gravity,” said Mr Johnes. The survey also revealed that Londoners have different priorities for spending, with 16 per cent of people living in the city taking five or more holidays per year, compared with 9 per cent in the North.cost of livingOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

What has swayed me over the last two years to fully back the Brexit vision is the immense opportunities that are available from global trade, and for the ability for Britain to be an outward looking nation in control of our own destiny once again. “I fear that this agreement at Chequers damages those opportunities that being tied to EU regulations, and the EU tying our hands when seeking to make new trade agreements, will be the worst of all worlds if we do not deliver Brexit in spirit as well as in name, then we are handing Jeremy Corbyn the keys to No10.”910 Robert Courts - Resigned from Parliamentary Private Secretary role1010 Scott Mann - Resigned from Parliamentary Private Secretary roleJuly 2018 - resigned over May\u0027s Chequers plan. I fear elements of the Brexit white paper will inevitably put me in direct conflict with the views expressed by a large section of my constituents. I am not prepared to compromise their wishes to deliver a watered-down Brexit.“The last three months have seen the economy slip into its weakest growth spell for six years, and indicate that GDP likely stagnated at the start of 2019 after eking out modest growth of just 0.1 per cent\u0026nbspin the fourth quarter.”Duncan Brock of the\u0026nbspChartered Institute of Procurement \u0026amp Supply, which sponsors the survey, said Brexit was the main culprit.“At the risk of sounding like a broken record, Brexit uncertainty continues to be at the\u0026nbspheart of the malaise as clients delayed orders and consumers were deeply reluctant to spend under the continuing cloud of hesitation, indecision and ambiguity.”The PMI for the sector\u0026nbspcovers businesses such as hotels, restaurants, transport and finance, although not retail.It also showed that in January services firms reduced jobs for the first time since 2012.UK GDP grew by 0.6 per cent in the third quarter of 2018. The figure for the final quarter, released next week, is expected to show a slump to 0.2 per cent.The PMIs for January are consistent, on a historic basis, with flatlining GDP in the first quarter of 2019.Fifth of big firms have already moved operations abroad due to BrexitSome analysts said that might be misleading, however.“Since 2004, the rate of GDP growth implied by the PMIs has been wide of the mark by an average of 0.3 percentage points,” said Samuel Tombs of Pantheon.“They were far too downbeat immediately after the referendum, suggesting that they tend to overstate the impact of political uncertainty on the economy. They also pointed to downturns in activity in 1998, 2001 and 2003 that failed to materialise.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It’s also worth limiting who can find your Facebook profile with your number and email address. 49 Control access to your TimelineYou can limit who gets to post things on your Timeline and who gets to see posts on your Timeline too. In Settings, go to Timeline and Tagging and edit the sections you want to lock down. When you block someone, they won’t be able to see things you post on your Timeline, tag you, invite you to events or groups, start conversations with you or add you as a friend. To do it, go to Settings and Blocking. Annoyingly, you have to block people on Messenger separately. One of Facebook’s handiest privacy features is the ability to review posts you’re tagged in before they appear on your Timeline. They’ll still be visible on the News Feed while they’re fresh, but won’t be tied to your profile forever. In Timeline and Tagging, enable Timeline review controls. 79 Clean up your appsYou can view a list of all of the apps you’ve connected to your Facebook account by going to Settings and Apps.

There will be an option to report people to avoid users sending then removing harmful messages, for instance.It mirrors a tool that is available in other apps including Facebook\u0027s own WhatsApp. On that app, messages can be deleted for much longer after they are sent, allowing people more than an hour – though it was much shorter initially.Mark Zuckerberg tries to defend Facebook on its birthdayMark Zuckerberg has also had access to a similar feature for some time. Facebook claims the boss\u0027s messages disappear over time to ensure they are kept safing, citing security issues such as the major Sony hack.But users complained that it appeared to be unfair that only they were given the option of deleting messages after the fact. When it became clear Mr Zuckerberg was receiving special treatment, the company announced he would have limited access to the feature that and that such a tool would be rolled out in the coming months.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

In the same year, the company\u0027s shares dropped 30 per cent.\u0026nbspJosie Cox\u0026nbspexplains how\u0026nbspit got there and where it\u0027s going nextClick to followThe IndependentApple Park, the new headquarters in Cupertino designed by Lord Norman Foster, cost roughly $5bn, and will house 13,000 employees when everyone has moved inFor an interview published in the\u0026nbspFinancial Times\u0026nbspback in 2006, journalist Richard Waters hauled himself to a nondescript corner of the Californian city of San Jose to meet with a corpulent computer scientist called Steve. As Richard walked into a vinyl-clad diner called The Hickory Pit, Steve sat –\u0026nbspbearded and burly – hunched over some sort of hand-held device, engrossed in a game of Tetris.The setting of the interview was unusual for the FT. The salmon pink daily is more widely known for its profiles of the buffed and manicured business elite, lounging in grand villas, chalets and penthouse pads, preferably in Davos or Cannes. But Steve – eating cherry pie in a washed-out T-shirt – had certainly earned his column inches: 30\u0026nbspyears earlier, together with another Steve and an electronics industry worker called Ronald, the Hickory Pit’s favourite tech geek created what would later become the world’s largest publicly traded company. For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialHis unremarkable appearance and the profoundly mundane setting of his encounter with the FT, convey a banality neatly reflected in the origins of the very firm he was instrumental in founding: An experimental three-man band (the original start-up, if you will) that took a crazy punt on a simple motherboard and now has more cash than the vast majority of countries.Apple was founded on 1 April 1976 by the late Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak and Ronald Wayne in Cupertino. It wormed its way on to the tech scene with a creation named the Apple I, a computer designed and built by Tetris-loving Wozniak, and sold for the ominous sum of $666.66 – or about $2,900 in today’s inflation-adjusted money. Unremarkably, the name reportedly stems from Jobs’ fondness of the humble fruit.Less than a year later, the company was incorporated. Wayne had already jumped ship, having sold his stake in the group for the paltry sum of $800, but –\u0026nbspunhampered by the exit of a third of its staff –\u0026nbspApple’s operational revenues were heading north. According to media reports, they almost doubled every four months during the first five years of the company operating. Between September 1977 and the same month in 1980, sales increased by more than 500 per cent, on average annually.Apple’s mysterious new charger might be about to arriveThe Apple II and Apple III followed, and the company’s success grew with every launch. On 12 December 12 1980 it listed on the stock exchange, publicly floating around 4.6 million shares at $22 apiece. The offering turned scores of Apple’s early employees into instant millionaires. Shares in the company ended the day at $29 each, giving Jobs a net worth of well over $200 million. He was 25 at the time.In 1984, Apple launched the Macintosh. Its debut was marked with a high-budget neo-noir dystopian commercial, aired during that year’s Super Bowl and directed by Bladerunner’s Ridley Scott. The release was hailed a watershed moment not just for the tech world, but also for the advertising industry. Already then Apple was inventing itself as a generation-defining, industry straddling brand a firm that challenged the status quo and confronted the norm ruthlessly.Though Jobs and Wozniak both left the company in the mid-1980s amid disputes with management, predominantly over strategy, Apple’s success initially continued untarnished.In 1991 the company created the PowerBook, presenting a blueprint for all modern laptops. That same year it launched System 7, adding colour to the interface. But not all its products proved a hit. The company was struggling to tap into its client base and it was failing to gain traction with its strategy of marketing high-end products with a high price – dubbed the High-Right Policy – while simultaneously battling heavyweight rivals, like Microsoft, which in many cases were offering similar technology at a vastly smaller price.By 1997, marred by constant leadership change, an unclear approach to the market and a series of painful restructuring exercises, Apple was forced to choose between sticking to its poorly performing guns or risking a dramatic high-stakes turnaround. It chose the latter. It snapped up NeXT, – Jobs’ new venture – for $429 million and scrapped the High-Right Policy. Shortly after, it launched the iMac G3, an affordable machine with a quirky, futuristic look that jarred with Apple’s previous designs, but spoke to a new generation of tech-savvy, progressive professionals. The move proved a lifeline for the financially bruised group and catapulted it into a new era. Apple computers were no longer just the tools of businessmen and accountants, but the product of choice for students, designers and artists. It had won over the creative elite and would continue to claim there support for many years to come.Jobs, who had returned to Apple as an adviser in early 1997, assumed the position of interim CEO when Gilbert Frank Amelio, the company’s boss since February 1996, was pushed out for overseeing several quarters of lacklustre earnings. And it was at this time too that Jonathan Ive joined the upper echelons of management, injecting fresh energy into the brand and later designing the decade-defining iPod and iPad.\u0026nbspThe 2000s were a period of revival for Apple, which the company kicked off with a wild buying spree. It snapped up a portfolio of corporations, including a DVD authoring platform and a music software group. In May 2001, doors to its first retail stores opened and it debuted the iPod, of which more than 100 million were sold over the subsequent six years. The iTunes Store launched in 2003. Within just two years it was the world’s largest music retailer. The MacPro, MacBook, and MacBook Pro hit the market with resounding success, marking the dawn of Apple’s gradual shift away from computers and towards the future of portable consumer electronics.At the Macworld Expo on January 9 2007, Jobs announced the launch of the iPhone of which hundreds of thousands were sold within hours. A year later the App Store was introduced, allowing users to buy third-party applications for their devices and generating millions of dollars of revenue within its own right.\u0026nbspIn 2010, shortly after Jobs took his first medical leave of absence, Apple introduced the iPad which was met with massive demand globally, helping the company’s market capitalisation eclipse that of arch rival Microsoft for the first time in over two decades. The iPhone 4 was released in June of that year, offering a range of new features, including video calling, and sporting a now iconic stainless steel design. The iPod Nano, iPod Touch and iPod Shuffle were also relaunched and the MacBook Air was updated, powering Apple to the top of the list of the world’s most valuable consumer brands.In dire contrast to his professional success though, Jobs’ health was deteriorating. In January 2011 he announced to staff that he would be taking another period of leave of indefinite length, handing the reigns to chief operating officer Tim Cook.\u0026nbspIn August 2011 he officially resigned as CEO. He passed away in October in Palo Alto, succumbing to a rare and aggressive form of pancreatic cancer. Jobs was 56 years old.In many ways, Apple’s post-Jobs years were an era of superlatives. Thanks largely to the launch of the iPhone4S and iPhone 5, and later the iPad mini, Apple’s market value in 2012 soared to an unprecedented $624bn, beating the previous record set by Microsoft. It used that financial momentum to further its quest to ersify into newfangled fields like augmented reality and artificial intelligence. It also remained fiercely committed to design and in 2013 recruited the former CEO of Yves Saint Laurent, as well as former Burberry executive Angela Ahrendts to oversee its digital strategy.Why Apple plans to stop putting a number on iPhone salesApple boss says data is being ‘weaponised with military efficiency’Tim Cook responds after Apple becomes first trillion-dollar companyThe company became a staple on lists of the world’s most valuable, best-known and influential brands. By January 2016 a billion Apple devices were reported to be in active use around the world. It moved into smart home technology and ride-sharing, through its investment in Chinese Uber rival Didi Chuxing. It bought Shazam, a music recognition service, launched its own video unit and signed a content partnership with Oprah Winfrey. Several series are reportedly in development as well as a film. Elsewhere collaborations with Hermes and Nike spurred sales of the Apple Watch, and in October 2018 it launched the twelfth generation of the iPhone. Its slogan? “Brilliant. In every way”.In\u0026nbsp2018, Apple became the first company in history to have a market value in excess of $1 trillion, an amount greater than the gross domestic product of most countries in the world, including TurkeyIn late summer 2018, Apple became the first company in history to have a market value in excess of $1 trillion, an amount greater than the gross domestic product of most countries in the world, including Turkey, the Netherlands, Saudi Arabia and Sweden.\u0026nbspEmployment hit more than\u0026nbsp90,000 and, according to some reports, the company has more readily deployable cash than the US Treasury. The combined wealth of the world’s 10\u0026nbsprichest people – a list that includes Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, financier Warren Buffett, and Facebook founder Mark Zuckergerg – doesn’t even come close to the size of Apple’s market capitalisation.The “too big to fail” economic theory prescribes that some organisations, particularly banks, are so large and influential, that their failure would be catastrophic for the broader economy. Apple is undoubtedly one of those organisations, and in the last few months of 2018 markets were offered a taste of what that could actually mean.Shares peaked around the launch of the latest iPhone, and started trending lower shortly thereafter. Between early October and the end of the year, Apple’s shares lost more than 30 per cent of their value, taking them to below $160 from a peak of over $230 just a week earlier, and dragging swathes of the broader stock market with them.Analysts said that investors were falling out of love with the name for a slew of reasons. Product sales were slowing and consumers were becoming more sensitive to prices amid fears of an impending economic downturn. After reporting a set of quarterly results on 1 November\u0026nbspthat reflected a weakening in crucial emerging markets, Apple’s shares fell by 7 per cent in a single day wiping an estimated $70 billion off the group’s value.Executives at the time said that they would stop providing quarterly updates for the number of iPhones, iPads and Mac computers sold, unnerving investors further. The cost of new products also spawned worries, with the average selling price of iPhones climbing to $793 during the final quarter of 2018.After reporting quarterly results that reflected a weakening in emerging markets, Apple’s shares fell by 7 per cent, wiping $70 billuon off the group’s value“Our worry is there must be a limit to Apple’s pricing power,” George Salmon, an analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, told Reuters at the time. “The group is now charging close to $800 per phone, and while that’s helping revenues climb despite flat sales volumes, one has to wonder how the strategy to shimmy up the price ladder fares in a downturn. If consumers start feeling the pinch, those price tags could put the punters off.”Analyst Chaim Siegel at Elazar Advisors told the agency that trade issues between China and the US are also threatening to throw a ner in the works if they make it hard for Apple to get the supplies it needs. “As for emerging markets slowing, that’s also contagion from China. Both trade war issues coming to reality,” he said.Elsewhere analysts at Bank of America Merrill Lynch slashed their recommendation on the stock to “neutral” from “buy”, explaining that they are “incrementally concerned that not all the weakness is captured in the near-term” and that there are likely to be “further negative estimate revisions” to Apple’s financials. Analysts at Goldman Sachs cut their share price target on the stock repeatedly.Others have shown concern about the company’s emphasis on its services business: ApplePay, Apple Music and the App store. Potential for growth is undoubtedly there, but the company has yet to share concrete plans about its strategy going forward and how it intends to keep growing.\u0026nbspNot helping the situation, Tim Cook in early January wrote a letter to shareholders in which he announced that Apple’s results for the quarter that ended on 29 December\u0026nbsp2018 were likely to be worse than previously anticipated. Cook cited the unforeseen “magnitude” of the economic slowdown in markets such as\u0026nbspChina. The profit warning was Apple’s first since 2002 and dealt a fresh hefty blow to the share price, as well as the performance of dozens of smaller suppliers and competitors whose fate is closely linked to that of Apple. It also sent shockwaves through broader financial markets, sending stocks – which are generally considered a fairly risky asset – sharply lower in most regions and driving demand for perceived safe havens, like gold and Japan’s yen. The sell-off was a dramatic reminder of the sheer scale of the Apple ecosystem. If Apple sneezes many parts of the financial system will most certainly catch a cold.Since then Apple shares have continued to trade sideways, keeping the company’s market capitalisation well below that psychologically significant $1\u0026nbsptrillion\u0026nbspmark and raising questions about how much more correcting still needs to be done, before – or if – the trajectory can turn.So what will 2019 hold for the company which is no longer quite the world’s largest (having\u0026nbsprelinquished that role to Microsoft and Amazon)? Opinions are ided. While many experts who have been tracking the stock for years predict this to be a turning point, others consider it more of a blip.“When we get into these situations where the current product may not be moving as well as investors expected, some get scared and then the fear compounds itself,” Jason Benowitz, a senior portfolio manager at Roosevelt Investors, told Bloomberg. “We’re not really too concerned. Some of this is probably just noise like it always is.”Also speaking to the news agency, Ross Gerber, co-founder of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth \u0026amp Investment Management, described the climate of fear around Apple as “absurd”. “It doesn’t make any sense. It’s a solid business even if it’s not going to grow as much as it did,” he said.Apple is still hugely profitable. It’s sitting on well over $200 billion of cash, and shares – despite their recent brutal tumble – have roughly doubled in the past five years. The omnipresence of Apple devices across the planet also suggests that if the company’s heyday really is over, then its decline would likely be glacial rather than sudden. It simply has too many dependents, both in the corporate world and the consumer world, to swiftly fizzle out.As for Wozniak, the smiley 68-year old with a penchant for pie and Tetris, is unperturbed the ultimate bull, in market parlance. In an interview with CNBC at the end of last year, he said that Jobs would be proud of what Apple had become. Speaking of rivals, like Samsung, Wozniak said that they don’t present a real threat. They’re not innovating, he explained. They’re simply creating “fun features”. Apple, meanwhile, is concentrating on innovations that “literally affect everything we do all the time in life”.If Wozniak is right, then Apple’s dominance is far from over. Technology famously knows no limits and it’s increasingly evident that consumer appetite hardly does either. We want lives that are interconnected, homes that are smarter than us, phones that manage our whole existence and privacy that is safeguarded unconditionally.Amid all this, the most serious challenge for Apple will be to keep up with contracting attention s. In a world of instant gratification, it’s becoming clear that he who fails to innovate is lost. Perhaps, just perhaps, that will prove Apple’s greatest obstacle yet.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Debate in the European parliament is a joke. Neither system is perfect, but they can learn from each other, writes Jon Stone\u0026nbspClick to followThe IndependentFarage and Jean-Claude Juncker: the former Ukip leader is a master of the grandstand-to-viral-video formulaThis is not the House of Commons, this is the European parliament.” These were the words deputy speaker Mairead McGuinness used on Wednesday to tell off former Ukip MEPs shouting down another member during a debate in Brussels.The Brexit crisis has put the House of Commons in the international spotlight more than ever, and the chamber ides opinion. To some like McGuiness, the Commons’ boisterous atmosphere and over-the-top shouting is a sign that MPs do not take things things seriously. It is criticised as being an archaic, hostile environment that disadvantages anyone who doesn’t take a macro approach to politics – often women.Others speak highly of the drama of Britain’s mother of parliaments and sigh wearily at the dour debates in other legislatures like the European parliament. Many foreign observers who watch the Commons for the first time are captivated. An amazed American friend once genuinely asked me whether he was watching footage “from a movie”. Prime minister’s questions features regularly on US political channel C-Span and makes far more appearances there than any other foreign legislature – because it is so watchable.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialI covered Westminster for years and made the jump to Brussels in 2017. I arrived with high expectations of the European parliament, expecting a modern legislature that was rationally designed rather than evolved through the centuries. Not every expectation was met: after a year and a half of working in the EU capital I believe Brussels is better than Westminster in some respects – but worse in others.Let’s start with the bad: what passes for “debate” in Brussels is a joke, and beyond awful. In Westminster the format for asking questions to a minister is designed to put them on the ropes – they get quizzed by their opposition counterpart and have to give an answer immediately after they are asked. Then there are follow-ups. Backbenchers can raise questions afterwards. If the minister doesn’t give good answers, they look stupid or evasive. It is not uncommon for answers to be newsworthy sometimes unintentionally.Drop Brexit red lines to ‘avoid backstop’, EU parliament to urgeNot so in Brussels: first, MEPs ask their questions. Then, after all the questions have been asked, the commissioner does a single summing up speech in response where he picks the questions he likes and pretends uncomfortable ones didn’t exist. There is practically zero scrutiny applied, and the system incentivises MEPs to do a piece of grandstanding to camera, so their clip can be shared on Facebook later and get 17 likes.\u0026nbspSome MEPs are better at exploiting this dynamic than others. Pro-Europeans in the UK would do well to remember that it was the European parliament, not Westminster, that gave Nigel Farage his platform to rail against the EU. The former Ukip leader is a master at the grandstand-to-viral-video formula: one extended clip of him insulting former European Council president Herman Van Rompuy (“You have all the charisma of a damp rag and the appearance of a low-grade bank clerk.”) is perhaps the single most popular clip in the history of the Parliament. It has several million views across dozens of different uploads on YouTube and other streaming sites and made Farage an overnight celebrity across the world – catching the eyes of US news channels where he is now a regular fixture and an ally of Donald Trump.Created with Sketch.The Royal Gallery, Houses of Parliament — in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.India\u0027s Prime Minister Narendra Modi addresses members of parliament and invited guests in the Royal Gallery Queen Elizabeth II  is accompanied by Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh as they proceed through the Royal Gallery before the State Opening of Parliament in the House of LordsGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel addresses both Houses of Parliament in the Royal Gallery of the Palace of Westminster in 2014.The Royal Gallery during the State Opening of Parliament in the House of LordsChina\u0027s President, Xi Jinping addresses MPs and peers in Parliament\u0027s Royal Gallery in 2015.Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi delivers a speech in the Royal Gallery in the Houses of Parliament as Britain\u0027s Speaker of the House of Commons John Bercow listens Yeoman of the Guard, wearing traditional uniform walk through the Royal Gallery during the ceremonial search before the State Opening of Parliament in the House of LordsIndia\u0027s Prime Minister Narendra Modi addresses members of parliament and invited guests in the Royal Gallery at the Houses of Parliamen in 2015.India\u0027s Prime Minister Narendra Modi addresses members of parliament and invited guests in the Royal Gallery Queen Elizabeth II  is accompanied by Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh as they proceed through the Royal Gallery before the State Opening of Parliament in the House of LordsGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel addresses both Houses of Parliament in the Royal Gallery of the Palace of Westminster in 2014.The Royal Gallery during the State Opening of Parliament in the House of LordsChina\u0027s President, Xi Jinping addresses MPs and peers in Parliament\u0027s Royal Gallery in 2015.Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi delivers a speech in the Royal Gallery in the Houses of Parliament as Britain\u0027s Speaker of the House of Commons John Bercow listens Yeoman of the Guard, wearing traditional uniform walk through the Royal Gallery during the ceremonial search before the State Opening of Parliament in the House of LordsIndia\u0027s Prime Minister Narendra Modi addresses members of parliament and invited guests in the Royal Gallery at the Houses of Parliamen in 2015.Furious rhetoric has become a cottage industry: other typical video titles include “‘Who the Hell do you Think You Are?’ Nigel Farage throws egg in Eurocrat faces”, “Nigel Farage: I want you all fired!” and “‘You Are a TERRIBLE Leader’ – Nigel Farage Tells Angela Merkel Everything To Her Face”. In some ways the dynamic of the parliament’s broken debates has undermined the European project itself and allowed shouty populists to differentiate themselves in a field where reasoned debate is always overshadowed by grandstanding.EU rules Gibraltar is ‘colony’ of BritainEU agrees to give UK visa-free travel even after no-deal BrexitJeremy Hardy’s best jokes: From Brexit to right wing hypocrisySenior Conservative latest to admit Brexit could be delayedThe minimal time allocated for debates in Brussels is also a serious problem that prevents serious discussion. Often, only the leaders of the European parliament’s political groups get time to speak – backbenchers are often omitted altogether, even on big issues. When regular MEPs do get a word in, it will only be a handful of them. Even the group leaders are regularly told by the chair to hurry up – we don’t have all day. A massive basketball-style clock with red lettering looms over MEPs telling them how much speaking time they have used.\u0026nbspThis is unforgiveable, and it need not be this\u0026nbspway. The limited speaking time is a function of the fact the parliament barely sits – the main chamber is usually in use for around four days a month, with occasional extra “extraordinary” sessions lasting two days. The Commons, by contrast, sits over twice as many days – even though MPs tend to have more intensive constituency duties than MEPs do. It would be easy to find more time for proper debates if only the parliament actually met more regularly.Westminster has its fair share of ridiculous spectacles: mock hostage-taking during the state opening of parliament, £80,000 animal skin parchments, and the magic mace (don’t pick it up!). But none of these traditions are as bizarre and disruptive as the monthly caravan of MEPs and their staff marching from Brussels to Strasbourg. For the unfamiliar: the European Parliament’s main offices are in Belgium’s capital, but because of a historical quirk and a whole lot of politics, it conducts most of its main sessions in France. To give you an idea of how sensible this is, the transport infrastructure between the cities is so poor that the fastest way is actually to go on the train via Paris (the parliament, in fact charters special TGVs from the French national railway company for some staff). If you’ve ever looked at a map you’ll appreciate that this makes no sense: Paris is 400km from Strasbourg, and not in the right direction.France has an effective veto on ending the practice, and even Emmanuel Macron, for all his alleged reforming zeal, wants to keep it. The situation is so inconvenient that the parliament’s secretariat actually offers to pay expenses for journalists to come to Strasbourg to encourage some to show up. It is, at least, a lovely city – certainly worth a visit or 12.It should be clear that the European parliament is absolutely not the ideal legislature of some British pro-Europeans’ imaginations. And yet, there is a lot that Westminster could learn from itIt should be clear that the European parliament is absolutely not the ideal legislature of some British pro-Europeans’ imaginations. And yet, there is a lot that Westminster could learn from it.\u0026nbspThe overall EU legislative process is notoriously long and convoluted, but the legislative scrutiny the parliament provides is generally very good: independent committees of MEPs and rapporteurs scrutinise laws coming from the commission and council, and all MEPs get a binding vote on their recommended changes, which are often substantial and well thought-out. Elections by proportional representation mean the commission presidency never really has an absolute single-party majority and the law-making process is genuinely consensual – it is harder to railroad through legislation than in the UK.\u0026nbspSome of the nuts and bolts of how the European parliament works are also very impressive to someone used to the 16th century practises still operating in the Commons. MEPs vote electronically, which means it takes about 10 seconds to process a vote. In Westminster a single amendment will take 15 minutes because all 650 MPs have to physically go and stand in a room together to be counted: the present system of having two ision lobbies dates back to 1835 but a similar system, which used only one lobby, dates back to at least 1584.You might think that the fact MEPs speak dozens of different languages from 28 countries would be a problem, but this is actually dealt with very well. The translation set-up is practically one of the wonders of the modern world – everyone can talk and listen to everyone else in their native language. Sometimes MEPs choose to speak in English: some are better than others, and the language barrier makes genuinely inspiring rhetoric sparse, though some does occasionally shine through.What will happen to Britain’s MEPs if Brexit is delayed?What Britain’s last ever MEPs are planning to do after BrexitIn many respects the European parliament is also far more open than Westminster. If you want to report on the House of Commons in person as a journalist, you need to be a member of the press gallery. This requires a parliamentary security pass, of which there are a limited number for journalists, with a set allocation for established publications. It is hard to get one, they are jealously guarded, and the whole system is very much a closed shop.\u0026nbspIn Brussels anyone who can prove they are a bone fide journalist can get a pass that gives them access to the EU institutions: a letter from your editor and samples of work will do. This thankfully made it easy for The Independent to set up shop here, but it also means there are far more freelancers, upstart publications, and smaller specialist outfits catering to interested audiences. Given the technical nature of a lot of legislation the EU deals with, having specialists on hand is crucial: it’s good for scrutiny, and it’s good for democracy. There has been some movement in the UK to allow new publications into the press gallery, but the issue is contentious and the process of who is allowed in is not always transparent.\u0026nbspSpecialist reporters are usually confined to newsrooms for lack of parliamentary passes – while in Brussels agricultural subsidy specialists wander the halls freely with financial services reporters and health policy correspondents.Created with Sketch.

This is not the case in Brussels: because of the way the EU is set up, the parliament plays second – or even third – fiddle to the European Commission and European Council, which are a short walk away and where most journalists congregate. The most important daily press briefing in Brussels happens at the commission, in an auditorium, on camera – while in Westminster it is done in an obscure wood-panelled room, up too many staircases, on semi-anonymous terms.\u0026nbspThe European parliament has gained more powers and importance in recent years, but it cannot yet claim to be a fully-pledged legislature – notably it lacks the ability to actually suggest laws known as legislative initiative. But in practice in Westminster there is little legislative initiative from the backbenches anyway: the UK’s broken private members’ bill system, where practically every law is talked out or “filibustered” even if there is a majority for it, means that the government has a very firm grip on the statute book indeed.Some differences between Westminster and Brussels are a matter of taste: Westminster, notably, sits in a gothic palace, while the parliament buildings in Brussels and Strasbourg are modern glass, steel, and concrete – both styles have their fans and detractors. In one way, though, the two places are more similar than they might like to admit: it notably is very easy to get lost in both, thanks to a shared history of repeated extensions, badly connected annexes, and endless nondescript corridors.There is no really answer to which parliament is better: they can both learn from each other. And really, they both need to.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

These are major differentials.”Meanwhile, tenants in Manchester pay an average rent of £496, against £1,053 in the capital. One chart that shows why Londoners are the poorest workers in the UKLondon is over. I\u0027m so glad I leftRenters are leaving London in record numbers. Where are they going?A new survey has revealed what Britons hate the most about LondonThe cost of living in every part of the world in one infographicThe ‘Northern pound’ is “essentially a difference in the cost of living”, Mr Johnes said, and the fact that money goes further outside the capital explains why more than half (53 per cent) of Londoners said they would move away from the city and accept a lower salary elsewhere, while just 31 per cent in the North said they would consider moving. This benefits both jobseekers and employers, Mr Johnes said, because companies will find it easier to hire staff and workers will find their money goes further, even if they are being paid a smaller amount. “So it’s a win for consumers and a win for businesses,” he said. Martin Talbot, director at Totaljobs, added: “Gone are the days where a salary is enough to secure the best talent today’s jobseekers are increasingly valuing work-life balance and their wellbeing above all else. “Northern cities are seeing a rise in job opportunities as UK companies no longer think the capital is the be all and end all. Many northern cities offer lots of other advantages too, from a shorter (and cheaper) commute, great cultural scene, and a more affordable social life. “No matter where they’re based, it’s key for businesses to highlight not just their employer brand, but the lifestyle their local area can provide existing and potential employees.”However, the researchers noted that London is unlikely to be abandoned by UK workers. “London will be fine, London is still a great place to live. It has been and will continue to be a centre of gravity,” said Mr Johnes. The survey also revealed that Londoners have different priorities for spending, with 16 per cent of people living in the city taking five or more holidays per year, compared with 9 per cent in the North.cost of livingOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Used for conditions such as myopia and cataracts.While some other animals, including the hopping mouse, have adopted a similar gait, kangaroos have unique anatomy to facilitate this highly efficient mode of locomotion.To find out if the same was true of balbarids, Dr Kear and his colleagues analysed the few bones they had unearthed belonging to one known as Nambaroo gillespieae, comparing them to different modern relatives that live in trees and on the plains.Their results, published in the journal Royal Society Open Science, challenged the idea that kangaroos began hopping on Australia’s arid plains.The scientists said these creatures appear to have evolved a versatile anatomy to scramble around their forest environment.Fur clothing made of hamsters, lynx and kangaroos legally sold in UK“The iconic kangaroo body plan is therefore extremely adaptable, and was probably a key to their success over the last 20 million years or more,” said Dr Kear.It was not enough to save the balbarids, however, and the team think these creatures were probably driven to\u0026nbspextinction as their forest homes shrunk.“On the other hand, the ancestors of modern kangaroos used the same suite of locomotory morphologies to exploit newly emerging open habitats, and thus gave rise to one of the most successful mammal radiations on the Australian landmass today,” said Dr Kear.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Thus, the post-crash recession of 2008 was less severe than it might have been.Under the Maastricht Treaty of 1992, the UK and Denmark were the\u0026nbsponly EU member states relieved of the requirement to join the euro once certain economic conditions were in place, for example on government borrowing and inflation (the “convergence criteria”).For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialThat treaty was eventually subsumed into the Lisbon Treaty of 2007. The European Commission states: “The treaty does not specify a particular timetable for joining the euro area, but leaves it to member states to develop their own strategies for meeting the condition for euro adoption. Seven of the 13 member states who joined the EU since 2004 have already joined the euro area, most recently Lithuania on 1 January 2015.” The UK and Denmark’s “opt-outs” are still in force.The question now arises, then, of whether this special situation would continue of the Brexit process, under article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, were now paused or revoked (ie reversed).What’s behind the latest Brexit row over Gibraltar?The short answer to that is yes. The UK would remain, as now, a member state under existing terms. Including the euro opt-out.However, if the UK were to formally leave the EU at any point, even under a “soft Brexit” and remaining in the European Economic Area, the single market or customs union, it would still need to reapply for membership in the usual fashion if it wanted to return. Just as, say, Albania or Serbia are now, the UK would become a “candidate” for accession.This would require acceptance of the “acquis communautaire” – all the rules, regulations and laws of the EU as they currently stand. Any exceptions would have to be agreed by the EU.Created with Sketch.

There the Bank of England would be represented along with the other central banks.In due course, when the convergence criteria had been met, the UK would then join the euro and abolish the pound, first in bank deposits and then in notes and coins. However, it is interesting that Sweden maintains that it is not obliged to join the euro, and would only do so after a referendum. It has been an EU member since 1994 and still uses the krona.The UK joining the euro would be a controversial question, as it was when it was a live issue in the 1990s.If history is any guide, and with acknowledged flaws in the eurozone’s governance, joining the euro would be a significant obstacle to the UK rejoining the EU, if the EU insisted on enforcing it. Critics would claim it would mean bailing out Greece or Italy at great costs. Supporters would point to how it would make cross-border trade and price transparency much easier.Got an unanswered question about Brexit?

These included more generous advance loans for new claimants\u0026nbspand an additional two weeks of housing benefit while they wait for universal credit payments to start.But the measures appear to have had little effect. More than half (54 per cent) of council tenants who started claiming universal credit after the changes\u0026nbspwere brought in last April are at least a month behind on rent, including a third\u0026nbspwho are at least two months behind.This is barely different to the figures for all council tenants on universal credit, half of whom are at least a month in arrears and a third at least two months behind.One woman was forced to wait for five weeks to receive her first payment after switching onto the new benefit system. Joanne Harrison, 43\u0026nbspfrom Leeds, said she feared she and her son would become homeless during the Christmas period after she was left unable to pay her rent.Rudd has done the right thing, but universal credit should be scrappedMs Harrison, who hadn\u0027t previously had problems paying the rent on time, said she was out of money and falling into arrears after two and a half weeks of waiting for her universal credit to come through.“I was worried because this universal credit, if anything goes wrong with it you get sanctioned or they\u0027re not paying your rent. I was\u0026nbspworried about being made homeless,” she said.\u0026nbsp”I got a letter from the council when it reached £200 saying that they wanted payment right now. I had already phoned them and told them I were going onto universal credit ... because obviously I didn\u0027t have money, that\u0027s why my rent wasn\u0027t getting paid.Assisted by charity Christians Against Poverty, Ms Harrison applied for an advance loan from the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) to tide her over – but she used it to stock up on essentials, knowing she wouldn\u0027t have any other money for a month.\u0026nbsp“It was a case of buying food, stocking up - toilet rolls, baby wipes, sanitary stuff, and filling my freezer up ... I spent it all within two days,” she said.”I didn\u0027t want to be having to ask people for toilet rolls and baby wipes and stuff like that. During that time, nobody was getting paid - no electric, no council tax, no nowt.Surge in families begging for money online amid universal credit woesOne of the worst hit local authorities is Angus in Scotland, where 94 per cent of council tenants on universal credit are at least a month behind on rent – more than 15 times higher than Housing Benefit claimants – and more than 80 percent are at least two months behind. Angus council did not respond to a request for comment.In Bristol, eight out of ten council tenants on the new benefit are at least a month in arrears, with four out of ten at least two months behind. Bristol council said this was because a large proportion of their tenants only recently started claiming universal credit, and have yet to recover from the initial five-week delay.New Citizens Advice research, based on analysis of 190,000 universal credit claimants the charity has helped, shows\u0026nbsp60 per cent of people it helped were having to take out advances while they waited for payment.It also found that debt problems were more common for universal credit claimants than those claiming benefits under the previous system, with 24 per cent of people in the news system also seeking debt advice.Shadow welfare secretary Margaret Greenwood said the data provided “yet more evidence of how universal credit is failing the very people it should be helping”.She added: “Nobody should be pushed into rent arrears and left at risk of eviction because they have to wait to receive a payment. Offering loans to people who have been pushed into debt as a direct result of flaws in the system is not the answer.\u0026nbsp“Tinkering is not enough. The government must stop the roll out of universal credit.“A spokesperson for Christians Against Poverty, which is helping people struggling with universal credit, said rent arrears remained\u0026nbspa big issue among universal credit claimants.To lose your income for five weeks means you are going to have to prioritise who you give your money to and sadly that is a decision that many have to face, they added.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Emergency services attend to a house fire Stafford in which four children have died.

However, in the end his hip injury just took too much out of him, and Bautista Agut clinched a breath-taking 6-4, 6-4, 6-7 (5-7), 6-7 (4-7), 2-6 victory to reach the second round where he\u0027ll face Australia\u0027s John MillmanBritish Prime Minister, Theresa May and her husband Philip attend Sunday morning prayers at her local church in Maidenhead, Britain, 13 January 2019.

But if we are able to make progress sooner, then that might not be necessary.“We can’t know at this stage exactly which of those scenarios would happen.”There is\u0026nbspgrowing concern\u0026nbspamong ministers that there is not enough time to pass the necessary legislation before exit day,\u0026nbspamid reports that the February recess could be cancelled to give Ms May more time to win over the EU.Mr Hunt said a solution had “not been properly worked up” to replace the\u0026nbspIrish backstop – which aims to prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland.\u0026nbspMPs backed a bid to\u0026nbspreplace it\u0026nbspwith “alternative arrangements” in a series of crunch votes on Tuesday.He said it was “difficult to know” if negotiations would run to the end of March, but added: “Whereas a week ago none of us really knew whether this was going to be possible, we are now in a situation where it clearly is possible.“There are lots and lots of hurdles –\u0026nbspno one is saying this isn’t going to be very challenging –\u0026nbspbut we do now have a consensus in parliament.“Providing we can do that, which I think we can, then I think there is a way through.”However his Austrian counterpart, Karin Kneissl, said it would be “very difficult” for the Brexit timeframe to be extended and warned that Britain could be heading for a no-deal exit.She said: “According to the Article 50 procedures, the deadline is 29 March,\u0026nbspso there is a time pressure because what couldn’t be reached by negotiation over the last years, it’s very difficult to imagine that there can be a tremendous breakthrough – a magic solution – in the next few days in order also to have this ratified in due time for the remaining EU members.”Created with Sketch.

would have to reapply for the cash, after its shock decision to abandon production of the X-Trail SUV at its Sunderland plant.A letter revealing the package – originally set to be up to £80m – was

anti-Brexit group Best for Britain, said: “This Brexit bribe has come back to bite the government.”Ms Morgan, writing in her capacity as the Conservative chairwoman of the Treasury select committee, demanded to know why Mr Clark had kept secret “direct financial assistance from the government to Nissan”.“How much of the £61m is not going to be paid over?” she asked, during a Commons statement on

response, Mr Clark revealed that only £2.6m had been paid out so far – “about half for training of the workforce and half for environmental improvements to the plant”.And he told MPs: “Of course, the company will need to resubmit on the grounds of the new information that it has.”That new information, which emerged over the weekend, is that production of the X-Trail will be moved back to Japan, a decision partly caused by the Brexit crisis, the company said.The decision is a further blow to the UK car industry, following recent moves by Ford, Jaguar Land Rover and Honda to reduce their workforces and cut costs.Mr Clark said the decision meant that 741 planned extra jobs would no longer be created at Sunderland – although there were “no implications for existing jobs”.Pro-Brexit Tory MP refuses to back down over false Twitter claimWas Brexit behind Nissan’s decision not to build the X-Trail here?UK ports to wave through EU goods without checks after no-deal BrexitWhat is the Malthouse compromise and will it solve the Brexit puzzle?Mr Clark, who has hinted he will resign if the UK looks like crashing out of the EU without an agreement, added: “No deal is fully acknowledged, certainly by me and the industry, as being ruinous for our prospects.”The controversy blew up on a day when:* It was announced that UK ports will wave through goods from the EU without checks if there is a no-deal Brexit, to avoid huge traffic jams.* It was revealed that the prime minister will hold talks with business leaders in Northern Ireland on Tuesday, and its political leaders the following day.* Lord Trimble, the former Northern Ireland first minister threatened to take the government to court over the Irish backstop, claiming a breach of the Good Friday Agreement.* Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, raised hopes in Downing Street by saying a Brexit deal could be agreed if people were “creative” and if “there’s enough good will”.* A poll found that 45 per cent of voters back delaying Brexit beyond the scheduled date of 29 March to allow time to negotiate a better deal.Mr Clark defended the secrecy on the grounds that Nissan had been promised the aid would only be revealed “when the company said it was no longer commercially sensitive”.It was offered in return for a decision to build the Qashqhai and X-Trail models at the flagship northeast plant. The first car will still be built there.At the time, Mr Clark had said: “There is no question of financial compensation over tariffs because we have said that what is necessary is that we are going to maintain the competitiveness of the sector, and we are going to get the best deal possible.”Rebecca Long-Bailey, Labour’s shadow business secretary, accused the government of planning “managed decline’, saying: “Of course Brexit was not the only reason but it was pretty prominent in Nissan’s decision.”She said Mr Clark’s “quiet opposition to no-deal Brexit is of course well known, but still the juggernaut of government chaos hurtles on.”The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I am not prepared to compromise their wishes to deliver a watered-down Brexit.“The last three months have seen the economy slip into its weakest growth spell for six years, and indicate that GDP likely stagnated at the start of 2019 after eking out modest growth of just 0.1 per cent\u0026nbspin the fourth quarter.”Duncan Brock of the\u0026nbspChartered Institute of Procurement \u0026amp Supply, which sponsors the survey, said Brexit was the main culprit.“At the risk of sounding like a broken record, Brexit uncertainty continues to be at the\u0026nbspheart of the malaise as clients delayed orders and consumers were deeply reluctant to spend under the continuing cloud of hesitation, indecision and ambiguity.”The PMI for the sector\u0026nbspcovers businesses such as hotels, restaurants, transport and finance, although not retail.It also showed that in January services firms reduced jobs for the first time since 2012.UK GDP grew by 0.6 per cent in the third quarter of 2018. The figure for the final quarter, released next week, is expected to show a slump to 0.2 per cent.The PMIs for January are consistent, on a historic basis, with flatlining GDP in the first quarter of 2019.Fifth of big firms have already moved operations abroad due to BrexitSome analysts said that might be misleading, however.“Since 2004, the rate of GDP growth implied by the PMIs has been wide of the mark by an average of 0.3 percentage points,” said Samuel Tombs of Pantheon.“They were far too downbeat immediately after the referendum, suggesting that they tend to overstate the impact of political uncertainty on the economy. They also pointed to downturns in activity in 1998, 2001 and 2003 that failed to materialise.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

eu","story":"So, what would a No-Deal Brexit mean for the UK  Heres what we know so far.A no-deal British departure from the European Union means leaving without formal arrangements for the future relationship.Currently Britains trade, customs and immigration rules are tied up with the single market and a host of EU regulatory bodies.Ministers are seeking a legal deal to replace these with looser arrangements so we are outside the single market and customs union but keeping close ties so cross-border trade is easy.Negotiations are ongoing under Article  of the Lisbon Treaty ahead of the UKs exit on March , .Some fear these talks could collapse without a deal agreed before the deadline.This could mean the UK being treated as a third country by the EU with commerce governed by World Trade Organisationrules.On January , Boris Johnson claimed that a No-Deal Brexit is the closest to what people voted for in the referendum.He also urged Cabinet Ministers to mirror the British publics optimism and self-confidence for the possible exit scenario.A poll by YouGov on January  revealed that  per cent of the British public think a No-Deal Brexit it likely,  per cent thinks a failed deal will result in a second referendum,  per cent the deal will pass and  per cent said a better deal could be negotiated.Mrs May is fighting back against opponents of her blueprint for Brexit, saying Parliament will have to choose between her proposal and crashing out of the European Union without a deal.It would mean scrapping a -month transition period lasting until the end of , and the exit would be immediate.Brexiteers say it would be a boost for the UK to be free from Brussels rules and we will be able to strike deals with other upcoming nations around the globe.We would also not be obliged to pay the £billion orce bill, according to a House of Commons report — but Chancellor Philip Hammond sparked fury by saying we would pay up even without a deal.Many people fear the UK economy would be hurt by a clf edge Brexit as trade is held up by new border checks and tarfs and more red tape for businesses.Doom-monger Bank of England governor Mark Carney has warned house prices could crash by a third in a worst-case scenario.Customs checks on cross-Channel freight could cause havoc at ports, hitting food supplies and other goods such a motor parts.The Border Force is also planning for a possible No-Deal Brexit as they fear there will be signicant outbound queues at the Eurostar and a degradation of border security, Sky News reported.In a pure No-Deal Brexit scenario, businesses would lose their passporting rights, which allow them to sell their services across the EU without having to obtain licences in each inidual country.The  mile border between Northern Ireland and the Republic could become a hard border, according to the Eurocrats in Brussels.The EUs rules may require Ireland to impose customs and other checks to protect the bloc’s border – which some say would mark ato the dark days of the Troubles.It could blow a hole in the Good Friday Agreement, with pressure on all sides to find a compromise.Theresa May announced on January  that a vote on her EU Withdrawal deal will take place on Tuesday, January , which was rejected  to .May has guaranteed MPs a vote on whether the controversial Brexit backstop is triggeredthe UK fails to conclude a new trade deal with the EU by the end of next year.She unveiled her plan B Brexit plan on January  and vowed to have another go with solving the issue of the back stop.The Confederation of British Industry also said a No-Deal Brexit would wipe £billion off the UK economy, making every region poorer, the Daily Mail reported.Ministers announced plans for troops on the street and emergency ferries

sun says","story":"Parliament this week sent them a clear message — their hopes to overturn the biggest democratic mandate in our country’s history will come to nothing.But now they have turned their guns on Brexit-supporting Labour MPs who have put constituents and country above their pathetic party’s posturing.These low-grade nobodies are already so bloated with self-importance that they’re happy to say they know better than million Leave voters.And they DARE to target MPs for the crime of voting for what their constituents want It’s exactly the sort of ideological purity battle Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour specialises in. The Tories need to show they’re above that.We don’t agree with much of Nick Boles’s plan for a Brexit so soft as to be barely Brexit at all. This week’s amendment, co-signed by Boles and Yvette Cooper, could have holed the whole operation below the waterline.But that does not mean he should be deselected. The Tory party has always been a broad church and it serves as a better party of government when pragmatism is its guiding force.For the first time in months, the Conservatives have shown the sort of professionalism and unity that the public expects of them.They must keep it together.IT is an outrage that speedboat killer Jack Shepherd continues to claim legal aid despite refusing toto Britain.Justice Secretary David Gauke cannot simply put his hands in the air and claim he’s powerless to do anything.Everybody has a right to a fair trial, and that often means help with legal costs. But how anybody on the run can be entitled to taxpayers’ cash is absolutely beyond us.Gauke has form for dodging tough decisions. His plans to reform Parole Board transparency in the wake of the John Worboys fiasco are still in a holding pattern.He has been renowned as a safe pair of hands for years.That reputation is rapidly disintegrating.A STONED teenager drives his parents’ Audi and kills two people — weeks after being stopped for suspected drug-driving.You’d probably expect the lout to spend some time at Her Maj’s pleasure. You’d at least expect him to be charged with manslaughter, or death by dangerous driving.But no. The coppers’ son from swanky Ascot walked free from court with barely a slap on the wrist.Would that happen to a -year-old council estate kid We doubt it.

So why lie Some people have been asking this weekjail is the best punishment for a speeding fine. But let’s be clear: She is not going to prison for speeding — she is going to prison for perverting the course of justice by lying about who was driving her car.That would be bad enough for an average citizen. But Onasanya is not an average citizen. She is a solicitor — and also an MP.An MP is known by the title ­“Honourable” for a reason: There is a code of conduct outlined for MPs which includes, among other things, integrity and honesty.Any MP has even more obligation than the average person to set a good example and to take responsibility for their actions — both of which she has failed, spectacularly, to do. She has acted asshe is above the law, which is simply not acceptable for someone whose job is to uphold the law.She no longer deserves the privilege of representing anyone in the legal or parliamentary system and it is clear to any right-thinking ­person that she should be struck off as a solicitor — and resign as an MP.It is her refusal to do this immediately which is the most astonishing thing about this story.That, plus Corbyn’s lack of ­leadership in not insisting she resign as soon as she was found guilty.By all accounts, it sounds like she was out of her depth as an MP from the get go. For a start, constituents complained she was uncontactable.She also spent £, of taxpayer’s money in seven months on “expenses” and was caught on video ­pretending to snort “cocaine”, which isn’t exactly a great look for an MP.The trial judge concluded the “truth comes a very distant second to your personal ambition, doesn’t it ”Whether or not that’s true, it is hard not to conclude, in the face of the evidence against her, that her refusal to resign as an MP is rooted in the £, salary it yields.But how is she going to help her constituents from prison One argument being made about her being sent to jail is that she is clearly not a danger to society, which is true. But the problem for the courts is thatyou take an oath to tell the truth, then fail to do so, it has to be considered a serious offence — and punished accordingly.Without a deterrent to stop people lying through their teeth, the justice system would collapse.Let’s face it, there is nothing about this story that makes Onasanya look good.She is going to have an ­electronic tag when she comes out.No doubt she is massively regretting not owning up to speeding in the first place — and taking the consequences.Her le is now in tatters.But resigning as an MP now might help her claw back a tiny bit of respect for finally doing the right thing. As a solicitor and an MP, she needs to take full responsibility for her actions.IT’S shocking that Bonita Baxter, a heavily pregnant woman with a serious heart condition, was forced to sit on an AE floor at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham for five hours after patients and visitors refused to give up their seats.Clearly, manners are no longer important to this nation.But the real issue is that the hospital was so overcrowded that, given the five-hour wait, no one was going to give up their seat.AE departments continue to be overcrowded in part because we continue to abuse the NHS, turning up to AE for anything from drunkenness to a broken fingernail.Anyone who has ever had to pay for their healthcare, as they do in North America, would respect our health service much, much more.In the meantime, we need to put measures in place to make sure that people start valuing what they have.There should be fines for people who don’t attend GP and hospital appointments.And AE should start turning away anything other than genuine emergencies.T’S heart-breaking, isn’t it, ­listening to Vicky Pattison blaming herself for the fact her fiancé, John Noble, had “grown close to” other women during a boys’ trip to Dubai “When something like this happens, you blame yourself and I did question myself. MaybeI was thinner he wouldn’t have done what he did,” she said on TV on Wednesday.Apparently, this charmer actually blamed her – and her size – saying that he was “set up” to cheat because of it. Vicky, darling,you are reading this: It’s not your fault he cheated. And no amount of dieting would have stopped him.A cheater’s always going to cheat.You need to take some time out to focus on yourself and decide not to be around people who make you feel bad about yourself. There is so much pressure on women today.There is so much emphasis on how they look and how other people see them, rather than a focus on real values, like the size of your brain.So I suppose it’s easy to understand how Vicky concluded that her appearance might be the “problem”.When the reality is just that she picked an a***hole to go out with.I ABHOR fat-shaming, and rudeness. And I have zero sympathy for the woman who refused to sit between two overweight passengers on a United Airlines flight from Las Vegas to New York.She caused a horrible scene and loudly called them “big pigs”, which is truly shocking.But luckily the shame was all hers, as her tirade went viral on social media – and she was thrown off the flight.It’s also true thatyou book a flight then you are entitled to the seat you’ve booked, andsomeone is taking up half of yours that’s not fair.But this issue should be dealt with by the airline, not passengers.Many airlines have an “obesity policy”. American Airlines, for example, requires passengers to purchase a second seatthey need a seatbelt extension and their body “extends more than one inch beyond the outermost edge of the arm rest”.I can imagine it’s a dficult and embarrassing rule to enforce – but it’s better than people taking matters into their ownhands.For once, I can say I did not stray, not even so much as once.THE Europeans screaming that the Irish backstop must remain are deluded.No Deal will affect Europe as much as – and in some cases, more than – the UK.And when the French farmers realise they can’t get their cheese across the border before it rots, and the Spanish – who sell more goods and services to the UK than it buys – are stranded with decaying goods, and when German car sales slump because tarfs make them too expensive, I predict riots across Europe.And then Michael Barnier will have a small dose of the pain he has inflicted on our PM.The reality is that citizens of these European countries, whose jobs will be under threat by No Deal, will not give a hootthere is or isn’t a hard border in Ireland.And frankly, all companies collect VAT for the Government and PAYE for them, so why not let them do the same for tarfs and be their own custom offices The Government can audit them once every three months, then the problem is solved.APPARENTLY, dog-walking in Tehran has been outlawed by the Islamic government in a crackdown against pet ownership.Dog owners will even face penaltiesspotted carrying their pets in a car.Tehran’s chief of police, Brigadier-General Hossein Rahimi, said the ban had been introduced because dogs “create fear and anxiety” among members of the public.Ironically, my experience is that dogs create exactly the opposite reaction.But what do you expect from a country that doesn’t allow women to initiate orce, dance or report a rape .Our country might be crazy at the moment, but let’s all breathe a sigh of relief we live here, rather than there.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Here, leading Conservative Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg offers his view:THE EU has taken an almost religious approach to Britain’s latest move towards securing a Brexit deal.The compromise put forward by my fellow MP Kit Malthouse has been immediately dismissed and any prospect of further negotiation turned away. The mighty EU has spoken and will not be gainsaid.In negotiating the compromise, both Leavers and Remainers made concessions. This has led to criticism from their supporters, as I found in my weekly radio show on LBC.Callers felt that I had become a “snowflake” in my willingness to see £billion of taxpayers’ money spent without giving us any advantage in future negotiations.The legal basis for the EU demanding money is weak. A House of Lords report came to the conclusion that while there could be a moral obligation, under UK, EU and international law there was no valid or forceful claim.The only motive for paying is to secure a good future deal, rather than to pay a ransom for our freedom.Yet I have come to the conclusion that leaving on March  is at risk and exiting the EU is a prize worth paying for and on which thewill be great.Unfortunately, in spite of the Referendum result, the majority of MPs are reluctant to see the UK part from the EU and at the least want terms that mirror our membership.This may well not be the view of most voters, who seem to welcome the clean break and are not fearful of the scare stories.It is, therefore, crucial to ensure the fears of those who are far from enthusiastic Brexiteers are assuaged. This is where the Malthouse Compromise comes in.By offering money and making the prospect of a No Deal Brexit unlikely, possible moderate former Remainers are willing to avoid Parliamentary tactics that would frustrate our departure.They can accept the replacement of the backstop, which could keep us tied in to the EU’s rules and courts forever, with a routine trade agreement based on existing processes commonly used around the world.This would not hamper the development of a future relationship which would be discussed once we have left. Although in these discussions we would lose the leverage of cash, we would not be squeezed by the backstop.The second stage of the compromise is that the implementation period could be extended by one year. Currently the withdrawal agreement proposes a maximum of two years.In this time we would remain subject to EU laws and what follows, but it makes the prospect of not finalising a future relationship less likely, which gives comfort to those who are determined to avoid No Deal.In my view, an extra  months of vassalage after  years is an unwelcome but not unaffordable price to pay. Critics may ask why Brexiteers want to lessen the chance of a No Deal departure — and the reason is simple.Regardless of the folly of Project Fear, which becomes more preposterous by the day, the Parliamentary arithmetic means we must either lessen the prospect by compromise or it will be done by sharp practice in the House of Commons.This could lead to delay or even no Brexit at all. This would destroy any remaining trust of politicians in our constitutional settlement, it would show reckless contempt for voters, yet the Brexit-denying amendment put forward by Yvette Cooper last week was only defeated by  votes.As with all compromises, Malthouse is not perfect but is enough for each side of the argument in the UK to accept.The question remains, will the EU response be positive  So far, it has not.This has always been at the heart of the debate, and in a way a compelling reason for going. Is the EU a Mafia-style organisation that has to punish countries that do not subscribe to its religion Their response to the Malthouse Compromise and the PM’s request to re-open the text will answer this question. It must be clear to the EU that the current withdrawal agreement will not do.Defeated in the Commons by the largest margin ever achieved in the lower house on Government business, it is simply too one-sided and allows too great a triumph to the EU.If the EU were to insist on its inalterability requiring the punishment of a recalcitrant, freedom-loving nation then it will reveal its true and barbarous colours. It would be evident on its own that we are right to leave.How much better it would bethis were wrong and that in fact the EU is the civilised organisation it claims to be — respecting democracy, the nation state and constitutional procedures.

They might even win a snap election.Played skilfully, this could win a deal that satisfies both Remainers and Leavers.Yet there are fears Mrs May will use it to revive her wretched Chequers plan, which sparked the resignations of Boris Johnson and David Davis, or the botched deal thrown out last month by a -vote margin.She has made a worrying start by apparently binning the No Deal card — the only one that truly scares the EU. Mrs May has no intention of playing this ace — and never had.There are other worrying signs.This showdown with EU hardliners requires fresh thinking and shrewd advice from seasoned players. Crawford Falconer, an ex-World Trade Organisation ambassador, was recruited by the Brexit department for precisely these skills.Indeed, he is the ONLY person in the Government machine who has ever negotiated a trade deal.Yet bafflingly, Mrs May is keeping this star player on the sidelines.Instead, she will fly to Brussels with Whitehall mandarin Olly Robbins, the pro-EU fanatic who plunged Britain into the backstop trap she is now under pressure to escape from.Robbins hates Brexit and has privately warned the PM this is Mission Impossible.Mrs May — herself a Remainer who has never grasped the case for Brexit — will be joined by trusted “deputy PM” David Lidington, a dyed-in-the-wool Brussels worshipper.In such company, even the inclusion in her team of a thundering Brexiteer Attorney-General Geoffrey Cox is only mildly reassuring.Mrs May is notoriously stubborn. She can also be devious.After nearly three years, even her closest political colleagues — who can be counted on one hand with a couple of missing digits — have no idea what her Brexit might look like.Voters are increasingly irritated by this foot-dragging.Why should we remain part of an organisation that wants to punish us by stealing Gibraltar, Northern Ireland and our car industry Nobody who watched the brutal humiliation of poor little Greece will be surprised. This tragic and insolvent nation should never have been admitted to the EU, still less the Eurozone.Only with the assistance of US banking giant Goldman Sachs — “The Vampire Squid” — got them in under the wire. Once inside, they launched a borrowing and spending binge which ended in tears in the  crash.Greece might have flourished as a cheap but lovely tourist economy. Instead, it is now being cruelly tormented by Brussels and lumbered with multi-billion euros debts it can never repay.Greece symbolises all that is wrong with arrogant Brussels — the catastrophic Euro, inflexible economic policies and mass unemployment for under-s.Above all, there is the sneering contempt of unsackable Eurocrats for the million people they rule from subsidised ivory towers.Theresa May is a poor negotiator who never truly believed No Deal is better than a bad deal.Without this implicit threat, Brussels will give little and demand much in . It would be a pleasure to eat my words and watch Mrs May play a blinder.She can use her good luck to land a historic victory. Or she can blink and condemn Britain to colony status, paying billions more into EU coffers while being led by the nose on trade deal promises that never materialise.In which case, forget about that snap election fantasy.The Conservative Party would never be forgiven by the .million voters who voted Brexit — or those who wish they had.SECURITY CHIEFS are dusting off Cold War plans anticipating a Soviet nuclear strike to whisk the Queen to safety in the event of . . .  er . . . a No Deal Brexit.Presumably The Mall will be cleared of traffic and used as a landing strip to fly Her Maj out before revolutionary Remainers string her up for supporting Brexit.The only question is whether she will go quietly.The royals refused to leave London even after Buckingham Palace was bombed during the Second World War.This Project Fear nonsense is even more insane than the idea that thousands will die of fruit shortages.To quote Corporal Jones: “Don’t panic!!”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

joining the new fleet of F- Lightning jets.Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson said: It is with a heavy heart, but enormous pride, that we bid farewell to the Tornado from operations.This truly is the end of an era, having played a vital role in keeping Britain and its allies safe for four decades.They are flexible when flying with a mm gun for ied targets.The aircraft carry Paveway guided bombs and Brimstone and Storm Shadow missiles.They can reach top speeds of Mach . and fly to an altitude of ,ft.A Tornados wingspan is ftin and the jet is ftins in .But, after so long in service, it is only right that we now look to the future.The combination of our state-of-the art Fs and the Typhoon’s new weapon systems will keep us as a world leader in air combat for a generation.Chief of the Air Staff, Air Chief Marshal Sir Stephen Hillier said: My sincerest congratulations to the Tornado Force, ing home after more than  years of continuous commitment to defeating Daesh in Iraq and Syria - an exceptional effort from everyone, well done and thank you.As a Tornado GR pilot myself, I have seen the aircraft develop over its nearly  years of service into an outstanding combat aircraft, flown, maintained and supported by similarly outstanding air and groundcrew.The Tornado Force has been continuously deployed on operations since , serving with immense distinction in Iraq, Syria, Afghanistan, Libya and the Balkans.I will personally be very sad to see the Tornado retire, but it is time now to pass the baton to our next generation combat aircraft.The F-B Lightning is now operational and the Typhoon is now fully multi-role capable and able to take on the Tornado’s missions.We can all take immense pride in what the Tornado has achieved in defence of the nation over nearly four decades, and reflect back on the courage, commitment and achievements of everyone who has contributed to the success of this extraordinary aircraft.The RAF has already trialled its Typhoon and F- Forces’ abilities to work together.In a series of trials, the effectiveness of both s when operating alongside one another has been confirmed.With its larger payload and increased agility and range, the Typhoon will operate in concert with the stealthy F- and its next-generation sensors, delivering the UK a force ready to counter evolving threats in the global environment."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/NINTCHDBPICT000466754490.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"tourist snaps seal poo new zealand usb","story":"Vets took a slab of faeces from a leopard seal and had it stored in a freezer for a year before researchers started to analyse the mass for scientic research.But while sting the scat from feathers, seaweed and other junk they discovered something large and hard inside -

I was told Ive idiopathic urticaria, meaning it can start without a cause.Lydia was completely debilitated by the bizarre allergy, which affected all of her limbs. Yet despite trying everything she could think of to eliminate potential ­triggers, she couldnt find a cause.She explained: The daily rashes affected my whole body, I would wake up with them every day, they were really itchy and large.They even covered the palms of my hands and soles of my feet, it made me feel unwell, as I was so exhausted from being unable to sleep due to being so itchy.I couldnt see any identiable causes — I changed my bedsheets, my diet, my body wash, shampoo, make-up and everything.Thankfully, the rash started to subside in August — and has now disappeared ­completely. However, she constantly fears that the mystery condition will ­reappear.She said: Im worried it will come back next year as it started during the cold spell in the UK, so I do wonderits related to snow and cold weather.Im delighted that I dont have to deal with it any more — training to be a paramedic is full on and when youre with the public, people commentDuring Lydias battle with the rashes, strangers have treated her dferently.She explained: You could see people looking at my rash hoping they didnt catch it.No one said anything until when I was on ambulance ­placement — where you wear short sleeves — so could see my arms and chest.When I went to take someones blood pressure, she told me, Dont touch me, I dont want to catch it.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Personally, I didn’t.What I hope we’re all agreed on, though, is the fact that Danny’s too busy playing Danny Dyer, the professional geezer, to be a good listener or natural TV historian.It’s an act that worked, of course, when he was wondering, “Eleanor of Aquitaine, was she a looker ” but didn’t serve him so well when presented with a longbow.“Long, innit ”The Beeb clocked this before production started, obviously, so had paired him up with dozens of head-patting historians and actors who got him to dress up as every kind of medieval t**t you can imagine. Like Mr Benn on crack, it was.Armour, codpieces, nappies, tights, doublet and hose, and a gigantic white smock, bleached with human urine, which had one grovelling “courtier” wondering: “Has all the p*** been washed out, my Lord King ”A good question.We didn’t actually get the answer, though, until part two, on Wednesday, when, after a brief detour round his ancestors, Louis IX of France, William the Conqueror and Henry II, viewers got to the nub of things, with Professor Chris Given-Wilson explaining the agonising death of Edward II: “By thrusting a hollow instrument, like the end of a trumpet, up his fundament.”“’Old on a minute,” said a rattled Danny. “He’s been stabbed  With a trumpet ”“Into his fundament.” Long pause.“Don’t tell me it’s up his a**e ”Right up it, Danny, with a red-hot poker. News which didn’t just do his “nut in”, it seemed to derail the entire documentary.They ran out of direct royal ancestors shortly afterwards as well, and the BBC adopted its stupid default setting in such circumstances. It turned Danny’s Right Royal Family into a dance and cookery show, complete with demonstrations of both, from medieval experts.It was about this time I also sussed out what was going on in the background, with all those winsome historians. An audition.The BBC was using it to find its new face of history, though why any of the blokes turned up is a mystery. Auntie’s already made it clear: “The days of white, middle-aged men explaining stuff are over.”Danny, on the other hand, can be tolerated, because he’s their new performing Cockney. A novelty act who can be dressed up and patronised so much he ended this one doing some weird medieval can-can, with his family, in front of his lost ancestral pile.A trumpet wasn’t quite shoved up his fundament as they danced, but the p*** had very much been washed out of him, my Lord King.GREAT TV lies and delusions of the month. “I think it’s going to be a really great show.” Cheryl Tweedy, The Greatest Dancer.“We do TV shows and we’re national treasures.” Jedward, Celebrity Coach Trip.“People will remember my name and I love that.” Some t**t off Ship- wrecked.IF you’re to take anything from the news experts have claimed Monday, January  was the most depressing day of the year, it’s probably the fact the experts clearly never sat through what happened eight days later, on Tuesday, January .Britain’s Top  Dogs Live: .

It comes as part of a drive to ‘clean up’ the internet and give the public more power online in the wake of the Vote Leave data harvesting scandal. Shadow culture secretary Tom Watson will say: “I know Silicon Valley companies didn’t set out to undermine democracy. But they didn’t stop it, and they continue to profit from it. “This is a matter of national security. Disinformation ides our society, damages our faith in the media, and distorts electoral outcomes. We need to counter this.”   Labour is also proposing a new digital bill of rights to allow citizens to exercise more control over how their data is collected and monetized. “We have the right to know who is trying to influence our views, and how they are trying to do it,” he said. “Agents of disinformation amply their lies through targeted digital adverts and social media bots.” There would be a new legal duty to remove illegal content with the supervision of regular judicial review and a transparent process, including fast-track appeals. It comes after the Government yesterday revealed that social media firms would be forced by law to sign a code of conduct protecting young and vulnerable users. A White Paper on online harms will be published by the end of winter setting out expectations for firms, followed by a consultation over the summer. Digital minister Margot James said: “There is far too much bullying, abuse, misinformation and manipulation online as well as, I’m afraid, serious organised crime. “For too long, the response of many of the large s has fallen short. “There have been no fewer than  voluntary codes of practice agreed with s since . “Where we are now, is an absolute indictment of a system which has relied far too little on the role of the law.”   Labour’s own plans for a duty of care currently go further as they are backed up by tough financial penalties.This means firms like Facebook , Google and Twitter could face fines of up to pound million a time for breaches such as those behind the death of -year-old Molly Russell.The teenager’s parents said last month that exposure to harmful content about depression and suicide online had led their daughter to suicide in . Labour is also proposing to give a new regulator, with statutory underpinning, powers to prevent market abuse and where necessary break up monopolies.

Alarm bells were ringing at Amber Peats school just months before she was found hanged in a hedgerow, the hearing was told. Concerns about the teenager, from Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, were reported to a safeguarding team at her local council. These included claims she had made to teachers at school that she had been forced to wash every pot in her house as a punishment. The inquest has heard she was also made to wear baggy tracksuit bottoms to school because she forgot to wash her school clothes. A second call to the team listed a series of alleged incidents reported by Amber to her form tutor that had happened at home, one of which was a claim her stepdad Danny Peat had woken the schoolgirl at .pm and made her clean the floor of their house.   However, on neither occasion was Amber’s case escalated to the level of formal social care involvement, the hearing was told today. This led to coroner Laurinda Bower saying she was ‘concerned’ about how the system operated. Amber’s body was discovered in June , three days after she walked out of the home she shared with mum Kelly, stepdad Danny, and two younger siblings. The inquest into her death has heard how she ran away from home following a row with her parents over chores. The hearing, which is being held in Nottingham, was earlier told her parents waited almost eight hours before they finally reported her missing in the early hours of the morning. Ms Bower was told two calls were made from Queen Elizabeth School in Mansfield, which Amber attended at the time of her death, to MASH before the tragedy – one in September , and another six months later.  Both times a worker took information from the callers – one of which was a key worker at the school and the other its vice principal - and handed it on to a qualied social worker. But the inquest was told the case didn’t pass a “threshold” that would have triggered statutory social services intervention. The coroner told MASH group manager Teresa Godfrey: “In the world of safeguarding there should have been an explicit conversation about risk.” The first call to the safeguarding unit was made by Queen Elizabeth vice principal Karen Green. Ms Green said she knew the Peats had been involved with a similar team in Derby, where they used to live, adding: “This family has moved around quite a bit and people have started to work with them and as soon as they start to work with them, the family move.”  The teacher added Amber had mentioned a “big secret” at home she wasn’t allowed to talk about – which turned out to be her stepdad had been jailed for tax fraud – and that she had been subjected to the pot washing punishment. The inquest was told that Ms Green said: “This one is ringing alarm bells. It just does not feel right. My gut instinct is there is something not right here and I can’t put my finger on it.” A second call was made to the MASH team in March , two months before Amber’s death, by her school key worker Sharon Clay. She reported concerns over Amber wearing ill-fitting tracksuit bottoms to school, which the inquest has previously heard she was made to do by Mr Peat after failing to put her normal trousers in the wash, and bringing her items in a cheap plastic bag.  Ms Clay added that she thought Amber was being “emotionally abused” by her stepdad, who had also ordered her to wash the floors at .pm at night. MASH worker Joanna Shepherd, who took the call, said “you would need more incidents over a period of time” – adding she was not aware at the time of the “bigger picture” surrounding Amber. But Ms Bower askedany thought had been given to the impact it could have on Amberthe disclosures she’d made to her teacher were passed back to her parents, adding: “As we discuss this now, do you see the concerns I am raising ” Mrs Shepherd replied: “Yes. But I could not question the social worker on that.” The hearing was told that since Amber’s death procedures had been put in place, including better recording systems, that aimed to gather and collate information better. The inquest continues.

Michael Seed, , is said to share the same gait as a burglar in a wig captured on CCTV during the poundmillion raid over the  Easter Bank Holiday. Seed was allegedly the brains behind the burglary, disabling the alarm, allowing the elderly villains to enter the vault, Woolwich Crown Court was told. Six men drilled in to take gems, cash and gold worth pound.million. Five have been convicted over the raid: Brian Reader, , John Collins, , Daniel Jones, , Carl Wood, , and Terry Perkins, who died last year aged .  CCTV cameras captured Basil in a blue boiler suit and disguised with the wig and mask, as he walked in through the main door of Hatton Garden Safe Deposit, Central London. Comparing that with covert footage of Seed, a shypodiatrist saw “strong evidence” to suggest they are the same man, said prosecutor Philip Evans QC. Mr Evans told jurors: “He concluded the ‘Basil’ footage showed someone with a particular habitual walk or gait, an abnormality in his right leg.” He said  items of jewellery shypotentially stolen from the Hatton Garden were found in Seed’s one-bed council flat in a raid in March . Officers found precision drills, a smelting machine and jewellery, gold, watches and gems valued at pound,.   Anti-surveillance gadgets and gold ingots like ones linked to Jones were also found at the Islington flat, where Seed lived alone just two miles from the diamond district, the court heard. Jurors were told he has no known income and was unemployed from , paid no tax and took no benefits. Recordings of Jones, Collins and Perkins supported the claim that Seed is Basil, the court heard. Jones was said to be referring to Seed’s “frugal lestyle” when he said gold, cash and “foreign money” from the raid would last Basil “forever, Tel, that will last him right through, he goes for the cheapest gaffs”. Another plank in the prosecution case is surveillance photos of Seed meeting Collins twice in the weeks after the burglary, the court heard.  Mr Evans also outlined “striking and compelling” similarities between Hatton Garden and a second high value raid Seed is charged with. The Chatila jewellery store in Bond Street was attacked on August Bank Holiday weekend in . Seed is alleged to have disabled two alarms, allowing four raiders to swipe around poundmillion worth of jewellery, along with pound, in cash. “These two offences required very specialist skills and knowledge,” he said. “The prosecution suggest that Mr Seed is one of those people.” Seed denies two charges of conspiracy to commit burglary and one charge of conspiracy to convert or transfer criminal property.

When Ms Zafirakou explained the dferent types of printing taught in her classes, Kate said with a laugh: Im desperate to go back to tie dye. When askedshe was interested in art, the Duchess, who studied History of Art at university, said she loved it adding: Its something Im loving doing with the children - papier mache - I forgot how messy it is, but its really great. She also said her son George had found a piece of charcoal in a fireplace and told her: Mummy Im going to draw a picture - thats whats so nice you can do it from all around you.

She stressed how the school supports not only the pupils academic aspirations but their personal development.

First-time mother Sonal Vasta, , gave birth to little Mihan as her partner Vik, , drove his Audi in heavy traffic.She says Vik didnt believe she was delivering their child - but when she felt the head, she told him to pull over. The couple, of Bolton, Greater Manchester, had been to pregnancy hypnobirthing and yoga classes before the birth. They believe that is what kept Sonal supremely calm throughout. Sonal said: In my classes, I was told to envisage the place I wanted to give birth. Obviously, I didn’t exactly visualise a car birth.  “I was so calm that the midwives told me not to come into hospital. Even my husband didn’t believe I was in labour and he didn’t even stop the car for the birth. “We were driving down the main road and the next thing, I was holding a baby boy in my arms. Just two streets on, I felt the head and I told Vik to pull over. But he was saying: ‘We’re nearly there, just hold on.’ He didn’t believe I was giving birth.

Jenefer Gillam, , saw her weight creep up after gorging on huge portions of quick-fix caloric food. The NHS worker, from East Preston, West Sussex began experiencing breathlessness, aching joints and indigestion - and decided to overhaul her whole lestyle in  after catching a glimpse of herself in a lt at work. Jenefer said: I just thought – ‘Jenefer, you’re enormous. Determined to change, Jenefer, whose partner Glenn, , is a technology sales consultant, joined WW, formerly known as Weight Watchers, in early  and has since completely changed her diet - slimming down to a size  after an eight stone weight loss. Jenefer, mum to Ethan, , and Eva, seven, revealed: “Since losing the weight, I’ve bumped into colleagues from dferent offices, or friends that I don’t see regularly, and they haven’t even recognised me. I’ll get a blank look when I say hello, before they realise who I am.”   Struggling with her weight for much of her le, the super-slimmer admitted to embarking on ious dferent diets over the years, without much success. Her problem escalated after having children and when, in , she started studying for a Masters degree, juggling lectures with work and being a mum meant any notion of healthy eating and exercise took a back seat. She explained: “The weight crept on as I’d be sitting there in the evenings studying and grabbing quick fixes. “I did also eat fruit and vegetables and wasn’t one for takeaways or anything like that, but it was more the portion sizes that were the problem. My portions would be huge.” Most mornings, Jenefer would start with peanut butter on toast, before grabbing a coffee and a cake or bacon butty once she got to college. Then lunch would be a cheese-laden panini followed by comfort food for dinner, like a jacket potato piled high with toppings, or a pie. “I had a terrible crisp habit, too,” she said. “I could easily get through a family bag, then fib about it, saying the kids had eaten it.” Eventually, Jenefer reached her heaviest weight of st lb – although she said she still felt relatively confident.   But, in late , everything changed during a seemingly routine morning at her work in clinical services for the NHS. After taking the lt to avoid the stairs, she saw herself in the mirror and felt asshe was seeing the change in her body for the first time. “I thought to myself, ‘You’re fat, you’re getting out of breath easily – you have to do something.’ I’d been getting all sorts of health problems like aching knees and ankles, terrible indigestion and high cholesterol,” she said. “I knew I had to change for the sake of my kids. It was never about confidence. Even at my biggest, I always tried to make the best of myself with makeup and having my hair done – but I didn’t want anything to happen to me. I had to think of Ethan and Eva.” But, since joining WW, she has now lost eight stone and, at the end of , also started regularly working out at a local gym. “It does take courage to walk in there when you aren’t a skinny Minnie, as you worry what people will say,” she said. “I started out with quite gentle exercise, but now I go five times a week and do more high intensity classes like spinning. “I never thought I’d be able to do that.” Her body overhaul has also meant Jenefer has more fun with her children.   “The best thing about it is being able to keep up with the kids more. I can go swimming with them, or bike rides at the weekend, she said. “We can even go to theme parks now, when, on two occasions in the past, I was too heavy for the rides and had to get off. It was the most mortying thing – one of those moments where everybody is staring, and you just want the ground to swallow you up. “Now, I don’t even have to think about it.” With the help of the WW app, Jenefer has transformed her eating habits too, downloading healthy recipes and ensuring she eats a balanced diet, aided by their Smartpoints system. The apps built-in barcode scanner also means Jenefer is able to check food whilst in the supermarket to see how many points it would be worth - and can even win prizes for sticking to her plan through WWs new WellnessWins reward programme.   Now, breakfast will be nutrient-packed overnight oats - a favourite with fitness bloggers - followed by fresh home-cooked meals, such as butternut squash shepherds pie or garlicky chicken with vegetables. “I have a busy le, but this regime is manageable for me. I can find recipes I like and make them quickly and easily,” she said. “Now, when I look back, I can’t quite believe it’s me in old photos. I walk much taller these days and feel very proud. “For my th birthday just gone, I even wore a black sleeveless jumpsuit. It’s something I never dreamed I’d see myself in, but I felt fantastic.”For information, visit www.weightwatchers uk"},{"url":null,"title":"pub owners brutal takedown customers","story":"NewsPub owners brutal takedown of customers one-star TripAdvisor reviewThe owner of the Hobgoblin in Bishopston, Bristol, delivered a scathing response to a review of the pubShareCommentsByTristan Cork:,  FEB Updated:,  FEB NewsThe Hobgoblin pub in Bishopston, Bristol\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA customer who left a one-star TripAdvisor review of a pub was given short shrt by the landlord in a blistering response. The customer had allegedly claimed she was a police officer and that her human rights were violated when staff refused to give her a free round of drinks when she dropped the previous round on the floor. She later took to TripAdvisor to claim that the pubs staff had taken a disliking to her group and had an issue with happy people, Bristol Live reports.In his scathing riposte, landlord James Aylfe asked the woman, Hows the head this morning , and claimed she had been kicked out of the Hobgoblin pub in Bristol. His reply is serving as another example of bar and restaurant owners hitting back at bad reviews.   The woman, registered on TripAdvisor as ‘Chloe A’ posted on the public review website on Saturday night after allegedly being kicked out of the venue.Her review was headed ‘unreasonable’, and complained the bar staff took her for being drunk, even though she said she wasn’t. She explained how she and four friends had entered the pub but her stay did not last long. “The staff took a disliking to us the second we walked in,” she wrote. “We are a group of five who haven’t seen each other since uni. “They told us we were too drunk despite not having any alcohol before entering the establishment. This pub clearly has an issue with happy people,” she added. At least that is the best interpretation of what Chloe A wrote on TripAdvisor, Bristol Live reported.She actually tapped in: “The staff good a disliking to use the second we walked in. We are a group of  who haven’t seen us since uni. They told us we were too drunk despite not having any alcohol before entering the establishmst. This pub clearly has an issue with happy people.” Hobgoblin owner James saw the review the next day, and claims he immediately recognised who Chloe A was from the night before. He decided to respond to set the record straight, and also back up his staff, who were allegedly left upset by the experience of dealing with Chloe.   James response on TripAdvisor began inquiring after her health, before saying she might not be able to remember exactly what happened. He explained things began well - she was served a round of drinks with no problem. But then Chloe A’s time in the Hobgoblin took something of a downward turn almost immediately, because as she carried them back to the table, she spilt all the drinks after ‘stumbling away from the bar, barging into another customer’ And it was at this point, according to James, it started getting a little weird, and rather unpleasant for the staff behind the bar. She ed to the bar and ‘aggressively demanded’ replacement drinks for free, James wrote. “At this point you began threatening a member of bar staff,” he wrote, followed up by a scathing remark. “You claimed to be a police officer and that you could arrest the member of staff . “You threatened tothe following day with senior officers to pursue this further and suggested that we were infringing on your human rights,” he added. But James went on to explain the effect this behaviour had on staff and other customers. One member of staff was reduced to tears, other customers complained about her behaviour, he said. And when the assistant manager asked Chloe A to leave, she was not going to go quietly. According to James, she ‘continued to remonstrate aggressively with my assistant manager threatening all manner of consequences, demanding he hand over the full names of the staff who had refused to serve you so you could sue them for breaching your human rights’. “So the thing is Chloe,what you say is true and you really werent drunk when you arrived, then what you are asking us to accept is that these are the actions of you as a sober person,” he added, before ending by stating he was ‘completely comfortable’ with how she was treated by his staff, and suggesting that she should perhaps come to the bar with an apology. Since he posted the response on the pubs Facebook page, it has gone viral. Bristol Live has messaged Chloe A, but is yet to receive a response. James said he took the decision to share his response as a show of support for the staff involved. We dont get many one-star reviews, in fact I think hers was the just the third, so mercully we havent particularly suffered from reviews like this, he told Bristol Live . I didnt want to make a big deal about it, but I didnt feel I could just leave it unanswered. What has been really nice is that the response from customers has been almost universally positive - its been really nice to see, and nice for the staff, becauseyou get a slightly unpleasant experience it can knock your confidence in dealing with people. What was also good was that a number of people commented that they were there and that the staff did really well and acted properly, he added. James Aylfes response in full Hi Chloe, Hows the head this morning  Id be surprisedyou can actually remember your behaviour last night so, just in case its a little foggy, lets have a recap, shall we  Although you were initially served a round of drinks, after you stumbled away from the bar and barged into another customer, dropping your drinks on the floor, we began to realise that you werent *entirely* sober. This assessment was further strengthened when you ed to the bar, aggressively demanding that your spilt drinks be replaced for free. You were refused. At this point you began threatening a member of bar staff. You claimed to be a police officer and that you could arrest the member of staff . You threatened tothe following day with senior officers to pursue this further and suggested that we were infringing on your human rights. In the cold light of this morning these were rather obviously the angry ravings of someone well in their cups but as funny as it sounds now, you were extremely aggressive and intimidating at the time. A number of other customers commented that your behaviour was inappropriate, and you reduced the member of bar staff to tears. Once we had discussed what had happened, we decided that frankly it would be bestyou all moved on and we informed you that we wouldnt be serving you any further. Instead of leaving quietly with your friends you continued to remonstrate aggressively with my assistant manager threatening all manner of consequences, demanding he hand over the full names of the staff who had refused to serve you so you could sue them for breaching your human rights. So the thing is Chloe,what you say is true and you really werent drunk when you arrived, then what you are asking us to accept is that these are the actions of you as a sober person. Im really not sure that paints you in a particularly flattering light either way and I am completely comfortable with how you were dealt with last night. As for where we go from here, Ill leave that up to you. Id suggest contrition and heartfelt apology as a bare minimum requirement to you being served here againbut you are, of course, free to seek to enforce your *ahem* human rights in the courtsyou are so determined.

Her beloved father, King George VI passed away in his sleep and she became the Queen. When the news was broken to Princess Elizabeth she was enjoying a holiday in Kenya with her husband, Prince Philip. The evening before, she had been taking pictures of the incredible wildle from their tree top hideaway, including baboons, elephants and even a warthog. The princess had even asked to eat her evening meal outside in the Treetops hotel so she could continue to take photographs into the night.   And she had even woke early the next day to capture two rhinos fighting at a watering hole nearby. The couple got ready to depart for the next stage of their tour, which should have also taken them to New Zealand and Australia. But first they were travelling to a fishing lodge called Sangana some  miles away. Back in England, at Sandringham, the Kings staff were preparing to wake him for the day. Despite his recent bout of ill health, he had been happy the previous day and had even been on a shoot with a friend.   His final acts were to play with his two grandchildren, Charles and Anne, and have dinner with his youngest daughter, Princess Margaret. James McDonald, the Kings valet, realised something was seriously wrong with the monarch when he ran him a bath and he didnt wake as he usually did. A doctor was called to the palace who confirmed the sad news that King George had passed away in his sleep. But the couples secluded and isolated location meant it was almost impossible to break the terrible news to the princess that her father was dead. Journalist Granville Roberts, who was covering the royal tour, was the first person to receive the news in Kenya.  After it had been announced the country, Roberts spotted a breaking news memo from Reuters confirming that the king was dead. He immediately told Prince Philips private secretary, Commander Michael Parker, who tuned into the BBC to confirm the news. The Duke of Edinburgh had been taking an afternoon nap and was stunned when he was woken told the sad news. And Prince Philip now had to work out how he would tell his we the tragic news that the father she adored had died and she was now Queen. Rather than tell his we in a formal setting, surrounded by their staff, Philip took her for a walk in the grounds of the lodge they were staying in.  It was a private moment for the couple while Elizabeth could be alone with her husband during her moment of grief. She was just -years-old. Ever aware of her public duty, Elizabeth immediately discussed the practicalities of herto England. But she also asked for an hour alone in her room. The Queenswas delayed for several hours due to a storm. Her staff also realised her mourning outfit had already been sent on by plane to the next stop on her royal tour.  When the royal plane touched down in London, a black dress was brought on board for her to change into before she emerged to the full glare of the press and public. Prime Minsiter Winston Churchill was in the welcome party to greet Britains new queen home. Her coronation took place the following year and the first ever to be televised. Queen Elizabeth II is now the longest-reigning monarch and became the first British monarch to celebrate her Sapphire Jubilee -  years on the throne - last year.

Still, personally, I don’t think it was one of my better games by any stretch.“It was my first game at the club, my first playing a dferent style of football and my first playing in dferent weather conditions and stuff like that.“It was all a learning curve, something to take from that game into future games.“I came up Thursday night, so I only had a day here before the game but I have high expectations and I like to set high standards.“When I don’t reach them, I’m disappointed.”The aim now is to show up well as he makes his home debut as Morton visit Tannadice and United try to get back to winning ways to keep in touch with leaders Ross County.And Seaman does admit this week has given him more time to do his homework on the opposition, saying: “Before Ayr the gaffer gave me a lot of clips of Ayr to watch so I had a fair idea of what they were going to do.“I was relatively ready for the game in a tactical aspect but I did only come up on Thursday night.“For this game against Morton we have been getting information throughout the week.

initiative could be served up across aberdeen","story":"Bosses of an innovative new food initiative hope it can eventually expand across Aberdeen.The Woodside Pantry, due to open to the public next Monday, offers a new way for people in financial trouble to get food.Led by Community Food Initiatives North East , the pantry offers an innovative subscription service to members and is the first of its kind to exist in Scotland.An annual subscription fee of £ and a £. supplement before every visit entitles members to take  items of their choice, including up to three exclusive items.Dave Simmers, the CEO of CFINE, hopes that –the scheme is successful – it can be rolled out to other regeneration areas across the city.Plans have also been hatched to create a pantry and clothes shop at the charity’s Poynenook Road headquarters.Mr Simmers said: “The Woodside Pantry is the first in Scotland, but we’re speaking with the Scottish Government and with Aberdeen City Council about investment to firstly establish a pantry at our premises, along with a clothes store.“Then what we want to do is to establish a network of community pantries across the city’s regeneration areas.”Mr Simmers said: “One of the most unfortunate parts of the past seven years has been the rise in foodbank use.“Our foodbank is up to more than  parcels daily, Monday to Friday. There’s a general agreement that it’s not very dignied.“The pantry is a way for people to access affordable food, but they’re paying for it.”Claire Whyte is a support worker at Fersands and Fountain Community Project, and also a partner in the pantry with CFINE.She said: “CFINE approached us with the concept, which is designed to replace foodbanks. We had a shop and a foodbank, and no one was really using the shop, but the foodbank was inundated.“It was the same at CFINE when they approached us, so I think it was just perfect timing.”Claire agreed with Mr Simmers that the pantry model is one that could spread beyond the boundaries of Woodside.She said: “CFINE want to roll several of these out across the city, so we’re really just the guinea pigs here.“They’re hoping to reach into every regeneration area, or at least most of them, in the city over the next few years.“This is just the start of something that is going to be much bigger in Aberdeen and hopefully across the country once we get this set up.”"},{"url":null,"title":"sister of dons legend pets loved neale he was like dr dolittle","story":"The sister of a Dons legend says renaming part of an animal centre in his honour is the perfect way to continue his legacy.Aberdeen FC icon Neale Cooper, a well-known animal lover, passed away last May aged just .A collection was held at his funeral with the money raised being donated to Mrs Murray’s Home for Stray Cats and Dogs in Seaton.A golf day at Trump International Golf Links was also auctioned off in memory of the midfielder, who was part of the side that beat Real Madrid to win the European Cup Winners’ Cup in .

In the second half, Rangers took the lead in  minutes but three minutes later Hibernian drew level.There were few chances in the remainder of the second half and at full time both teams were level at -.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13926204.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_18355078.jpg","title":"ayr united 2 inverness 3","story":"NewsAyr United  Inverness : John Roberston hails Somerset Park among best grounds in worldThe Inverness gaffer was full of praise for the old fashioned surroundings as his side clung on in the face of a stirring fightback.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN NewsNathan Austin puts Caley - up \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailJohn Robertson hailed Somerset Park as one of the best grounds in the WORLD after Caley held off a storming Ayr fightback. Inverness were three up and on easy street after a crazy opening  minutes which saw United gt-wrap the game. But a Lawrence Shankland inspired comeback almost grabbed a share of the spoils for Ian McCalls title contenders. A relieved Robertson said: Had it finished - you wouldnt have been surprised. Somerset Park is one of these grounds that sucks you inyou give them a snf. Its a good throwback and their fans make it intimidating and a good atmosphere for teams when you lose a goal. Its brilliant...one of the best grounds in the world to come and play your football. In the past we might have lost a game like this so Im delighted.  Ayr knew a win here would take them top of the Championship and started well with Robbie Crawford missing a good chance in the first minute. But they soon hit the self destruct button as their defence went AWOL to allow Nathan Austin in for a double before Liam Polworth rammed home a third. The game looked over with barely  minutes on the clock and shellshocked Ayr took time to regroup. Coventry-bound Michael Rose rocked the post with a header before Michael Moffat drew a fingertip save from Cammy Mackay. McCall turned to the bench at half time and introduced top gun Shankland who immediately turned the tide. He set up Declan McDaid to haul Ayr back into the contest with a close range finish eight minutes after the restart. And a resurgent Ayr thought they had a penalty when Carl Tremarco appeared to handle in the box but ref Nick Walsh waved away loud protests. United continued to pour forward as the clock ticked down and Shankland set up a grandstand finish when slamming home a  yard free kick with five minutes left.  But their comeback proved too little too late as Inverness clung on. Ayr boss McCall said: Im just gutted. Weve conceded three goals and at least two of them were gted with just crazy defending. And were the team with the best defensive record in the league. I think a draw would’ve been fair but it’s just one of those nights.

Gin and tonic anyone ” “Large ones all round!” To be serious though – I still can’t decide what made me angrier. The crass begging bowl letter – hoping to cash in on the biggest Burns day of the year  Or the fact that Burns Cottage has been allowed to fall into such a state that phrases like “damaged beyond repair” are even necessary  If we’re talking man’s insensitivity to man here – then last Friday’s NTS letter takes the bannock! Its contents have upset dozens of people I know – and judging by the reaction on social media, hundreds more that I don’t know. Nicky Cotter wrote: “NTS . . . put your hands in your pockets and get it fixed. If you can spend pound, on a wooden tree house at Culzean Castle – you can stump up pound, to fix one of the most historically and culturally signicant buildings in Scotland”. Spot on, sir. The NTS letter tells us that “time and Scotland’s wet winters have taken their toll”. Yes – that’ll be the  winters since Burns father William Burness built the cottage on . And during that period, it’s been thatched more times than Wayne Rooney’s balding napper. If the current thatch “has signicant tears and has worn away”, you have to askthe last thatching work was in some way inferior - orthe cottage needed re-thatched several years ago and the work was never undertaken  You then start wondering how the auld clay biggin’ managed to survive the  wet Scottish winters between the cottage being built and the National Trust for Scotland’s formation back in   The answer is fairly obvious. Back then – people looked after it! And you only have to look at the recent row over the deteriorating Burns Monument to start wonderingthe NTS is the right custodian of our Burns heritage  Burns Cottage is everything Mr Cotter said earlier . .. and more. It’s the most important building in Ayrshire – by a lang Scots mile. Every nook, cranny - and twig of its roof - should be the subject of a fingertip, annual inspection. And whatever work is required – at whatever cost – should be sanctioned immediately. In fact, I imagine that’s what ‘most people’ thought was already happening. But then we had last Friday’s mail . . . when ‘most people’ discovered to their horror that the north-west gable is starting to pull away from the rest of the cottage! If admission fees don’t cover the cost of Burns Cottage – then put them up! The last figures I have show , visitors in . Charging them an extra p would have reached the pound, required – with enough left over to putty the windows as well. So, I’m sorry, NTS.

Mark Kirkby, , almost killed passenger Kerrie Anne Monaghan when he finally crashed into a wall. Miss Monaghan was in Ayr Sherf Court on crutches to hear the sentence on her partner, who she is standing by. The court heard Kirkby did not even have a driving licence and Sherf John Montgomery banned him from holding one for four years. Depute fiscal Lindsay Bain told the court police spotted a silver Volvo being driven erratically from Barassie Street into Portland Street. The police car’s blue lights went on and Kirkby initially slowed down before increasing speed. He was hitting mph in Templehill before heading into Harbour Road. And Kirkby’s car was said to have taken off as he drove across a mini roundabout into Port Ranald Drive. He hit mph in North Shore Road, eventually crashing into a wall at the Beach Road Kilmarnock Road junction in Barassie. During the whole episode, which began around .am on October  last year, Kirkby drove dangerously through junctions and swerved round corners.  When the crash occurred the car’s airbags were deployed but this did not prevent Ms Monaghan’s horric injuries. She had to be cut out of the car by firefighters and suffered numerous fractures to her face, head, body and limbs. “Kerrie Anne Monaghan is very lucky to be alive,” said fiscal Ms Bain. The court also heard of offences committed by Kirkbywhose address was given as Barlinnie Prison, on June . This time he was in a grey Ford Mondeo around .am when police spotted the car stationary on the A near the Pennyburn Roundabout. Kirkby was unsteady on his feet and slurring his speech, although a breath test proved negative. A a blood test found substances identied as cocaine and benzocaine. Defence lawyer Hugh Duncan said Kirkby’s relationship with Ms Monaghan was still ongoing. “He accepts full responsibility,” said the lawyer. “He comes across as remorseful to the injuries his partner suffered and to potential harm he could have done to others.” Mr Duncan said Kirkby had been remanded in custody since October , had undergone a detox programme, and had come to a realisation of his mental health issues. Sherf John Montgomery told Kirkby: “You drove dangerously at high speed for an extended period. I see no option but a custodial sentence.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnHMP BarlinnieVolvoAyrCourtsJusticeTroon"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article11461688.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/ymr_ayp_141112Elliots_02.jpg","title":"elliots prestwick evolve rebrand vics","story":"NewsElliots in Prestwick to \"evolve\" with rebrand as Vics  The VineBosses at Buzzworks say the bar and restaurant must \"evolve\" as part of its transformation.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  FEB NewsBuzzworks managing director, Kenny Blair, is promising bold changes at Elliots \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailOne of Ayrshire’s biggest hospitality venues has closed for a “complete transformation”.

Kenny added: “We’ve seen an appetite in the industry for more cool and modern pubs and, similarly to our T-Bar in Ayr, Vic’s will be a traditional bar with a twist. “This will both suit the local market and sit alongside our excellent new restaurant offering in Prestwick. “Our vision is to create the best day-to-night venue in Scotland and we are confident Vic’s  The Vine will match those expectations.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyrPrestwickAyr News"},{"url":null,"title":"former royal hotel ayr sold","story":"NewsFormer Royal Hotel in Ayr is sold at auctionBuilding is branded the most dangerous in the townShareByGary Fanning:,  FEB NewsRoyal Hotel Ayr\"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe former Royal Hotel, which has been described as the most dangerous building in Ayr, has been sold at auction. The iconic property, near Ayr Central, went under the hammer last Thursday. Wilsons Auctions Land and property sales executive, Lorren Mullen were managing the auction of the ex hotel.

Builders Dawn Developments wanted to build a new block in its place to home a gym and shops. But the plan was cut short as council planners want the hotel preserved or refurbished instead. And the sale happened after concerns about the safety of the former hotel were discussed at this month’s Fort, Seafield, and Wallacetown Community Council held at Ayr Town Hall. One community councillor said: “It is the most dangerous building in Ayr. ” It wasn’t the only empty building t discussed at the meeting. The meeting heard how young people were putting themselves in danger by gaining access to Belleisle House One said: ”If we can show concern then the council can take action and step in..” And the meeting was told how youngsters were “masquerading around” Strathdoon House.

Now the proposition has got a whole lot dferent. Pet Heaven, a crematorium for family animals, has just opened in Ayr. And businessman Forbes Robertson believes it is the answer for many families who want to give their four legged - or two-legged in the case of birds - friends a splendid send-off. No expense has been spared in an -month project at the former commercial garage site in West Sanquhar Road. Area MP Bill Grant performed the official opening ceremony last week. The lavishly decorated gilded interior includes a parlour where families can pay their last respects. Entrepreneur Forbes, who has business interests throughout the area, revealed up to  people can attend the pet funeral services . Mourners can watch as their pet recedes behind the final curtain at the close of the service, similar to what would happen in a human ceremony at Masonhill. As yet Pet Heaven cannot handle horses, but the biggest of dogs to cats, hamsters and birds. There is a tea and coffee service as well as any choice of music desired and a book of remembrance in the reception area.  Much of the interior decoration has been gathered by Forbes, a keen antique hunter and auction room collector. The company will offer a collection service as well as provide a selection of remembrance urns for ashes. It seems no expense is spared by some dog lovers in the UK and recently a couple spent pound on a full funeral including a horse drawn glass hearse. Forbes said: “People sometimes care more about their animals than humans. “A farmer who contacted me askedhis dog goes before him, the animal would be cremated here and I will store the ashes. “He told me his lawyer would be in touch as he wanted buried with his dog. “Pets are loyal, they don’t steal from you and are there first thing in the morning and last thing at night.” MP Bill Grant said Pet Heaven was a signicant investment for the area. He said: “I am sure this will be welcomed by pet owners from all over the southwest, pet owners who have lost their best friend. “To have a dignied departure for that pet who has been their friend - in some cases for  years - is a great service. “The set-up Mr Robertson has here is wonderful and I think he can be proud of it. “That last journey for pets will be full of dignity and respect from Pet Heaven and its staff. “Indeed my family had a wee dog Blackie for  years and I don’t mind admitting, then a senior fire officer, that I cried unashamedly for an hour at the loss of our companion”.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyrPetsSanquharAyr News"},{"url":null,"title":"weather knocks out weekend shutdown","story":"NewsWeather knocks out weekend shutdown of the main ASub zero temperatures have played havoc with road teamsShareByStephen Houston:,  FEB News\"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailRoad chiefs have axed major roadworks which would have seen the main A completely closed from pm tonight.

to Campbeltown and ing to Glasgow, or vice versa.We would like the reinstatement of the radar system to assist landings in adverse weather conditions.As there is a separate service between Islay and Edinburgh we suggest that Campbeltown should be included as we also have key tourist attractions such as distilleries and three fantastic -hole golf courses and high-standard accommodation.We would like to see the service continue with a timetable with low ticket prices to allow the full day in Glasgow for NHS appointments, business and shopping trips and the reinstatement of seven days a week flights to enhance business and tourism.In addition, we want national advertising campaigns inclusive of timetables to promote the area for increased passenger numbers, including weekend breaks.These aspirations are very much in keeping with the council’s Community Plan Single Outcome Agreement   in particular relating to National Policy Priorities i.e. economic recovery, growth and employment.We are also very much aware of organisations which have worked hard to promote the long-term outcomes in the Community Plan.The communities of Kintyre need a modern connectivity system, fit for purpose,this area is to have any credibility in the big wide world.Decent flight connections to the major hubs of Glasgow and Edinburgh would be a start.I have confirmed the Scottish Government is

to study a wider choice of subjects.At an open information evening last week, head teacher David Fyfe updated parents on the progress the school has made since its HM inspection last year, and spoke about plans to increase the number of subjects currently on offer, as suggested by inspectors.In order to provide six subjects in the senior phase, the school is considering increasing the number of periods in the week to seven a day.Consultation with pupils and staff began in August last year, and Mr Fyfe emphasised how much the opinions of parents are valued in the process.The school is looking at a choice of two new timetable models: Monday to Friday with seven periods, giving  periods a week or three days a week with seven periods and two days a week with six, giving  periods a week.At the moment, there are  periods a week.In addition to the timetable change, S and S students will maximise their time in school instead of being able to #sign out#.Pupils will be encouraged to study additional subjects, assist junior students in class, and volunteer in the community to gain Saltire Awards.Special arrangements will still be possible to enable other wider achievements such as gaining a driving licence.Mr Fyfe said: #We want our young people to make the best use of their time at school and gain valuable experiences which will benefit them when they leave.#S and S pupils will soon be required to give their initial option choices to allow the school to judge demand for each subject, although these will not be final.Mr Fyfe also shared the results of a parents and partners survey on the school#s visions and values and #rights respecting schools# charter.He said: #So far we have had  responses but there is still time for you to let us hear your views.#We really value input from parents so it is vital that as many people as possible come forward and make their opinions known.#The survey showed that . per cent of parents felt that the school#s aims, outlined in last week#s Courier, either fully capture what is important to the school, or capture it well.The survey also found, however, that . per cent of those who responded felt that they had #not been

midpoint of winter, half way between the shortest day and the spring equinox.For Christians it has a particularly special meaning as it was  days after the birth of Jesus and the day when, according to Jewish custom, his grateful parents took him to the temple to give thanks to God.We believe that Jesus is the light of the world who will guide us through our own dark times.Many customs have grown around Candlemas and one of the most interesting came from Scotland.In the olden days, Candlemas was the day when children brought candles to school so that the classrooms would have light on dull days.As time went on, gas lighting took over from candlelight and the children brought money to school with which the teacher was supposed to buy sweets for the children.The child who brought in the most money was declared Candlemas King or Queen and they ruled for six weeks.They had the power to make one whole afternoon a week a playtime and to excuse anyone they wished from any form of punishment.I don#t think this will catch on in Argyll!I think it is a lovely custom to take a child to church or temple for a blessing and to give thanks to God for their birth.I have the privilege of

It was a cold day but my friend, who is skilled in bushcraft, had brought his portable fire pit with him.We searched for drtwood and sat by the fire, roasting marshmallows and warming our hands. It was a short walk but dramatic rock formations loomed above us, making it feel like a real adventure. The kids climbed them and explored the rocky beach, where once there had been an open-air bathing pool.On our , we went through a small tunnel-like arch. I stopped for a moment, suddenly taken by the view. The ruins of Dunbar Castle were beautully framed by the archway. Locals call this archway the keyhole and I reflected that the term is a perfect name.When we look through a keyhole, our vision is narrowly focussed. Such was the effect here. It cast a visual spotlight on what is left of what was once a mighty fortress.The kids trundled on before me, noticing smaller wonders: a frozen worm on the path, a sea shell and interesting-looking stones. But I stood for some moments, taking in the view beyond and thinking of what stories those old stones of the castle could tell.Many people pass this way every day, both locals and visitors. Itrsquos a section of the John Muir Way. I have often been with my family to Dunbar Leisure Pool and the harbour and town. But somehow I had missed this short but spectacular nearby walk until this day.Dunbar Castle is now but a fallen-down ruin. Indeed, itrsquos dficult to imagine what it once was. But the weathered sandstone castles on the shoreline built by nature still stand defiant, somehow reminding us of their greater permanence in the face of human transience. But as I stood looking at the ruins, the keyhole focussed my thoughts as well as my vision.History is also viewed through a keyhole, a very narrow one. The lives and events of the castle were lived in most part unrecorded by it. The spotlight of history has illuminated only brief moments, and even then the characters have been only those deemed lsquoimportantrsquo.There are moments where the view through the narrow keyhole of history has included insights to untold stories. The bravery of Black Agnes, as she defied the siege in , is one of those. With her husband away, she was in charge of this important fortress during war with England. She refused to give up the castle, even in the face of bombardment and attempts to starve her small garrison into submission. Her mocking of her besiegers by dusting down the battlements with her maids after a bombardment is an image seared in legend.But itrsquos a chink of light on a huge untold story we are led to believe by historyrsquos silence that women were insignicant players in events. For sure they were oppressed and put down by a system that centred on male power, but they are half of humanity and at least half the story.As the actions of Black Agnes reveal, even with such constraints put on them, women were there, part of events and often refusing to accept their assigned role.The le of Mary Queen of Scots has always been for me an example of this. Yes, she was privileged and powerful by birth, but because of this history took notice of her.Despite all the political and religious challenges she faced, it was her womanhood which men deemed her main failing. And so she was judged by dferent standards. Had she behaved with the morals of her father she would not have lasted five minutes in power. But no one raised an eyebrow because he was a man.But more than this, even though Mary was the monarch, her royal authority was deemed diluted and even less legitimate merely because she was a woman.So she understood she needed to find a husband to bring her royal authority to full strength in a country full of powerful and bullying misogynist men.She chose the dashing young Darnley, and the fact that he turned out to be dross was not, in my opinion, Maryrsquos fault. How easy it is to blame a woman for a manrsquos failings. She was taken in by him it was he who was the failure, not her.Thatrsquos what Irsquove always maintained, despite the protestations of my tutors at university. And her third husband Bothwell, well he was a disappointment as well.It is the stones of Dunbar,they could speak, who could tell us of the truth of his forced union with Mary. She had been taken there by him in April . The circumstances of this still remain debated. Was she abducted by him as later claimed, or did she go willingly It was also claimed she was raped and forced to marry Bothwell soon afterwards to save her honour . This idea has been disputed by some because Mary is said to have miscarried with twins while imprisoned at Lochleven Castle some months after, suggesting a relationship with Bothwell even before Darnleyrsquos murder. So a woman cannot be abused by a man she has had a relationship with  Really If they could talk, the stones of Dunbar would whisper the truths of those events in , and the despair and desperation of a strong and clever woman whose destiny was stolen mainly because of her sex.These were my thoughts as I stood looking through the keyhole towards Dunbar Castle. Suddenly, my daughter Manja broke my trance by wiggling the frozen worm in front of me. I smiled and thought to myself that thankfully times have changed since the days when the castle was a fortress.But sometimes, I fear, not as much as we think they have."},{"url":null,"title":"new-fidra-gin-hoping-for-east-lothian-base","story":"Fidra Gin is the brainchild of Emma Bouglet and Jo Brydie and is currently based at Ballencrieff and Aviemore.The duo came together to create the juniper berry-based drink and have already enjoyed immediate success, with the product already available in a number of Edinburgh restaurants.Now they are hoping to make it  per cent based in the county, with plans under way to find suitable premises.Emma said: ldquoWe pick all the botanicals in East Lothian and, at the moment, we use a still in Aviemore.ldquoA friend has lent us his still for the time being so we can get enough momentum behind us and bring the whole operation to East Lothian.ldquoWe have potentially secured a premise in East Lothian.

It will also advise on any further, long-term solution to the issues at the beach.The groyne at the northern end of the beach will provide protection over part of the northern section of the seawall, with the potential to develop a higher beach in front of the wall.Finally, armour stones will be put in place along Lamer Street to protect the seawall.Discussions on how to revitalise the East Beach, which was once a popular tourist attraction, have been ongoing for more than five years.Pippa Swan, chairwoman of the townrsquos community council, has been heavily involved in the talks to find a solution.She was hopeful the latest measure would help and told community councillors: ldquoThe rock breakwater, the design has been worked on for more than two years.ldquoIt is now the preferred design solution and is the subject of a planning application.ldquoThere has been a lot of chatter about the East Beach and I wanted you all to be aware of what is going on and to be able to speak with some authority.Stones weighing anywhere between three and six tonnes will be used as part of the project, with work expected to take place throughout the summer and into the autumn.Mrs Swan was expecting heavy machinery to be on the site and said: ldquoIt will require big machines, at least -tonne trucks, moving these rocks around.ldquoThe East Beach will be the site of quite a lot of activity over the summer and we are bound to get some negative comments.

The doorsquocot is a clue that once a residence of some signicance stood here. It was called Dolphingstone Castle. Nothing now visibly remains of the castle, but around  years ago ruins were still to be seen.It was at one time an elegant mansion, but before that, on the same site, an older castle once stood ndash now all gone, and the structures of modernity are hemming in what is left of this ancient site. A wave of new housing laps at its walls to the west, the A traffic roars past on its south, and roads surround it on other quarters.One wondersthis small slice of East Lothian history will survive the developers. I hope it does. It is a small, historic fingerprint and gives a mysterious glimpse into our countyrsquos past, in an area now being carpeted with thousands of new houses.Earlier maps suggest that Dolphingstone Castle was surrounded by woodland. So perhaps the planting of a small wood or orchard within the old walls could create an island of both nature and history amidst the tide of urbanising development in this area.Up above on the ridge of Falside Hill to the south, the restored Farsquoside Castle looks down on the developments below . It sits like an eagle perched on a high ridge, observing the land below.How dferent the landscape it surveys would have been in  when, according to an old story, a small force of hand-picked warriors descended from the castle under the cover of darkness.It was just past midnight when they left, guided by a slither of moon. It was a raiding party, bent on revenge and heading for Preston Tower in what is now Prestonpans.Tradition tells us a feud had existed between the houses of Farsquoside and Preston for some years. The cause of the feud was the breaking down of walls between the two estates and the animals of each side grazing on the land of the other. Regular, and sometimes violent, clashes had taken place.But then Hamilton of Prestonrsquos livestock had been poisoned, or so it seemed. They had drunk from a burn which flowed from Farsquoside and it was assumed the water had been deliberately poisoned. Hamilton of Preston Tower, making no investigation, sent his men on a raid of violent retribution.Farsquoside Castle was attacked and blood was shed. This was the act which the select band of warriors who had set forth from Farsquoside were to avenge.In darkness, they filed down from the ridge on a path now known as Whinney Loan. This took them down to where the new houses are now being built on the southern edge of Wallyford.From here, great care was needed lest they be seen or heard. Dolphingstone Castle lay ahead and although their grievance was not with the occupants of Dolphingstone, early discovery could ruin the element of surprise.So the raiders veered north of Dolphingstone, by way of Prestoungrange, and at dawn, with the smell of the salt pans in their noses, they set about their vengeful work.Screams and running bairns alerted the occupants of Preston Tower. Armed men were ready, for this raid was expected, although not from this direction.The walls of Preston Tower held the attackers at bay but the people of the village suffered the worst of the slaughter. What senseless violence: neighbours separated only by the brae of a hill had been whipped up into a hateful frenzy against each other. Gradually the raiders melted away, back up the hill, with blooded swords.But hate builds on hate and the reckoning was not slow in coming. The very next day, Hamilton of Preston led a force westwards. It arrived by the walls of Dolphingstone Castle and then rounded past them to head up the hill towards Farsquoside, crossing where now the A speeds by.No attempt at surprise was required, this was to be an open fight. The Lord of Farsquoside had arranged his men along the top of the ridge, looking down on the approaching force of Hamiltonrsquos men. The order to charge was given and the men of Farsquoside poured down the slope.The leaders of both sides were in the thick of the fighting. It was the Lord of Farsquoside who fell, pulled from his horse and hacked to death by Hamiltonrsquos men.Seeing the death of their leader, the men of Farsquoside fled back to the castle. But the Lady of Farsquoside, in shock and rage at the death of her husband, rallied the men. She led them out of the castle in a furious charge as the sun began to set, forcing Hamiltonrsquos men to flee back to Preston.The battle, or skirmish as some would call it, was over, and the feud had reached its bloody climax. Soon after it was discovered an infectious disease had stricken the cattle, not poisoned water. Cattle on both sides had been equally affected. No one was to blame.How easy it had been to make enemies out of neighbours based on  assumptions. We are told Hamilton attempted to make amends. But the dead could not rise and the Lady of Farsquoside was said to be devastated at the loss of her husband. We can be sure others of lesser status suffered no less.This feud was over little remains to record it except tradition passed down, captured and retold by th-century writers such as P MrsquoNeill and Robert Seton, from whose works this account is garnished.Preston Tower still stands in Prestonpans, in a ruined but still defiant state. Farsquoside, much restored, is a visual delight still keeping watch atop the ridge. But only those feint hinds of Dolphingstone Castle remain, most of it lost to time and mystery just like the details of this story.But all the more reason to preserve and value them, I think."},{"url":null,"title":"betting-businesses-told-to-monitor-gambling-habits-of-people-on-benefits","story":"East Lothian Councilrsquos licensing board has approved a new gambling policy which puts the responsibility for policing the risks of betting in the hands of new licensees.Among the issues that new applicants will have to prove they have addressed before being given a licence will be monitoring ldquogaming trends that may reflect benefit payments, ldquoidentying and reporting attempts to launder money on premises and ldquoprotecting vulnerable people and those with gambling dependencies.Approving the new draft policy, which will govern the boardrsquos licensing decisions for the next three years, board members raised concerns about a lack of legislation to stophigh streets in deprived communities becoming lined with betting shops.Councillor Lachlan Bruce, Preston Seton Gosford ward member, called for current laws which prevent local authorities from refusing a licence to betting businesses because of overprovision to be changed.He said that it was impossible to walk down some town centre streets without being confronted by gambling premises offering promotions and deals.Mr Bruce told the meeting: ldquoThere are high streets in East Lothian where [betting shops] seem to be every  yards.ldquoThere is an issue where it is impossible to avoid gambling premises.The board was told that the Gambling Act  precluded using overprovision as a reason to refuse a licence for a betting shop.The councilrsquos new policy will put the onus for local risk assessments on applicants who want to open licensed gambling premises ranging from bookies to casinos, bingo halls, tracks and travelling fairs.Board member Councillor Jane Henderson, North Berwick Coastal, spoke of the dangers of gambling addiction, saying: ldquoGambling is an extremely destructive situation and sometime it does not get the headlines other things do.ldquoBut it crosses all walks of le and we, as a board and as iniduals, have a moral duty to recognise it is as much an illness as anything  and anything we can do to help should be taken very seriously.Councillor Willie Innes, council leader and Preston Seton Gosford ward member, cautioned that only a minority of people who gambled were affected by addiction and for others it was simply an activity they enjoyed.He told board members: ldquoWhen I first joined the council, gambling was a backstreet activity with premises down back alleys and it took us a long time to persuade the industry to come onto the high street.Mr Innes said that the new policy, which set out additional risk assessment requirements for applicants, sent ldquoa clear message to both the industry and those concerned about it."},{"url":null,"title":"prominent-cockenzie-campaigner-larry-tomlins-remembered","story":"Larry Tomlins, who was chairman of Cockenzie West Tenants and Residents Association, was involved in campaigns to reduce speeding and upgrade local park facilities in his community.The grandfather-of-two was an active supporter of the recent fight to implement speeding restrictions outside new housing at The Chimneys, Cockenzie, and helped oversee the trial and subsequent introduction of  miles per hourspeed limits in the Whin Park area of the village.Mr Tomlins, , grew up in Ayrshire and moved to Cockenzie more than  years ago, where he raised his family with we Ann.A consultant engineer, he ran his own successful business and still found the time to be an active member of his local community.He was a founding member of the tenantsrsquo and residentsrsquo association, which helped improve Whin Park for local families.Ward councillor Fiona OrsquoDonnell said: ldquoLarry made a huge contribution to the tenantsrsquo and residentsrsquo association and the wider community.

Cities ndash thanks to parks and gardens, public and private ndash can be more wooded than the national average. Tree cover was measured at % or above in Perth, Inverness and Stirling.But it falls to just under % in Dundee, % in Edinburgh, % in Glasgow and just % in the city of Aberdeen.A spokesman for Glasgow City Council: ldquoThere are multiple benefits that can potentially be drawn from planting new woodland on vacant or derelict land.ldquoUrban woodland assists with carbon reduction, enhances bioersity in places which maybe otherwise deficient, helps to manage flood risk and acts as a barrier to city noise among many other positive environmental impacts.ldquoBut planting on derelict land also leads to aesthetic improvements for communities, while encouraging increased physical activity as people make greater use of previously unattractive spaces.The Glasgow spokesman said: ldquoThere are derelict sites that naturally regenerate into woodland with tree species such as birch, willow and alder commonly taking hold along with ground flora and urban wildle.ldquoWhether to pursue planting or allow natural growth would require assessment on a site-by-site basis.ldquoAn appropriate balance would also have to be struck between fostering urban woodland and ensuring development of sites could continue, particularly for housing.Experts stress the healing powers of trees - both for people and for land and air. However, city planners are also excited about the ability of small urban woodlands to protect against flooding. A  per cent rise in tree cover, they say, can reduce surface off-flow by %.George Anderson of the Woodland Trust, which champions native trees, said: ldquoWe need more trees and they donrsquot have to be in the open countryside.ldquoAside from the broad positives boosting bioersity, fighting climate change and cutting flooding, urban trees create huge direct benefits for human health and wellbeing.ldquoWe breathe easier and think happier with trees nearby.ldquoThere is huge potential for Glasgow to improve citizensrsquo lives through planting derelict land. Successive Scottish and UK governments have pursued rural reforestation, often despite opposition from those who want to keep Scotlandrsquos hill as they are, gamekeepers and mountaineers.Tree cover across the country has gone from around % at beginning of the th century to % at its end, largely thanks to commercial timber plantations and the state-owned Forestry Commission.There is currently a target to raise that area to % by .

The emotional case for independence certainly exists for many but, on any other level, and to many more, it makes no sense whatsoever, so Irsquom certain an updated paper would add much to the debate.Stuart Brennan, Netherburn Avenue, Glasgow.MARIANNE Taylor correctly points out that \"the moral and democratic case for independence gets stronger and clearer by the day\" but worries that the economic case is harder to, but the choice facing Scotland is either to stay within a UK adrt on the sidelines of Europe, or to seize the opportunities of remaining within the European Union, the worlds largest single market, as an independent nation. As for the oft-raised situation of an independent Scotland trading with rUK, the main stumbling block to the UKs withdrawal deal with the EU is the sensitivities of the situation in Northern Ireland which do not apply to Scotland why would a Brexit-damaged UK want to turn its back on securing a trade deal with Scotland  Of course, spite might rear its ugly head, but surely pragmatism would see the advantages to both countries of establishing a sensible and healthy relationship in trading arrangements and so much .What we dont need at the next independence referendum is yet another dollop of Project Fear, or a hollow Vow, or wild promises stuck on the side of a bus. Like Ms Taylor, I welcome Angus Robertsons think tankand believe that Progress Scotland will indeed progress Scotland, and provide realistic and sound proposals to allow the electorate to make an informed choice when the time comes.

And now we learnthat of an additional pound million cash coming to Holyrood from the UK Government, Finance Secretary Derek Mackay has decided in his wisdom that poundm will go into Scottish reserves. In the meantime councils have been dipping into their dwindling reserves to enable them to maintain at least some of their non-statutory services.How generous of Mr Mackay to give local authorities the option to increase our council tax by up to . per cent and charge us for workplace parking.Bridget Wilcox,Beechbank Cottage, Nine Mile Burn, Midlothian.DURING the  independence referendum we were often warned that a Yes vote would lead to Scotland ending up outside the EU while England would continue ever more to enjoy membership.

He squandered his opportunities, fell into hard times and came back chastened to his father who forgave him his errors and welcomed him home.Could the same fate await the UK, which demands sovereignty and striking out on its own I doubt that the EU will be as charitable and forgiving as the father of the prodigal sonwe fall on hard times and come back chastened, seeking our former relationship with the EU.Denis Bruce, Rannoch Gardens, Bishopbriggs.ITS increasingly clear there wont be a second EU referendum, plus, while Article  may be delayed, it wont be revoked.

In addition, D photogrammetry is taking place so that digital D models of the wreck can be produced. By using these techniques, in essence, the team is able to digitally bring HMS Royal Oak to the surface.Survey organiser and licence-holder Emily Turton said: “The wreck of HMS Royal Oak is the final resting place of  men and boys. As the most intact underwater dreadnought-era battleship, she has an architectural grandeur befitting of any national memorial. However, at the smaller end of the scale, artefacts pertaining to everyday le on board are scattered around the site, bringing home the human story of those lost. The site is peaceful, yet vibrant, and supports a thriving marine eco-system.

The planning application also covers landscaping and future restoration of the site.The application process is being handled by consultants AECOM.The council-owned quarry currently supplies stone and aggregate materials for Council roads and building projects as well as the local construction industry.  It extracts Devonian Flagstone which is highly suited to a range of crushed aggregate products, in particular as roadstone and aggregates, used for producing asphalt for road construction and maintenance, with the quarry being the only active producer of asphalt in Orkney.The activity at the quarry generates an income for the Council which is reinvested to provide and protect some of the vital services we provide in Orkney.The current quarry area is heading towards the end of its use and an expansion would safeguard supply of materials. Current output ranges between , and , tonnes of rock per year andapproved, the ha expansion will release approximately  million tonnes of additional resources, sufficient for another  years of production.Full details are available on the Council website at http:www.orkney.gov.uk Council C long-term-development-of-cursiter-quarry-in-firth.htmPersons wishing to provide comments on the proposed development can do so by writing to AECOM at fraser.blackwood@aecom or by post to Fraser Blackwood, APEX ,  Haymarket Terrace, Edinburgh, EH HD by  February .OIC says that, at this stage, comments made to Aecom are for the purposes of assisting with the scheme design and EIA process and as such are not representations to the Planning Authority.

Gowns of silk ‘camelot’ were made for eight girls in her household, embellished with tanny velvet, a dull brownish purple colour which enjoyed a great deal of prestige in the th century, and double lined with taffeta.Prophetik designs which have been worn by everyone from Kings of Leon to Taylor Swt are often inspired by the dressmakers of the Civil War period who worked with what was in front of them, fashioning beautul gowns that were later taken apart to recreate new dresses – sustainability born out of necessity.Speaking about the show Jeff Garner says, “Women of the Crown defines a past when young kings had regents and strong queens ruled countries and inspired arts. Mary, Queen of Scots brought the beauty of fabrics to lighten the castles of Scotland.”The retail range produced by Historic Environment Scotland, in conjunction with Prophetik, is set to be showcased in the Queen Anne room during the catwalk show. The range features many of the fabrics and styles reminiscent of the th century, which grew in popularity thanks to Mary, Queen of Scots. The inventory, taken on  March  at the request of the Earl of Morton, who had resigned the regency, listed about  gowns – but more intriguingly, also included  or more fashion dolls known as poupines or ‘pippens’ in Scotland.A miniature bed and a horse-litterin the same group of objects belonging to Mary suggest that some of the dolls had been simply luxurious toys however. Due to their elaborate design, play may have been limited to the creation of tableaux rather than the recreation of domestic activities in doll’s houses. While dolls were traditionally considered as children’s playthings, with home-made rag dolls referred to in the th-century Scots poem Ratis Ravingused as puppets or as performing objects, by the second half of the th century, fashion dolls for privileged children were imported into England and Scotland. These were made of wood and papier mache and were presumably very expensive, commissioned primarily as fashion dolls for gting purposes. Carefully kept as luxurious and finely crafted objects, fashion dolls were intended as international courtly gts, from which garments were made up and worn, often as a compliment to a foreign court.Medieval and renaissance fashion dolls were sent between courts clothed in detailed miniature representations of current fashion, seemingly for reproducing the style of another court but perhaps exchanged in courtesy. A king might write for a doll to dress the ladies of his court, or a prospective bride might request a doll dressed in the fashion of her prospective husband’s court, just as in  Francis I requested a doll from the fashionable Isabella d’Este of Ferrara to dress the ladies of his court. She was known for her elegance and personal style and eagerly sought information on the dress of other courts. A fashion doll with a high degree of verisimilitude was more useful than a two-dimensional representation for exhibiting a new style of dress. Dolls could present a three-dimensional experience of fashionable garments, superior to drawings, paintings and prints. For this reason, the clothes were meticulously and accurately reproduced in a smaller scale, intended as an exemplar for others to copy.Adding to the diplomatic accounts and portraits, there is evidence that the dolls’ outfits would have been exquisitely crafted by tailors to display the new trends in materials, accessories and dress styles. In September , the leading court tailor Jacques de Seulis made grey and silver clothes for the dolls listed at Edinburgh Castle, permitting them to serve as mannequins showcasing female fashions. As well as an expression of style, the role of dolls could be extended into one of aides-memoire when they entered collections, serving to represent the manners and politics of other courts.The dolls are grouped in the inventory with items that may have formed the contents of Mary’s cabinet room including some exotic items such as the beak and feathers of rare birds, and her embroideries. A similar mix of objects can be found in the inventories of other women’s cabinets of this era: Catherine de Medici, Mary’s mother-in-law, also kept a group of dolls in armoires with luxury objects such as Eastern leather and Venetian masks, Chinese lacquers, antique medals, shell and coral, as did the family of Charles de Cossé Brissac, Marshall of France. These collections suggest that they were, or had become, curiosities held in the same kind of regard. Ultimately, the dolls were tokens of international affection, and were exchanged between powerful women across Renaissance Europe as a way of keeping abreast of the latest fashions. They were an expression of authority, imposing the queen’s style on the court and its followers and demonstrated the look of the day to the aristocratic women of higher rank who attended court as visitors and had their own tailors. This would result in women across Europe looking to Mary, for the latest fashion and trends.Natasha Troitino, head of retail for HES, says, “We are delighted to have this unique opportunity to work with an haute couture international designer to produce a capsule range of products inspired by Mary, Queen of Scots.

These moves are hugely intensive and provide a short-term boost for local workers and the economy. Such projects also develop the expertise and credibility of Scotland’s already impressive pool of financial services talent. : Nicola Sturgeon: Real and growing risk of no-deal BrexitHowever, that fact remains that much high-value work generated by exporting financial services to the EU is draining out of the Scottish economy permanently.On the other hand, there are new opportunities emerging as a direct result of the Brexit effect – for example firms are bringing some foreign operations back to Britain. Whilst the inward surge is not expected to match what is being lost, we are seeing a trend of UK and foreign firms relocating parts of their business to the UK to ensure they can continue to support their UK customer base. This includes many UK insurers who had previously set up offshore subsidiaries.The driver for larger UK firms moving operations to the EU is to satisfy their European customers, who are seeking assurances that there will be no disruption to their services in the event that no withdrawal deal is reached.However, some customers have raised concerns about whether they will get the same levels of consumer protection as offered in the UK – such as the protection of the Financial Services Compensation Scheme.We are advising a range of organisations, including a number of high-growth, financial technology businesses, who are planning their international growth strategy with Brexit in mind. We are seeing particularly high levels of activity in the payments industry. Many expanding fintech businesses in Scotland have an ambitious global outlook.: Brexit: Queen to be evacuated in event of no-deal, reports claimIt would be much simpler for them to grow abroadthe EU wasn’t to suddenly become a ‘foreign’ jurisdiction. On the other hand, many of these firms already have processes in place to manage a truly international business. For those companies, the potential barriers to exporting financial services to EU are relatively simple to plan for.International trade in financial services is particularly restricted by the requirement of firms to be authorised to undertake regulated activities. This is why Brexit is a serious issue for the financial sector to contend with. Currently we are part of a common regulatory regime, so any firm authorised to provide financial services in one EU member state can effectively get permission to conduct business in any other member state, using a mechanism known as ‘passporting’. When we are no longer in the EU, UK firms will lose their rights to passport their permissions to the EU. UK firms will be subject to the same restrictions as other firms from where across the globe.The UK will be eligible to apply for equivalence in a limited number of regulated activities, but this process is not automatic. It requires the approval of the European Commission, which could take considerable time and be subject to political obstacles. If an equivalence is approved for the UK, there would be a requirement to maintain close alignment to the EU financial services regulations. The Commission has the discretion to withdraw their approval at any time, which would provide little certainty for UK firms.On the flipside, any EU firm wanting to trade here will have to satisfy the UK’s own rules. Even though no deal has been agreed at the moment, the UK Government has thus far given assurances that regardless of what happens we’ll continue to give EU firms the opportunity to continue trading whilst applying for UK permissions up to March . They must noty the UK regulators in advance of Brexit to get the temporary permissions, but this gives more certainty to EU firms trading here than the other way around as it stands.If we are looking for positives where there are some short-term benefits of a weaker pound, which helps keep inward investment into the UK on the radar as an appealing prospect, but there is a bigger foreign exchange risk for the future should our economy and currency value begin to erge signicantly from mainland Europe.We have been helping our clients to review their businesses in order to better understand how Brexit will affect them. In some cases, depending on their set-up, it turns out after a thorough analysis that there are few specic risks.However, the process has been useful as a prompt to look at their operations in detail to see where there could get more general business efficiencies and opportunities.

And when people, as I believe they will in due course, opt for Scotland to be an independent country, that should be on the basis of a genuinely informed decision about all of the implications and consequences.”When asked about the timing of a second vote, Ms Sturgeon said: “Well, I think we have to follow the process that is currently under way to reach some conclusion.“What that conclusion will be remains to be seen.

If anything, it should be amplied.It turned into a trilogy. There was a Great Book of Skye Two in , and now we have the #Great Book of Skye Three#.That was perhaps predictable. In the first volume, Cailean Maclean commented that he had two problems in persuading Norman Macdonald to prepare the book. The first problem was to get him to start the second was to get him to stop.Three books and , pages later, the prof has stopped — or so he says.The three volumes comprise a Dictionary of Skye Biography. The lives of almost , people are profiled and illustrated inside their pages. They have all #been Skye born or bred or are people who have had an intimate connection with the island. They have all been noteworthy in one way or another… #There has never been more than , people living in Skye at any one time, and for much of history — particularly recent, recorded history — its population has been much smaller than that.Nobody, however, will be too surprised that Norman and Cailean uncovered and portrayed over a thousand eminent Sgiathanaich. Without wishing to kickstart Norman once again, the miracle is that they enumerated so few. The island, like almost all Hebridean islands, has been a breeding ground of talent and character.The only other qualication for entry in the Great Books of Skye is that you must be dead. You, dear reader, however, accomplished you might be, will not be able to read your entry unless metaphysics permits you access from your celestial cloud. These are obituaries, not panegyrics.That lends a sombre tone to certain pages of the Great Book of Skye Three. There are people featured here who, we are sharply reminded, were alive when volume one was in preparation.Here, for instance, is the smiling face of Dr Vicky Ann Galbraith, who was born in Portree in  and who died at home in Aird Bernisdale of brain cancer in .Vicky Ann was achievement personied. A leading scientist for Roche Pharmaceuticals, she also played for Scotland#s national women#s rugby union team on  occasions. Following her fatal diagnosis, she raised thousands of pounds for cancer research by leading sponsored walks from Portree to Glasgow, up the West Highland Way and where.Here is Thomas William Mackenzie. You may have known him as Tommy. He was born in  and he died last March. He was, in the GBS abbreviated subheading, a #printmaker, etcher and gallery owner, Chieftain of Skye Highland Games, boat race devotee, tug-of-war revivalist, shinty enthusiast, and half-marathon runner.#That just about covers it, as a dictionary of biography is forbidden to indulge itself and cannot add that for very many people, Tommy Mackenzie was the face and personality of modern Portree.These volumes, these hefty Great Books of Skye, are a leisurely parade along Wentworth Street and then out to the peninsulas, pausing to wave at or pass the time of day with Victorian land reformers, clan chiefs, bards, teachers, surgeons, fishermen, and climbers. It#s a verbal Skye equivalent of the cover of #Sergeant Pepper#s Lonely Hearts Club Band#.Sir Harold Boulton was not a Sgiathanach. He came from Hertfordshire and was educated at Harrow and Oxford.In  he married into the Highland quality via a Dingwall military family. Boulton already had an interest in Gaelic song and music.He enters the Great Book of Skye because, in the late th century, Boulton seems to have heard a Gaelic rowing song and put his own, English, words to the tune.Those lyrics and that tune have become internationally known as #The Skye Boat Song#. Norman Macdonald digresses wonderfully on Boulton#s creation of a supposed Jacobite anthem.We are still left with the dilemma of the bonnie boat#s journey. The original Gaelic version may have celebrated a voyage from Torrin to Loch Coruisk. For most of the th century, it was assumed to refer to Charles Edward Stuart#s post-Culloden flight by sea from the mainland to Skye.As Charles never made such a journey directly by sea, pedants have more recently suggested that Boulton must have been referring to the Pretender#s actual sea voyage It really, really, does not matter. We are in the realms of mythology. Charles may as well have been sailing from Papua New Guinea. Harold Boulton invented the whole damn thing — the misty isle#s most famous song is a Victorian concoction — and in recognition of that, he deserves his entry in the Great Book of Skye Three.And finally, here we are back in Portree. William Cowie was born in Kiltarlity in  and became an agricultural advisor in Skye in the s. The brother of a professional footballer, Cowie devoted himself to shinty and became one of the greatest players of his era.Fittingly, he married in  a grand-daughter of the captain of the Skye shinty team which had won the inaugural MacTavish Cup in .William and Margaret Cowie had two sons, Ross and William. He died too young, at the age of  years, while playing badminton in Portree Drill Hall.William Cowie would, therefore, have been shy of his th birthday had he led his natural course to June  and a day in Fort William which would have caused him, more even than the rest of Skye, unimaginable pride.It is tempting to say of all three Great Books of Skye that they are for dipping in and out rather than reading as a single narrative. The trouble with that suggestion is that once you#ve dipped in, it is very hard to dip out again.As a trilogy, they are a phenomenal publishing achievement. They should take their place, alongside the inevitable Tommy Mackenzie print, in every home in Skye."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/INDOOR-SHINTY-19-P4-7-FINAL-2.jpg","title":"skye schools indoor shinty competition all the action in","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineYoung shinty players fromthroughout Skye gathered to take part in two indoor tournaments for primary school teams last weekend.Portree High’s Fingal Centre hosted competitions for P-P and for P-and-under teams.On a fast and furious day of excellent shinty action teams fromBun-sgoil Ghàidhlig Phort Rìgh won both competitions.Broadford were runners up in the P- competition, with North West taking second spot in the P-under tournament following an epic final."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/WINTER-19-ROADS-1.jpg","title":"skye charities work to be showcased at skeabost","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineA multi-charity event will be held in Skeabost on Saturdayto highlight the work of several good causes across Skye.The event will be held at Skeabost Memorial Hall from  am until  pm and will provide information on the work carried out by a iety of charities in the area, as well as insight into the costs and challenges they face.to raise awareness of the event, which will support Skye and Lochalsh Young Carers the Skye and Lochalsh Foodbank Crossroads Care # Skye and Lochalsh Macmillan Cancer Support Skye Dance Bloodwise, and Rotjanas Hands, which Mr Williams set up with his we nearly  years ago.He said: “I have been an independent fundraiser for many years – I am a trustee of Rotjanas Hands – formally known as Hands Across the Water – which I set up alongside my we following the Indonesian Tsunami .”He added: “For me, it has always been important to share particularly when we are so fortunate and others not so.

The aim is to encourage conversation and share experiences and knowledge about their own encounters with nature.Suzy Lee, ATLASArts film programmer, commented: “We are really excited about working with both Portree Primary and Budhmor House to offer this screening that encourages sharing and discussion.We’ve had a great response to the film and to our extended programme, so we look forward to showing the film in a new environment.”Centre with the primary seven girls from Portree Primary.Angus Beaton, a care worker at the centre praised the event for bridging the generational gap. He said: “It was wonderful to see the younger generation interact with their regular group and to enjoy watching a film together that connected with both age groups.”Sara Matheson, Portree Primary Head Teacher said: #Our pupils have been very fortunate to benefit from the work of ATLAS Arts. Most recently our primary seven girls have taken part in film screenings of Eglantine, both at Dunvegan Castle where they were able to hear directly from Margaret Salmon, and more recently at Home Farm and Tigh Na Drochaid, where they have been able to enjoy the film in a cross-generational context.She added: #As with all projects we have been involved in with ATLAS Arts, our pupils have been impacted very positively by these experiences. We look forward to working with ATLAS Arts on some new and equally exciting future projects.#"},{"url":null,"title":"posting parcels to eu countries after brexit","story":"Q: I have an online business with  per cent international sales, but neither Royal Mail nor the Post Office can sayCN customs labels are going to be required for the EEA EU.Any idea A CN is a customs document, used when goods are being transported overseas.

An entrepreneur and pioneer in his field, Sir William, despite his worldwide success, has never forgotten his strong ties to Ballymena.“His vision and dedication has put our borough firmly on the map as an area of manufacturing excellence and innovation.”Mid and East Antrim Borough Council agreed to bestow the Honorary Freedom of the Borough of Mid and East Antrim on the Wrightbus founder in February . It followed a motion proposed by the previous Mayor, Councillor Paul Reid, and seconded by Councillor Audrey Wales MBE.Among those who paid special tributes to Sir William was former Mayor of Ballymena, P.J. McAvoy, who, as a long standing SDLP representative was poles apart on constitutional issues from the ardent unionist. On Friday, however, he told the audience of the personal bond that had grown between the pair during their service on Council.“I well remember Sir William giving me a lt in that great big car of his many times when going or coming from council meetings! “I’m happy to be here today to pay tribute to the man I call my friend,” he said. Further tributes came from North Antrim MP, Ian Paisley who remarked on Sir William’s political activism at a time when many in the business community ‘kept their heads below the parapet’. And he recalled nights in the harsh days of the troubles when his late father would receive ‘phone calls from the man he codenamed ‘Ahoghill’. Mr. Paisley said Sir William was a rare breed in today’s society: “He is a character. If anyone wants to see what makes a real Ballymena man they need only look at Sir William Wright.” Lauren Christie, speaking on behalf of the extended Wright family, thanked all who attended for the honour conferred on her grandfather and paid special tribute to Mrs. Ruby Wright, who, she described as ‘the great woman behind the great man’.

I was born in , my family have been resident in Ballymena for generations, Allen, obviously, on my fathers side and Gribben on my mothers. My parents moved into the Demesne Estate shortly after it was built, first living in Carnduff Drive and then after a few years moving to Glenshesk Drive where they lived the rest of their lives.  I attended Ballymena Boys Secondary School. Music lessons were pretty much a non event. Every exam time each student would be hauled up to the front of class to sing a song and was awarded a C grade. My standout memory of music lessons was hearing the music teacher playing an album of Holsts Planet Suite to himself, this at least started a le long love of classical music.  In my early teens Glam rock was the big thing but apart from Bowie, T Rex, Rod Stewart etc I seldom listened to the charts.  I was more into album bands like Cream, Taste, Hendrix, early Fleetwood Mac, Pink Floyd and especially Led Zeppelin. Of course I followed the usual links from these back through Willie Dixon, Muddy Waters, Howlin Wolf to the Delta greats, Robert Johnson, Son House and Charley Patton.  First real early Blues album I heard was by Leadbelly and then Robert Johnson : The King of the Delta Blues , album which has been a major influence on my playing ever since.  I started playing bass guitar when I was about twelve then switched to six string. FLAMINGOMy first paying gig was at The Flamingo playing bass with local rockers Angel when I was fourteen.  After discovering the joys of Blues and Booze, I could be found many a night after closing time, sitting around a fire in the woods at the back of my old school, playing guitar and singing the Blues with friends.  Many Friday nights were passed in The Bridge, Dunloy listening to South Bound Train and most Saturdays were spent in The Pound or The Harp Bar in Belfast, catching as much live music as I could.  This was during the dark days of the Troubles, with bomb warnings and check points an everyday normality but somehow music lovers seemed to live in a world apart, music clubs being one of the few places religion didnt encroach on.  I have played in ious bands throughout the years, including Angel, AGS, Harpers Hill Blues Band, The Flood and BIDDY EARLY as well as playing as a solo Delta Blues player, playing slide guitar harmonica.  Lately I have seriously got into electric Blues Harp, being influenced by Sonny Boy Williamson ii, Little Walter, Paul Butterfield, John Myall, Walter Horton etc. I currently play Blues Harp with The Matchstick Men, Irelands premier Status Quo tribute act, and I also regularly sit in with Legal Tender and Blues Taxis. I can be found most first Saturdays of the month at the excellent BT Blues and Rock Club sitting in on Harp with the featured bands. For the last six years I have been host of BIDDY EARLYS Open Mic at the BT Club, one of the Provinces most successful Open Mics which I also founded. I have finally decided to call an end to it at the start of this year to concentrate on my own music.  I play ious instruments guitar,  string guitar, slide guitar, bass guitar, banjo, mandolin, auto harp, Appalachian mountain dulcimer and of course Blues Harp.  Yeah, after all these years, Ive still got the Blues, once your hooked, thats it for le! - see BB King, John Lee Hooker, Buddy Guy etc.  As for other local promoters of the Blues, theres the afore mentioned BT Blues Club which Looi Burns has been doing an excellent job of running for many years and of course local bands like Legal Tender and Blues Taxis.

And back in the hungry s when every day was a grind to put the most basic grub on the table and keep a roof over your head, it was women like the lady opposite who you relied on to get you to your work on time.Our pictures show one of the last of the ‘knocker-uppers’ who rose well before the crack of dawn every day in le to go round the doors to give people their morning alarm call.Known as ‘The Lady With The Map’, Mary Millar plied her trade in Kells and Connor.A knocker-up was a job in Britain and Ireland that started during and lasted well into the Industrial Revolution, when alarm clocks were neither cheap nor reliable.Most had given up the role by the begnning of the s but Mary was still performing her morning task up until the outbreak of World War .  The knocker-up used a baton or short, heavy stick to knock on the clients doors or a long and light stick, often made of bamboo, to reach windows on higher floors. At least one of them used a pea-shooter!In , the knocker-up would be paid a few pence a week. The knocker-up would not leave a clients window until they were sure that the client had been awoken.A knocker upper would also use a snuffer outer as a tool to rouse the sleeping. This implement was used to put out gas lamps which were lit at dusk and then needed to be extinguished at dawn.There were large numbers of people carrying out the job, especially in larger industrial towns. Generally the job was done by elderly men and women but sometimes police constables supplemented their pay by performing the task during early morning patrols.The pictures, re-discovered by areporter on a research task at the Local Studies Department of Ballymena Library appeared in the Belfast Newsletter in January of .

From a legal perspective, my best advice to anyone thinking of going on holiday next summer, is to take out a travel insurance policy as soon as possible. Your insurance policy might cover you all year round until the time of your holiday, which means you could be covered for a number of dferent situations ndash for exampleyoursquore ill before your holiday and have to cancel it.Make sure the travel insurance is bespoke to you and your needsldquoItrsquos definitely worth taking out a cheaper policy than none at all, however, we do advise that you go a step further and opt for a bespoke policyyou can afford to. As this will ensure your policy is bespoke to you and your needs as an inidual. Many people tend to get reeled in by the cheap travel insurance deals ndash but think to yourself, what do I need cover for  Is this policy going to be suitable for me and my family Book a package holidayldquoOver the last decade or so, wersquove seen a signicant rise in people booking holidays that arenrsquot package holidays ndash people tend to be shopping around more booking flights  hotels  transfers separately, in order to cut down cost. However, we are advising consumers to rethink this strategy, and consider booking holidays as a package deal. Itrsquos important to understand the dficulty you may run intosomething were to go wrong, and yoursquove booked each component separately. For example,yoursquove paid £ for your flights with a particular airline, and paid £ with a separate hotel provider ndashyour flight was cancelled, you may or may not get your £ back from that airline . However, there is no guarantee that yoursquoll get your refund on the hotel too, as this is a separate and standalone contract. Again, this may or may not be covered on your insurance policy, but yoursquore not going to get it back from the hotel provider regardless.ldquoIf you choose to book a package holiday, with a reputable tour operator,one part goes wrong, all components are likely to be covered. The law in this area changed only recently and the new Package Travel Directive is an even more powerful piece of pro-consumer legislation. The importance of booking a genuine package holiday cannot be underestimated, and again this is even more relevant in light of Brexit and its uncertainties.Make sure there is ATOL Protection on your holidayldquoATOL protection is extremely important, and goes hand-in-hand with booking a package holiday.

Up stepped Peter Henvey and his shot was well-struck high into the net to tie the game at -.Carryduff made the perfect response as from the restart, they moved straight upfield with Beatty getting on the ball, finding Ciaran Sherry who broke through and squared for Darragh Connolly who rose to palm into the net and restore his side#s three-point lead.Beatty and Owen McCabe added points as it appeared Carryduff were set to pull away, but St Brigid#s refused to break as John Blaney and Rory Brolly kicked scores to get them back to within three.Beatty and Finnegan traded points while Beatty added another from play to make it a four-point game with seven to play, but St Brigid#s were far from done.Five minutes from time, substitute Paul Bradley gathered Peter King#s long ball and waited for movement inside. He spotted James Smith in space and played a high ball that Smith rose to meet and brilliantly palm to the corner of the net.Again, Carryduff went upfield and found the net when Beatty put Connolly in on the right, but while his shot was destined for the net, substitute Eoin Rooney decided to make sure of it by getting his foot to it. However, Rooney was well inside the small square before the ball and the effort was correctly ruled out for a square ball.St Brigid#s took full advantage as they swept upfield and Smith thumped over a great point to level with three to play.Once more, Carryduff were able to respond. This time, Guinness created space  meters out and his shot curled just inside the post with the referee # standing right behind the shot # overruling the umpire who waved it wide.St Brigid#s still had time to save themselves, but they couldn#t engineer a score as Carryduff broke away and almost sealed their win, but Rooney#s shot crashed off the crossbar to give the Antrim champions one last chance. But with the whistle in referee Martin Conroy#s mouth, it was now or never and Brolly had to shoot from an unfavourable distance, the effort tailing right and wide as Carryduff held on.CARRYDUFF: D Ross L Toal, G Henderson, C Cunningham J McGeough , D Coogan, D GuinnessP Laverty , J ConneryR Anderson , O McCabe , P Loughran D Connolly , R Beatty , C Sherry.

I believe that the work that I set out to do is completed and that RRCANI now has a good foundation which they can continue to build on.”She added: “It is amazing what we all achieved in a relatively short period of time, most times relying just on friendships and a lot of good will. A heartfelt thank you and very well done to you all. I hope you will continue the good work with the Roma communities.”Remarkably, recipients of the email include her line manager at LORAG and the community group’s CEO Gerard Rice – both of whom Ms Long now claims were aware of her concerns. Both say they were not alerted to any concerns with the project until issues were raised by the Belfast Trust in late May .Another recipient of the email is her then fellow LORAG worker in the RRCANI project, spokesman for the Roma community of Belfast, Nicolae Nicola. Ms Long now says that he was the person charging vulnerable Roma for services, a claim which remains unproven and which Mr Nicola vehemently denies. Also copied into the email is Ms Long’s husband, Stephen Long.LORAG Chairperson John Gormley said: “We reject the claim that was broadcast on the Nolan show. LORAG had previously told the BBC Nolan Show that the first we became aware of an allegation of charging by RRCANI was through a conversation on or about  May  with Belfast Health and Social Care Trust officials.

However, councillors subsequently switched attention to the former St. Maryrsquos Girlsrsquo Primary School campus at Shanslieve Drive.Despite a number of protracted attempts to secure the site and hopes that a deal could be agreed, it was bought by supermarket giant Lidl.While widely regarded as one of Northern Irelandrsquos premier tourist resorts, Newcastle does not have a modern indoor leisure facility and while there are some politicians who would like a swimming pool as part of any new development in the resort, this seems unlikely given there are local authority pools in Downpatrick, Kilkeel and Newry.It was previously suggested that the sale of the Annesley Buildings would free up the site for a new hotel and, signicantly, generate funds to help provide new leisure provision in the resort. But that now looks unlikely.As part of the drive to signicantly enhance leisure provision in the resort, council officials are continuing to work alongside education officials to develop a major new sports hub.Shimna Integrated College is planning to redevelop its King Street site which would include the creation of additional sports facilities at nearby Donard Park.It has been suggested that the proposed sports facilities could potentially be developed by the Department of Education in partnership with Newry, Mourne and Down Council with pitches and a sports pavilion forming the new sports hub which could also used by the community.While discussions are ongoing, the local authority still has to address the issue of no meaningful indoor sports facility in the resort to cater for both residents and visitors and is turning its attention to the Annesley Buildings site.Senior council officials have admitted that their initial thoughts about using the location for a town centre hotel have changed, confirming they are working to make a final decision on the way forward. It is also being suggested that the most likely outcome is developing a new leisure-cum-community facility at the Central Promenade site.A feasibility study on the redevelopment of the town centre site for a new hotel was completed several years ago which suggested a two or three-storey extension extension would be acceptable.The new hotel was viewed as a key ingredient in the plan to deliver highly ambitious proposals outlined in the Mournes Gateway proposals aimed at shaping future tourist provision in Newcastle.Other proposals include a gondola ride into the heart of the Mournes and a visitor centre at the site of the old quarry at Thomasrsquo Mountain.It has emerged that work on the high profile tourism project is progressing with moves to establish a board to deliver its ious elements, with membership including representatives from the local council, Tourism NI, Forest Service, Mourne Heritage Trust and National Trust.Over the next month, work is scheduled to start on tendering for consultancy and architectural services, alongside the recruitment of environmental and traffic management services.

Scrum half Conor Gibson was on hand to move the ball quickly to Hutley, who put Luka Walsh in space for the first score of the game.Omagh bounced back well, again using the wind effectively, and their pressure gave way to a penalty which they successfully struck to close the gap.As they continued to apply pressure, the home side had a chance to take the lead on the  minute mark, but their kick drted to the right hand side of the posts.With  minutes left in the half, Down High extended their lead. Having forced Omagh deep into their own half, Luka Walsh capitalised on Omaghrsquos decision to play out from their own quarters when he intercepted the ball to score his second of the day. Hutley slotted over the conversion. Down carried a - lead into half-time.With the strong wind now on their tails and a reasonable points buffer, Down High controlled the game well. Omagh continued to apply plenty of pressure, but the Down defence was hungry and with the exception of a few indiscretions they soaked up the Omagh onslaughts.With  minutes left the game took a critical turn when Hutley slotted agoal to take the Down lead to -.As would be expected from the men from the west, they didnrsquot lie down, but they were forced to chase the game.

However, the book kept me from thinking dark thoughts. Soon, all I wanted was to hold a copy of the book in my hand.Maureenrsquos dream came true in the autumn of  when her haunting story was finally published.Maureen, who is the mother of five grown-up children, explained some of the background as to why she put pen to paper.She added: ldquoI was initially setting out to piece together my family tree and the computer screen flashed up information on my great aunt Brigid. I was so fascinated with what I read that I could see the story unfold in a book and in turn I felt the plot would work well on screen too.Research took Maureen to the Presentation Convent in Co Kildare, which Brigid entered at the age of .Maureen said: ldquoI met with such a warm and friendly welcome from the community of sisters, that it gave me the desire to pursue Brigidrsquos story further. I travelled to Australia shortly after and I received the same, warm and friendly welcome from the sisters of the Presentation of the Blessed Virgin Mary in Wagga Wagga.On herMaureen set about sting through a mountain of information and carefully crafted the remarkable story of her great aunt. The book was published in July  and was officially launched a few months later to a rapturous reception in Murphyrsquos Bar in Downpatrick.A chance meeting which her web designer, Michael McLaughlin, had had a year later led to a further development.She said: ldquoMichael was working on a display in Eclipse Cinema in Downpatrick for another movie when he struck up a random conversation with Colin McIvor.ldquoAs they chatted Michael mentioned that he had recently read a book written by a Downpatrick woman which he thought might make a great movie.ldquoWithin days Colin, with the backing of Northern Ireland Screen, was in my house and we were signing contracts on a movie deal. That was in July last year and since then the whole thing has snowballed.ldquoIt has been a pleasure putting the whole thing together. I wrote it like a novel which makes it easy for the reader to follow the story. My story is entirely based on fact.As Maureen describes the plot her face lights up. She believes her great aunt would be delighted at her revealing the long-lost tale to a new generation.ldquoBrigid had trained as a teacher and in  there was a great demand for priests and nuns with skilled trades in Australia and so she was shipped off to the mother house in Wagga Wagga.ldquoBrigid proved herself capable and popular with the children she taught for six years. But a bad day in front of a teaching inspector led the convent demoting her to refectory duties.ldquoTwo weeks turned into two years of hard labour that took their toll physically and mentally on poor Brigid. Requests toto her former duties were denied and feeling she had no real means of complaint, it left Brigid desperate.ldquoOne day she wandered outside the convent walls. Tears welled up in her eyes as she called at a strangerrsquos home. Her afternoon of tea and warm company by the fire ended all too soon and Brigid was sent back to the convent, seen by a doctor and put to bed, Maureen added.The story really begins in earnest at this crossroads in Brigidrsquos le. Drawing on every ounce of courage she had, Brigid leapt from her bed that night and made a hasty escape barefoot in her nightgown on a foggy winterrsquos night in .This night set the scene for a religious storm unprecedented in Australiarsquos history. Brigid found refuge in the home of Protestants who refuse to disclose her whereabouts to the Catholic authorities.A bishop swore before a magistrate that Brigid was insane and a warrant was issued for her arrest. She was hunted down like an outlaw and the local media attention created a level of sectarian tension rarely unseen in that part of the world.Later, when there was no apology from the bishop for the arrest and slur on her character, Brigid turned to the courts for redress. But taking on the bishop meant taking on the Catholic Church.Maureen had a challenging time presenting Brigidrsquos story.She said: ldquoIt was a scandal at the time but I had to be careful to write it from both sides and let people judge for themselves. Itrsquos all I can do.Maureen says she is looking forward to the filmrsquos premiere.She added: ldquoIt will be the culmination of not just my five years of writing and telling the story, but all the hard work and effort that my family have put into supporting and helping me and, of course, the efforts of the film company, the director and the actors.Colin spoke of his enthusiasm over Maureenrsquos forthcoming film.ldquoI am thoroughly delighted to have optioned such an amazingly powerful book and to have met the inspirational Maureen and her family through the process, he said.He is currently adapting the book into a screenplay. ldquoI believe the film will offer a fantastic role for a strong female lead and supporting cast, he said. ldquoTo be able to bring this beautully written, dramatic and deserved piece to the silver screen some day would be just fantastic.Log on to Maureenrsquos website toon the forthcoming movie premiere at www.theextraordinarycaseofsisterliguori..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C January 30%2C 1979  ","story":"DOWNPATRICK mdash A Strangford man had a narrow escape from death when he turned up for work on Monday morning at the new Abbey Lodge Hotel, outside Downpatrick.A muffled explosion during the night had ripped apart a section of the hotel mdash which was due to open in three weeksrsquo time mdash but no alarm was raised and workmen were unaware of the danger when they reported for work.One of the men, Mr Francis Black, from Strangford, passed through the lounge and noticed a black bag and two yellow tins. He thought it was some material left for him to carry on with a job and picked it up.Mr Black failed to notice several wires leading from the bag, but an examination of the contents told him something was wrong. He put it down and it was discovered later that the contents were competence for a lethal fire-type bomb.By then Mr Blackrsquos colleagues had discovered the damage caused by another bomb and a warning was raised. Police and firemen rushed to the scene and the main Downpatrick-Crossgar Road, beside the hotel, was sealed off as army bomb disposal experts raced from Lisburn.An army officer successfully defused the second bomb and workmen moved in to assess the damage, which was confined that bedroom section of the hotel.The hotel owner, Mr William Polly, said: ldquoDoors, windows, the gable and the roof have all been damaged and this includes a total of eight bedrooms. It will mean that an entire section of the building containing the bedrooms will have to come out. It was fortunate that the bomb in the lounge did not explode.A police spokesman confirmed that no warnings of the bombs were made. He said that the entire building would likely have been destroyedthe second bomb had gone off.BALLYNAHINCH mdash Two Down councillors have expressed annoyance over the Department of Educationrsquos rejection of proposals for a swimming pool in Ballynahinch.At this weekrsquos meeting of the South Eastern Education and Library Board Mrs Ethel Smyth and Mr Jarlath Carey said nothing less than a meeting with the minister, Lord Melchett, would achieve any satisfaction.Mrs Smyth said that the Departmentrsquos withdrawal of permission for the pool was an immense setback at a time when everyone assumed that the way ahead was clear for the construction of a multi-purpose community complex to be provided by Down Council and a learner pool to be provided by the board.Mr Carey said there was immense concern over the disappearance of what would have been a very happy exercise in joint provision. He was most annoyed that the decision had been made by the Department without consulting either the council or the board.KILLYLEAGH mdash Killyleagh and Shrigley Town Committee was given a massive confidence boost at its annual general meeting last Wednesday evening.An enthusiastic and lively audience of more than  people turned up in response to a publicity drive aimed at finding out what grassroots support the committee had in the area.The response promoted outgoing committee chairman Col Denys Rowan-Hamilton to say later: ldquoSuch a well-attended meeting makes it all worthwhile.In his opening address to the meeting Col Rowan-Hamilton traced the work of the committee in the last  months.He outlined the reasons why the decision was taken to close the community hall, which had been opened by the committee with tremendous enthusiasm by the committee only four years ago.He also reported on Killyleaghrsquos water supply problems and said the shortages of the last three years had caused more worry to some townspeople than any other single item.A new -strong committee was elected and they will meet soon to elect their own office-bearers.CROSSGAR mdash An upstairs bedroom in a Crossgar house was completely gutted when a fire broke out on Friday morning. Severe fire, heat, smoke and water damage was caused to the house at Lislea Drive.Firemen from Downpatrick and Ballynahinch were sent to the scene, but encountered dficulty finding water hydrants due to the snow-covered roads and footpaths.

Photo: Liam McBurney PA WireBut her words, which did not clary the future of Brexit as it relates to the Province, drew a critical response from local anti-Brexit parties, and failed to draw a warm reaction from unionists.And she sidestepped questions, including one from the News Letter, about the moderate unionist critique of the backstop from Lords Trimble and Bew that it breaches the  Belfast Agreement. In her -minute address, Mrs May said: “Over the last two-and-a-half years, we have come a long way towards a solution that works for Northern Ireland and Ireland. We have agreed mutual protections for citizens’ rights, the maintenance of our common travel area, and set a framework for our future relationship that ensures tarf and quota-free trade and protects our close co-operation on security and law enforcement.”But, she added,”the UK Parliament rejected the Withdrawal Agreement because of their concerns about the backstop”.Mrs May said: “I know that many people in Northern Ireland, and indeed across this island, are worried about what Parliament’s rejection of the withdrawal deal means for them. So I am here today to affirm my commitment, and that of the United Kingdom government, to all of the people of Northern Ireland, of every background and tradition.”She affirmed her commitment both to the “Belfast Good Friday Agreement” and to “delivering a Brexit that ensures noto a hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland – which is unshakable.”The prime minister was at pains to state “I was  when the Troubles began and  when the Belfast Agreement was reached for all my adult le, Northern Ireland has been a central political issue”.The decisive moment in the transformation away from conflict, she said, “was the Belfast Agreement in ”.“It enshrined the principle that it is the ‘birthright of all the people of Northern Ireland to identy themselves and be accepted as Irish or British, or both, as they may so choose.“And it enshrined the consent principle: that it will always and only be for the people of Northern Ireland to decide what their constitutional future should be.”She said: “A fundamental belief in the Union of Great Britain and Northern Ireland is part of my political heritage as a Conservative and unionist – and that will never change.We retain absolute commitment to Northern Ireland’s place in internal UK market, says prime minister Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"“But the unionism I believe in is one that respects absolutely the central importance of Irish identity to those people in Northern Ireland who claim it.“Because the Belfast Agreement is not just the bedrock of stability here in Northern Ireland, its principles are fundamental to the security and success of the whole United Kingdom.“Our absolute commitment to those principles has informed and directed my approach to Brexit – from my first speeches as prime minister to my first meetings with the taoiseach.“And in December , in the Joint Report we agreed with the EU, we committed to protect the  agreement ‘in all its parts’.”She added: “Our preferred approach has always been to deliver them through the Future Relationship. But I accepted the need for an insurance policy or bridging arrangement to guarantee no hard borderthe FutureRelationship was not in place in time.”“That is why I agreed to the backstop in the Withdrawal Agreement. And unlike the original European Commission proposal, it did not impose a customs border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.“Many people, businesses, farming organisations and voluntary groups in Northern Ireland agreed with me. They spoke out in support of the Withdrawal Agreement and they defended the backstop.”The prime minister said in her speech that she had fought hard for the Withdrawal Agreement “as it stands”.Theresa May said: “I believed it could command a majority in the House of Commons. But I have had to face up to the fact that in its current form it cannot. And the need for changes to the backstop is the key issue.“While there were those in Northern Ireland who spoke in favour of it, it is also true that the backstop is not supported by the two main unionist parties here. And this also influenced MPs in England, Scotland and Wales in voting against the deal.“I can only deliver on the commitments we have madeI can get a deal through the UK Parliament. And meetings with MPs across the House showed that I can only get a deal through Parliamentlegal changes are made to the backstop.”She acknowledged that changing the backstop “creates real anxieties here in Northern Ireland and in Ireland” and added: “I recognise, too, that the majority of voters in Northern Ireland voted to remain.”The prime minister said: “First, we stand by our commitment in the Joint Report that there will be no hard border, including any physical infrastructure or related checks and controls. And this means people on either side of that border will be able to live their lives as they do now.”She added: “So while I have said that technology could play a part, and that we will look at alternative arrangements, these must be ones that can be made to work for the particular circumstances of Northern Ireland.“Second, neither will I compromise on my promise to protect Northern Ireland’s integral place in the UK. “When the European Commission proposed a version of the backstop which involved creating a customs border in the Irish Sea, I successfully resisted it. And I have ruled out anyto such a suggestion.” It would, she said, “damage the integrity of the UK’s internal market”.• In full: Theresa May’s speech in BelfastShe added that “there will be no new regulatory barriers between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK without Northern Ireland’s institutions having their say”.Mrs May said: “Third, there will be full protection for all existing cross-border co-operation.”The prime minister then spoke about nationalist concerns, saying: “The birth right to identy and be accepted as British, Irish or both, and to hold both British and Irish citizenship is absolutely central to the agreement. “But I know that in some cases recently, people have encountered dficulties in securing their rights as Irish citizens to bring in family members.”The prime minister said she had asked the home secretary, working with Northern Ireland secretary, “to review these issues urgently”.Mrs May said “Without a devolved government – and with only unionists represented in the House of Commons – it is more important than ever that we uphold our duty to ensure all voices in Northern Ireland are heard.”“... So [on Wednesday] I will be sitting down with the political parties to discuss the way forward and ensure that we can deliver for all the people of Northern Ireland.”Mrs May said: “I have said many times that I want to see a new, deep and special partnership between the UK and the  member states of the European Union. “But our relationship with Ireland is deeper than our relationship with any of the other .”Setting out existing Anglo-Irish ties, she added: “We already have the British Irish Intergovernmental Conference, and regular summits between UK and Irish politicians. “But as we leave the European Union, we will need to establish new ways of coming together to develop further our unique relationship. “For example, the Irish government has suggested annual meetings where the prime minister and taoiseach, together with senior ministerial colleagues, come together to discuss the big issues of the day.”She said that “both the UK and the Irish governments have already made clear that we would support the tantalising possibility of a joint UK and Ireland World Cup bid for , should our respective football associations choose to pursue this”.She said that as the government seeks a deal that secures a majority in the Westminster Parliament, “which is the best way to deliver for the people of Northern Ireland”, she also hopes “we can ... move towards the restoration of devolution – so that politicians in Northern Ireland can get back to work on the issues that matter to the people they represent”.She said: “It must be how, together, we move forwards to shape the opportunities of the future.”• Political reaction, click here• Morning View: PM devoted to NI but focuses on land border•In full: Theresa May’s speech in BelfastJPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings  Terms and Conditions  Disclaimer  Privacy policy    d.onerror  d.onload  d.src  [\"secure-uk.imrworldwide cgi-bin m ciuk-hcgccsi\", escape, \"rp\", escape, \"tscompactrnd\", .getTime].join"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.newsletter.co.uk/webimage/1.8798748.1549399746!/image/image.jpg","title":"sam mcbride amid an evasive brexit fog the backstop re emerged after pm s speech  ","story":".... , , , , Would you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast Newsletter via email \"Newsletters\"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia Ltd , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"By clicking on register, you will be creating an account with Belfast Newsletter and agreeing to JPIMedia Ltd#s Standard Terms and ConditionsWould you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast Newsletter via email \"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia Ltd , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \" addCustomTextToCreateAccountTemplateNewslettersWould you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast Newsletter via email \"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia Ltd , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"  \". s .  \". s  \". s  \".after+text+ .+text+ .before+text+ .after+text+           TriggerPrompt url  https:survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site_oqfshupypyivmsxzqude + url +  +:  + random + .getTime + afterel.setAttribute head  document[]  document[]headChildTriggerPrompt   Jobs Cars Homes  Directory  Announcements  Advertise My Business NewsletterRegisterLoginEdit Account\"Sign Out\" --\"    --       News Politics Crime Farming Education Business Transport Environment Health Your Say Opinion Offbeat s News News Politics Crime Farming Education Business Transport Environment Health Your Say Opinion Offbeat Sport Football Rugby Union Cricket Golf Motorcycling Boxing More Sport Whats On Music Theatre  Comedy Arts TV  Film Eating Out Lestyle Nostalgia People Family Gadgets  Tech Outdoors Travel Cars Read This           Sam McBride: Amid an evasive Brexit fog, the backstop re-emerged after PMrsquos speechPrime Minister Theresa May at a community centre during her visit to BelfastSam McBrideEmail Published::Wednesday  February Share this article window.onload  .sharetool \"m.\" index  .indexOf \"ContentId\" pointIndex  .indexOf articleID  .substringSign Up To Our Daily Newsletter ipaddress.getJSON .keypress.focus.on email  .val.ajax\",source_url: location.href,source_website_category: \"Local\", \"text\".done .removeAttr  .htmlThanks,  + email +  has been added to our newsletter..

But there was disappointment for anyone hoping that with just over  days to go until Brexit day the prime minister was going to set out a clear pathway to securing a deal with the EU.Instead, with the point of departure from the EU within touching distance, Mrs May told the invited audience that she is now “working on a solution” to how Brexit will impact on the Irish border that will “command broader support across the community in Northern Ireland”.It was an attempt to be all things to all men which will have fuelled the fears of those who believe that she is out of ideas and cynically running down the clock in the hope that the looming reality of no deal prompts MPs to suddenly swing behind her deal.It took a question at the end of the speech to reveal something of what is really going on within government at this point. Asked by UTV’s political editor Ken Reid to explain how she could expect nationalists in Northern Ireland to accept a deal which does not include a backstop, the prime minister made clear that – contrary to what some Brexiteers had hoped – there will definitely be a backstop in any deal.She said: “Well, I’m not proposing to persuade people to accept a deal that doesn’t include that insurance policy for the future.”That will concern some Brexiteers and some of the DUP who want to see the backstop removed in its entirety. Just two months ago, DUP leader Arlene Foster told Mrs May that she wanted to see her “bin the backstop”.But even that revelation from Mrs May was ambiguous. ‘A backstop’ couldmean almost anything and it is the specics of that arrangement which will be signicant.However, there is hope for Mrs May – at least from the DUP. When pressed yesterday, Mrs Foster refused to say that she is still demanding the removal of the backstop.It now seems that the DUP is prepared to accept a time-limited backstop, or perhaps some other mechanism. The real test of that will be the reaction of Brussels – and Dublin.Prime minister repeats her pledges to Northern Ireland but gives no clarity on Brexit Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch  TrendingIN PICTURES:  things you should never EVER say or do to someone from Northern IrelandHas PSNI officer Bobby Singleton become an unwitting sex symbol Ian Ogle daughter: UVF gang that murdered Dad are still planning to kill my brotherVIDEO: Police investigation into fight at Belfast International Airport, AldergroveIN PICTURES: the funeral of Ian Ogle          ..

One of his historical advisors, Lord Bew, a very respected figure in the House of Lords, he said one of the most remarkable things was the British government had not challenged this Irish narrative on the Belfast Good Friday Agreement in recent years and I’m wondering what you think about that.“He is concerned, like Lord Trimble, that Britain would be signing away the right, the possibility of there one day there being regulatory and customs ergence on the island of Ireland.Are you going to keep open that possibility for Britain ” Mrs May replied: “What I’ve made clear and you’ve heard me repeat in my speech, is the commitment that we made in the December joint report, December  joint report, to ensure Ireland’s place in the — the integral place that NI has within the internal market of the United Kingdom. We have already set forth, set out within Westminster, ways in which we believe as a UK government we would deliver on that.“I recognise the concerns that have been expressed about regulatory dferences but as I say, we were absolutely clear in that December joint report, and we retain our absolute commitment to that, to ensure Northern Ireland’s integral place in the UK’s internal market.”Ken Reid of UTV asked:“Fty six per cent of people in Northern Ireland voted to remain, it has wide support in the business community here as well. How are you going to persuade particularly nationalist politicians, the nationalist parties, to accept a deal that doesn’t contain a backstop ”Mrs May replied: “Well I’m not proposing to persuade people to accept a deal that doesn’t contain that insurance policy for the future. What Parliament has said is that they believe there should be changes made to the backstop.”Emma Little Pengelly: Prime minister must stand strong and get legally binding change to backstopParties will face down Sinn Fein on city hall statue provision Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch  TrendingIN PICTURES:  things you should never EVER say or do to someone from Northern IrelandHas PSNI officer Bobby Singleton become an unwitting sex symbol Ian Ogle daughter: UVF gang that murdered Dad are still planning to kill my brotherVIDEO: Police investigation into fight at Belfast International Airport, AldergroveIN PICTURES: the funeral of Ian Ogle          ..

It must be one which respects the economic and constitutional integrity of the United Kingdom.Northern Ireland cannot be left as a rule taker, running to Dublin to seek changes to the rules governing our core industries. Whilst there have been positive voices from Brussels about the need to seek creative solutions, such commentary will now be put to the test.

We can now offer our customers a streamlined product supply chain package by integrating their co-packing requirements with the grouprsquos warehouse and transport subsidiary companies.ldquoLogistically, this works out to be more cost effective overall, but also lowers the carbon footprint on the transportation of food products, which is something we are passionate about.Wild Water Group has a current annual turnover of poundm and Mr Rattenbury believes the company can increase that figure by a further poundm within  months and then reach poundm within two to three years.The project is backed by a pound. million investment from Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking and the Development Bank of Wales and has secured Welsh Government funding under the new economic contract.Using a similar business model to the grouprsquos other three sites in Merthyr Tydfil, Llanishen and Cardf Bay, the first phase of development will be the conversion of available space into a large ambient open plan co-packing facility, which will be operational early November  to meet festive season demand.During the first quarter of , Wild Water Group will move the entire Cardf Bay co-packing facility to Aberbargoed, once freezer facilities, production lines and machinery are in place.The company will then continue services such as frozen to frozen storage, bagging, over wrapping, sleeving and tray sealing, as well as the full spectrum of print labelling applications required under the Food Safety Technicalspecications.Economy Secretary Ken Skates said: ldquoThis project will not only see a successful, growing Welsh business create an additional  jobs, it will also create a new strategic hub and facility for both large and small food and drink businesses across the region to pack or store products themselves. This could, in turn, open up new markets for those businesses ndash so Irsquom excited about what this means not only for Wild Water Group and Aberbargoed, but for the region more widely.ldquoIt shows that both our Economic and Food and Drink Action plans are delivering what we had hoped ndash jobs, prosperity and sustainable growth. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

I canrsquot see that there is any way the council can fix this, there just isnrsquot the infrastructure.ldquoItrsquos obvious that it is not going to work, it would be a waste of money to even try it.But another Plassey Street resident, Bat Goddard, said: ldquoTo spend pound, on an experiment, which in  months they could reject, is ludicrous.ldquoWe have the widest street in Penarth here but they want to turn it in to a one-way system.ldquoWe need to stop this folly now.Vale council member Geoff Cox, who is the cabinet member for Neighbourhood Services and Transport, has since said a report will be put forward that retains the roundabout and instead looks at enhancing other ideas to solve crossing issues and traffic problems.Cllr Coxsaid: ldquoAs the Cabinet meeting date approached, I became more aware of the strength of local feeling associated with the highway option being proposed, hence my decision to defer the report meaning it was not even considered by Cabinet on January .ldquoI have since reviewed the ious options further, which has included my meeting with local ward members to obtain their detailed views on all options. I now intend to present an amended report to cabinet on February .ldquoThe report will propose that option one in the previous report now be taken forward, which retains the current roundabout though enhances the gateway route into Penarth whilst providing much safer crossing opportunities for cyclists and pedestrians. There is no requirement to complete any spending on this project by the end of this financial year.ldquoIt is very dficult to please everyone with highway improvement schemes but I very much hope that this option provides the active travel benefits we are seeking and is viewed by residents and visitors to Penarth as being the most appropriate. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It was made with willow grown in the grounds of Cogan Primary School.More than  people attended the hill rolling ceremony down Clf Hill towards Penarth Esplanade - with the school pupils from Cogan and pupils and families from Ysgol Pen Y Garth helping to roll it along.The head was accompanied by a wooden frame from the Mabinogion stories called the Window of Sorrows made by Tony Simms, and the artist Ifor Davies undertook the ritual sawing of the Window of Sorrows on the clftops and read the Bendigeidfran story from the Mabinogion tales before the rolling went ahead.The head of Bendigeidfran and the Window of Sorrows was accompanied by Penarths Mari Lwyd which is a symbol of hosting, and negotiating hospitality through song and teasing. Richard Parry led the Mari Lwyd this year, and on arriving at the bottom of the hill the celebration visited local shops and resaurants along the sea front wishing the proprietors and customers a Happy New Year. We sang for Romeo Italian restaurant, The Fig Tree, James Sommerin, The Crazy Cafe and Hamptons seaside shop. After reaching the bottom of the hill the head was carried by the children along with the Mari Lwyd to the shops and cafes along the seafront where dferent New Year songs - called Calenig - were sung in each venue and led by local opera singer Richard Parry.Speaking about the event, artist Haf Weighton said: \"I loved working with Cogan School. Itrsquos a hidden gem in Penarth with very enthusiastic staff who were happy to jump in to get involved in this project at short notice. Richard Parry and the schools deputy head Tom Lewis, ran a assembly to the whole school on the new year traditions. Then children from across the school came to see me working on the piece. \"It was lovely to hear children who donrsquot come from homes where Welsh is spoken enthusing about the mabinogi tales and Welsh traditions. Children from Pen y Garth joined in after the head was created. They helped us roll it down the hill from the clf tops.\"Richard Parry, who helped to organise the event and led the Mari Lwyd, said: \"It was great to see so many people come together to celebrate Hen Galan in Penarth. The giant Bendegeidfran got his name because he was the Blessed Bran - the best friend anyone could ever want - and in the stories of the Mabinogion he was loved by those who knew him. He is a symbol of friendship and celebrating together. \"The community celebration on the clftops was thoroughly enjoyed by children and adults alike, and even though its a bit chilly it was wonderful to see so many people out of doors, celebrating, singing and enjoying wishing everyone we met Blwyddyn Newydd Dda and Happy New Year.\"The head will now go on display at a iety of places, including Pen y Garth School, Cogan Primary School, Penarth Library and The Hearth Gallery Llandough Hospital. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The backstop is part of the Withdrawal Agreement, and the Withdrawal Agreement is not open for re-negotiation.\"And French President Emmanuel Macron also said the agreement was \"not re-negotiable\", in comments just moments before MPs voted.The Commons approved a cross-party amendment, tabled by Midlands MPs Caroline Spelman and Jack Dromey, rejecting a no-deal Brexit by  to .The vote is not legally binding on the government but will impose massive political pressure on the prime minister to delay Brexit from its scheduled date of March she cannot secure a new deal from Brussels.The PM told MPs: \"I agree that we should not leave without a deal.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work.

We tell client’s stories through engaging content written by former journalists – grab their customers’ attention with stunning design, maximise conversions by using the latest digital marketing expertise, and develop websites which are living, breathing, online stores or shop windows. As content director, my role is to bring almost  years’ experience in journalism, political communications, corporate PR, crisis management and digital content crafting to Grofuse. How did the business start and how has it grown The business was created by a fusion of expertise to achieve sales growth, including experienced digital marketers, PR consultants, web developers, software developers, graphic designers, illustrators and motion designers. I co-founded the company with expert digital marketer Denis Finnegan who has spent  years fuelling online lead generation for businesses. Growth has been swt over the last  months. We’ve employed an effective combination of marketing efforts and created fans of our existing clients.What is your background I’m a seasoned hack, having worked in print journalism for almost  years followed by a few years as a political communications adviser. I spent a brief period teaching English and history at secondary level before entering a newsroom. The working environments were poles apart in terms pace, excitement and... language choices. As a school pupil and university student, I worked on building sites, supermarkets, farms, bars, bread delivery vans, a bakery and even a bacon factory kill-line. However, I had never encountered such flurries of expletives as I did in newsrooms. Great places to work. High pressure, tight deadlines and great target-setting – a superb way to fuel productivity in any work environment.What do you do dferently from your competition and what are your strengths Clear communication with our clients is our greatest strength. We listen intently to what our clients’ goals are, take time to learn about their products and gain full understanding of their ideal customers. We start with a blank canvass and devise bespoke digital strategies to fuel each client’s business growth by engaging their target market effectively and delivering genuine sales leads that are easily quantiable.Who are your main customers Our customers operate across a wide range of sectors. We are currently working with clients across the UK and Ireland, US, France and Spain. Do you have a target in mind in terms of where you want the business to grow We are currently focusing the bulk of our efforts on the island of Ireland with a particular focus on Dublin and Belfast. What challenges have you faced The somewhat ‘snake-oil industry’ reputation of digital marketing sometimes poses a barrier to speaking with decision makers who in the past have invested with little . However, once we’re given an opportunity, we like to let the results do the talking. Who most inspires you Those who thrive in the face of adversity and have strong growth mind-sets. The type of person with the right measure of accountability, skill and relentlessness to inspire their teams to achieve targets. It’s a mind-set akin to that of a top athlete whose body is screaming ‘slow down’ in the business end of a race but whose mind interprets that as a cue to go faster. My we Martina – a former operations manager with Lidl Ireland who co-founded and runs leading human resources consultancy, HR Team – has these qualities in abundance. She inspires me in everything I do.Where do you see yourself in the next few years I love living and working in the North West. Whatever people like to call Derry or Londonderry, it’s a very special place with a lot of talent and a big future in driving the cross-border regional economy. With our headquarters at Catalyst Inc and plans underway for satellite offices in Dublin and the UK, we want to ensure our agency plays a part in shaping that economic prosperity with the provision of more high-quality jobs for the area.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
