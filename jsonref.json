The most expensive collection of 5,800 pogs we saw went for £215 earlier this yearIn light of the new game, we took a look on eBay to see how much original pogs were selling for. There are hundreds of listing for pogs worldwide, both limited edition pogs and general collections of them.The most valuable UK sale we found was for a collection of more than 5,800 pogs in a variety of different themes, including a Star Wars collection, which sold for £215 in March this year.          Job-lot collections of pogs are selling on eBay for an average of £20 for around 200 discsNext was a set of the special edition ‘Chupa Caps – City People Series’ in green which went for £122, then a similar set of \u0027Chupa Caps\u0027 in glow in the dark for £90.88. Several people had also sold job lots of random pogs, with one of 4,009 discs for £80.The average price of those we found were between  £20 and £50 for collections of at least a few hundred pogs, or those which contained some special edition designs. Even some unfinished sets were being sold, with one part set of the \u0027Batman Power Caps\u0027 series selling for £21 in April this year.Inidual pogs and slammers, were also selling on eBay but these are a lot less and going for an average of £1 - £2.           The new Pog game will let users scan in images of their retro pogs for in-game creditsTherefore if you do have a collection left over from the 90s, you could try your hand at selling them online. The new game is being created by the London-based firm Compton Technology which has just launched an Indigogo campaign to raise funds to design the game. The target is $50,000 and it’s reached $5,947 already with 106 backers and a month to go.The free game, named POGS AR, is due to be released in September for android and iPhone users and it’s the first officially licensed mobile game from the World Pog Federation, the biggest seller of pogs in the UK.It will include all the original features of the 90s game – including flipping and slamming – but through a mobile app.          A limited edition physical pog is available for people who back the campaign earlyUsers will be able to scan existing pogs and unlock extra content, earn physical prizes, take part in slamming matches with other players and compete in regular tournaments. For those backing the funding campaign, there will be extra perks available including a limited-edition physical slammer, special in-game content, a custom designed pog character and early access to the game.Sam Park, director of Compton Technology, said: ‘Pogs blend two things people love to do - compete and collect. \u0027But in pogs you play for keeps and must risk losing some of your collection to expand it, so the excitement and intensity increases as you play.          This collection of almost 500 pogs sold on eBay for £31 earlier this year‘By going digital and applying modern technology like AR to the original concept, we’re creating a game community and collectible ecosystem that I believe can be even bigger than the original.’  As the new game is due to launch in September,  the number of people flogging their old pogs online could increase over the next couple of months and therefore the overall value you can sell them for will go down as more people hunt theirs out to sell on. But conversely, as interest grows there may be more buyers, which could also affect the price. On the other hand, if you want to get involved with playing the new game – it could be worth hanging onto the pogs as the designers say you will be able to scan them in and use them with it.One year fixed rate£20 in M\u0026S points after first purchaseDouble points for a year£150 to switch, £50 to stay"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/08/15/4CF3EC4F00000578-5818559-image-a-24_1528466664114.jpg","title":"Dennis Rodmans relationship Kim Jong revealed","story":"    Former NBA player Dennis Rodman has been close friends with Kim Jong-un since early 2013Dennis Rodman and Kim Jong-un’s relationshipRodman’s friendship with the North Korean leader is believed to date back to 2013 when the former NBA player traveled to North Korea with Vice Media reporter Ryan Duffy to host a series of exhibition basketball games in February 2013.Rodman met with Kim and declared him to be his ‘friend for life’ and an ‘awesome guy’ after they bonded while in the country.He later stated in an interview with Good Morning Britain: ‘I hang out with him all the time.

Professor Sarah-Jayne Blakemore said research shows 16-year-olds are undergoing seismic changes in the brain while they took the ‘extremely stressful’ examsShe said it was now believed that the composition of parts of the brain changed ‘hugely’ during adolescence.Speaking at the Hay Festival, Professor Blakemore said: ‘Why do we still have GCSEs?‘I think we always will have them for historic reasons.‘But that’s no good reason to have an extremely stressful exam which, by the way, I think has become more stressful in the last ten years – just at an age where children are going through all this change in terms of brain, behaviour hormones and social changes, and rendering them very vulnerable to things like mental health problems.’She added: ‘Given that our children now have to stay in some form of education until they’re 18, we don’t need those exams aged 16.’                         "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/11/06/4D205EFF00000578-0-image-a-71_1528695154383.jpg","title":"US N Korea officials final summit preparations","story":"    \u0027Until such time as we get the outcome that we’re demanding, economic relief is not going to be provided,\u0027 Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in Singapore, speaking of U.S. depands that North Korea dismantle its nuclear wepons program  The Trump-Kim meeting will be the first ever between a serving U.S. president and a North Korean leader\u0027Sanctions will remain until North Korea completely and verifiably eliminates is weapons of mass destruction programs,\u0027 Pompeo added. \u0027If diplomacy does not move in the right direction ... those measures will increase.\u0027The White House said preparatory negotiations had \u0027moved more quickly than expected\u0027 and Trump would leave Tuesday evening after his talks with Kim, seemingly ruling out the possibility the unprecedented tete-a-tete would continue into a second day.The meeting, long sought by Pyongyang, will be the first ever between a serving U.S. president and a North Korean leader, and will focus on the nuclear bombs and ballistic missiles the North has spent decades developing.Happy Birthday, Mr President: Trump is presented with a...Kim Jong-un\u0027s favorite TV presenter reveals to North Koreans...Kim Jong Un \u0027invited Donald Trump to a SECOND summit in...\u0027No f***ing crazy talk from anybody in the administration\u0027:...Share this articleNorth Korean leader Kim Jong-un reviewed an honor guard before departing Pyongyang for SingaporeHe refused to go into details.

North Korean security personnel keep watch outside the St. Regis hotel, where Kim Jong Un is staying for the Singapore summitPompeo also signalled there would be more discussions to come, adding that Tuesday\u0027s meeting \u0027will set the framework for the hard work that will follow.

Supporters of President Donald Trump stand outside the Singapore prime minister\u0027s official residenceBut critics have warned it risks becoming more of a media circus than an occasion for substantial progress.The U.S. leader has whipsawed on expectations for the meeting, signalling that it could be the beginning of a \u0027process\u0027 of several meetings, only to call it a \u0027one-time shot\u0027 for peace as he embarked for Singapore and saying he would know \u0027within the first minute\u0027 whether an agreement would be possible.\u0027I just think it\u0027s going to work out very nicely,\u0027 said Trump at a working lunch with the prime minister of Singapore, Lee Hsien-Loong.The previous U.S. stance, said Bruce Klingner of the Heritage Foundation, was that \u0027we don\u0027t deploy a president to negotiate a treaty, we deploy a president to sign a treaty where we know where every piece of punctuation is on that piece of paper.\u0027\u0027One of my worries is that we come out of this Singapore summit with something that looks remarkably like the Six Party Talks or anything that the president has previously criticised but it is hyped as something that\u0027s historic and new and groundbreaking,\u0027 he said.The North\u0027s official KCNA news agency called the summit \u0027historic,\u0027 saying it would take place in a \u0027changed era\u0027 and \u0027under the great attention and expectation of the whole world.\u0027Kim would exchange \u0027wide-ranging and profound views\u0027 on issues including \u0027building a permanent and durable peace-keeping mechanism on the Korean peninsula\u0027 and \u0027realising the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula,\u0027 it added.It formally referred to Trump by his full name in the Monday report, including his middle initial -- the first time it has done so.Kim\u0027s sister and close aide Kim Yo Jong is also in Singapore, and is believed to have travelled separately on the ageing Soviet-made Ilyushin-62 that is the leader\u0027s personal aircraft."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/04/18/4CE7266500000578-0-image-m-8_1528131587535.jpg","title":"Passenger forces Jet2 flight divert following disgraceful behaviour blow doll in","story":"    The Jet2 plane was on its way from Belfast to Ibiza when the passenger became abusive after being refused alcohol (file picture)A Jet2 spokesman said the decision to ert was taken due \u0027the deplorable behaviour of a particularly disruptive customer\u0027, who has now been handed a lifetime ban.A woman who was on the flight with her partner and four-month-old baby told the BBC that the man was part of a \u0027large stag group\u0027 that was \u0027quite rowdy\u0027 when they came on board.First-time flier who drank to soothe his nerves and was...Pictured: Husband-to-be and his raucous stag do party who...Share this articleShe said the stag group were some of the last passengers to board the plane.\u0027The captain introduced himself and gave a really stern warning and reiterated that only alcohol bought on board could be consumed on flight and duty free can\u0027t be consumed.\u0027The passenger said the ersion doubled the length of their trip.\u0027Passengers couldn\u0027t get off the plane and it was roasting,\u0027 she said.

According to witness statements, after being woken by smoke alarms, a resident called the fire brigade just before 1am.Four fire engines arrived at the scene minutes later and as the crew dealt with the fire in the fridge freezer, flames began to grow in other areas of the kitchen and images revealed that it had spread to the cladding before the firefighters had even arrived.As the fire continued to spread, by 2am the London Fire Bridge had declared it a ‘major incident’ and at this point, around 40 fire engines were at the location or on their way. In addition to this, because of Grenfell Tower’s ‘stay put’ fire policy, many residents were told to remain in their flats by emergency services.The ‘stay put’ order was abandoned at just before 3am and 65 people were rescued from the building by firefighters, 144 managing to escape before the order was abandoned, but only 36 after. By 4:30am, the entire building was engulfed and the fire did not stop until 1am the next day.          Photo issued by the Grenfell Tower Inquiry of the kitchen in Flat 16 where the fire startedGrenfell Tower vigilWriting for the Evening Standard, Prime Minister Theresa May has revealed that she will ‘always regret’ not meeting the residents of Grenfell Tower after the disaster and made it clear the belief she ‘didn’t care’ was ‘never the case’.She continued: ‘What I did not do on that first visit was meet the residents and survivors who had escaped the blaze. But the residents of Grenfell Tower needed to know that those in power recognised and understood their despair.‘And I will always regret that by not meeting them that day, it seemed as though I didn’t care.’ The Grenfell Tower inquiry has been halted for a week so that memorials and vigils can take place to mark the anniversary.The North Kensington community will come together for a 24-hour vigil on the eve of the anniversary and at 1:30am BST on Thursday, June 14, the names of all the fire’s victims will be read out at St Clement’s church.At 12pm, survivors and the bereaved will also gather near Grenfell Tower for a minute’s silence, the tower being lit green alongside 12 other tower blocks in the area, from 12:54am, the time the fire is thought to have started and will be for the following four evenings.

Zhukova and Abramovich were last seen together in September in NYC (above) And while they may have been one of the richest couples in the world, the pair were dressed down in jeans and simple tops when DailyMail.com caught them dropping the kids of in school last September just after their split.Zhukova grew up in Russia before moving to Houston, Texas when her parents split.Elena Zhukova was a molecular biologist and Dasha\u0027s father was in the oil trade, which is how she came to meet Abramovich.Zhukova and her mother eventually moved to Los Angeles, where she would finish high school and then attend the University of California.Zhukova also has a half-sister Katya and half-brother Yuri.Her first high-profile romance was with Russian tennis star Marat Saffin while she was still in college, but after meeting Abramovich in late 2005 she began spending more and more time with the Russian oligarch.He eventually orced his second wife Irina, the mother of five of his children, and she received a $300 million settlement which included a yacht, plane and homes in Moscow and London.Zhukova and Abramovich married around 2007, something she did not reveal until a 2015 interview with The Wall Street Journal, one of only two profiles she granted during her time with Abramovich.The two are incredibly private, especially Abramovich who would only be seen with his wife at football matches, occasional gallery openings in Moscow or on vacation in St Barths or the South of France.Zhukova had a fashion line prior to their union, Kova \u0026amp T, and during the marriage would open Garage while also creating a magazine and editorial site of the same name.Vice purchased a controlling stake in the magazine back in 2016.  Abramovich has homes all over the world and is the owner of Eclipse, the second largest yacht in the world.He is currently turning four townhouses in Manhattan\u0027s Upper East Side into one mega mansion, and owns the spectacular Château de la Croë in the South of France.Zhukova owns a $6.5million mansion in Los Angeles and a one bedroom pied-a-terre in New York\u0027s Upper West Side according to property records.She has or will likely receive more property in her orce from Abramovich, who is worth an estimated $11.3 billion. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/31/16/4CC98D6200000578-0-image-a-98_1527781144297.jpg","title":"Sir Paul McCartney returns childhood home time 54 YEARS","story":"    Sir Paul McCartney lived at the house in the Liverpool suburb of AllertonIt\u0027s been a long and winding road but it\u0027s finally led to the door of his childhood home for the first time in more than five decades.Sir Paul McCartney lived at the house in the Liverpool suburb of Allerton as a teenager and wrote several of his hits there.The 75-year-old was persuaded to return to film a skit over the weekend with comedian James Corden for his US chat show.The former Beatle, now with an £820million fortune, strolled around his former home which he last saw in 1964 in what is said to have been an \u0027emotional\u0027 visit.Tour guides told how Sir Paul gave an impromptu rendition of When I\u0027m 64 on the piano in the front room. \u0027There was a coachload of tourists outside, just as there is every day, and suddenly Sir Paul looked out of the window and waved to them,\u0027 said one, Kevin Buckley. \u0027They couldn\u0027t believe it!\u0027Sir Paul moved to the three-bedroom terrace, now owned by the National Trust, with his parents and brother Mike in 1955.

She wants nurseries to teach children these basic skills if parents have failed to do so, to make sure they are ‘school ready’ by the age of five.But yesterday’s LSE study casts doubt over the abilities of nurseries to solve the issue when some children are simply being kept at home.It found almost one in five children delays taking up a free place in pre-school education – most of them from low-income families.Around one third of persistently poor children delays, compared to one sixth of their higher-income peers.The researchers found that persistently poor children are 13 percentage points less likely to attend for the full five terms of free pre-school education than children from higher-income families.Parents need to take mobile phones away from children at...Primary school bans shoes for pupils and teachers so they...Share this articlePersistently poor children were defined as who were eligible for the ‘pupil premium’ – a deprivation indicator – for all three years of early primary school.In addition, migrant children – those who speak English as an additional language – were nearly three times more likely not to take up their full five terms as their peers.The LSE researchers said the findings were worrying because nursery is a key component to bridging the gap in attainment between rich and poor children.Author Dr Tammy Campbell said: ‘Universally funded pre-school education is not, in fact, being accessed equally by all children.‘The families who are benefitting most from the policy are those who are already advantaged in many ways – while low-income children miss out.‘It’s time for a clear and transparent reassessment of the purpose of funding for the pre-school stage – looking properly at which children win under the current system, and at who misses out.’Since 2004, all three and four-year-olds have been allowed a free nursery place.In 2010 the entitlement rose from 12.5 to 15 hours a week and in 2013, free places were extended to two-year-olds from low-income families.In 2017, there was an additional expansion to 30 funded hours a week for three and four-year-olds with working parents.          Poorer parents are less likely to send their pre-school child to nursery even though it is free, according to research (stock image used)The paper, ‘“Universal” early education: who benefits?’, was funded by the Nuffield Foundation and is published in the British Educational Research Journal.It found the free places have been ‘disproportionately benefitting’ children from higher income families who ‘least need a head start’.It said: ‘With over £2,000 now allocated annually to each eligible child, these places have become the central initiative aimed at creating a more equitable start for children in England.‘This is especially true given the squeeze since 2010 on funding for other early childhood initiatives, including Sure Start children’s centres, as well as reductions in cash benefits for families with young children.’The researchers also examined whether the type of pre-school provision available locally makes a difference to take-up.They found that in areas where more children take their places in Sure Start centres, take-up was highest among all children – and the gap between low- and higher-income children much smaller.In contrast, areas with most pre-school places provided through the private sector have the largest gap in take-up between low- and higher-income families.The authors called on the government to re-think their policy to make sure more disadvantaged children benefitted from nurseries.It comes after education secretary Damian Hinds spoke of the tragedy of children turning up to school unable to understand basic commands.Studies have shown these children quickly fall behind and can underachieve for the rest of their lives.Earlier this year, Mr Hinds launched a series of initiatives targeted at disadvantaged families encouraging them to read to their children and sing nursery rhymes, in a bid to help them learn more vocabulary."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/07/08/04C062F5000007D0-0-image-m-12_1528356987659.jpg","title":"How pogs worth","story":"    Cash prize: A collection of more than 5,800 pogs sold on eBay for £215 in March this yearPogs, also known as Tazos and Flippos, are round cardboard discs with colourful designs on one side and the pog logo on the other.There were hundreds of different designs available, and an extensive list can be found on the website milkcapmania.co.uk.Not only were pogs a collectors item, they were a game first which involved using a slammer, a more heavy-duty pog made from metal or plastic, to flip over as many pogs as possible.Now pay £150 if you decide you don\u0027t want a smart meter...Bitten by the solar panel sharks: Homeowners were promised...Beat the Big Six energy price hikes: Join our Energy Switch...Share this articleThe pogs were stacked in equal numbers and players then took turns using the slammer to flip them over – and were able to keep any they did.Allegedly the game originated in Hawaii before moving to the United States and then the UK, where they were launched in 1995 and around 30 million are estimated to have been sold since.Now, a new game is being designed which lets you play pogs through an app on your mobile with people around the world, and you can scan in your old pogs using image recognition technology and use these in the game.          The most expensive collection of 5,800 pogs we saw went for £215 earlier this yearIn light of the new game, we took a look on eBay to see how much original pogs were selling for. There are hundreds of listing for pogs worldwide, both limited edition pogs and general collections of them.The most valuable UK sale we found was for a collection of more than 5,800 pogs in a variety of different themes, including a Star Wars collection, which sold for £215 in March this year.          Job-lot collections of pogs are selling on eBay for an average of £20 for around 200 discsNext was a set of the special edition ‘Chupa Caps – City People Series’ in green which went for £122, then a similar set of \u0027Chupa Caps\u0027 in glow in the dark for £90.88. Several people had also sold job lots of random pogs, with one of 4,009 discs for £80.The average price of those we found were between  £20 and £50 for collections of at least a few hundred pogs, or those which contained some special edition designs. Even some unfinished sets were being sold, with one part set of the \u0027Batman Power Caps\u0027 series selling for £21 in April this year.Inidual pogs and slammers, were also selling on eBay but these are a lot less and going for an average of £1 - £2.           The new Pog game will let users scan in images of their retro pogs for in-game creditsTherefore if you do have a collection left over from the 90s, you could try your hand at selling them online. The new game is being created by the London-based firm Compton Technology which has just launched an Indigogo campaign to raise funds to design the game. The target is $50,000 and it’s reached $5,947 already with 106 backers and a month to go.The free game, named POGS AR, is due to be released in September for android and iPhone users and it’s the first officially licensed mobile game from the World Pog Federation, the biggest seller of pogs in the UK.It will include all the original features of the 90s game – including flipping and slamming – but through a mobile app.          A limited edition physical pog is available for people who back the campaign earlyUsers will be able to scan existing pogs and unlock extra content, earn physical prizes, take part in slamming matches with other players and compete in regular tournaments. For those backing the funding campaign, there will be extra perks available including a limited-edition physical slammer, special in-game content, a custom designed pog character and early access to the game.Sam Park, director of Compton Technology, said: ‘Pogs blend two things people love to do - compete and collect. \u0027But in pogs you play for keeps and must risk losing some of your collection to expand it, so the excitement and intensity increases as you play.          This collection of almost 500 pogs sold on eBay for £31 earlier this year‘By going digital and applying modern technology like AR to the original concept, we’re creating a game community and collectible ecosystem that I believe can be even bigger than the original.’  As the new game is due to launch in September,  the number of people flogging their old pogs online could increase over the next couple of months and therefore the overall value you can sell them for will go down as more people hunt theirs out to sell on. But conversely, as interest grows there may be more buyers, which could also affect the price. On the other hand, if you want to get involved with playing the new game – it could be worth hanging onto the pogs as the designers say you will be able to scan them in and use them with it.One year fixed rate£20 in M\u0026S points after first purchaseDouble points for a year£150 to switch, £50 to stay"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/08/09/4D0A8E2B00000578-5820445-Chancellor_Sebastian_Kurz_said-a-14_1528446722486.jpg","title":"Erdogan denounces Austrian decision close mosques","story":"Recep Tayyip Erdogan insisted Ankara would \u0027have to do something\u0027 in response to Austria\u0027s decision to close mosques and expel Turkish-funded imams          Chancellor Sebastian Kurz (pictured) said the Austrian government would be shutting a hardline Turkish nationalist mosque in Vienna and dissolving a group called the Arab Religious CommunityInterior Minister Herbert Kickl of the far-right Freedom Party (FPOe), the junior partner in Austria\u0027s coalition government said the move concerned imams with alleged links to the Turkish-Islamic Cultural Associations (ATIB) organisation, a branch of Turkey\u0027s religious affairs agency Diyanet.Kickl added the government suspects them of contravening a ban on foreign funding of religious office holders.A Turkish presidential spokesman had on Friday described the Austrian move as \u0027a reflection of the anti-Islam, racist and discriminatory populist wave in this country\u0027.Austria\u0027s right-wing government plans to shut down seven...\u0027It was EASY\u0027: Prankster who duped Foreign Secretary Boris...Boris Johnson spent 18 minutes speaking to prank callers...Share this articleHowever, other European far-right leaders welcomed the announcement.Even Austria\u0027s opposition parties were broadly supportive of Friday\u0027s announcement, with the centre-left Social Democrats calling it \u0027the first sensible thing this government\u0027s done\u0027.But the Green Party pointed out it could serve as a propaganda victory for the Turkish government.

How do we deal with this?When Jean-Paul Sartre said, “Hell is other people”, he was clueless. Social media did not yet exist. Now we all know how hellish other people are, no matter how heavenly their Instas. And we know not what we do. Or at least that’s how the internet is still spoken of, as something newish, out of control and worrying. The gnattish attention s of adults, the limited vocabulary of children, social isolation, Trump, eating disorders, the “alt-right”. All of these are because of the damned old internet. Limiting the time your kids spend online is now a signifier of middle-class parenting is now limiting to limit the time your kids spend online. Really? This is like buying them wooden toys they never play with.We still seem to have no real handle on how we talk about the online world apart from this narrative of fear, addiction and excess. At this stage of the game, I wonder how useful this is. A nine-year-old girl has reportedly been put into rehab for an Xbox addiction so bad that she would rather sit in her own urine than stop for a toilet break. A mother of a 15-year-old boy is fighting for the NHS to diagnose internet gaming addiction, as her son’s life is being ruined by it. The World Health Organization has classified internet gaming addiction as a mental health disorder.On Twitter, people are always boasting about how their time away from Twitter made them feel so much better. I am no better or worse than them. Lily Allen has said she spends five hours a day on Twitter. I can see that lots of journalists doing morespend more time on there than that. If this is addiction, is it the same as addiction to a physical substance such as nicotine? Surely this is about impulse control, a need to feel connected that then has negative consequences in real life, if we’re still operating in this real life v online life binary? The internet is just a medium that delivers feelings. And phones make them deliverable everywhere.Whether it’s a compulsion to shop, gamble or be liked, those feelings existed anyway. Experts will argue over what classifies addiction, but it matters because if the first step of the 12-step programme is to admit our powerlessness, then we completely inidualise the problem into that of people making poor choices. It may indeed feel like that, but a huge cultural shift has occurred that affects our democracy.Distraction is a personal but also a political issue. So is polarisation: the lack of nuance, the tribal anger and the reduction of dialogue to babble is alarming. One solution from a tech pioneer such as Jaron Lanier is to break the bars of the cage that goes everywhere with you, and just stop. Delete the poison. Go cold turkey. A more realistic approach is surely that of Jamie Bartlett, who writes about how we could be more alert citizens online, how we could refresh democracy. This means planning our time online, teaching critical thinking so we can navigate the internet sceptically and safely, and taking responsibility for ourselves rather than outsourcing every decision to Google.It is not about how much we are online but how we behave there. There has been a concerted political failure to think about how this now old technology has allowed fake news to flourish, data to be missold and democracy undermined.Am I in denial about my own dependence? Probably. I waste hours looking at all sorts of rubbish. I avoid intimacy by having conversations that I know I can leave. But I also learn – and I don’t want to go to rehab. No. No. No. I just want us all to have more control, more say, more understanding of the systems we are operating in. I make no distinction between real life and online in this desire. Do I need to?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eab4fc423fd0a0b6d03b2a98149edadc6305e86b/0_87_3671_2202/master/3671.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8d67c31012c239e4bc08382e847e0816","title":"theresa may brussels brexit","story":"A soft Brexit was effectively signed off six months ago. But there’s still time for the PM to play a decent last handA lot of confusion arises from the way “Brexit” has come to describe two very different things. It can be heroic liberation from foreign control – a common British definition. Or it can be the task of dismantling the UK’s membership of the European Union, in which heroism plays no part. That is how it is generally understood abroad.They sound the same and are spelt the same way, but the meanings have erged so far that really they should be separate words. One is an event, the other is a process. One is booked for 29 March 2019 the other will drag on for a decade or more. One is a fantasy, the other is a negotiation. Fantasies tend to be non-negotiable.On Tuesday, the Commons starts voting on amendments to the EU withdrawal bill and the debate will be passionate, invoking democracy and patriotism. “Brexit” will mostly be used in its fantastical sense. But some rebellious Tories and many Labour MPs will deploy the B-word according to international usage, speaking the language of negotiable agreement. (That is also what Theresa May will have to do at a Brussels summit at the end of June.)To understand the difference, it helps to identify the moment when the two meanings parted company. It was 8 December 2017. May presented the “joint report” that closed the first phase of separation talks. To seal the deal, the prime minister promised the EU an invisible border between the UK and the Republic of Ireland. She also promised Arlene Foster, leader of the Democratic Unionist party, that there would be no new differences in the arrangements covering Northern Ireland and mainland Britain. The only way to satisfy both pledges at once is for the UK to retain near-total regulatory alignment with the EU for the foreseeable future. There may have been some ambiguity lurking in the tortured official syntax but, in essence, May signed off on a soft Brexit. That was six months ago. The ink is dry.If Jacob Rees-Mogg or Boris Johnson believed half of what they have said about ditching the talks, threatening to go it alone on “WTO rules”, they would have rejected the joint report and demanded May’s head. They didn’t, and so their bluff was called. You do sometimes still hear chat about “no deal”, but only from people who would see setting fire to their own heads as a viable alternative to the hairdresser.Yet the Tories did not accept the consequences of their actions in December. They still think it should be possible to ditch EU regulations without disrupting trade. They want UK enterprises to be part of a single European commercial space, competing with EU businesses, but with a right to selectively apply EU law. No jurisdiction in the world would offer that privilege. Brussels said as much. But off went the cabinet, hunting for magical ways to restore a border without border controls (“customs partnership”), or to reintroduce border controls without a border (“maximum facilitation”).None of this made sense outside the UK. In\u0026nbspdomestic debate, the word “Brexit” was still being used nebulously and dishonestly, as it had been by the leave\u0026nbspcampaign. In Brussels its definition was refined by the joint report: it meant sticking to the deal. The\u0026nbspTories have wasted 2018 so far arguing about deals with\u0026nbspa Europe of their imaginations, as opposed to dealing with the one that exists in law. The parameters of available agreement are known. May could withdraw mainland Britain from the customs union and single market – economically potty, but technically possible – while submitting Northern Ireland to joint jurisdiction with the EU. She would challenge the DUP to suck it up because if they brought the government down they might wake up to find Jeremy Corbyn (whom they dread as an agent of Irish reunification) in Downing Street.Or, she could sign the whole of the UK up to a customs union and single market membership. That\u0026nbspwould entail submission to European court rulings, payment into EU budgets and free movement of people. It would be just like EU membership but worse, because there would be no top-table seat to defend national interests. If she plays her diplomatic cards very well, the prime minister might upgrade that package to include a consultative role when big decisions are being made, plus a modest dispensation on free movement. Skirting\u0026nbspthe boundary between realism and fantasy is a proposal to stay in the single market for goods only – allowing a more independent trade policy in services. Ambitious maybe not impossible.Those are the runways on which the Brexit plane can land. It is circling in the air because May doesn’t want to tell the passengers about the destination. Wisely, she rejected advice from her backbenchers to ditch the plane in the sea or slam it into a cliff. The point of departure now feels very remote. Even if she wanted to go back, it isn’t clear whether there is enough goodwill in the EU tank to get us there. Time is the fuel and she is running low.And May is alone in the cockpit. No one else wants to make the announcement: fasten your safety belts, we are starting our descent. The days when Brexit meant gazing out of the window at wispy cloud castles are over. Corbyn doesn’t want to say it. Johnson can’t say it. They don’t want to tell the public that the options are either: a deal worse than membership or no deal, which is worse than the worst deal.There is orderly arrival in a second-rate location, or there is a fiery crash-landing. That is what it means to honour the referendum. That is what it meant all along. There is no sunnier destination just over the horizon. But there is also no political leader with the courage to admit it. Instead we have our prime minister, afraid of the runway, without a clue how to turn the plane around, flying on empty."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ff8a4c7d9d250ff0080e3447ea172ebbf1132d39/0_0_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f66618b8b3c56a315df623722e6edd70","title":"how we made spare rib magazine","story":"‘WH Smith wouldn’t stock some issues. One cover showed a woman in the throes of an orgasm’There were lots of things rumbling around in 1971. Germaine Greer’s The Female Eunuch had come out, and there were protests against Miss World – but they didn’t seem to reach the ordinary woman. I had dropped out of university and was working on an underground newspaper called Frendz. It was an “alternative” culture, but for women it was extremely sexist. If you didn’t agree to get laid, you were a “straight”.We – Marsha Rowe and I – wanted to make a feminist magazine that would be widely read. She was going out with the son of journalist Claud Cockburn, and we were all at a Chinese restaurant one evening when Claud picked up a spare rib and said: “Call it Spare Rib.” It was a moment of genius.There were terrific arguments at the launch party. The gay rights people were shouting that we weren’t supporting them, the radical feminists were shouting that we weren’t radical enough. You’re always going to displease someone. We wrote an editorial saying liberation was as important for men as it was for women – we were adamant that feminism was going to be brilliant for both sexes. Inevitably, that fell away. I wish we’d been able to explore it more.We seriously thought we were going to take on Woman and Woman’s Own. We’d do parties to raise money and wouldn’t let people out until they’d given us £20. At one point we were so desperate, we asked an Arab sheikh for money. He was extremely nonplussed. I don’t think anyone had ever asked him for a donation without offering some kind of sexual favour.Certain branches of WH Smith wouldn’t stock some issues. One cover had a woman supposedly in the throes of an orgasm with the line: “The liberated orgasm … Make a New Year resolution to have one.” It went over very badly. The magazine was also a difficult advertising proposition. The first issue had a makeup ad in which a woman was very demurely pulling aside a lace curtain to reveal half her face. After that, we realised, well, actually, we can’t run those kind of ads.I left in 1974, but Spare Rib kept publishing until 1993. It was there through the crucial years of feminism. It pushed what needed to be put in front of people – and it didn’t give up. In 2013, the journalist Charlotte Raven asked if she could relaunch the magazine, but in the end we said no. It played a part in changing the landscape for women in Britain, but things have their time. You resurrect them at your peril.I did what was expected of me in the early 1960s in Australia and became a secretary. I’d seen the alternative magazine Oz and thought: “This is fabulous.” So I got a job there and saw how it was put together. At the end of the decade, I moved to London. At a meeting of women who worked in the underground press, we realised that we did all the support work, and then we went home and looked after men there as well. That revelation – actually speaking it – was extraordinary. I suggested Spare Rib at the third of these meetings. I remember Rosie’s expression, those big blue eyes looking all smiley and positive. Six months later, in June 1972, our first edition was on the stands, on sale for 17 and a half pence. We had a feature on romantic novels and a brilliant piece by Patricia Hewitt on women’s pensions. I’d met someone who knew George Best, so we interviewed him for the man’s page, which was partly a satire on the usual women’s page, but also because we wanted to explore what men thought about feminism.We called ourselves an alternative women’s news magazine. I adored magazines and their visual aspect, but we could only afford two colours, to go with black and white. I wanted Spare Rib to have all the traditional elements of a women’s magazine, but with a different spin. Our first fashion spread was a double page on jeans. No one in fashion ever mentioned jeans back then.The women’s liberation movement changed my life, but I discovered my voice through Spare Rib. We did a feature on the first women’s centre in London and the first refuge. At that point, domestic abuse was rarely talked about. It was something women were blamed for. As soon as news spread of what we were trying to do, people wanted to contribute. Those early days in the office were a joy, working with women, sharing ideas, thinking things through. It was so non-competitive. It took about four years for Spare Rib to find its feet. By the time 10 years had gone by, it had become more of a magazine for the women’s movement. I think it lost a certain spark. We’d had a wonderful DIY page and a cooking section – and all these things had disappeared. The design element lost some of the early brilliance, too. It became much more solid.Financially, it was tough going. In later years, they had to rely increasingly on grants, and the readership shrank. But the fact that it lasted 21 years is a tribute to the series of brilliant women who worked there. • Spare Rib features in Print!

We know everything else comes on the back of that.“We are seeing now that this is a team that is enjoying each other’s company, getting on well, very proud to represent their nation, that have some talent, a real desire and determination to play for England and are determined to play in a style that people are enjoying watching. We ask people to pay a lot of money to watch football. In the end, we want to entertain where we possibly can.”Southgate added: “I think there was a shift in November when we brought in some of the younger players. There was a clear shift in the identity of the team, we went to a back three and people have been warmed by that, not only the young players in this squad, but the young players in the system and the success with the junior teams. The Under-17s’ World Cup win, in particular, came at a moment where the profile of our young players was really high.“We are just trying to improve every day we work together. We know we are not the finished article – in fact, we’re a long way from it – but I think people see signs of progress and enjoy watching us and the manner in which we try to play.”England have won only six matches in the knockout stages of major international tournaments since their World Cup triumph in 1966, the last victory of that kind being 12 years ago against Ecuador. As such, Southgate has been reluctant to be drawn into talking about England’s chances of winning the competition.“I keep being asked the question and I keep finding different ways to answer it. Our focus as a team has to be on the bits we can control: constantly trying to improve, playing in a style that we’ve used in the last year or so, and that people have warmed to.“If we do all of those things, play with a smile on our faces and enjoy our football, I think we will get results. Ultimately, we know we’ll be judged on results but we have to focus on the processes. We hope we can send people to work the following day having enjoyed those matches. I know what those tournament experiences can be like and we desperately want to bring that.“We’re all looking forward to getting on with the tournament now because there’s been such a long preparation. We’ve had weeks together with a really good training camp. I’m really pleased with the performances in the two games and we just want to get out to the tournament now, get to Russia and experience all the feelings of being in a World Cup.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/24b13ebcbcdf7b83be741f19764c47f72488a305/0_155_2569_1541/master/2569.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1883216b3dc27fa5e5ebf6ee69587435","title":"jordan pickford englands confident no 1 who could do a job in midfield","story":"Hardened by his rise through the lower leagues, the young goalkeeper’s excellent distribution sets his apart from his peers This article is part of the ’s 2018 World Cup Experts’ Network, a cooperation between some of the best media organisations from the 32 countries who have qualified for Russia. the is running previews from two countries each day in the run-up to the tournament kicking off on 14 June.During Jordan Pickford’s Sunderland days he occasionally played midfield in training ground practice games. As the goalkeeper showcased an extraordinarily varied passing range, crowned by the unerringly accurate, long range, side-foot volley which has become his hallmark, he invariably looked the best inidual on view.Impressed onlookers routinely agreed that Pickford possessed the sort of assured left foot leading coaches pay millions of pounds for. “It’s like watching a top midfielder,” said David Moyes, his manager at the time. “Jordan’s got a very big kick but he’s also got a very good passing range, he can go short, he can go long. Distribution is such a big part of goalkeeping these days and his is very good indeed.”Signed by Everton for £30m last summer, Pickford is also rather useful in central defence. Granted, with the ball at his feet, the 24-year-old often looks a natural-born midfield playmaker but he also seems adept as a classy sweeper.“I played Jordan at centre half in training so he understood what it was like for defenders when keepers came over the top of them for crosses,” recalled Kevin Ball, Sunderland’s former academy manager. “Jordan loved it. He could easily have been a centre half.“When he was in goal, the centre halves would split, hoping to take the ball from him but he’d just ping it upfield perfectly. I’d say ‘play it out Jordan, let them do it,’ but he’d reply ‘why? I’m better than them.’ He wasn’t being a pain, just honest. Jordan has confidence in his ability and his opinions. He’ll challenge you, he’ll say ‘I don’t agree’. I like that.”For his part, Pickford thrived under the exacting taskmaster. “Bally was a great coach who wouldn’t give us any leeway,” said Pickford. “We had to do all the old apprentice jobs, clean the dressing room, put Dubbin on the coaches’ boots.”Ball recognised that Pickford needed challenges and helped ensure that the boyhood Sunderland supporter from Washington, Tyne and Wear, received them.Loan stints at Darlington, Alfreton, Burton, Carlisle, Bradford and Preston duly followed with their fans being treated to not only a series of stunning saves but early glimpses of that trademark rocket like sidefoot volley with which Pickford would later make so many goals for Jermain Defoe in Sunderland’s first team.“There’s no place to hide at places like Darlo and Alfreton,” reflected Pickford who was driven to the latter club’s home games by his parents and would sit in the back seat consuming the chicken and pasta lunches his mother had prepared in a tupperware box as they traversed the motorway network. “Playing for Darlington at 17 I learnt so much. You’re up against men, it’s a physical and mental test against big centre halves needing to pay their mortgages.”The stellar hand-eye co-ordination which would serve him so well was possibly inherited from his father, now a builder but once a gamekeeper on Lord Lambton’s County Durham estate.By the time he reached Preston, Pickford was a star in waiting. “I’ve never seen anyone kick a ball like Jordan can,” says Chris Kirkland, the former Liverpool goalkeeper who deputised for him at Deepdale. “I could never have kicked a ball as far as Jordan.“But the biggest thing about him was his command of the penalty area. All goalkeepers make saves but Jordan’s command of the area impressed me. He came out for crosses and high balls with an authority rare for one so young. He was brilliant.”Such fearlessness was evident as a small boy in Washington. Playing football with his older brother on the family’s asphalt drive the budding goalkeeper threw himself repeatedly onto that unforgiving surface as if it were a soft play area.A similarly unflinching candour, sets Pickford slightly apart from the crowd in today’s sometimes publicly synthetic football world. After Everton recently beat Newcastle United, Sunderland’s great rivals, he married a triumphant Instagram picture with the unapologetically undiplomatic message: “No better feeling than keeping them quiet.”If those north-east roots are the ties that bind the life of an England international who remains close to his family and lives with the girlfriend he has dated since they were 14, Pickford’s imposing amalgam of psychological and physical strength threatens to unnerve opponents in Russia. “Jordan has exceptional wrist and forearm strength,” says Adrian Tucker, Pickford’s goalkeeping coach at Sunderland. “He’s got excellent hands.” Not to mention exceptional feet and an exemplary mindset.For years England have been looking for a No 1 that can take them far in an international tournament. Finally, they may have found someone.

I just feel like I’m going to be happier arguing about VAR than about nerve agentIn 2012, the Pointless host Richard Osman conceived the World Cup of Crisps, in which 32 big-hitting varieties of crisp were pitted against each other in group stages, all decided by Twitter polls. Thereafter, the winners proceeded to knockout stages, meeting in quarter-finals, before progressing to – well, I believe you are familiar with this general format.Osman has since expanded the idea to the World Cup of Chocolate, and a book called The World Cup of Everything, which invites readers to stage their own hotly contested tournaments between the weightiest competitors in the fields of such things as bands, animals, biscuits and so on.I have never game-theorised a World Cup of My World Cup Lies but in a way that particular tournament happens every four years anyway, whether I want it to or not. I have simply yet to formalise it. Which of my grandest self-deceptions would win? Well, clearly, a lot depends on the draw. For instance, I wouldn’t like “I honestly don’t get emotional about England anymore” to be drawn in the same group as “I don’t secretly find it a release once England crash out”. It would be too early for them to meet.See also “I never make jokes based on lazy prejudices regarding national character” and “I especially never do this out of thinly disguised jealously that the nation in question is better at football than us”. I mean, I could go on. “I have never attempted to make an in-game football bargain with a god I otherwise know doesn’t exist.” “I am happy for Germany’s success.”Oh, the things you tell yourself. Or the things I tell myself, at any rate. I’m sure you’re much purer, much less hypocritical and much less of a terrible person than me. Especially when you’re on the internet.But on a personal note, the World Cup is a quadrennial chance to be reminded of my own shallows and self-delusions. I can feel it in those moments of worshipping – literally and wholly loving – a player I despise at club level, for putting England through in the last minute with some scrappy, flukey, comically undeserved goal I basically know is only deferring the agony to come.At the same time, the psychic pall of the England shirt traditionally gets too much even for those of us not having to wear it. It’s all rather too tired and emotional, eventually, like some toxic family Christmas that’s gone on too long. There is a kind of relief and freshly laundered feel to a tournament once England have inevitably buggered off out of it. Think of it as “the reset”.Thereafter I switch to indulging one of the other World Cup lies I tell myself: namely, that I’m a proper sporting purist who is now genuinely happy to simply be watching great international sides that are not my own make their electrifying progress toward a trophy I am absolutely relaxed about England never winning again.Those are just the printable lies but let’s not get ahead of ourselves. Instead, set your sights on adventure, as we contemplate Russia 2018 – what could be your last 32-team World Cup!Obviously, I cannot wait for it to start. Not least because, given various developing news stories relating to our hosts, the tournament has rather ghastlier noises-off than usual. I just feel like I’m going to be happier arguing about VAR than about nerve agent.Then again, it’s fair to say the opening game – Russia v Saudi Arabia – is not the “prospect to salivate over” of footballing cliche. On the one hand, the two countries are engaged in a version of proxy war in Syria. On the other, they’ve formed a strategic alliance on energy. Either way, Vladimir Putin will be in attendance. As for further presidential cameos at a tournament he has spent almost £9bn on, despite being not that into it … Well, according to a Kremlin spokesman’s most recent update, “everything will depend on how things go”.This feels like a remark of unsettling vagueness when applied to Putin. The Russian president used his last sporting mega-event as a curtain raiser to invading Crimea, so it is to be hoped this “how things go” is a reference to Russia’s progress through the group stages of the football World Cup, as opposed to any potential sudden developments in Russia’s role in the conflict in Syriathe investigation into the poisoning of a former Russian spy and his daughter in Salisburythe investigation of possible Russian interference in the 2016 US presidential electionany other of the crazy shit the Russian president’s currently into.So yes, as I say – it does help once the actual football gets underway. And the actual fibbing. The lying – the sweet, sweet self-delusion – is really the key to it all."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1c4eba4049c79e498aad4653bab024da5ea3af39/0_19_4034_2421/master/4034.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=21ab36f24811e20e82d8aaedc6bf4472","title":"bootleg liquor africa latin america","story":"Up to half of all alcoholic drinks consumed in Africa and Latin America are illicit, often with fatal consequencesUp to half of all alcoholic drinks consumed in countries across Africa and Latin America are illicit – more than double previous estimates – according to new analysis.Methanol, mortuary formaldehyde and battery acid were among a cocktail of toxic ingredients found in unregulated drinks, according to the International Alliance for Responsible Drinking (Iard).In Kenya, one of the most common varieties of home-produced alcohol is called “chang’aa”, or “kill me quick” . The spirit is widely available in poor townships and is often made with contaminated water and potentially lethal methanol. One variant, “jet-five”, is spiked with jet fuel, while another contains embalming fluid.The figures for consumption of illegal alcohol exceeded 2014 estimates by the World Health Organization (WHO), which said that illegal and informally produced alcohol accounted for nearly a quarter of all alcohol consumed globally. The Iard report used data from Euromonitor International to look at consumption of illicit alcohol in 26 countries, the majority in Latin America and Africa. It found that in low and middle-income countries, bootleg alcohol accounted for a “sizeable proportion” of total sales. The report, Alcohol in the Shadow Economy, said illicit alcohol contributes to widening health inequalities.The production of illegal alcohol, which is cheaper and often more readily available than regulated alcohol, is largely driven by poverty, the report found, although culture was an important factor. Across Africa, many producers of homebrew are women who are the sole earners for their families.In April police in Indonesia seized alcohol containing mosquito repellent and cough medicine, after 141 people died from organ failure after drinking moonshine liquor, or oplosan. It was the worst case of alcohol poisoning in the country, where 24 people died in 2016, and 12 people died in 2014. Other deaths have occurred over the past decade in Libya, Russia and the Czech Republic, the report said.The combined revenue loss from illicit alcohol in 18 countries mentioned in the report was found to be $1.8bn (£1.5bn). The loss to Colombia in 2015 was $406m  in Mozambique, the loss in 2014 was $285m.Henry Ashworth, Iard CEO and president, said: “What this report tries to do is to show the scale of the challenge and the cost to health, society and to government.“Tackling harmful use of alcohol requires a collaborative and united response from public, private and not-for-profit sectors. But these partnerships can only thrive when there is a broad and regulated private sector able to play its role in improving health and tackling harmful drinking.”He cited South Africa, where communities had flagged concern over disorder, noise and crime associated with unregulated drinking houses or shebeens. A code of practice introduced by inidual owners had helped increase the quality of alcohol produced and allowed the operators to maintain order and prevent harm, while remaining outside government control. He cited the UK’s thriving microbrewery industry as an example of how countries could produce viable alternatives.

In her latest crusade against identity politics, the writer decries the “drunk on virtue” publisher Penguin Random House’s pledge to ensure new authors and colleagues reflect the UK population by 2025, “taking into account ethnicity, gender, sexuality, social mobility and disability”.Why so bad? Because, naturally, it will result in crap books. More ersity, as this all-too-familiar, offensive argument goes, amounts to less quality.“If an agent submits a manuscript written by a gay transgender Caribbean who dropped out of school at seven and powers around town on a mobility scooter,” Shriver wrote, “it will be published, whether or not said manuscript is an incoherent, tedious, meandering and insensible pile of mixed-paper recycling.”But what if – and Wide Awoke appreciates this may be unimaginable to Shriver – said gay trans Caribbean person is also a good writer? If he, she or they have, in spite of their talent, been unable to break into an industry that is notoriously white, middle-class and risk-averse? An industry in which a writer has more chance of making it on to the bestseller lists if their name is David than if they are from an ethnic minority?Ironically, considering we talk about ersity more than we see it increase, the word and concept appear to be rubbing white privileged people up the wrong way more and more. Recently, another piece, by writer David Brooks – a white man! – outlined what he branded a “misplaced idolisation of ersity” and warned of the dangers of social fragmentation caused by “ersity for its own sake”. But the only real danger ersity poses, which perhaps is threatening to some, is greater inclusion.Conflating ersity with a box-ticking or virtue-signalling exercise misappropriates its true meaning, which, if done properly by genuinely erse decision-makers, is always about excellence. As a BAME, bisexual, female writer (I know, check out all my boxes). I have been on the receiving end of this, erm, pale imitation of ersity many times. The uncomfortable sense of being on a festival panel for tokenistic reasons. The time I won an award and was praised for ticking boxes rather than writing a book. This is not true ersity, but it so easily mimics it.Equality and quality are not mutually exclusive. It is deeply hurtful to say that they are, because it suggests that those of us who fall under ersity’s wide umbrella are not as good, smart or worthy as the establishment that it is merit, rather than prejudice and a certain narrowness of perspective that accompanies privilege, that has held us back. The truth? An “incoherent, tedious, meandering and insensible pile of mixed-paper recycling” can come from anywhere. And so, too, can greatness."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2c5434024b948c622f04fc544e0e98dac29faef3/0_211_4637_2782/master/4637.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3af5a88e63f1787a345e6ef3a2670be4","title":"tesco sells green lemons as spanish supply sours","story":"Supermarket says South African lemons are mature but need longer to turn yellowTesco has started selling green lemons after relaxing its quality specifications in an attempt to avoid shortages in its UK stores and reduce food waste.Although the skins are slightly green, the fruit is as zesty and robust as lemons that have turned completely yellow, while the flesh inside is ripe and edible.The UK’s largest retailer has lifted its colour requirements for lemons partly to help offset domestic food waste by adding up to an extra two days’ shelf life to the fruit as it ripens.There has also been a shortage of yellow lemons caused by poor growing conditions in Spain, which supplies the UK with the bulk of the fruit until the end of spring.South Africa’s lemon season traditionally begins in late June and it takes over as the UK’s main supplier. However, Tesco will take the greener South African lemons earlier than usual to avoid gaps in its supply.“These greener lemons that we now have on sale are already mature and perfect tasting inside but need longer for the skin to turn yellow,” said Tesco’s citrus fruit buyer Savia Weidinger-Reich. “With the South African crop, that happens towards the end of June as evenings cool, which helps the fruit to colour. The move not only means that shoppers will again be easily able to buy a fruit that is growing in popularity, but they will gain extra freshness.”The greener lemons – the same price as regular yellow ones – are unlikely to be confused with limes as they have the more distinctive, elongated shape of lemons.

The Royal British Legion provides high quality recovery and rehabilitation support to ex-service personnel who find themselves wounded, injured, sick, or who are experiencing multiple challenges such as being out of work, dealing with mental health problems, financial issues and alcohol abuse.The programme’s flagship is the £27m Battle Back Centre at Lilleshall in the West Midlands, which provides sports and adventure activities designed to promote self-confidence and improve motivation to aid recovery. Tailored programmes help the wounded cope with both physical and psychological challenges.For most, leaving the armed forces means starting a completely new career. The Legion offers a wide range of services designed to help ex-service men and women find employment including Civvy Street – a dedicated website, which lists job vacancies and provides online training resources and information on changing careers. The Legion can also provide funding for additional training or education through its employment support grant scheme.Anyone planning on starting a business will also be supported in their ambition. The Legion provides guidance on business plans, finances and tax requirements. Specialist assistance is also available to put together a business plan, source funding and even find mentors.Not everyone is a DIY whiz and not all former members of the services are equipped to tackle repair jobs. However, rather than booking a handyman, The Royal British Legion provides a handy van service across 21 counties to help with minor home adaptations and repairs for older or less able veterans and their families. The fully trained team assists with maintenance round the home – covering everything from putting up shelves and grab rails to building access ramps and storage sheds to provide shelter for personal mobility vehicles.They can also install the Legion’s system of care phones. A type of personal alarm, a care phone is a telephone-based unit worn on a user’s wrist or neck that can be used to summon help in an emergency.It can be tough and stressful for families and children of those serving in the armed forces. Often some light relief can make a real difference, but taking a much-needed holiday can prove difficult for those on a tight budget. The Legion provides a range of welfare services including week-long adventure breaks for children. These breaks offer a great opportunity for youngsters to have fun, make new friends, have new experiences and improve their self-esteem while giving parents a well-earned break.Parents are not left out either. Week-long breaks for service families are offered at four Legion centres in traditional British seaside resorts during the Easter, summer and October school holidays. Guests are free to take in the sea air while exploring the coast or visiting local tourist attractions. The breaks offer rest and recuperation for people recovering from life-changing events such as illness or bereavement.In the UK today, one in six people over 80 has dementia and by 2025 more than a million people could have the condition. Inevitably, former members of the services feature in these figures. The Royal British Legion provides care in the shape of its purpose built dementia wings at four of its six residential care homes in Somerset, Warwickshire, Norfolk and north Yorkshire, as well as specialist, admiral nurses – developed in partnership with Dementia UK – who work in the community. Currently operating in Lancashire, the west Midlands, Hampshire and Somerset, admiral nurses offer specialist support, information and advice to the family carers of people living with dementia within the armed forces community.Leaving the armed forces means having to deal with an array of financial issues that can be confusing if you’re not prepared for them. Bring in The Royal British Legion’s team of benefits and money advisers. This financial team provides support and guidance in the event ex-service people and their families suffer money problems or need guidance to help set up a new home or access benefits. It also provides help with debt and other unexpected crises, plus support through grants.The Legion has set up MoneyForce, a dedicated website designed to improve understanding of financial issues with information on essentials such as interest charges or buying a home. Managed in partnership with the Ministry of Defence and Standard Life Charitable Trust, the scheme has saved beneficiaries £70m through increases in benefits, tax credits, writing off debts and gaining grants since it began in 2007. It gives ex-service men and women the skills they need to manage their money, smoothing the transition to civilian life.To find out more about The Royal British Legion click here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/15ef6fe4450a7e99b3a72f4e7ea3552214cf10b3/0_153_2799_1679/master/2799.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c5c23e9345f63d34c0f2c02fb7b9c098","title":"from medical discharge to the london marathon one military couples story of resilience","story":"When Mike Kiff was discharged from the army, chronic pain and depression threatened to end his marriage, but with support from The Royal British Legion he and his wife have rebuilt their life togetherIn 2005, Cpl Mike Kiff fell from a roof and dislocated his shoulder badly while on active duty. The injury required surgery but seemed unlikely to curtail a career in the armed forces.Although it was never quite right after the incident, he continued in his role. Then, one day in 2014, while serving in Kabul, Afghanistan, he reached for his rifle and felt a blinding pain in the same shoulder. The pins that were holding it together had been ripped out, tearing tendons and fracturing the bone.“In my mind I knew it was all over then, the pain was so severe I couldn’t breathe,” he recalls of the incident. “Things went downhill from there.”He attempted to continue his job, but after a few weeks Kiff’s senior officer made it clear he was in no position to function effectively in what was a war zone. He was flown back to his base in Germany where he found his problems shelved as the rest of the regiment began a move back to the UK. The injury also meant that a pending promotion was off the table because he was now considered unfit for duty. Serious injury often signals the end of a career in the armed forces but making the transition back to civilian life can be a very difficult process for both the service person affected and their family.With little external support and constant chronic pain he began to sink into severe depression, which soon had an impact on his relationship.“I knew Mike was struggling badly from the calls we had when he was in Afghanistan, but when he returned to base it began to fall apart almost from the moment he walked through the door. He was no longer the same man who had gone away,” says wife Linda. The couple had met while Mike was on leave in Bournemouth, married in 2006 and have two children.As the barracks emptied out around them, their problems were low priority. However, Mike had some good fortune when a medical officer recommended a break at Brydon House, a recently opened personnel recovery centre that had received major funding from The Royal British Legion.“I had physiotherapy, received specialist counselling and found people who were prepared to listen to my problems. It was a completely different level of support, a hundred times better,” he says.After a lengthy recovery process, Mike was medically discharged and the family returned to Bournemouth from Germany. Unfortunately, their problems worsened. They found themselves homeless and were forced to move in with Linda’s parents. Meanwhile, Mike was jobless, in severe pain and on antidepressants. Linda took a job working nights. Their relationship deteriorated rapidly.“I had no one to turn to,” says Linda. “I’m Mike’s support system, of course, so I took the brunt of it. He was jobless for a year and I was working full time. Our roles changed completely, which only added to the stress. It wasn’t a healthy situation but I discovered I could also get support from the Legion. Until then I thought they were just fundraisers.“They advised me to adapt my thought process towards him. I talked to them on a number of occasions and they were always a huge help. We had hit a wall in our marriage and their support was crucial to us getting through it.”“My issues had begun to affect our relationship and we were struggling,” agrees Mike. “The Legion were there to support us. We were both able to talk to people about what was going on. I was able to get anything from a sympathetic ear to practical financial guidance and help finding a job. Linda got advice about how to manage me because I was depressed and angry.”Slowly, with support from the Legion, the couple have rebuilt their lives. Mike now works as a civilian instructor teaching fibre optics to military personnel and Linda has a job in retail. Mike is still on medication and has good days and bad, but knows he can always pick up the phone and talk to someone.In 2017 the couple ran the London Marathon to raise funds for the organisation. “It was a way of saying thank you and having a common goal also helped reconnect us,” says Mike. “I think it’s safe to say we’d probably be orced without them and if that had happened I don’t know what would have happened to me. It would have been the final straw.”To find out more about The Royal British Legion click here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fd9b0086b181548bd323ca738abff8b831cd9a3b/0_210_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a0aa9bb2d8930295ed85386d22b40d55","title":"how one marine lost his dream job but found meaning helping other veterans","story":"When a freak injury ended marine Nick Fleming’s chances of ever seeing active deployment, he left the services unsure of what to do next. But it wasn’t long before The Royal British Legion answered that question for himNick Fleming had always wanted to be a marine. After joining the service in February 2014, and enduring eight months of gruelling training, he was devastated when his career came to end because of a knee injury. The fact that it happened while on a rugby league pitch, rather than during deployment, added insult to injury. “It was my dream job,” he says. “To have it taken out from under my feet before it even got started was a pretty tough one to take.”The 28-year-old had been posted to Plymouth as part of the Royal Marines’ 42 Commando unit and would spend two years in rehabilitation, undergoing a number of operations to try and repair the damage. Eventually, under his surgeon’s advice, he had to admit defeat and accept that he wouldn’t be able to continue as a Royal Marine . He was medically discharged in October 2017 – only three and a half years after he’d joined the service. “One of the top knee surgeons in the south west said it was time to rethink my career. I potentially could have stayed on as a clerk or in the store, but it’s not really what I joined up to do. So it was decided I’d leave.” For service men and women who leave the forces, adjusting to civilian life can be a challenge. Fleming admits he didn’t really know what he wanted to do after he left the marines. “I had no clear direction,” he says, but decided to move to London to be with his girlfriend. He had come across The Royal British Legion while in rehabilitation, attending the charity’s Battle Back Centre in Lilleshall, which supports sick and injured armed forces personnel. While there, he took part in indoor climbing and golf sessions, and completed a wheelchair basketball coaching qualification. In London, he saw a job advert for an advice and information officer at the Legion’s Pop-In Centre and applied. He now helps others make the same transition as he did, and offers welfare support to the armed forces community as needed. Working in an office has been a real culture change, but he admits he’s found the work really rewarding. “We were able to talk to him, find him accommodation, get him a deposit and kit out the property. We gave him a fresh start and took that worry off him, so he could start getting his life back together.”Many of the charity’s beneficiaries are dealing with mental health issues, often related to their time in the services. Fleming has completed a mental health first aid course with the Legion to help those who come through the centre’s doors. The other common issue is accommodation – particularly in London. Some of the men and women leaving the service won’t have a plan in place for where they’re going to live afterwards and will panic about leaving it to the last minute. The Legion can help with finding somewhere suitable, offering grants for deposits or furnishings, or with filling out benefit forms. Fleming can also signpost beneficiaries to other services, such as counselling and physiotherapy. For him, the most challenging part of his work is learning to deal with the stress and responsibility of other people’s problems. Golf, which he was introduced to at the Battle Back Centre while in rehabilitation, has become an important coping mechanism.“Not only am I coming to terms with losing my career and moving to London, trying to find somewhere to live, all of that stuff, but you’re also picking up other people’s issues, which are constantly going through your mind,” he says. “Golf sounds really boring but if I need to unwind, that’s what I’ll go and do.”To find out more about The Royal British Legion click here "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1d6f123b3b1ae93de89b0db38f52d903a5a80ee6/0_216_4045_2427/master/4045.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ea191edd869f0360c9f7481e4b1a3fd2","title":"pro brexit labour mps expose partys divisions over eea membership","story":"MPs dispute benefits of staying in European economic area before vote in CommonsLabour’s isions over Brexit have been exposed afresh, as MPs from leave constituencies hit back against the idea that membership of the European economic area (EEA) is the best outcome for Britain.Keir Starmer addressed a backbenchers’ meeting on Monday night, followed by what MPs described as a forceful display of unity from backbenchers and shadow ministers in support of the party’s official position. Jeremy Corbyn is expected to whip his MPs to abstain when a House of Lords amendment to the EU withdrawal bill, aimed at keeping open the option of EEA membership, is voted on in the House of Commons on Wednesday.Members of the EEA, which include Norway and Liechtenstein, accept the constraints of the single market – including EU regulations and free movement – without having a seat at the table in Brussels or Strasbourg.A vocal group of rebel backbenchers, including Chuka Umunna and Stephen Kinnock, have been urging colleagues to support the amendment, believing it is the best off-the-shelf alternative to full EU membership.But some colleagues from pro-Brexit constituencies reject EEA membership, because they fear it could signal to voters that Labour hopes to overturn the referendum result.Gloria De Piero, the MP for Ashfield in Nottinghamshire, said: “We just want to make sure our voices are heard. In seats like mine, because colleagues who have sincerely held views are very vocal, about their desire not to leave the single market, my constituents often think that we are a remain party.“My constituents aren’t against all immigration, which is how they are sometimes portrayed – they want control of immigration.”Gareth Snell, who defeated then Ukip leader Paul Nuttall in Stoke-on-Trent Central, used a post for the blog Labour List, to send a similar message.“Most Labour MPs are in seats that voted leave. My constituents could rightly ask whether we have really left the EU if we are still subject to all the rules, regulations and obligations that come from membership,” he wrote. “What message are we, as a Labour party, sending to voters in these seats if we simply turn away from the spirit of the referendum result? What hope can we have to win back those traditional seats we need to win in order to form the next government if we tell the voters in those communities that we know better than they do?”The MP for Warley, John Spellar, said he was still considering how to vote on the EEA amendment. “It involves free movement – that’s the crucial issue,” he said. “The views of the public were very clear: even among many of those who voted remain, they had major concerns about it.”A Labour frontbencher, Laura Smith, is said to have told friends that she is considering resigning her role as shadow cabinet office minister in order to vote against the EEA amendment, rather than follow the party whip to abstain. Smith, who was elected in 2017, has a majority of just 46 in her Crewe and Nantwich seat, a pro-leave area.Starmer addressed a group of pro-EEA rebels on Monday, in a last-ditch attempt to convince them not to back the amendment.But one MP who attended Monday’s meeting said Starmer was “left in no doubt about the strength of feeling” another said the two sides were “talking past each other”. Some who once chided Corbyn as a hard-left ideologue now complain that the party’s current position is determined by “triangulation”.At the parliamentary Labour party meeting on Monday night, MPs spoke forcefully in favour of a display of unity. Starmer told MPs it appeared some Conservative rebels were wavering on crucial votes and Labour had to deploy all its efforts into trying to keep them on board on two crucial amendments – on the customs union and a vote on the exit deal.Many MPs who stood up to speak backed the shadow Brexit secretary, including Caroline Flint and Lloyd Russell-Moyle. “We’re undergoing an episode of almost painful tribal loyalty,” one quipped on the way out of the room.Others were less than convinced. “It was an utterly banal argument from Keir tonight that somehow we should carry on not saying what we want so that everyone can find a home in Labour – to the point of not standing for anything at all,” one pro-EEA backbencher said.The EEA amendment was the only one of the 15 made by peers as the government’s flagship Brexit bill passed through the House of Lords, that is not supported by the Labour frontbench.Last week Starmer tabled his own, alternative version of the amendment, which would strike out the phrase EEA, and replace it with a pledge to retain “full access” to the “internal market” of the EU, based on “shared institutions”. But he made clear Labour would not be able to sign up to unfettered freedom of movement.The new wording was regarded as another step towards a softening of Labour’s Brexit position, but the EEA rebels believe it was what one called a “unicorn”, which the EU27 would never sign up to. “There’s nothing wrong with it in theory – it just doesn’t exist,” one rebel said.Starmer rejected the idea he was turning down the opportunity to defeat the government over the issue last week, saying Labour was too ided to back the EEA amendment even if the leadership whipped in favour of it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9c47e03769c171834441b4e435f6cd3ff0a6d66b/303_58_2412_1448/master/2412.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=47b251c6cdc8a682febb03aef5dfc9a4","title":"uk government very seriously examining arron banks russian links","story":"Ministers trying to establish if democracy was undermined during Brexit campaignHome secretary Sajid Javid has said that Arron Banks’s Russian connections are being examined “very seriously” by two ministers in two departments who want to establish if there was an attempt to undermine parliamentary democracy during the Brexit campaign. Javid’s unexpected intervention came on the eve of what is expected to be a stormy select committee meeting in which the Brexit-backing tycoon and his colleague Andy Wigmore are expected to be questioned by MPs over their links to Russian officials and business leaders. Javid was asked in the Commons by the Labour MP Stephen Doughty if he would comment further on reports that Banks had met Russia’s ambassador to the UK three times in 2015 and 2016, and had been asked by him if he was interested in participating in a Siberian gold mining deal. The home secretary said his department was liaising with the Cabinet Office and both were “taking this issue seriously, I know they are looking at intelligence and other information they are receiving alongside my department. The two departments are working closely on this issue. I would assure him we are taking it very seriously indeed.” Doughty, after the debate, described Javid’s answer as revelatory. The Labour MP had asked if Javid could “say a little bit about the allegations that we have heard over the weekend in the Observer, Sunday Times and elsewhere about other Russian attempts to undermine parliamentary democracy and our democracy in this country?” MPs on the digital, culture, media and sport select committee are gearing up to ask Banks and his associate Wigmore about the extent of their dealings with the Russian ambassador, and whether Banks took part in the consolidation of a company called GeoProMining as proposed by ambassador Alexander Yakovenko in a meeting scheduled to last at least three hours. A cache of emails leaked first to the Observer and subsequently to the Sunday Times revealed that Banks had three meetings with the Russian ambassador and met other officials in 2015 and 2016, rather than the single “six hour boozy lunch” he had previously acknowledged. The leak came from research conducted by journalist Isabel Oakeshott who is working on a book about the future of Britain’s armed forces with Conservative donor Lord Ashcroft, and was sent via crowdsourced website Byline Media to the Observer. It is understood that Banks hopes to take a combative approach at the select committee meeting, telling people that he has conducted “opposition research” on some of the MPs involved, highlighting for example the fact that, as declared by the committee’s chair Damian Collins in the register of members’ interests, Collins had accepted two tickets worth £1,060 to watch Roman Abramovich’s Chelsea play Crystal Palace in March.The Brexit campaigner also tried to embark on a public relations offensive ahead of the meeting, although he pulled out at the last minute from a pre-recorded interview on the BBC’s Newsnight.Instead he chose to be interviewed on LBC radio by Nigel Farage, where the former Ukip leader turned radio host did ask Banks about the Siberian gold deal and whether it amounted to an attempt by him to “use the Brexit campaign to further his business interests”. Banks, who denies participating in the proposed deal, said in reply “not really”.A statement released in 2016 – at the time when the mining company deal was completed – said a key investor in GeoProMining is Kirill Androsov, a former deputy chief of staff to Vladimir Putin, via his Altera Fund.Banks and Wigmore also told LBC that they would provide to the select committee details of all the meetings they had with CIA and other US officials in the UK to demonstrate they had been talking to a wide range of interested parties ahead of the Brexit referendum.During the radio interview, Farage asked Banks and Wigmore: “Was there, at any point, Russian – or Russian iniduals, or Russian businesses that gave money to Leave.EU?” In reply, Wigmore said: “No. Not one penny or rouble”, while Banks said: “Where is the evidence that we took Russian money? There’s no evidence.”Labour’s front bench weighed in on the controversy for the first time on Sunday. Tom Watson said: “I thought the idea of Kremlin gold being used to destabilise our democracy became redundant at the end of the cold war. Try as he might, Mr Banks can’t just bluster his way out of these serious allegations. Democratic integrity is too important. If it’s true that his account of events is inaccurate, his links to Russian financiers and mine owners must be subject to detailed scrutiny.” Banks was the key financial backer of Farage’s Brexit strategy, providing at least £9m in loans and other donations to the Leave.EU and Grassroots Out campaigns, the small unofficial campaigns that were closely aligned with Ukip. After the unexpected vote for Brexit, Banks has faced questions about the origin of his money with the Electoral Commission conducting an ongoing investigation into the “true source” of his donations to Leave.EU."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/80c183900462990d7007c233b5cafbb9da3627c5/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4547f990c022f842ec82cf5ccc2f0674","title":"brexit jacob rees mogg hosts lbc phone in politics live","story":"Rolling coverage of the day’s political developments as they happenArron Banks, the financial backer of the unofficial Brexit campaign, says there was possibly collusion between Russia and the Trump or Brexit campaigns “at a low level”.

Wigmore says the Russian government was simply unprepared for Trump’s victory.Following the LBC interview, the home secretary, Sajid Javid, says Banks’s Russian connections are being examined “very seriously” by ministers. They want to establish if there was an attempt to undermine parliamentary democracy during the Brexit campaign, he said. You can read the full story here:The prime minister has been meeting the influential Tory backbench 1922 Committee, along with ministers – including the Treasurer, Philip Hammond, and the Brexit secretary, David Davis.She warned Conservative MPs that defeats over the Brexit bill would undermine her negotiating position with Brussels. May told them:We must think about the message parliament will send to the European Union this week.I am trying to negotiate the best deal for Britain. I am confident I can get a deal that allows us to strike our own trade deals while having a border with the EU which is as frictionless as possible.But, if the Lords amendments are allowed to stand, that negotiating position will be undermined.Read the full story by Pippa Crerar, Heather Stewart and Lisa O’Carroll here:Earlier today, my colleague Jim Waterson put together a profile of Isabel Oakeshott, the journalist who has said she was aware of emails linking Arron Banks to Russian officials and businessmen at the end of last year – but did not publish the information until recently.Farage has concluded his interview with Banks and Wigmore. I’ll post a summary soon.In the meantime, Heather Stewart has been looking at the internal isions in the Labour party over its position on EEA membership. It’s worth a read:Farage asks Banks if there was collusion between Russia and the Trump or Brexit campaigns. Banks replies:I think it’s possible at a low level – when we talked about these bots and the things that the Russians were trying to do. But at a very, sort of, amateur level. I really think that the reason this is all coming out is because it’s a concerted remain campaign to smear anyone involved in the Brexit campaign.Banks tells Farage: “Where is the evidence that we took Russian money? There’s no evidence.”Asked if he is in for a “tough time of it”, Banks says it is the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport committee that may find themselves in difficulty. He says the chair, Damian Collins, “had to disclose a donation from Roman Abramovich ... Putin’s man in London”.He is referring to an entry placed on the register of members’ interests last Wednesday, in which Collins declared receipt of “two tickets, including hospitality, for Chelsea vs Crystal Palace with a total value of £1,060” from the Abramovich-owned Chelsea Football Club.Farage asks: Was there, at any point, Russian – or Russian iniduals, or Russian businesses that gave money to Leave.EU?Wigmore: “No. Not one penny or rouble.”Banks is asked about handing the Russians the telephone numbers of members of the Trump transition team, which he acknowledges.Wigmore, the communications director for the Leave.EU campaign, interjects to add “context”. He says the Trump transition team needed phone numbers for foreign governments and was given one he could hand out to them.He claims the Russians, like many governments, did not expect Trump to win and had not prepared for that eventuality. It was in that context, he says, that the phone number was handed over.Asked if he was “reporting back” to the Russian ambassador on the meeting the three men held with then president elect Trump, Banks says:Asked by Farage if he was using the Brexit campaign for his financial gain, Banks tells him:Not really. We went there to have this lunch with the Russian ambassador, we had it after Trump. He was interested in the election of Trump. When we’d had the original meeting, relating to Brexit, he was fascinated by the Brexit campaign. In fact, he thought it wasn’t going to happen.Farage is just getting underway with a monologue, saying Arron Banks and Andy Wigmore will appear before the Commons select committee tomorrow.He asks Banks about claims he met the Russian ambassador. Banks says he was approached at the Ukip conference in Doncaster and asked if he wanted lunch with the ambassador. “Of course,” he said, calling subsequent coverage a “witch hunt”.He says it would be a strange conspiracy if he had revealed it in his own book. He says the second meeting wasn’t mentioned in his book because it came after the end of the timeline.Banks says he had “two lunches and one cup of tea” with the ambassador.Hello, we resume our coverage this evening with the appearances of Arron Banks and Andy Wigmore on Nigel Farage’s LBC radio show.The trio were previously involved with the same pro-Brexit campaign group, Leave.EU.If I have heard one view I’ve heard 100 different views about what that law should look like. But there is one thing that’s absolutely certain - politicians at Westminster are not the people qualified to determine what the law looks like. It absolutely should be done in Stormont.That’s all from me for today.A colleague will be taking for developments this evening.Nigel Farage, the former Ukip leader, will be interviewing his Leave.EU pals Arron Banks and Andy Wigmore on his LBC phone-in this evening, he has announced on Twitter.The government may be tabling a new amendment to the EU withdrawal bill in the hope of appeasing potential rebels, the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg reports.We have some new ICM polling out today.

Dr Charlene Wong, co-author of the research from Duke University in North Carolina, said the research could help to direct public health interventions, noting that the study suggests the focus should be on females, young adults and those from minority and low-income backgrounds.“Our black female young adults were the least likely to say they did any physical activity and those who did were active for the shortest amount of time,” she said. Writing in the journal Jama Pediatrics, Wong and colleagues describe how they pooled and analysed data from an annual nationwide health survey in the US, encompassing the years 2007 to 2016, focusing on responses from 9,472 iniduals aged between 12 and 29.The survey, carried out through interviews, asked participants questions about their levels of physical activity relating to sports or recreational pursuits.For those who did get their blood pumping, the amount of time spent exercising also fell with age, from just over 71 minutes a day for adolescent boys to just over 50 minutes for those aged 25 to 29. For girls, it fell from 56 minutes to just over 39 minutes a day respectively.White adolescent boys were the most likely to say they exercised in a week, with black males aged 18-24 reporting the longest duration of physical activity a day.Once factors including weight, education and income were taken into account, the team found race was linked to whether females reported any physical activity: in general, a larger proportion of white females said they exercised than black or Hiic participants. The trend was less clear for males.Higher income was linked to reporting physical activity for females regardless of age, but the same only held true for adolescent boys and not young men, while young adults with a college education were more likely to report any exercise across both sexes. Weight had little impact on whether participants reported exercising.While it is not clear what is behind the trends, the authors say multiple factors might be at play including issues around body image, social norms for exercise being different between the sexes, less scheduled activity after leaving school and growing pressures of working life.But the study had limitations, including that activity such as walking to work was not included, it was not considered whether participants had children, or were pregnant, and the authors admit that self-reported data can lead to an over-estimation of activity. Dr Gavin Sandercock, an expert in child activity and fitness from the University of Essex who was not involved in the study, said the findings mirror certain trends seen in the UK, including that females exercise less than males and that physical activity drops across both sexes with age.While he noted there are already some campaigns aimed at encouraging girls and women to exercise, including This Girl Can, he said it was also important to help iniduals of both sexes from lower income groups to become physically active. “We know that if you get children more active, as well as getting more physically healthy, they get happier and their educational attainment improves,” he said.Joan Duda, professor of sport and exercise psychology at the University of Birmingham, said offering a choice of activities and cultivating a sense of empowerment is key: “We need to do more to promote participation in physical activity in the case of adolescent females, and males, not just taking it up or giving a particular activity ‘a go’ but also how to sustain quality engagement,” she said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e732c96e4afc6601fed91c7d2d0839d1ac155446/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=daeee7fd8990fa2e576ef9ce7785c620","title":"the hemp revival why marijuanas cousin could soon be big business","story":"The useful crop has seen renewed interest alongside legalized weed – and there are signs that US officials are warming to itLong associated with the hoariest hippie stereotypes, hemp is now chic.The crop – which is a cannabis plant very similar to marijuana, but lacking its best-known property: getting you high – is a versatile raw material, and like its more notorious relative, it could once again become very lucrative.The spread of marijuana legalization has sparked renewed interest not because of hemp wallet fanatics – but due largely to demand for CBD, a chemical both it and marijuana produce in which some see potential as a pharmaceutical and nutritional supplement. But the climate is changing. In recent weeks, the US Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, a conservative Republican who opposes marijuana legalization, has called for hemp to be legalized, a move which would benefit farmers, though McConnell still opposes marijuana legalization. And it’s not just the farmers in McConnell’s home state of Kentucky who would be pleased to see a resurgence of the crop. Early this month for hemp history week, the US Senate unanimously passed a non-binding resolution acknowledging hemp’s economic value and “historical relevance”.China, though wary of marijuana, has emerged as a hemp “superpower”, according to a fascinating 2017 story in the South China Morning Post. While hemp is indigenous to China, Chinese research advanced only recently in 1970 when the military used it for uniforms that would be more comfortable in the Vietnamese jungle. Today, the Morning Post notes, China holds more than half of the world’s more than 600 hemp-related patents. Hemp’s revival is only the latest chapter in a long history.In China, hemp has been used to make fabric and rope for more than 3,000 years. A Chinese eunuch named Cai Lun, who is credited with inventing paper during the early Christian era, used hemp as one of his source materials. Between the 16th and 18th centuries, hemp rope, sails and rigging were so vital to the British Royal Navy that the supply was considered a national security issue. Both Henry VIII and Elizabeth I encouraged growing the crop. In the US, some of the founding fathers grew hemp. Stoner lore has it that the constitution and declaration of independence were written on hemp. It’s not true – they were written on parchment – but drafts of the documents probably were. But interest in hemp waned as cotton, a finer fabric dependent on American slave labor, ascended. It was last a relevant crop in the US during the second world war, when the Department of Agriculture made a Hemp for Victory film and encouraged production. Today’s hemp advocates, a passionate cohort indeed, claim paper, cloth and biofuel made from hemp are all environmentally and economically attractive, relative to the prevailing current methods. If hemp became a major source for any one of these staples, it would be an immense opportunity, akin to legal marijuana.And there are more uses for hemp still. The seeds are a good source of protein, popular with vegans. Hemp can also be made into a building material known as hempcrete, which is currently easier to access in parts of Europe than in the US. A bridge in sixth-century Gaul was built from hempcrete. Bryan DeHaven’s Colorado-based clothing company, Chiefton Supply Co, makes T-shirts from a hempcotton blend. The component organic hemp is grown, processed into fabric and then stitched into apparel all at one facility in China’s Shangdong province.DeHaven said hemp’s benefits included that it needed substantially less water than cotton to grow. The resultant cloth, he said, also had anti-bacterial properties Chiefton is working with sportswear companies on breathable hemp clothing for athletes. “Those guys are really putting our garments to the test,” he said. Eventually, DeHaven said, he would like to see Chiefton hemp goods produced in the US “from seed to seam”. It will be difficult. Hemp is not completely illegal in the US but the current rules are wildly convoluted, probably even more so than those for marijuana. But the laws weren’t the main problem, DeHaven said. You can’t make hemp clothing in the US because the country no longer has sufficient expertise in textile production."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/804b33e0d20e2587f1bd0556eb33890c045f5258/0_172_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5340a1bb4be4ee954f8f1be8cd937abb","title":"chris froome lizzie deignan doping cases reputations","story":"Lizzie Deignan has claimed Chris Froome has been denied a fair process in his anti-doping case and criticised the testing authorities for not doing more to protect her reputation after three whereabouts failings.Deignan, known as Armitstead until she married Team Sky rider Philip Deignan in 2016, said Froome’s name had been unfairly tarnished.  and the French newspaper Le Monde made public the fact Froome had returned an adverse finding to a urine test submitted during his Vuelta a España victory last September.Froome is fighting the finding and has continued to compete, winning the Giro d’Italia and stating his intention to compete in the Tour de France next month. Other riders, both active and retired, have said he should remain on the sidelines until the case is resolved.“He hasn’t had a fair process because already people have made up their minds unfortunately, and that is not based on the full story,” Deignan said. “Unfortunately for Chris his reputation is tarnished and will be for ever. Whether he’s innocent or not, it’s kind of irrelevant to some people at this stage. A leak in a legal process should never happen.”Froome’s failed test indicated twice the permitted level of the asthma drug salbutamol in his system. The 33‑year‑old insisted he had not taken more than the allowed amount of the drug, which is a specified substance.“A rider should be protected because inevitably there will be things that happen, grey areas that should be looked at logically, scientifically, and analysed in court,” Deignan told the When Orla Met podcast. “That’s an inevitable part of having asthma and taking an inhaler and I think unfortunately he hasn’t had a fair process. It’s a very personal story.”Deignan escaped a ban in 2016 after three whereabouts failings in a 12-month period. The court of arbitration for sport accepted that in the first occurrence a doping control officer had not tried hard enough to locate the Olympic silver medallist when she was at a hotel for a training camp in Sweden.However, Deignan is still disappointed in the UK Anti-Doping Agency. “I felt really let down by UK Anti-Doping at the time that they didn’t publicly defend the fact I was tested within a day of both missed tests and obviously all my samples have proved negative. I’ve never doped.“All I needed was for them to say ‘We made a mistake, we’re an organisation that’s totally funded to do this job and we’ve made a mistake.’ They haven’t taken ownership or apologised or anything. You’re still working with a system that is not even good. I think there’s still a long way to go for them to be transparent themselves.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cf175fc0f4647b17048d97258231d74886f9cc5c/458_71_1820_1092/master/1820.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c83ed068f5499a63a17126ad1f9c8014","title":"schalk brits called out of retirement and the stands for south africa squad","story":"• Hooker Brits joins Springbok squad for second Test• Paul Gustard admits England defended badly in JohannesburgWith England having just slipped to a disappointing first Test loss and in danger of sliding further down the World Rugby rankings, the news that a snake handler was invited into camp to help boost squad morale following their 42-39 defeat felt more than a little ironic. The deadly mambas, cobras and tarantulas proved a useful distraction but finding an antidote to English deficiencies is less easy.With Wales hoping to move above their neighbours into fourth place in the rankings next week, the list of English concerns also now includes the Saracens hooker Schalk Brits who has interrupted his South African holiday to join the Springbok squad before the second Test in Bloemfontein. The 37-year-old Brits retired a fortnight ago but could yet be invited to make the most popular and unexpected of international comebacks.What a wonderful tale it would be if Brits, among the most successful all‑time Premiership imports, were to resume his Test career against his Saracens team-mates Jamie George, Maro Itoje, the Vunipola brothers and Owen Farrell. Brits, who won the last of his 10 Springbok caps at the 2015 Rugby World Cup, attended the first Test at Ellis Park as a fan but Rassie Erasmus believes he can help South Africa’s younger players as they attempt to clinch the best-of-three series.“We are busy building experience, continuity and capacity towards the Rugby World Cup, so we want our young players rubbing shoulders with experienced players such as Duane Vermeulen and Willie le Roux,” Erasmus said. “I want Schalk to perform a similar role because he has extensive inside knowledge and plenty of experience from playing for Saracens in English and European conditions. It’s a great way for our younger guys to learn the trade of international rugby from these guys.”England, in contrast, have had to fly in the young, uncapped Worcester hooker Jack Singleton as cover after Exeter’s Luke Cowan-Dickie hurt a hamstring at Ellis Park. Joe Launchbury’s sore calf is also still being monitored as all concerned look to regroup following the visitors’ spectacular defensive implosion from 24-3 ahead in Johannesburg.For England’s defence coach, Paul Gustard – on his last tour of duty before taking charge at Harlequins – these are particularly tricky days. His side conceded five tries at the weekend and a further nine against the Barbarians last month and the former Leicester and London Irish flanker acknowledges there is plenty of room for improvement.“We didn’t defend well,” Gustard said. “We were tight and our spacing was poor. We just didn’t deliver what we know we’re capable of. We made some poor decisions, we didn’t work hard enough and we lost composure. There’s a knock-on effect of things going against you which you can’t quantify sometimes: the mental drain, the energy drain that comes with losing momentum. We need to correct that.It remains Gustard’s firm belief, furthermore, that England can still wriggle off the hook and win the last two Tests: “Absolutely we can rescue the series. We didn’t have the start to the series we wanted but we are still in it we can still win the series 2-1 and everyone is a firm believer in that. The players want to achieve something historical and we genuinely believe we can do it.”Amid all the snakes and spiders – Dan Robson and Nick Isiekwe proved the most squeamish team members – which enlivened the squad barbecue on Sunday evening, Gustard also insists England have been perfectly correct to base themselves at sea level despite the first two Tests being played at altitude. “We’ve got our own sports scientists and we’ve got a guy who mentors the coaches who head up British Athletics. We took all that advice in and spoke to a lot of Super Rugby teams about what to do. We are very happy with our decision to stay in Durban.“The result at the weekend was not a reflection of the altitude, it was a reflection of our performance. We let them into the game and gave them too many opportunities, which is something we are looking forward to rectifying on Saturday.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bc66328bd36c9d8b145a893963b186e8f422d11e/0_202_4067_2440/master/4067.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1f43c101cc573441c0d99c1fc206073e","title":"monogamy review celebrity chef cooks up an apocalyptic stew","story":"Park theatre, LondonTorben Betts’s social satire about a beleaguered kitchen goddess builds to a bewildering climax of panic and violenceTorben Betts clearly sees cooking as a source of drama. In Muswell Hill (2012) he showed a disastrous dinner party from the perspective of the kitchen. His new play deals with the disintegration of a popular female TV chef but, while Betts is good on the gulf between public and private faces, a play that starts as social satire ends up improbably apocalyptic. We first see Betts’s heroine, Caroline, rehearsing her TV show in her kitchen, but troubles, as Hamlet says, come not single spies but in battalions. Just for starters, Caroline has to deal with tabloid photos exposing her dead drunk, the long-delayed coming out of her socialist son and the revelation of her affair with a married builder. Betts shrewdly reminds us that fame offers no insulation against misfortune, but, as Caroline’s life falls apart, so too does the play as it leads to a bewildering climax full of panic and violence. Having started with a specific target, Betts ends up tackling the explosion of the nuclear family and the decline and fall of the middle classes. Alastair Whatley’s production is, however, strongly cast. As Caroline, Janie Dee easily convinces us she could be “the country’s second favourite kitchen goddess” while conveying the desperation of a devout believer appalled at her failure to live up to her principles. Genevieve Gaunt is very funny as her language-distorting PA and there is strong support from Patrick Ryecart as Caroline’s apoplectic husband and Jack Sandle as her invaluable handyman. The problem is that Betts seems torn between writing a comedy about celebrity chefs and demonstrating that the family is an outdated cultural construct. • Monogamy is at Park theatre, London, until 7 July.

The letter came in August, 1975, inviting her to go and view flat number 13. “I thought it was\u0026nbspa palace compared to where I was coming from,” she recalls in the opening frames of Grenfell (BBC One), Ben Anthony’s profoundly moving feature-length documentary. Later, in the disorientating days after the fire that ripped through the tower in minutes, claiming the lives of 72 people, we meet Lorraine again. “My whole life was in that flat,” she says,\u0026nbspher face crumpling. “It’s a horror story. Everything’s gone.”Shahin Sadafi, fifth floor, said that Grenfell was “our base, fortress, a concrete castle”. “I was very proud to live there,” says Edward Daffarn, 16th floor, his mouth contorting with grief. “Stay put,” Nick Burton, 19th floor, recalls being told, like others higher up the tower. “It’s concrete. It’s not going anywhere.” He escaped with his\u0026nbspwife, Maria del Pilar Burton, but she\u0026nbspnever recovered,\u0026nbspand died seven months later. “When it comes\u0026nbspit hits you\u0026nbspreally hard,” says Nabil Choucair of\u0026nbspfinding out, after an agonising wait of weeks, that his\u0026nbspmother, sister,\u0026nbspbrother-in-law and their\u0026nbspthree daughters, who lived on the 22nd floor, all died. “Every\u0026nbsptime they told us\u0026nbspabout one it was like a knife going through you.”The articulacy, measure and resolve maintained by survivors is a deeply humbling aspect of this respectful documentary, which began filming the day after the fire\u0026nbspand continued throughout the year. What hits you most is the grief, still so fresh, still so engulfing. Everyone breaks down and cries, from Yasmeen, Choucair’s 11-year-old daughter, showing drawings she has done of the tower in flames, to Zeyad Cred, who organises monthly silent walks around the tower, remembering how the first one, “in the midst of all that\u0026nbspdespair … neutralised everyone”.Grenfell, stitched together from hundreds of hours of interviews and filming, as well as archive and social\u0026nbspmedia footage, airs at a highly sensitive time, amid\u0026nbspthe public inquiry and approaching the first anniversary. Everyone is talking about Grenfell again: the response from the council and central government, allegations of institutional racism, the cladding and the fire brigade’s stay put policy. And everyone has their take\u0026nbspon who was most at fault, though\u0026nbspno perspective can\u0026nbspbe truly objective or orced\u0026nbspfrom personal bias. What is so vital about Anthony’s take\u0026nbspis its resolute focus\u0026nbspon the erse working-class\u0026nbsppeople to whom\u0026nbspthis tragedy continues to happen. The voices that\u0026nbsproutinely get drowned out, ignored and\u0026nbspdisrespected, which many say is why the fire\u0026nbspstarted\u0026nbspin the first place.Residents recall lifts regularly out of order, rotting kitchens, and surges of power that made toasters smoke and sparks come out of light fittings in the months leading up to the fire. What emerges is a community deeply wounded by the fire and its aftermath, but also by the cumulative\u0026nbspdespair of being overlooked for so long. If there is a\u0026nbspprevailing message here it is about\u0026nbspthe contempt with which successive governments treat people\u0026nbspin social housing.Local people from mosques and synagogues, churches and rugby clubs recall stepping up in the aftermath. All report the absence of\u0026nbspauthorities. Some volunteers were\u0026nbspthemselves survivors. Hassan Awadh Hassan, 23rd\u0026nbspfloor, was away from his wife and two daughters visiting his sick brother\u0026nbspin Egypt on the night of the fire. “I see the news.\u0026nbspI\u0026nbsptake my passport and go to the airport straight away,” he says. “I go to duty-free to buy\u0026nbspchocolate for my two daughters.” He breaks down in\u0026nbsptears.

Oliver then summarized tactics used by Trump’s supporters to delegitimize the investigation, like redefining the terms of the inquiry itself. “It is important to remember Mueller wasn’t tasked with finding proof of collusion. In actuality he was tasked with looking into links and coordination between the Russian government and anyone associated with the Trump campaign, as well as any matter that arose or may arise directly from the investigation,” said Oliver. “That’s a pretty broad mandate. So saying the investigation has to shut down if there’s no collusion is like saying a game of Scrabble has to end because you fit all the letters in your mouth. “There’s also whataboutism,” Oliver added, “the practice of shifting the debate to someone else’s wrongdoing.”Oliver proceeded to share a clip from Sean Hannity’s show, in which the Fox News host wondered why people like Christopher Steele, the Clintons, Jim Comey and Susan Rice weren’t being prosecuted instead of Trump.“That is a lot of name to throw up on the screen and just say, what about them?” Oliver quipped. “Hannity’s point is that other people did bad things so therefore Trump’s bad things don’t count. Let me be clear on this: whether or not someone else did something shitty has no bearing over whether you did something shitty. If that were true, every movie that got a bad review could simply say, what about From Justin to Kelly?”Finally, Oliver explained how successfully the right has established its own counter-narrative to the special counsel’s inquiry “by framing it as part of a grand conspiracy to bring down Trump”.“Night after night, Hannity paints a picture where the investigation itself is one gigantic scandal, with the Democrats, the FBI, the Deep State and the establishment Republicans teaming up to bring down Trump,” the host added, noting that Hannity is fond of saying that “Spygate” makes “Watergate look like stealing a Snickers bar”.“None of this even addresses the most obvious question,” Oliver said. “If absolutely everyone from Hillary to the FBI to Trey Gowdy was in on a Deep State plan to sabotage Trump, how the fuck is he president right now?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0bfb3500adf59d247345c3e11d39ff9193dbbe51/0_154_3296_1979/master/3296.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eaa4b318325fd8665a789559c260ce6a","title":"paraguay declared free of malaria by who","story":"Celebrating first country in Americas to eliminate disease since Cuba, WHO head says: ‘Success story shows what is possible’Paraguay is officially free of malaria, the World Health Organization (WHO) said on Monday, making it the first country in the Americas in 45 years to have wiped out the deadly disease which is back on the rise globally.With no recorded cases of malaria in five years, Paraguay became the first country in the region to have eliminated malaria since Cuba in 1973, the WHO said. It was the first country to be declared malaria-free since Sri Lanka in 2016. “It gives me great pleasure today to certify that Paraguay is officially free of malaria,” Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, head of the WHO, said in a statement. “Success stories like Paraguay’s show what is possible. If malaria can be eliminated in one country, it can be eliminated in all countries.”While significant progress has been made over the past 20 years in reducing malaria cases and deaths, in 2016, for the first time in a decade, the number of malaria cases rose and in some areas there was a resurgence, the WHO said.Health experts say a growing resistance to the sprays and drugs used to attack the mosquito that transmits the disease and the parasite that causes it was partly to blame. They also say it was partly due to stagnant global funding for malaria since 2010. Climate change and conflict can also exacerbate malaria outbreaks. “This is a powerful reminder for the region of what can be achieved when countries are focused on an important goal,” said Carissa Etienne, director of the Pan American Health Organization, the WHO’s regional office. “We are hopeful that other countries will soon join Paraguay in eliminating malaria,” she said in a statement. In 2016 the WHO identified Paraguay as one of 21 countries with the potential to eliminate malaria by 2020. The WHO said Algeria, Argentina and Uzbekistan are on track to be declared free from malaria later this year.

Photograph: iStockA puzzler about distance and time was one of the few difficulties facing students on a fairly straightforward higher level science paper, teachers have said.“The theme of pollution was notable on the course,” said John Conneely, ASTI subject representative and a teacher at St Flannan’s College in Ennis, Co Clare.“These appeared on different parts of the course and included questions on acid rain, plastics pollution and noise pollution. Students will have been happy to see two gases appear in the chemistry section of the paper.”Luke Saunders, Studyclix.ie founder and a science teacher at JMSS in Enniscrone, Co Sligo, said that the paper didn’t break any conventions over the last decade.“The biology sector would have been welcomed for having a relatively small proportion of plant biology questions, an area disliked by many. The chemistry section would have rewarded students who had a good understanding of the experimental work on the course. But some students may have been confused by the wording ‘physical quantities’ in question 7D that showed an image of a copper coil.”Jennifer Cuffe, a student at JMSS, said that the biology and physics questions went well but she found the chemistry section difficult.Mr Saunders said that the ordinary level paper offered a lot of photos and diagrams, which students would have welcomed, and the biology section had a lot of favoured biology and ecology questions. However, he was surprised to see cobalt chloride listed as one of the three substances used to test for the presence of water, given it was banned from school science labs in 2011 because it is a dangerous chemical.Next year’s junior cycle students will sit the first exam of the new syllabus, which places an emphasis on the scientific method. In an era rife with ill-informed scaremongering on vaccines, conspiracy theories about chemtrails and belief in quackery over proven medicine, the new science course will also focus on how students can critically examine sources of information.“This is welcome but we would also hope that there is still enough room for learning off knowledge and facts,” said Mr Conneely.Try this at home: Junior Cert science, higher levelA student set up an experiment to show that there is water vapour in air.(i) Name a chemical that can be used to test for water.(ii) What colour is this chemical before water is added?"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3526653.1528724428!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"leaving cert maths paper 2 nasty surprise on higher paper","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThis year’s higher-level maths paper was said to be demanding. File photograph: iStock The second of this year’s higher-level maths papers was very demanding, with some especially tough parts and a nasty surprise, according to teachers.“It was easily the trickier of the two exams,” said Eamonn Toland, founder of TheMathsTutor.ie.“The concepts and skills section had some deceptively tricky questions. For example, the question on the empirical rule had a twist that might have stumped some students, although it could be solved without using the empirical rule.”Mr Toland added: “The two geometry questions were fairly doable but the statistics question was quite difficult. “The students had to be very good at interpreting abstract mathematical results and some of the parts were quite different from previous statistics questions. This is a part of the course that many students find difficult so parts of this question might have stumped quite a few of them.”Luke Saunders, Studyclix.ie founder and a maths teacher at Jesus and Mary Secondary School in Enniscrone, Co Sligo, said that students sitting higher-level maths paper two would have found section A relatively straightforward but that there was a sting in the tail in section B. “Question 8 combined questions on statistics with probability and may have thrown some weaker students,” he said.Mr Saunders was surprised to see a question on sequences and series appear on the paper given that they had been a particularly dominant topic on paper one. Aidan Roantree, senior maths teacher at the Institute of Education in Dublin, said it was a very demanding paper and that to move beyond a H4 or H5, students would have required a very good understanding of the material. “The headline surprise is the inclusion of a question on financial maths on paper two, which normally appears exclusively on paper one,” he said.“The most difficult of the geometry proofs was asked and the B part of question 8 was a completely new in-depth analysis of the margin of error approximation, which was very tough.” However, he said the questions on geometry and trigonometry were generally “very fair”.With regards to the ordinary-level paper, Mr Toland said that section A was easy but section B contained some tricky statistics. The number of atoms in a solid gold sphere was among the topics featured. “The concepts and skills question was fairly straightforward and many of the parts were extremely easy,” he said. “For example, to complete a table that shows the possible values for the sum of two dice the student only needs to be able to add two numbers together. The concepts and applications section had quite a lot of statistics, which is normally a topic reserved for higher level. “Even though the question is fairly straightforward, many students at ordinary-level may not be familiar with the phrase ‘confidence interval’.”Mr Saunders said that students who were comfortable with applying trigonometry and geometry skills would have been happy with today’s paper and that it was typical of what is expected from Project Maths.Q8(c) Acme Confectionary has an employee pension plan.

Photograph: Dara Mac DonaillThe British government is “riven by internal dissent” and lacks credibility on the UK’s withdrawal from the European Union, former taoiseach Enda Kenny has said.Mr Kenny, in his first major public intervention since standing down as taoiseach a year ago, said he was “appalled” at what was happening in British politics.Mr Kenny’s remarks undermine criticism of Taoiseach Leo Varadkar by pro-Brexit British Conservatives who have claimed that Brexit negotiations would be more productive if a more experienced politician like the former taoiseach was involved.His views emerged as Mr Varadkar raised the possibility of postponing the formal date of Brexit in March 2019 if the EU and UK are unable to agree a deal before then.“There are a number of different scenarios that could arise if we’re in a ‘no deal’ situation,” Mr Varadkar told TV3.Speaking at an event in Dublin, Mr Kenny said there had been little progress since last December, when the UK and EU initially agreed to a number of issues, such as the so-called “backstop”, he added.“The EU continues to negotiate from a unified position. British business is afraid to speak out because of the spectre of a Labour government.”He added: “If this matter is not dealt with, and if negotiations have not been concluded and signed off before the EU council in October, then we might have a very different outcome.”Mr Kenny was speaking at a lunch hosted by the European Movement Ireland, which named him European of the Year. He was presented with the award by Mr Varadkar, who paid warm tribute to his predecessor.Mr Kenny called on European Council president Donald Tusk to convene a special summit later this year to sign off on the final Brexit withdrawal treaty.The Government has conceded that a deal on the so-called “backstop” - which guarantees no hard Border between North and South, even in a no-deal Brexit scenario - will not be completed until the withdrawal agreement is finalised in October.Mr Kenny said the October summit would not be a negotiating meeting, adding that Britain was not represented at the European Council when Brexit was discussed.“So if the negotiations have not been concluded before that meeting, then the European Council of 27 will meet to discuss among themselves, without Britain, and it will not be in a position to make a difference,” he said.“This is so serious, I believe, that the president of the council, should consider either having a meeting before that meeting in October or afterwards, specifically and solely to deal with signing off and hopefully concluding negotiations on the relationship between the United Kingdom and the European Union. I say that in the context of maintaining relationships that we have with our friends across the water.”Mr Kenny also criticised the US administration led by President Trump, among other international governments, for populism and “aggressive nationalism”.“But there are still enough who know and celebrate the difference between patriotism and nationalism. How patriotism burns quietly, furiously in the human heart, how aggressive nationalism sets fire to decency, responsibility, memory, even humanity itself.”He also spoke of the a “quantum change in geo-politics and economics” with an “emerging Russia and China” and “an America that is frequently unrecognisable”.On the North, Mr Kenny said the EU’s declaration that Northern Ireland would be automatically readmitted to the union in the event of Irish unity proved again that the “ballot overruled” the bullet.Mr Kenny secured such an agreement from the EU last year, and it had become known as the “Kenny text”.It says: “The European Council acknowledges that the Good Friday Agreement expressly provides for an agreed mechanism whereby a united Ireland may be brought about through peaceful and democratic means.“In this regard, the European Council acknowledges that, in accordance with international law, the entire territory of such a united Ireland would thus be part of the European Union.”Speaking on Monday, Mr Kenny said it would provide an opportunity for Northern Ireland in the future.“That opportunity, while it is not for now, is there for all to judge at some future time. It puts paid, for once and for all, to the warped mentality held by the Provisional IRA that it was possible to bomb the six counties into a united Ireland.

It is a simple process,” said Mr O’Carroll.The controversy came to light after terminally ill Limerick woman Vicky Phelan settled a High Court action last month after her cancer was missed in a smear test three years before she was diagnosed.The missed smear test was discovered in 2014, after her diagnosis, but she was not told until 2017.A follow-up HSE investigation found that 209 women who were diagnosed with cervical cancer were not told about subsequent audits showing past smear tests could have provided a different outcome.Asked about the delay in releasing records yesterday, Mr Varadkar said he could not comment on inidual cases but said: “There shouldn’t be any delay in providing patients with their medical records.”He added: “I do appreciate that it is not as simple as taking a book out of a library. Medical records are not often held in one place. They are in different places.”Records can include lab specimens, and samples and records also need to be reviewed first, because there can be private information in medical records belonging to others, he said.“Notwithstanding those constraints and those realities, there should be no delay in making medical records and specimens available to people, and that should be done as quickly as possible,” he said.Mr Varadkar said the State Claims Agency, which handles legal actions against the HSE, will invite people to attend mediation so the women avoid stressful trials. He said many invitations had been issued.“In some cases there hasn’t been a reply,” he said.A spokesman for the agency declined to provide an update on the CervicalCheck-related claims facing the State ahead of its officials appearing before the Public Accounts Committee on Thursday.The HSE has acknowledged delays in responding to solicitors’ correspondence due to the volume of requests but that it was trying to meet its obligations."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3526584.1528718548!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"the exceptional weather is coming to an end met %C3%A9ireann","story":"\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                                                            People play a game of cards at the beach on Bull Island on a sunny day near Dublin this weekend.

Photograph: Gareth Chaney CollinsIt has been as glorious a start to the summer as most of us can remember and the good weather is set to continue for the next few days at least.However, Met Éireann is warning the “exceptional weather” will come to an end later this week.Dublin recorded one of its sunniest weeks on record last week with some 80 hours of sunshine, the equivalent of more than 11 hours a day.Monday will be mild and dry in most places with a respectable 21 degrees in the midlands and east. This is cooler than of late and the sunshine will be more hazy, but still above normal for the time of year.Tuesday will be a similar kind of day and both days will be dry across the country.A notable change is due on Wednesday. The bad news is that rain is forecast across the country for the first time in weeks: the good news is that this will be most welcome by farmers and Irish Water.The rain will appear off the west coast on Wednesday afternoon and gradually extend across the country reaching eastern areas by nighttime.Near drought-like conditions have been experienced across the country for the past three weeks. Dublin has had just 1mm of rain since June 1st and May was exceptionally dry with just a third of the average rainfall recorded for the month.Most places had just trace amounts of rainfall in recent weeks. Even those places that had more normal levels of rainfall in the north and midlands only did so because of heavy thunderstorms last week.There has been several gorse fires over the last few weeks in the Dublin and Wicklow mountains and the dry conditions have caused water shortages in the Skerries area of Dublin.The Department of Agriculture has issued an orange “high risk” forest fire warning that remains in place until Wednesday, June 13th.They have asked public if they see a fire to not delay in reporting a fire to the fire and emergency services.But rain is on the way.“The exceptional weather is coming to an end but we’re not going down the tubes either,” Met Éireann forecaster John Eagleton said.He explained the change in wind direction from south to west will mean a transition to cooler, more showery weather. Nevertheless, the temperatures will still be in the high teens and rainfall amounts will not be above normal.“We’re not going to get lashings of it,” he explained. “It won’t be as sunny as it was, but it will still be very pleasant.”Thursday and Friday will be mostly dry days with temperatures of 16 to 18 degrees - cooler because of the change in wind direction.Mr Eagleton said rainfall amounts over the next 10 days will range from 15mm in the east and midlands to 60mm in the north-west.Some rain is forecast next weekend as there will be more unsettled conditions and southwesterly winds. Monday next week looks like bringing a lot of rain across the country."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3527111.1528747025!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"eu commissioner says tide is going out on brexit hardliners","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tEU comissioner Phil Hogan (pictured in Brussels on June 1st) said ‘there is still a real danger is that it will be the Rees-Mogg mutineers who will triumph’. Photograph: ReutersYves HermanEuropean Union commissioner Phil Hogan has said the “tide is going out on the high priests of Brexit” as he raised the prospect of second referendum on whether the UK should exit the EU.Mr Hogan said British public opinion was turning against Brexit and the British public was starting to see through the “deception and lies” of pro-Brexit politicians.Mr Hogan cited polls showing the Remain side were ahead compared to last year.“There is also the unmistakable sense that the mood is changing in the UK. Public opinion is starting to move, and all recent polling shows the ‘Remain’ side firmly ahead. This is an important change, because well into 2017, the polls showed a majority still in favour of Brexit,” he said. Speaking at a conference on Brexit organised by the Irish Road Haulage Association at Rosslare Port on Monday, Mr Hogan hit out at pro-Brexit politicians Michael Gove and Nigel Farage for misleading the British public. In April, Mr Hogan criticised British prime minister Theresa May’s plan for a “global Britain”, warning there were “stubborn facts that over-shadow a rosy picture”. “The tide is finally starting to go out on the high priests of Brexit, and not before time. Arch-Brexiteers like Nigel Farage and Michael Gove are disowning their pre-referendum promises of a land of milk and honey, and a sense of panic is setting in among them that the British public is finally seeing through their deception and lies,” he said.Mr Hogan, who is the EU’s agriculture chief, said the British government lacked a concrete plan and its cabinet was failing to even agree with itself on a “workable solution” to issues like customs.“The latest episodes of the Brexit reality show have shown us prime minister May battling with the mutineers, and the mutineers battling with each other. This means that, less than two weeks out from a key meeting of EU leaders which is supposed to settle this very question, we are no closer to the UK converging around a real, workable solution,” he said.“One group prefers a cyber border. Another group prefers new-look documentation and inspection procedures. Both groups seem to agree on only one thing - that neither of the two approaches will work,” he said. He said calls were growing for some form of “people’s referendum” on the final Brexit deal, if there was one. “Mrs May’s dilemma is that she has to disappoint one group or the other within her own party. She is trying to find a middle way - agreements on border management and future trade that will be acceptable to all. There are no signs that such a middle way exists,” he said. “She will have to choose. And there is still a real danger is that it will be the Rees-Mogg mutineers who will triumph,” he said, Mr Hogan said British business was “raising its voice in exasperation at the government’s lack of a plan.”“Throughout the UK, including in Northern Ireland, businesses are making contingency plans for a no-deal Brexit, openly speaking about the damage that will be done to jobs and growth,” he said.

Photograph: Daniel Leal-OlivasAFPGetty ImagesTheresa May has appealed to Conservative MPs for support ahead of two days of crucial votes on the EU Withdrawal Bill, warning that a defeat for the government would undermine her negotiating position over Brexit. She told the 1922 Committee of Conservative backbenchers on Monday night to think of the message sent to Brussels if amendments to the Bill approved by the House of Lords are not defeated in the Commons this week.“I am trying to negotiate the best deal for Britain. I am confident I can get a deal that allows us to strike our own trade deals while having a border with the EU which is as frictionless as possible. But if the Lords amendments are allowed to stand, that negotiating position will be undermined,” she said.The Lords approved 15 amendments to the Bill, which repeals the act that brought Britain into the common market and transposes EU law into British law. MPs will debate and vote on the amendments for six hours on Tuesday and a further six hours on Wednesday.The government was working last night on a compromise over an amendment on the customs union, which some pro-EU Conservatives are backing. The Lords amendment calls on the government to report by October 31st on “steps taken to negotiate a customs union with the EU”. The compromise version being negotiated last night would instead require the government to report on steps to negotiate a customs “arrangement”.Next month, MPs will debate an amendment to a trade Bill that would require Britain to remain in a customs union with the EU after Brexit, and some potential rebels have suggested they will wait for that vote to take a stand.The other amendment that could create problems for Ms May concerns the role of parliament in approving the final Brexit deal. The Lords amendment would not only give parliament a veto over the withdrawal agreement with the EU but a right to issue binding instructions to the government on how to proceed with the negotiations after that.Brexiteers fear that the Lords amendment would allow parliament to stop Brexit by rejecting the withdrawal agreement but telling the government not to leave the EU without a deal. The government has proposed its own version of the amendment, which would give parliament a veto over the withdrawal agreement and the framework for a future relationship with the EU, promising to give MPs a vote on the deal before it goes to the European Parliament for ratification.The government’s version would not, however, allow parliament to instruct the government how to proceed with negotiations, instead requiring a minister to report to MPs on what the government planned to do next.Labour has imposed a three-line whip on its MPs, telling them to vote in favour of all House of Lords amendments except one, on remaining in the European Economic Area. The Labour leadership has told its MPs to abstain on that amendment and to vote instead for its own alternative, which calls for full access to the single market.Negotiations move to phase II after agreement reached on protecting the rights of citizens in both UK \u0026amp EU, Northern Ireland and the financial settlement of the orce"},{"url":null,"title":"magnum freedom project pictures","story":"1968 was a seismic year of deep societal and political shifts.

It is hoped that children will again be taught there.This road will transform life on Sanday, she said. No ordinary vehicles could use the old track because of the clearance needed and only get around along the foreshore when the tide is out.The road will give 24 hour access and is also vital for a new renewable energy scheme which will start producing electricity in a few months.The new road stretches from the Canna bridge to a church on the island.The original track would often be submerged under water at high tideAlongside the track, the trust wants to create a trail to link the sites of interest on Sanday together. These include the bridge itself, the shrine, machair and sand dunes, bird colonies, St Edward\u0027s Church, Sanday lighthouse and local archaeology.Canna is just over four miles long and one mile wide.

New research suggests a vital link between our ability to sense our physical bodies and knowing how we feelStephen has been married twice. Two wedding days. Two “I do”s. Yet Stephen has no happy memories from either – or, in fact, from the marriages or any of his relationships.\u0026nbspHe met his first wife on a pre-nursing course when he was just 16. Six years later, they were married. Three years after that, they got orced she was never really the right one for him, he says.Almost two decades on, in 2009, he met his second wife through a dating site. He threw himself into the relationship and, the following year, with his father and her two adult siblings present, they married at the registrar’s office in Sheffield, where they both live.\u0026nbspHe put on smiles for the wedding photos because he recognised that they were expected but, as he explains: “From an inner feeling point of view, anything I do that requires an emotional response feels like a fake.“Most of my responses are learned responses. In an environment where everyone is being jolly and happy, it feels like I’m lying. Acting. Which I am. So it is a lie.”\u0026nbspHappiness isn’t the only emotion that Stephen struggles with. Excitement, shame, disgust, anticipation, even love… he doesn’t feel these, either. “I feel something but I’m unable to distinguish in any real way what that feeling is.” The only emotions he is familiar with are fear and anger.\u0026nbspSuch profound problems with emotion are sometimes associated with autism, which Stephen does not have, or with psychopathy, which he doesn’t have, either.Last year, at the age of 51, he finally learned what he does have: a little-known condition called alexithymia, a word made from Greek parts meaning, roughly, “no words for emotion”.Despite the name, the real problem for people with alexithymia isn’t so much that they have no words for their emotions, but that they lack the emotions themselves. Still, not everyone with the condition has the same experiences. Some have gaps and distortions in the typical emotional repertoire.Some realise they’re feeling an emotion, but don’t know which, while others confuse signs of certain emotions for something else – perhaps interpreting butterflies in the stomach as hunger pangs.\u0026nbspSurprisingly, given how generally unrecognised it is, studies show that about one in 10 people fall on the alexithymia spectrum. New research is now revealing what’s going wrong – and this work holds the promise not only of novel treatments for disorders of emotion, but of revealing just how the rest of us feel anything at all.\u0026nbspAfter working as a nurse for 10 years, Stephen decided he wanted to do something different. A two-year Access to University course led to a degree in astronomy and physics, and then to a job testing computer games.He built a successful career for himself, working for various companies in their computer testing departments, managing teams, and travelling around the world to speak at conferences. He had no problem conveying facts to colleagues.It was in the context of more personal relationships – or any other scenario that would typically involve expressions of emotion – that he felt things were “wrong”.\u0026nbsp“At the beginning of a relationship, I’m totally into who that person is,” he explains. “I’ve been told I’m very good at maintaining a honeymoon period for ‘longer than expected’. But after a year it takes a massive turn. It all falls apart. I’ve put myself on a pedestal to be this person which I’m really not. I react mostly cognitively, rather than it being emotions making me react. Obviously, that is not valid. It’s not real. It seems fake. Because it is fake. And you can only pretend for so long.”\u0026nbspHe and his current wife stopped living together in 2012. He saw a GP and was prescribed antidepressants. Though he was still in contact with his wife, it was clear that the relationship was no longer working. In June 2015, he attempted suicide.“I had actually been posting on Facebook and Twitter regarding killing myself and someone – I’ve never found out who – contacted the police. I was taken to hospital and treated.”\u0026nbspA psychiatrist referred Stephen for a series of counselling sessions and then a course of psychodynamic psychotherapy, a type of Freudian-based therapy that, in trying to uncover unconscious drivers of thoughts and behaviour, is similar to psychoanalysis.\u0026nbspIt was in a book called Why Love Matters by Sue Gerhardt, which his therapist recommended, that he first came across the concept of alexithymia.“I brought it up in therapy, and that’s when we started talking about how I was very alexithymic. Obviously, I’ve got a vocabulary. I’ve got words for emotions. But whether they’re the right words for the right emotion is a different point altogether… I just thought that I wasn’t good at talking about how I feel and emotions and stuff like that. But after a year of therapy, it became apparent that when I talk about emotions I don’t actually know what I’m talking about.”The term “alexithymic” dates from a book published in 1972 and has its origins in Freudian psychodynamic literature.Freudian ideas are now out of favour with most academic psychologists, as Geoff Bird, a professor of psychology at the University of Oxford explains. “Not to disrespect those traditions, but in the cognitive, neuro, experimental field, not so many people are really very interested in anything associated with Freud any more.”But when Bird read about alexithymia, he found the descriptions intriguing. “Actually, it’s really quite amazing.” For most people, “at a low level of emotion, you might be a bit unsure about exactly what you’re feeling, but if you have a strong emotion, you know what it is”. And yet somehow, here were people who simply did not know.\u0026nbspBird started his academic career studying autism spectrum disorder, empathy and emotional awareness, which led to his interest in alexithymia.In one of his first studies in this field, he linked alexithymia, as measured with a 20-item checklist developed at the University of Toronto, with a lack of empathy. If you can’t feel your own emotions in the typical way, it makes sense that you can’t identify with those of others, either.\u0026nbspBut what really drew Bird into alexithymia research were his interactions with people with autism. “There has been this perception that people with autism don’t have empathy. And that’s rubbish. And you can see that immediately as soon as you meet some autistic people.”In a series of studies, Bird has found that about half of people with autism have alexithymia – it’s these people who struggle with emotion and empathy, while the rest do not. In other words, emotion-related difficulties are intrinsic to the alexithymia, not to the autism.Bird is passionate about spreading this message. He talks with feeling about one particular autistic study volunteer who did not have alexithymia: “A lovely guy with an IQ we couldn’t measure, it’s that good. He couldn’t hold down a job. But he volunteered to work at a care home because he wanted to do something productive with his time.“They said, ‘Oh because you’ve got a diagnosis of autism you can’t do empathy, therefore you can’t look after our elderly people.’ Which is just ridiculous.”\u0026nbspBird has since run a series of studies exploring alexithymia outside the context of autism. He has found, for example, that people with the condition have no trouble recognising faces, or distinguishing pictures of people smiling and frowning.“But for a few of our really alexithymic people, while they can tell a smile and a frown apart, they have no idea what they are. That is really quite strange.”\u0026nbspMany of the people with the condition who Bird has met talk about being told by other people that they’re different, though some do recognise it in themselves early on.“I guess it’s a bit like not being able to see colour, and everybody’s always banging on about how red this is or how blue, and you come to realise there’s an aspect of human experience that you’re just not participating in.”As well as better characterising alexithymia, Bird and his colleagues have also dug into what explains it, taking what could seem to be a circular argument – Stephen has problems with emotion because he has alexithymia, which is characterised by problems with emotion – and blowing it right apart.In situations that Stephen recognises as being in theory highly emotional – like telling someone “I love you” – he experiences changes inside his body. “I feel my heart race and this rush of adrenaline, but to me that feeling is always scary. I don’t know how to react. It makes me want to either run away or react verbally aggressively.”\u0026nbspFear and anger – and confusion – he understands. “Everything else just feels all the same… it’s this feeling of, ‘Errrr, I’m not quite comfortable with this – it’s not quite right’.”\u0026nbsp“Similarly with anxiety, it might be that someone experiences an emotional response associated with a fast heartbeat – which might be excitement – but they don’t know how to interpret that, and they could panic about what’s happening in their body.”\u0026nbspThe ability to detect changes inside the body – everything from a racing heart to a ersion of blood flow, from a full bladder to a distension of the lungs – is known as interoception. It’s your perception of your own internal state.\u0026nbspDifferent emotions are associated with different physical changes. In anger, for example, the heart rate rises, blood rushes to the face, and fists clench. In fear, the heart rate also rises but blood drains from the face.It’s generally thought that these changes are not entirely specific to inidual emotions, and so context is also important: if you feel your heart racing and you’re looking at a spider, you know it’s fear that you’re feeling, not sexual arousal.\u0026nbspWhat Bird, Brewer and others have found in people with alexithymia is a reduced ability, sometimes a complete inability, to produce, detect or interpret these internal bodily changes. People with the condition have normal-range IQs.They can understand as well as anyone else that they’re seeing a spider, rather than an attractive potential partner. But either their brains aren’t triggering the physical changes that it seems are needed for the experience of an emotion, or other regions of their brains aren’t reading these signals properly.\u0026nbspIn 2016, Bird and Brewer, along with Richard Cook at City University in London, published a research paper that characterised alexithymia as a “generalised deficit of interoception”.Here, then, was an explanation for these people’s problems with emotion – but also, in effect, a manifesto stating that the perception of a range of bodily signals is important for the experience of emotion in the rest of us.\u0026nbspIt’s an idea that we already express in everyday language: in English, for an apology to mean anything, it has to be “heartfelt”. If you truly love someone, it’s with “all your heart”.When you’re really angry, your “blood boils”. Instead of saying that you’re anxious, you might talk about having “butterflies in your stomach” (thought to be caused by a ersion of blood flow away from the digestive system).While most people may not be familiar with alexithymia, there is a different disorder involving flat emotions and poor empathy that seems to fascinate us, even more than it repels us: psychopathy. Can we learn more about how we feel by understanding psychopaths?Lieke Nentjes is in her early thirties. She’s slender and softly spoken it’s hard to picture her spending countless hours in small rooms with incarcerated, unshackled psychopaths, including serially violent men who have committed murder.\u0026nbsp“Then he explained that he was at the end of his therapy and was ‘resocialising’ and no one would hire him because they were intimidated by him. He wasn’t really angry. He was frustrated.”While the nature of psychopathy is still debated, psychologists generally agree that it entails, among other things, a lack of empathy or guilt, shallow emotions, and antisocial behaviour – treating other people badly and, in some cases, engaging in criminal acts.\u0026nbspIt has certainly been suggested that the reason some psychopaths are able to torture or murder people is that they don’t process emotions properly – they don’t feel fear, for example, and they don’t recognise it in others.\u0026nbspNentjes is based at the University of Amsterdam. Here in the Netherlands, if a criminal is found to have a psychological condition that relates to the crime, he or she is deemed to be only partially responsible.Such criminals might spend a few years in a regular jail before being sent to a secure treatment centre, or they may be sent straight for treatment.\u0026nbspNentjes decided to assess a range of criminals from these centres and from jails to find out just how psychopathic they were (with particular attention to different aspects of psychopathy), to learn about their lives – their upbringing, and their criminal behaviour – and also to measure their interoceptive ability.\u0026nbsp“Emotion is very central when you look at psychopathy – or rather, lack of emotion,” she says. So could it be that psychopathic offenders just aren’t very in touch with their bodies?\u0026nbspIn the course of the interviews, Nentjes asked questions to probe their levels of empathy, and how much remorse they felt about what they had done to their victims. “Some were just completely honest, and would say, ‘I don’t care,’” she says.“Others who were psychopathic would say, ‘Oh, but I’m very empathic.’ They had learned the lingo to describe feelings very accurately and they could talk about compassionate, empathic feelings towards others – but then when you look at the crimes they have committed…” Her sentence trails off.\u0026nbsp“There is research finding that psychopathic offenders can describe emotions in terms of words, but they lack the inner experience of the emotion,” she adds.\u0026nbspSince assessing a person’s ability to detect a range of bodily signals is tricky, the most commonly used measures of interoceptive sensitivity are based on judgements of heart rate. One test involves asking participants to count their heartbeats over varying periods – 25 or 50 seconds, perhaps – multiple times.About 10 per cent of us are good at counting heartbeats, 5 to 10 per cent are very bad, and the rest fall somewhere in between.In another test, volunteers are played a series of beeps that are either in sync or out of sync with their heartbeat, and asked which it is. On this type of task, about 10 per cent of the general population can do it really well, and 80 per cent can’t do it at all.\u0026nbspNentjes brought the necessary equipment for the heartbeat synch task with her into the interview rooms, and took measures for 75 offenders. She found a clear link: the higher an offender’s score on the antisocial aspect of psychopathy, the poorer their performance on the heart-rate task.This does at least suggest that psychopaths who are poorer at detecting bodily signals feel less emotion and therefore less empathy for others.Psychopathic criminals are sometimes ided into the “white-collar” type, who tend to commit non-violent crimes such as fraud, and the violent type. In her interviews with this violent group, Nentjes was struck by one similarity, in particular, compared with the white-collar group.“That was their upbringing. Or rather lack of it. Emotional abuse. Sexual abuse. Neglect. A lot of physical abuse. I’ve heard people literally say that emotion is not of use to them. All they felt during their upbringing was fear.”\u0026nbspAs a child, Stephen suffered extreme emotional neglect. When he was six, his mother intentionally set fire to their home in Nottingham while she, Stephen, his younger brother and even younger sister were all inside. Fortunately, the children’s father, who had left for work, realised that he’d forgotten his packed lunch and came home.\u0026nbspLooking back, Stephen says it’s clear that his mother was suffering from post-natal depression. But she received no treatment, “and all I knew was anxiety and being worried”. After the fire, his mother went to prison. His father was a steelworker, who worked all kinds of shifts.“A neighbour contacted social services and Dad was told to sort it out or they’d take us away. None of my dad’s brothers or sisters wanted me or my brother because we were little shits. We were always in trouble. Robbing shops. All kinds of stuff. So we went into care.”\u0026nbspFor the rest of his childhood, Stephen was in and out of care homes. The only emotions he remembers feeling, even then, are fear, anger and confusion. “Christmas, birthdays, people out of the blue at care homes being nice to me… I never really got used to it. I always felt uncomfortable. There’s just a mess of feelings inside me that I don’t interpret properly, or respond to properly.”\u0026nbspAlexithymia is often associated with trauma and neglect from a young age, explains Geoff Bird. Twin studies have suggested a genetic component, too. And it’s also linked to certain types of brain damage, particularly to the insula, the region that receives interoceptive signals.\u0026nbspAs Rebecca Brewer notes, the kind of anxiety that Stephen experiences is common in people with poor interoception. At the University of Sussex, Hugo Critchley and Sarah Garfinkel, who have expertise in psychiatry and neuroscience, are looking at ways to alter interoception, to bring anxiety down.\u0026nbspGarfinkel has put forward a three-dimensional model of interoception that has been well received by others in the field. First, objective accuracy at perceiving interoceptive signals – how good you are at counting heartbeats, for example.Second, subjective report – how good you think you are. And third, metacognitive accuracy – how good you are at knowing how good you actually are.\u0026nbspThe third dimension is important because various studies have found that the gap between how good someone thinks they are at counting heartbeats, for example, and how good they actually are predicts their levels of anxiety.Lisa Quadt, a research fellow with the Sussex group, is now running a clinical trial with the aim of testing whether reducing this gap for people with autism can reduce their anxiety.In a pilot study, Critchley, Garfinkel and MSc student Abigail McLanachan recruited a group of students who came into the lab for six training sessions. In each session, they first did the heartbeat-counting task.The volunteer sat at rest, with a loose rubber pulse oximeter on their forefingers, and reported how many beats they’d counted. Then McLanachan told them how they’d done so that they got a better sense of how accurate they were.McLanachan then got them to do a few minutes of jumping jacks or walking fast up the steep hill outside the building – whatever was necessary to raise their heart rate, to make it easier to detect. (“Because some people really can’t feel their heartbeat at all. I can’t,” Quadt explains.)Then they went back into the lab, did the tasks again and, as before, were given feedback each time.\u0026nbspThis was just a pilot study on a general student population. But after three weeks, not only had the students’ accuracy improved on all three dimensions of interoception, but they also reported reductions in anxiety of around 10 per cent.\u0026nbspFor the main trial, volunteers diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder will complete the same tasks as in the pilot, but once at the start and once at the end they’ll do them inside an MRI scanner.This will allow the team to monitor activity in the insula, which receives heart-rate data, and look at how changes in that activity may correspond to connections between the amygdala, which detects threats, and the prefrontal cortex, which can work out whether a potential threat really is or is not dangerous and so whether anxiety is warranted.The hope, Critchley explains, is to see improved connectivity between these two regions, which previous studies have linked to reduced anxiety.\u0026nbspIn Oxford, meanwhile, Geoff Bird wants to look at the idea that there are two different types of alexithymia. People with one type don’t produce enough of the bodily signals necessary for the experience of an emotion, so would be unlikely to benefit from the Sussex group’s kind of training.People with the other type produce all kinds of bodily sensations but their brains don’t process these signals in the typical way. This second group, which includes Stephen, might benefit more.\u0026nbspBird stresses that, although people with alexithymia struggle to understand emotion, that doesn’t mean they don’t care about other people. “For the most part, iniduals with alexithymia can recognise that others are in a negative state, and this makes them distressed.“The problem is that they can’t work out what the other person is feeling, and what they are feeling, and therefore how to make the other person feel better or how to reduce their own distress. I think that’s important because alexithymia is different from psychopathy in that respect.”Stephen says that for him, this is certainly true. And in theory, an emotional training technique is something he would welcome. “I’ve got several books about emotions and feelings and they don’t make a jot of difference because they’re not talking specifically enough about what you actually feel within your body is which emotion.”\u0026nbspFor now, given the absence of available treatments for alexithymia, Stephen plans to use his newfound understanding of himself, gained through therapy, to try to move forwards. At first, he says, he hoped that therapy would fix everything.“I thought every day would be perfect, brilliant… and I’ve come to realise that’s not going to happen. I’m always going to have problems, always going to have issues.”\u0026nbspHe’s learned valuable lessons, he says. Though he and his wife are still separated, they talk regularly and now he tries not to reject her views on his anxiety. “Rather than go, ‘No,’ I will listen. I think, ‘Well, you know what emotions are about and I don’t, so I’m going to listen to you and I’ll either take it on board or I’ll find a way to deal with it’.”He’s also thinking about moving to work with people who are struggling with substance abuse, because he’d like to be back in a career where he can help people.\u0026nbspMost of all, he’s determined to use his diagnosis of alexithymia. “For me, it empowers me – now I know about it, I can read about it. I can find out more about it. And I can develop certain tools that enable me to combat it.”People without alexithymia could probably use such tools as well. Bird has led work showing that people who are more aware of their own heartbeat are better able to recognise others’ emotions, a crucial first step in being empathetic.He’s planning studies to investigate whether heartbeat training might therefore increase empathy.\u0026nbspThose who want to reduce feelings of stress and anxiety in daily life, but who either can’t or don’t want to change the sources of stress, could focus on changing the signals coming from their bodies instead.Regular physical exercise should dampen down the kinds of bodily signals (from the heart and circulation, for example) that the brain could interpret as being anxious – so it should dampen down feelings of anxiety, too.\u0026nbspKnowing that signals from our bodies underpin our emotions could be empowering for all of us.

Andy Martin on the man who’ll be guiding ITV viewers through a month of World Cup hyperboleEverybody is a commentator these days. @Chasepacheco1, for example, who tweeted after last month’s Uefa Champions League final:\u0026nbsp“My Liverpool team fought hard and I’m proud of them. Except for Karius, he can die in a hole.” Loris Karius, Liverpool’s German goalkeeeper, let in three goals (one of them, to be fair, a moment of sheer brilliance by Gareth Bale). Which means that online he finds himself denounced as a “Nazi”. And, according to one theory, paid handsomely for his “howlers” by Real Madrid. We can assume that the World Cup in Russia this month will be the occasion of a deluge of similar wildly overheated rhetoric, hyperbole and death threats.But you won’t be hearing any of it from ITV’s chief football commentator Clive Tyldesley. Winner many times over of the Royal Television Society Sports Commentator of the Year award, he is the voice of moderation, the calm centre at the eye of the storm. Occasionally the target of Twitter rage himself, he expects to encounter not just a lot of verbals but also racism, hooliganism, and misogyny on top. Football, he says, is “warts and all. It reflects life. It corrupts. That is part of its fascination.” But, from the heights of the commentary box, he tries to provide something like a counterpoint to all the frenzy, the agony and the ecstasy.He is a fit-looking 63 and described himself as “a respecter of vocabulary” when I went to see him shortly before the Champions League final. “I would never say it’s a ‘disaster’ or a ‘tragedy’ if the ball goes through the goalkeeper’s legs,” he said. “You only use words like that if somebody dies.” He thought he might stretch to “calamity”.\u0026nbspHis words were strangely prophetic. As it turned out that is exactly the word he selected to describe Liverpool’s “goalkeeping calamity” when Karius bowled the ball right onto the toe of Benzema. But it struck me that there was also a kind of poetry, of a restrained, austere kind, in his summary of Real Madrid’s first goal, perhaps something like an instant haiku:And Real Madrid are in front.His “an evening that had started so promisingly for Liverpool” sounded a poignantly elegiac note. I also had to admire the comment, after Karius lets a tame one by Bale slip through his hands and into the net: “His reputation would do well to survive that moment.” Note the use of the conditional tense. Tyldesley appreciates that the keeper’s reputation is already in tatters, but that – perhaps in an ideal world – it could still recover.David Hume said that you cannot get an “ought” from an “is”. Somehow Clive Tyldesley manages to pull that off. He is only describing a game of football but there is an implicit ethics in his commentary. Tyldesley agrees with Bill Shankly that football is not a matter of life and death, but omits the punchline, “it’s more important than that.” Still, it is “a huge emotional investment by all the people who turn on. They choose to watch.” Therefore, as a commentator, “You have to be careful with your use of words.”The Playstation Schools Cup U15 final, between Thomas Telford School and Carshalton Boys Sports College, held at Reading’s Madejski stadium, was as fraught and intense as any Champions League final. Some of the players even had agents already. “Maybe overdid it a bit, Hodnett,” commented Tyldesley, in his simultaneous schools broadcast, as he skyed the ball over the bar. He prepared for this game as scrupulously as he is now preparing for the opening game of the World Cup between Russia and Saudi Arabia, and had a foolscap file in front of him containing assorted facts about the players.There was a goalmouth melee, which saw both the Carshalton goalkeeper and the Telford player red-carded. And a penalty shootout after the much fancied Telford came back from 2-0 down only to blow it on the last kick of the game. “Now that is absolutely out of order,” said Tyldesley, as the hulking No 10 wrapped a menacing paw around the referee. “He’d have done well to keep his opinions to himself.” It’s advice he has tried to follow.But in a sense all of his commentary implies an opinion. Presumably he would have disapproved of Zinedine Zidane’s farewell headbutt on Marco Materazzi in 2006 and David Beckham’s retaliation on Diego Simeone that got him sent off in 1998. Tyldesley himself doesn’t get flustered. He is unflappable. He has – and admires – grace under pressure. “His control wasn’t the best,” as he said in one of his critical remarks about the U15 final. The ability to take and keep control is all important, whether you’re on the pitch or off it.This might have something to do with having been subjected to the furious “hairdryer” treatment from Sir Alex Ferguson when still manager of Manchester United, not just once but twice. “You really can feel your hair blowing backwards.” He thought that the boot that hit David Beckham in the face in the dressing room was “probably an accident”.Whether it’s broadcasting to schools or to 10 million people on ITV, Tyldesley always feels a sense of “responsibility”. “Balance” is a key word. He points out that the dying words of Pheidippedes, the messenger who ran all the way from Marathon to Athens to report on the outcome of the battle back in 490BC, “We won!”, only caused confusion, because people were bound to ask, “Who is ‘we’?” “He wasn’t a good journalist,” says Tyldesley. “What he should have said is ‘Athens won’.” Greece 1, Persia 0.He was once commentating on an England-Scotland game with Ron Atkinson when Atkinson insisted on saying “we”. Tyldesley said to him, “You should say ‘England’ not ‘we’.” Although he accepts that there perhaps he was being “correct beyond reason”. He allows that the occasional we “might slip out” at the World Cup. “I’m English but I’m still objective. You don’t choose to support England. It would be odd to switch to supporting Chile.”Tyldesley disapproves of those who get too fancy. “A straightforward pass would have done,” is a classic line of his, which happened to be addressed to schools. So too when it comes to commentary. He argues that cricket and golf have passages of inaction which permit – or even demand – “colour”, the kind of lyrical and expansive discourse, infinitely digressive, forever associated with John Arlott and Brian Johnston in cricket or Peter Alliss in golf. Steve Bunce likewise in boxing, and I can get similarly carried away when it comes to describing surfing, perhaps because there are often long lulls between the epic and the awesome.Tyldesley is more a fan of plain speaking. He says the best ad slogan of all time is Ronseal’s “Does exactly what it says on the tin”. That’s how he thinks commentary should be. You observe, you analyse, you try not to hype it up. You keep it “succinct”. “There’s no point trying to be Wordsworth or Browning. As Barry Davis once said, “One man’s commentator is another man’s pain in the arse.”Everything is mediated and mediatised. There are no exceptions. The old Zen koan, “If a tree fell over in the forest and no one was there to witness it would you still hear it?” now has a clear answer. Yes, because it would be captured by a passing drone or on satellite TV, blazed all over Instagram, tweeted about furiously, the tree’s friends on Facebook would start a crowdfunding campaign, and it would shortly thereafter be the subject of a controversial Channel 4 documentary. Nothing happens any more without commentary. But this is and always has been especially true of football. “They think it’s all over… it is now”, Kenneth Wolstenholme’s line, is as memorable as the 1966 World Cup final itself. Whether or not the ball crossed the line is less significant now than the fact that there was so much debate about whether or not it had. And new technology is not making the debate go away, rather the opposite.I can’t play football without also hearing something like this in my head:\u0026nbsp “Martin comes on, scores with his first touch, and the crowd goes wild.” As Simon Critchley, philosopher and (currently distraught) Liverpool fan comments in his book, What We Think About When We Think About Football, “We usually know football through commentary, through largely, and hugely, inane commentary.”Tyldesley doesn’t think of it as inane. “Sometimes,” he says, “‘a game of two halves’ is exactly what it is. You can’t improve on it.” If he were to write a book about it, it would be something like the opposite of Nick Hornby’s Fever Pitch. Hornby is all about irrational fandom, ritual, intensity of feeling. Tyldesley is more of a phlegmatic “keep calm and carry on” sort of guy. “We don’t need to see that!” he exclaimed at the sight of an overflow of emotions on the sidelines with even teachers getting hot under the collar.Albert Camus said, “I learned everything I know about morality from football.” Which is to say, when it comes to the “beautiful game”, the good, the bad, and the ugly are all on display. There are undoubtedly heroes and villains in Tyldesley’s narrative. But he does it subtly. “You try not to sound too much like a Methodist preacher,” as he puts it. When it comes to making criticism of the play – you could call it a judo throw – by Sergio Ramos, the Real Madrid captain, that resulted in Mo Salah going off in agony with a dislocated shoulder, Tyldesley is judicious but still uncompromising in his remarks. There is “a coming together with Ramos that only he can fully explain”. As he goes up to collect the cup, Ramos is described as “not everyone’s idea of a model professional – maybe nobody’s”.There is even an implicit politics in his commentary. Tyldesley has no objection to big money in football. “It’s labour intensive, they’re entitled to be paid. You can’t do without inidual players.” But still “the collective should be stronger than the inidual”. And this is where we went so badly wrong in the Brexit campaign, and the adjacent media coverage, he argues. “We turned it into a personality competition. Instead of providing the relevant information, we focused on the impact it would have on the lives of politicians.”He says that “the most popular team in this country is not Manchester United or Liverpool, it’s England. It’s a great democracy.” And he has to be “inclusive”. He would never use the word “esoteric” for example, he says, because he doesn’t “want anyone to have to get up and look for a dictionary”.When I saw him, Tyldesley was prepping Arabic and Russian names. He says, “I will try to get it correct, but I will not make sounds we don’t make in the English language.” When identifying James Rodriguez of Chile in the past, he wanted to say “James”.\u0026nbspEventually he bowed to pressure from Twitter to say “Ham-es”, in the Spanish manner. “But later I learned that his father,\u0026nbspa 007 fan,\u0026nbsphad named him after James Bond.”\u0026nbspHe felt vindicated, because in Spanish-speaking countries it’s always James, never Ham-es, Bond.\u0026nbspHe is not, he reckons, “responsible for the teaching of Spanish” or Arabic or Russian.In an extremist, Dionysian world, Tyldesley is an Apollonian voice of reason. He holds the mirror up to football with minimum distortion, minimum fuss. Sound without the fury. A degree zero of poetry. Let’s hope he doesn’t have to repeat a line he first used of England versus Iceland in 2016, “This is the most abject failure that I can recall.”Andy Martin is the author of ‘Reacher Said Nothing: Lee Child and the Making of Make Me’.

Flat desert on either side, a few lights.\u0026nbspThe Moroccan traveller Ibn Battuta passed this way on camel back in 1326, and wrote of its emphatic wilderness: “He who enters it is lost and he who leaves it is born.”Before mass tourism ruined them for a second time, I’d travelled to the so-called “lost” cities of Petra, Machu Picchu and Angkor Wat.\u0026nbspMy destination tonight was the isolated sandstone valley eulogised by Charles Doughty, the first European to enter it\u0026nbspin 1876, as “the fabulous Mada’in Saleh\u0026nbspwhich I was come from far countries to seek in Arabia”.The prospect of following in Doughty’s flapping shadow gave me a jolt of anticipation that I hadn’t experienced since my twenties.\u0026nbspDoughty’s classic book Arabia Deserta was championed by his friend TE\u0026nbspLawrence, who later used it as a military textbook, as the greatest record of adventure and travel in our language.It begins with Doughty trying to smuggle himself into Mada’in Saleh in the guise of a poor Syrian pilgrim.\u0026nbspEven up until recently few Europeans have visited this cradle of forgotten civilisations, which, though designated a World Heritage Site in 2008, remains a blank page on the archaeological record, closed off by geography, politics, religion.“Visitors last year from abroad? I can say zero,” my guide Ahmed tells me.This is set to change. Last July, under the impetus of Saudi Arabia’s progressive new Crown Prince, Mohammed Bin Salman, or “MBS” as he is popularly known, a Royal Commission took charge of Mada’in Saleh and its surrounds – “the only crown jewel of a site the country possesses,” says one of the archaeologists recruited to excavate it.In December, public access was halted first in order to survey what actually is there, next to develop a strategy for protecting it, and then to open up Mada’in Saleh to the outside world. My advance visit is aimed at providing an amuse-bouche, as it were.In the bright morning sunlight, Ahmed escorts me through locked gates, past the German-built railway-line linking Damascus with Medina, which Lawrence bombed (“there are still local tribes which call their sons Al-Orans”), to the celebrated Nabatean rock tombs.Doughty first heard about these in Petra, 300 miles north. Fifty years earlier, an awe-struck British naval commander had gazed in disbelief at Petra’s imperishable Treasury, murmuring, as many continue to do: “There is nothing in the world that resembles it.” He was wrong.If a little less rosier than her sister city, Mada’in Saleh shares her capacity to stagger.\u0026nbspOut of the flat desert, one after another, the ornate facades rise into sight, 111 of them, carved into perpendicular cliffs up to four storeys high, their low doorways decorated by Alexandrian masons in the first century AD, with Greek triangles, Roman pilasters, Persian flowers, Egyptian sphinxes, birds.“This is a twin to Petra,” Ahmed says. Except that in Petra we would be bobbing among crowds.Standing in reverent silence, with the valley to ourselves, I recall how the Victorian artist who supplied the first images of Petra to the world, David Roberts, responded to that other city. “I turned from it at length with an impression which will be effaced only by death.”These tombs were carved for the Nabatean tribes who ruled this region for 300 years until the Romans annexed them in 106AD. Nomads who had settled and grown wealthy, the Nabateans controlled the lucrative spice route from the Mediterranean to the Red Sea.Then, like the civilisations they’d replaced, the Dedanites, the Lihyanites, the Thamuds, they galloped off into obscurity. Their tombs were looted: the acacia doors plundered for firewood, the marble statues melted to make lime for plaster, the porphyry urns smashed.All that survives of their caravan city, Hegra, is a flat expanse behind a wire fence: “her clay-built streets are again the blown dust in the wilderness,” Doughty wrote.The same desolation holds true for the still more ancient Biblical city of Dedan, situated on the lip of an oasis a few minutes drive way. To visit both sites is to gain the sense of a narrative even now being worked out.\u0026nbspUntil the 20th\u0026nbspcentury the story of these civilisations was scrawled on the rocks in Nabatean or Thamudic script. Ahmed leads me between two steep cliffs to the oldest inscription, written 6,000 years ago.Below, a square hole in the rock floor denotes a sacrificial spot from the time of the Dedanites. Ahmed could be speaking of the cavity in the historical record when he says, “They were making sacrifices to one god, Dhu-Ghaibat, which means ‘the one who is absent’.”Out in the desert, the wind has chiselled its own mysterious deities and hieroglyphs. The scene is stunning. In Petra, which forms part of the same massif, David Roberts threw away his pencil in despair at being able to convey it, believing that the ruins “sink into insignificance when compared with these stupendous rocks”.It’s hard to disagree. Cliffs formed out of red and black sandstone have eroded into crazy, hallucinatory shapes: elephants, mushrooms, braying seals. If they were transcribed into music, it would be Wagnerian.They make you believe in mountain gods, I tell Ahmed, who smiles. “I never try smoking weed, but when I hear someone react, I feel like that. It makes you high, naturally.”For sheer high spirits, no one yields to the British archaeologist I meet that night. Jamie Quartermain is part of an international team employed since March to survey these sites.A surveyor who pioneered the use of drones, Quartermain says: “We’ve been wanting to get involved here, but Saudi has been a closed shop, a completely untapped reserve.The perception is that it’s big, open desert. When I tried to find out anything about it, there was essentially one book. The discovery that there are so many archaeological sites is a big shock for most people. It was a big shock for me.”Advised by the Royal Commission to expect 450 unexcavated sites, Quartermain estimates the truer number between 6,000-10,000.\u0026nbsp“The survival of the archaeology is remarkable, some of the best condition remains I’ve ever seen. We’re not finding it close to the surface, it’s above surface, well and truly visible.”Deploying a drone, he has begun creating a three-dimensional textural surface of the area. Already, what he has found is ground-breaking. “You can see all the archaeology jumping out and biting you on the bottom.”When, aged 20, I visited Petra, sleeping in one of the caves, I talked to the head of the Bdoul tribe, allegedly descendants of the Nabateans, who told me: “We have a saying that the more wealth you have, the more brain cells you need to be able to cope with it.What impresses about MBS’s plan for Mada’in Saleh is his determination to use his nation’s resources to avoid the pitfalls of Petra.“Wadi Rum is pretty disastrous,” says Chris Tuttle, an American archaeologist seconded to the project. Tuttle spent many years excavating in Petra. He saw at first hand the ruinous impact of tourism, both on the ruins and the local community.By contrast, in Al-Ula, the local town for Mada’in Saleh, there has been a concerted drive to educate the locals, giving scholarships to 150 children, but also to attract experts armed with the latest methodolOne reason for the blankness on Saudi Arabia’s archaeological map, says Tuttle, has been the resistance of conservative religious leaders to question their history. “You don’t need to study the past when you’ve been given a manual from God.”Suddenly, a multi-thousand-year-old story has become an open book, not a closed one, and the revelation it contains could be a complex of sites more significant even than Petra.\u0026nbspMy guide Ahmed Alimam is a perfect representative of Al-Ula’s past and future. He comes from a long line of imams descended from a grand tribal judge who arrived c1400 in Al Ula’s “old town”Abandoned in 1983, the year of Ahmed’s birth, this haunting labyrinth of mud houses and twisting streets replaced Dedan and Hegra. It was built using stones from those cities. They can be seen fortifying the occasional doorway.Ahmed leads the way down an empty street to the house where his parents used to live – collapsed beams, upturned crates. He shows me the mosque, erected over the spot where the Prophet Mohammed stopped in 630AD, and with a goat bone drew in the sand the direction of Medina Ahmed’s uncle was the last imam.And a modern inscription: the name “Charles”, scratched on the oat-coloured mud wall not, as momentarily I’d hoped, by Charles Doughty, but by Prince Charles (in 2015, with his key), and below it the Islamic translation.During the Islamic period, Al-Ula, or El-Ally as Doughty knew it, became an important station on the haj road south, and marked the last place where Christians were permitted to travel.\u0026nbspIbn Battuta described how pilgrim caravans paused here for four days to resupply and wash, and to leave any excess baggage with the townspeople “who are known for their trustworthiness”.“I hope we are still doing our best to be like that,” Ahmed says. “You can try, if you want, to leave something.”The only thing I left behind after my four days here was an urge to come back.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Sending vulnerable victims of trafficking back to the place they were trafficked from risks pushing them straight back into modern slavery,” she told The Independent.“It also means that victims won’t come forward or ask for help for fear of being sent straight back again. Instead of tackling modern slavery, this risks strengthening the power of the traffickers.”Labour MP Vernon\u0026nbspCoaker, chair of the all-party parliamentary group on human trafficking and modern slavery, said the current policy was “outrageous” and “totally and utterly unacceptable”.“Immigration policy seems to be riding roughshod over the needs of victims of trafficking. With much of this we’re talking about confirmed victims. These are not people who are playing the system, they are cases where the Home Office themselves have said these are victims of some of the most serious crimes,” he said.“It’s going to put people off coming forward, and it’s going to undermine the government’s own strategy on cracking down on trafficking and modern slavery. If the government is true to its rhetoric around supporting modern slavery victims, this would not be happening.”The Home Office accepted that Mr Nguyen was a victim of trafficking last August. He was released on bail last year and relocated in Glasgow, where he began volunteering for a number of charities, but he was detained again last Monday and issued the deportation notice.He is currently being held in Colnbrook detention centre, in Harmondsworth, awaiting deportation on Thursday.Describing his trafficking ordeal, Mr Nguyen said: “I worked but I had no money. I knew nothing about cannabis. They told me they couldn’t sell it because my skills to cultivate it were so poor.“When I realised it was illegal, in my mind I had a plan to escape\u0026nbspbut I couldn’t\u0026nbspbecause they are gangsters and part of an underground group.\u0026nbsp“They would come in and open the door and then leave again. I had to wake up after midnight to turn on and off the lights and to water the cannabis. I often had to stay up overnight.“I couldn’t get out. The house lacked oxygen – all the windows and the doors had live power on them so I would get electric shocks if I tried to open them.”Eight months into the exploitation, police raided the property and Mr Nguyen was arrested and sentenced to 15 months in prisonThe Vietnamese national described his imprisonment as “hard, but better than\u0026nbspgrowing cannabis,” adding: “I felt more freedom in prison.”Expressing his fear of deportation, the Vietnamese national said: “I feel very nervous. I don’t know what will happen to me in the future. I would be scared to go back because the gangsters will be out to get me. If I was to return I fear I will be killed.”Mr Nguyen’s situation has prompted a renewed push for changes to legislation to ensure adequate\u0026nbspsupport is\u0026nbspprovided to modern slavery victims, after a report by the National Audit Office urged there was\u0026nbsp“much more to do” to ensure victims in the UK are protected.At\u0026nbsppresent,\u0026nbsppeople who are officially recognised to have been trafficked through the National Referral Mechanism (NRM) – the UK’s official framework for identifying victims of human trafficking –\u0026nbspreceive no long-term support or automatic immigration status in the UK.Janet Fisher, advocacy manager and a solicitor at anti-slavery charity Hope for Justice, said the number of victims the organisation was seeing being threatened with deportation was “definitely increasing”, and claimed the issue was an as yet uncovered element of the hostile environment policies.She told of one client who\u0026nbspwas recently taken from their safe house, which is\u0026nbspwhere trafficking victims stay after they are rescued,\u0026nbspby immigration enforcement officers in order to carry out their deportation. The removal was later halted after\u0026nbsplawyers intervened.“We’ve had a number of trafficking victims who have been deported and then been pursued by their captors and fled straight back again. It’s a growing problem. It’s one of a number of things which are happening in the hostile environment but are only anecdotal at this point because they haven’t come to light,” said Ms Fisher.“We know that traffickers are mentioning the threat of deportation when they are exploiting people as a way of keeping control. One man was shown his own house on Google Earth by his trafficker to show they knew where he lived, so didn’t want to report the abuse out of fear. There are genuine threats to people.“The government must focus their immigration efforts on the people doing the trafficking, not the victims. But we know there have been many more victims facing deportation than traffickers.”Bhaveshri Patel-Chandegra, a solicitor from Duncan Lewis who is representing Mr Nguyen, said: “So many people get put off reporting because word gets around and they think if this is how I’m going to be treated, why should I claim?“There needs to be a change in the policy. People are being recognised as victims but then left without status. They’re left with nothing. What’s the point in being recognised as a victim if they’re not going to have any kind of support?”Kate Roberts, head of the Human Trafficking Foundation, echoed the concerns, saying: “There is a conflict between the immigration enforcement and the rehabilitation and victims’ needs, and supporting people to ensure they have a chance to rebuild their lives and not be re-trafficked.\u0026nbsp“It’s symptomatic of the huge focus on immigration control and its prevalence above everything else.”A Home Office spokesperson said: “We do not routinely comment on inidual cases.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The trip is only Mr Davis’s second visit to the de facto EU capital this year, with progress in talks having been slow. The minister declined to speak to the press during the trip.The “backstop solution” is supposed to prevent a hard border from emerging on the island of Ireland no matter what happens. Both sides say they do not want a hard border because the open frontier is part of the Good Friday Agreement, which brought an end to the Troubles.Mr Barnier last week said he was still studying the UK’s proposal and had not rejected it out of hand. When asked why he was doing so if it has such problems, he said: “Because I look at all British proposals in an objective manner.”The UK paper is the product of months of cabinet wrangling over how to temporarily solve the Irish border issue if it cannot be solved by a wider trade deal.\u0026nbspSeparately, the cabinet has still not decided on a single solution for the wider customs agreement between the UK and EU – with two options on the table. Both ideas, “max fac” and “customs partnership” have been rejected out of hand by Brussels.A spokesperson for the European Commission said: “We can confirm that the European Commission chief negotiator Michel Barnier and the secretary of state for exiting the European Union David Davis met this morning here in Brussels where they discussed the latest state of play of the Article 50 negotiations. They touched on issues related to the withdrawal agreement, including the backstop for Ireland-Northern Ireland and the framework for the future relationship.”British officials confirmed a similar line neither side would give more details.Officials on both sides are getting ready for a European Council summit in March where member states will take stock over the state of negotiations so far.A UK Government spokesperson said: “The Prime Minster has been clear that we will never accept a customs border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom.\u0026nbspWe are also committed to maintaining the integrity of our own internal market. That position will not change. The Commission’s proposals did not achieve this, which is why we have put forward our own backstop solutions for customs.“All parties must recall their commitment in the Joint Report to protect the Belfast Agreement in all its parts. Michel Barnier confirmed on Friday that discussions will now continue on our proposal.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

This is not your fault. Ask Daddy!”Can you imagine how that little girl must be feeling?She’s lost her mother and some have surmised the note appears to point the finger at her dad.It’s obviously not at all clear if that was really Kate’s intention, or whether she just wanted her daughter to seek answers and comfort from her father.That’s the trouble with suicide. Those left behind have to deal with so many unanswered questions.Look at little Ariane, who has just lost her beloved dad and will also be left with feelings of confusion and anger, as well as searing grief.Anthony, 61, was an award-winning chef and TV presenter.He was in France filming an episode of his successful CNN series, Parts Unknown, when he was found unresponsive in his hotel room.He was a larger-than-life, passionate character who championed the underdog and supported his girlfriend Asia Argento, one of the first actresses to accuse Harvey Weinstein of rape.Both Kate and Anthony were successful and, as far as the rest of the world was concerned, were living the dream.But no one really knows what goes on behind closed doors.Kate, who was 55, met husband Andy 35 years ago.They were married for 24 years but had been living apart for the past ten months, while sharing parental duties.They hadn’t discussed divorce and Andy said they still loved each other very much.He went on to say there was no indication that Kate was going to kill herself and his priority now is to protect and comfort his daughter.He will not only be grieving but inevitably feel he should have been able to somehow prevent this tragedy.People have asked “Who in their right mind would leave their own child to grow up motherless?”, but that’s the point.Kate wasn’t “in her right mind” and it seems neither was Anthony.People who kill themselves are suffering mental distress that no one can understand unless they have walked a mile in their shoes.On the surface, Kate had it all. Many thought she was still happily married. The couple had a healthy daughter, her designer label was a massive success.Kate was also good looking, funny and always seemed happy in interviews and photos. But now we know the poor woman was in agony.According to members of her family she had suffered from mental health problems for many years, and there has been speculation she was reluctant to seek help.If this was the case, then the reasons put forward for Kate trying to cope on her own are heartbreaking.She was apparently worried that her business, based on her cheerful handbags, would be affected if it was known she suffered from anxiety and depression. That really is desperately sad.Not only was Kate trying to cope with her demons but her marriage was going through a rocky patch and all the while she felt as though she had to paint on a smile and pretend everything was fine.Her life became so unbearable that she believed her only escape was to end it all.Her husband has said she was undergoing treatment and taking medication, yet Kate’s death shows that despite a change in attitudes towards those unfortunate enough to suffer from mental health problems, there is still a very long way to go.There are still people who will tell sufferers who are clearly very unwell to man up, or pull themselves together, which is just about the worst thing you could do.Suicide is a growing problem and each death is a tragedy. It is the biggest killer of men aged 20 to 49 in the UK. At least 84 men will have taken their own lives this week.If so many people were being lost to a virus there would be a national outcry and funds would be made available to find the cause and cure.Mental illness is still a Cinderella disease, and that cannot continue.But there are glimmers of hope.On TV we’ve seen the effect of Aidan Connor’s suicide on his friends and family in Coronation Street. It was tough to watch but raised awareness on a massive scale.We have seen raw grief but also deep anger and Aidan was branded selfish by his distraught sister.Those closest to him have experienced guilt because they didn’t realise how much pain he was in and have suffered sleepless nights and have been torturing themselves for not knowing how bad it was and for not offering help.Corrie shone a light in a dark place and I believe this storyline and the tragedy of Kate Spade and the apparent suicide of Anthony Bourdain will make people think.None of us knows what private battles are being fought against the dark demons of mental illness, even among our family and close friends.We all need to be watchful and unafraid to ask if everything really is OK. We need to be prepared to be rebuffed but to gently persist if we feel there is a real problem.The black despair that it seems Anthony Bourdain and Kate Spade succumbed to could happen to any one of us.If you feel depressed, please, I beg you, be brave and ask for help. And let’s all be prepared to reach out to that person in despair.I FIND it utterly ludicrous that in the eyes of the law a criminal who steals your pet is treated in exactly the same way as if they stole your TV or sofa.There’s no consideration for the fact that your dog or cat is a living, breathing animal and a much beloved member of the family.If the thieves are caught, although unlikely in these days of police cuts, the monetary value of the pet is the only consideration when it comes to sentencing.This is bonkers. You simply cannot put a price on your pet.So I am delighted that a campaign to change the law is gaining momentum.What all concerned dog and cat lovers want is higher sentencing for the theft of our animals and to reclassify stealing a pet as a crime in its own right.Hopefully this would act as a deterrent to pet theft, something alarmingly on the increase.One of those who passionately wants the law to change is Sir Bruce Forsyth’s daughter Debbie Matthews.Back in 2006, both her dogs were stolen from her car.She appeared on GMTV with her dad to make a heartfelt plea begging for the return of Yorkshire terriers Gizmo and Widget.Thankfully, within hours of appearing on the show, people who had bought the dogs in good faith at a market realised they were stolen from Debbie and she was emotionally reunited with them.It was a traumatic time for the whole family and Debbie knows she was incredibly lucky her story had a happy ending.So many owners never see their pets again and are left with endless worries about their fate.If you want to help change the law, do sign the pet theft petition at petition.parliament.uk/petitions/212174 and make your voice heard.IT was impossible to take the p*** out of Peter Stringfellow, because he would be first to make fun of himself.He knew his habit of wearing tiny thongs made him look daft, and was well aware that his mullet haircut was old-fashioned and silly and that people considered him to be a bit naff.When he was pilloried, he just gave one of his big guffaws and carried on enjoying himself.Peter was funny, kind-hearted and generous to a fault.He bore his illness with great stoicism and bravery and will be sadly missed.POLDARK returns to our screens tomorrow night amid a row over what many in Scotland refer to as “taps aff”.This occurs on those wonderful, albeit rare, occasions when the sunshine beams warmly north of the border and allows chaps to remove their cagoules, sweatshirts, woolly jumpers and tops.Aidan Turner, who plays Captain Poldark, is probably one of the most famous exponents of “taps aff” in recent times, ever since those sweaty scything scenes in his first series.It turns out that it was Aidan’s idea to take off his cambric shirt and scythe away in those tight breeches.But it’s caused the mother of all rows, with admiring women being accused of “objectifying” the bold captain.I have thoughtfully reproduced an image of a topless Aidan so you can make up your own minds.You will either think this photograph adds to the joy of a Saturday or be horrified by the sexualisation of the poor, unfortunate man.Frankly, I’m happy to wallow in this fantastic view and look forward to tomorrow, BBC1, 9pm, when I can enjoy some cracking writing, proper acting and top production values.Those “taps aff” scenes only enhance the pleasure of Poldark and, don’t forget, no one forced Aidan to show his pert nipples.He knows full well he’s a handsome fella and it was all his choice, for which we are truly grateful.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I believe the horrifying murder of soldier Lee Rigby in May 2013 was a turning point.As the founder of Tell MAMA, I found myself in the unenviable position of having to mobilise my tiny team at the time to help the growing number of people being targeted at a street and online level by anti-Muslim hatred.The backlash was significant, given the targeting of a young soldier minding his own business and the brutal manner of the terrorist attack.In the aftermath, Ukrainian neo-Nazi Pavlo Lapshyn placed three bombs in mosques in Wolverhampton, Walsall and Tipton — two months after murdering Mohammed Saleem, a grandfather walking back home from his mosque in Birmingham.The past five years have seen no let-up in the UK.People acting alone and small insular cells of men, and increasingly women, have carried out attacks at London Bridge, in Manchester, Finsbury Park and Westminster Bridge.And let us not ­forget the multiple terrorist attacks on 7/7 and the attempted attacks on civilians on 21/7.Our country has had its fair share of local and national triggers for potential tensions, but the unique nature of British society has meant we have not seen riots on our streets, such as those in Oldham in 2001 — and this is something to be ­celebrated.Terrorist trigger points have clearly led to rises in anti-Muslim hate incidents and there have been points where our country has been under ­significant pressure.After 7/7 and the significant loss of life that took place then, Britain was on a heightened state of alert as another plot failed to deliver its deadly cargo and the police and security services were in a race to find members of that terror cell.Dubbed 21/7, the country was shaken, ­communities were fearful and there was a crackle in the air as some people aired their frustrations openly.Even after all of this, we as communities held together.There is therefore something unique in our country which means community violence has not broken out, whereas in other European ­countries there have been street clashes and the widespread intimidation of minority communities.That “uniqueness” in our country is based on the old tradition that is ingrained in our society — that of “live and let live”, and “fair play”.It also underscores that the space for the accommodation of ideas and new populations has been a fundamental and historic part of our country though today, with resource pressures, there are limits.However, this is not only one-way traffic, and a sense of pride and identity within groups such as Britain’s Muslims has shown itself time and time again.It is therefore important to note that while ­younger citizens are less proud to be English, poll after poll has shown that Muslims living here are more ­patriotic than the average Brit.This means many Muslims do feel pride in a country where they can worship freely, be who they want to be and have the ability to practice their faith how they want to.We also have to say what is patently obvious, that Muslims have more freedoms in the United Kingdom compared to their counterparts in ­mainland Europe, where veil bans, harassment and chronic unemployment blight Muslim and other minority communities.It is this freedom to worship without fear, allied to the British sense of fair play, that makes us a place many countries look up to.The fact is our futures are inter-related and will continue to be as people travel more and ­connect through social media.It also means many of our preconceptions of different communities will change over time.This can be a force for good, though hand-in-hand with this must be that there are a unique set of values in our country.They have held us together in the darkest moments and have strengthened our resolve to stand together. Of this, we can always be proud.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Hewill demand Britain continues to accept freedom of movement in exchange for unfettered access to Europe’s single market. But the Migration Watch think tank warned Mrs May that failure to curb EU migration after Brexit would destroy the Tory party’s credibility with voters.Its boss Lord Green said: “Controlling our borders must mean reducing immigration or it is pointless. 62% want to see a reduction in low skilled migration while 80% of EU migrants over the last ten years have been lower skilled. So any new arrangements must involve a sharp cut in immigration from the EU or the credibility of the Conservative government will be in shreds.”And Jacob Rees-Mogg, leader of the powerful backbench European Research Group of Tory MPs, said the ambush would only backfire on the EU. He told The Sun: “If Brussels wants to do that it fails to realise why we voted to leave in the first place - it’s all about taking back control.“Clever ambushes are are yesterday’s story for the European Commission and they need to stop thinking along those lines. Their failure to do so is why Italy is unhappy, Hungary and so on. It’s a mindset that is actually turning nations against the European Union.”Meanwhile on Wednesday Home Secretary Sajid Javid is expected to announce the Government’s plans for the status of EU migrants already living in the UK. He has torn up plans by his predecessor Amber Rudd to offer preferential treatment to EU citizens after Brexit.Yesterday Labour frontbencher Andy McDonald said immigration could actually go up after Brexit. The shadow transport secretary Andy McDonald said if businesses wanted more people to be allowed into Britain then the Government should allow that. His comments were described by one Tory MP as a “kick in the teeth for Brexit voters”.And his shadow cabinet colleague Sir Keir Starmer also hinted Labour is getting ready to U-turn on their pledge to end free movement. Mr McDonald told Pienaar’s Politics on BBC Radio 5 Live: “Your immigration levels should be consistent with the needs of your economy.

The whole thing is keeping Theresa May so busy that she hasnt even had time to check in to this years Love Island villa at all.As the EU Withdrawal Bill returns to the House of Commons for a series of knife-edge votes this week, weve got some help for the Love Island ladies to understand whats really going on in our fight to quit the EU...In short, Hayley, Britain is leaving the European Union.In a historic vote in 2016 Brits voted to throw off the shackles of Brussels and go it alone, taking back control of our money, borders and laws.We officially kicked off the process in March 2017, and Theresa May now has less than a year to negotiate with the EU just how were going to leave, and whats happening next.But, to be honest, its not going all that well for her lately.Last week her Brexit secretary David Davis almost quit over controversial plans for Northern Ireland, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson started mouthing off about the Government at a private dinner and he even said that Donald Trump could get a better deal with the EU.Not ideal. Mrs May needs the next few days to go a bit smoother or she will face more calls to kick her out and replace her with someone new.The EU Withdrawal Bill is absolutely vital to make sure Britain is ready for Brexit.It will transfer all existing EU laws into British law, so there are no gaps after we finally quit the bloc.In essence, its proof to the European Union that we really are leaving and were getting on with it.So come on, lets start talking trade!And if Brussels think the PM is being dictated to by her own MPs it will make Britain look weak at the negotiating table, where were fighting for a decent trade deal.Theresa May needs to win to show shes under control.We must be in a strong position to get what we want - and these votes could bind the PMs hands completely.So far its gone through the House of Commons and passed through to the Lords with just one change to it.Now meddling peers have slapped on a whopping 15 changes to it, which if passed would tell Mrs May what to do in Brussels.These have nothing to do with the EU Bill itself - all this is about is putting EU laws into Britains books.Lords - many of whom voted to Remain - want to water the Bill down and change it to how they want.And if they could, many of them would opt to keep us in the EU after all.Peers in the upper chamber have changed Mrs Mays Bill several times which is causing her huge problems.The main one is on the customs union - which would force the Government to negotiate with the EU to keep Britain in the customs union after Brexit.That would help trade flow freely between the EU and the UK - but would also stop Britain striking new trade deals with the rest of the world, removing one of Brexit’s main advantages.Although it would not necessarily keep the UK in the customs union, it would make that outcome much more likely.Theres a chance this one could pass, leaving Mrs May weak and defeated.Perhaps the most damaging amendment for the Government’s Brexit plan is a motion to propel Britain into the European Economic Area.The EEA - which includes Norway and Iceland - incorporates the single market, so joining it would force us to continue free movement of people and keep most European laws. That wont fly with most Leavers.Some of the other changes include scrapping Brexit Day altogether (when we will finally exit the bloc), hanging on to EU rights, keeping our borders open to refugees and giving MPs the power to decide what happens if they vote down her final Brexit deal.The Government has also accepted several amendments to the Bill - including that the courts should refer to European Court of Justice judgements when relevant and clarifying the status of retained EU laws after exit dayThe Bill comes back for two days to the House of Commons tomorrow and Wednesday.They are set to have six hours to debate the changes and then vote on whether to accept or reject them.By tomorrow night well know whether these changes have been made.Most of them Mrs May is set to win - as they do have a majority in the House of Commons with the help of her coalition pals - the DUP.Their 10 MPs - who have promised to support her - will secure the votes needed for most of them to pass.But some Tory rebels are threatening to go to the other side and vote against her on some of the changes - like the ones on a vote on our Brexit deal, and the customs union plans.These ones are likely to be much, much closer, and will cause real problems if they are lost.The Government has already put down a number of concessions to plead with the MPs to come back onside, but will it work? Who knows.At the end of last year 11 Tories voted against the PM and issued a damning defeat on her.Its likely the same group could cause trouble again.They include leading Remainers Nicky Morgan, Anna Soubry and Dominic Grieve, who all want the PM to compromise more.But leading rebel Ken Clarke yesterday admitted that the threat of rebellions was melting away because Tory MPs feared that inflicting government defeats this week would topple Mrs May after the turbulence of last week.Gosh, if only it were that easy.Some of these MPs are incredibly stubborn and think the changes to the Brexit Bill are more important than voting with their own leader and respecting the result of the referendum.Tonight the PM will issue a rallying cry to all Tory MPs to show the public they will deliver on Brexit ahead of the crunch votes tomorrow.She will make a crucial address to a meeting of all 316 Tory MPs in a last ditch bid to stave off a damaging rebellion over the Government’s Brexit plans.Yes, Brexit is still happening, no matter what happens at the end of these votes. Sorry, not sorry, Remainers!But they could totally change what Brexit looks like, and it could mean an utter betrayal of the result for millions of Leave-backers who wanted us to take back control.Staying inside a form of a customs union could mean having to accept thousands more people coming freely into Britain with no checks.Two years after the referendum, plenty of people are unhappy that ministers are STILL squabbling over the ins and outs of what our position is.After these crunch votes are done, some are warning shell face a leadership challenge and another top Tory will swoop in to take her place.If she loses them, a new Prime Minister could come sooner than you might think."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/NINTCHDBPICT000412519451.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"kate middleton polo pitch star player kiss","story":"But pictures taken from a different angle at the event in Gloucestershire on Sunday reveal Kate was running to give one of the star players a kiss - and its not who you think it is.Kate attended the Maserati Royal Charity Polo Trophy at Beaufort Polo Club with Prince George and Princess Charlotte to cheer on the Duke of Cambridge as he played in the match on Sunday June 10.In the photos, Kate can be seen sprinting from the grass bank where she had been sitting with her children and towards the marquees.While it was previously thought she was running with Prince George and Princess Charlotte, the photos show Kate was running towards Malcolm Borwick, Prince Williams team mate for the match.After the little princess joins her, Kate turns to Malcolm, who has played for England, and gives him an air-kiss on both sides of his cheek and a warm hug.Malcolm was wearing No3 for the Maserati team, while Prince William played as No4.The pair have previously played together at the 2017 Maserati Royal Charity Polo Trophy match, and the former England international is friends with both Prince William and Prince Harry.In May last year, Malcolm told The Sun he has offered to teach Meghan Markle how to play polo after she cheered on Harry while he played in Ascot.He told The Sun: “I met Meghan the other day for the first time - she’s a really, really nice person.“She’s not a polo player, but she’s very keen to learn and I’ve offered to teach her.”Also at Sundays match, playful Prince George took aim with a toy gun as he and sister Charlotte — gripped by watchful mum Kate — enjoyed a day in the sun watching dad William play polo.Adorable Princess Charlotte, 3, was seen doing rolly-pollies as she showed off to her giggling mum — and tearing across the fields in her bare feet after her older brother.She was also pictured being cuddled by Kate as the family relaxed on the sidelines.Earlier Kate, 36, comforted tearful George as he became overwhelmed with excitement — but the young prince was soon mucking about once again.The match was all in aid of two charities close to the princes heart — the Royal Marsden Hopsital, which the Duke supports as president, and homeless charity Centrepoint, of which he is patron.Sundays match was part of a series of charitable polo matches that the Duke and Prince Harry will play in this summer.The two brothers have taken part in polo fixtures in support of their charities since 2007, and have continued each year since, raising over £11 million for charitable causes to date."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/NINTCHDBPICT0004100417457.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960\" height=\"1960","title":"kim jong un intelligence files school boy switzerland","story":"The analysis carried out for America and South Korea paints a picture of a young Kim which bears striking similarities with his 36-year-old self.A source who spoke to new-site Axios said: “The picture that emerged from literally dozens of interviews bears a striking similarity with the man he has emerged into today,“Gluttonous, prone to fits of anger and swaggering around his classmates. “Kim Jong-un was an [inattentive] student but demanded slavish loyalty from other children in his wake.”The findings came about after compiling and analysing numerous interviews with teachers, students and others who knew him at his prestigious Liebefeld-Steinhölzli public school in Koeniz, south of Bern.Kim attended from the age of 11 in 1994 and stayed there until 1997.The source even alleged young Kim was something of a hooligan who “frequently” hit other students, didn’t do well in school and was often distracted.But chillingly after games the North Korean would reportedly declare: “Someday you will all remember me.”The alleged revelations comes as the two leaders, both who have very strong personalities, meet in Singapore in a bid to avert war breaking in the Korean peninsula over Kim’s nuclear missile programme.

But if the Lords amendments are allowed to stand, that negotiating position will be undermined.”Government minister Robert Buckland, who is in charge of the bill, added: “We all hang together or we all hang separately”.Downing Street had feared rebel Tories would unite with Labour today to enforce a symbolic victory with warm words about keeping the UK in a customs union.But the Europhiles promised to vote with the government instead last night when it agreed to instead report back to the Commons on the progress made on “a customs arrangement”.MPs signing the new amendment include Brexit-backers Jacob Rees-Mogg, Sir Bill Cash and Sir Benard Jenkin and former-Remainers Nicky Morgan, Stephen Hammond and Sir Oliver Letwin.Brexiteers’ leader Jacob Rees-Mogg welcomed the amendment as part of a “new collegiate spirit” in the party.But rebel leader Ms Morgan said the new customs amendment would “buy time” for Tories who still want to stay in the Customs Union.In a second compromise with Tory rebels, ministers have also pledged to enshrine in law today a meaningful vote for MPs on the final Brexit deal before the European Parliament validates it.In exchange, the rebel will agree to sink another powerful Lords amendment – pushed through by former Tory Cabinet minister Lord Hailsham - that would have seen control for the talks with Brussels handed over to Parliament.It emerged last night that the government could still suffer a devastating defeat today on another Lords amendment, despite theSix Tory rebels are still unhappy with ministers’ offer on a meaningful vote on the final deal, and are demanding more powers forBut No10 have insisted that Brexiteer MPs will not allow the PM to go any further on letting the Commons and Lords alter the eventual deal’s shape.The stand off could go right down to the wire when MPs vote on Lord Hailsham’s amendment at around 4pm today.The six are Ken Clarke, Dominic Grieve, Anna Soubry, Heidi Allen, Antoinette Sandbach and Sarah Wollaston are holding out.They are insisting that Parliament must be able to dictate what happens next if Mrs May’s deal is voted down, meaning No10 would have lost control of the Brexit negotiation and Brussels will be effectively dealing with MPs from then onwards.If passed today, it would even have given the Commons and Lords the right to halt Brexit altogether.In a more lighthearted moment during the PM’s 1922 meeting, senior Tory backbencher Keith Simpson suggested Mrs May shoot warring Cabinet Ministers Boris Johnson and Philip Hammond.The backbencher urged the PM to host a paint-balling fight to settle Cabinet differences at the Chequers away day next month.And he joked that former Army Officer and Tory MP Johnny Mercer “could provide you with some live ammunition if you want it.”A grinning PM thanked the MP “for his helpful suggestion.”As many as 12 pro-Brexit Labour MPs are also thinking about abstaining today to help the government’s numbers.Labour Brexit Secretary Keir Starmer last night urged MPs to come out in force against the Government on both the customs union and meaningful vote because of “wavering” by would-be Tory rebels.He told MPs he was concerned about reports Tory rebels may now fall away as there were only likely to be “two crunch votes”.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The most dangerous would be a mortal blow to the Government’s negotiating hand and could trigger a new election.Another one on Wednesday would be a giant step towards shackling ourselves forever inside an EU customs union, without any power over its decisions. That’s the worst possible Brexit, a catastrophe.Monday nights fudge between the two wings of the Tory party is still a risk — and merely postpones an inevitable showdown next month.In the end MPs must have faith in our great country, our extraordinary talent and our ability to thrive outside the EU. And, if they respect the democracy that has put them where they are, they must trust the decision we took.Tuesdays “meaningful vote” amendment, if passed, would wreck the Government’s negotiating position in Brussels. That is already weak enough... Theresa May has made far too many compromises and is doing far too little to prepare Britain for a “no deal”. But this new move would be deadly.It would enable Parliament to reject any deal we strike with Brussels and force the Government to go back and keep negotiating. It would strip Mrs May of the power to walk away.The EU could offer us a derisory and punitive deal knowing Parliament had compelled the Government to accept it in the end. It would be like haggling with a used car salesman who knows you have to pay whatever he wants.The diehard Remainers running an orchestrated, multi-million pound campaign to keep Britain in the EU are relying on this vote to upend the process. It could trigger a second referendum or an election which Corbyn’s Marxist wrecking crew could win.Tory rebels must have nothing to do with it. It is their duty to give the Government the strongest possible hand in negotiating our exit and a future trade deal.Another vote on Wednesday seeks to push us into a restrictive customs union with the EU. That would place us permanently and powerlessly under Brussels’ control — with no say over it, nor any ability to sign our own deals around the world.Free trade with America, China, India, Australia, Canada and New Zealand? Forget it.Remain-backing MPs pretend this — and staying in the single market — represent “soft Brexit”, a compromise to reflect that 48 per cent voted Remain. But they are fatal to Brexit and they know it.Either would be a far worse deal than we have had before. They are a ruse to engineer a new vote to stay in.We get that Europhile MPs hate Brexit. But they are there to represent their voters, not advance personal agendas.For some Tories and many Labour MPs the decision should be blindingly obvious: their own constituencies voted Leave. The manifestos on which they then stood for election last year promised to leave both the single market and customs union.Do they seriously believe it right to betray their voters and their own doorstep promises?Most people are too busy to follow the daily ins and outs as the Brexit debate grinds on. Outside the London political bubble, they imagine it’s done and dusted. They just want to get on with leaving. And in full.It has barely occurred to them that many politicians never accepted the result, have waged war on it relentlessly and are closer than ever to victory.Imagine the explosion of anger if that happens. If, today or next month, Tory Remainers vote with Labour’s opportunists to defy the biggest democratic mandate in British history. If MPs, having approved the EU Withdrawal Bill once already, back wrecking amendments drafted by unelected peers bent on destroying Brexit.That rage won’t even be limited to Leavers. Many Remainers also consider it vital to fulfil the result of the vote in full. They know staying in the single market or customs union is not leaving. It is a suicidal, half-baked Brexit.Why would anyone trust our democracy again if we took such a course, in defiance of the referendum result?The Sun understands the Tory rebels’ fears for the economy and jobs post-Brexit. We believe we may well be in for a rocky ride short-term, before the longer-term benefits pan out.But everyone should read the authoritative view from ex-Aussie Prime Minister Tony Abbott — who initially backed Remain but is brimming with confidence over what he considers a golden opportunity for this country, even if we never strike any deal with Brussels.The Sun understands, too, the worries many Remainers have that Britain could become less ­liberal, less open and more prejudiced against foreign migrants after Brexit. We whole-heartedly believe that’s unfounded.Brits are becoming MORE welcoming, secure now in the knowledge we are at last about to get the same control over numbers every non-EU country enjoys.On these two ​vital days for Brexit — and further votes next month — The Sun says this to backbench Tories: Have faith in the people of Britain.They made the right decision on Brexit and they will make it work... if you allow your Government to give them the chance.THE most Eurosceptic people in Britain are calling on Theresa May to make good on her promise that Brexit means Brexit.The Lincolnshire town’s Tory MP Matt Warman was a Remainer but now advocates a “clean break” from Europe in agreement with 74.9 per cent of his constituents.Office worker Beverly Iles, 67, said: “We should have come straight out. We shouldn’t be still messing about with all this.”Retired council worker Brian Isam, 75, said: “We don’t need soft Brexit. We didn’t pay Europe a penny when we went in and we should not pay them a penny to get out.”THE people of Hull want Theresa May to wave goodbye to the Eurocrats now.In the East Yorkshire city, the leave vote was 68 per cent, although Labour MP Karl Turner was a Remainer.Happy Cakes manager Debbie Scaife, 56, said uncertainty had driven up the price of ingredients.She added: “Mrs May, I call on you to do this for us now.“The British public voted to leave. They didn’t want five years of hell.”Retailer Vicky Paddey, 37, said: “I voted for Brexit and I’m proud to say that — it was what people wanted then and they still want it now. If we end up with a soft Brexit, a lot of these shops in this city centre will not survive it.”IN the North East, some impatient voters are calling for dithering Mrs May to go.Voters in Gateshead went 56.8 per cent in favour of leaving in 2016, against the wishes of Labour MP Ian Mearns.Florist Dawn Athey, 41, said: “I think Theresa May should resign.“She’s not the person I thought she was going to be.“I think she’s scared of being the Prime Minister who’s going to take us out of the EU.”And Jude Ditchburn, 51, from Gateshead, said: “I think she is betraying the country and not doing what people want.FORMER Tory Cabinet minister Nicky Morgan is a leading Remoaner — but in her Leicestershire constituency people want to get on with Brexit.The area voted 50.1 per cent in favour of leaving the EU.Brexit backer Andrew Cooper, 56, said: “They are dragging their feet, the people have voted for this and they need to do what the people asked them to do.”Cedric Hewitt, 90, said: “I think Theresa May ought to get her finger out and get on with it. It’s what the British people wanted.”And David Greasley, 85, a former quality control engineer, said: “I voted out and simply want out.”HARD Brexit opponent and Conservative MP Anna Soubry wants Britain to be shackled with a customs union.Now, they want her party to carry out their wishes.Ray James, 82, and Elsie James, 80, said: “We think the Government are failing to get things sorted. It is taking a long, long time and no people thought it would take this long.”John Wilson, 68, said the Government was clueless on disentangling from the single market. “It has become a shambles,” he added.TOTNES MP Sarah Wollaston switched sides during the referendum campaign and became a Remainer.But she is out of step with her Devon constituency, where 53.9 per cent voted in favour of leaving the EU.Christine Williams, 64, said she was disappointed with Dr Wollaston.“I don’t know if I can now vote for her in the next election,” she added.Butcher Chris McCabe, 70, blamed Theresa May for the slow progress.He said: “This is like the Champions League final and we are at half-time.“She still has a chance but she needs to get her team in order so they can go back out and win this.”WHILE the capital was the heartland of Remain, in Bromley, South London, there was a paper-thin majority of 50.6 per cent in favour of staying in the EU. Tory MP Bob Neill is a Remainer.Gardener David Alden, 52, said: “It’s been dragged out for a reason. They know how to grind people down and tire them out. The elites want one thing and try any way to get it. They want to stop Brexit.”Retired software developer Steve Johnson, 58, said: “They are trying to come up with these fudges — ways to try to renege on the will of the people without outwardly doing so.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Endangered not only by parliamentarians who never really accepted the referendum result, but by the Government’s negotiating approach, which risks delivering an exit from the EU which fails to deliver the control Britons voted for.When, on June 23, 2016, 17.4million people went to the polls to vote for Britain to chart a new course for itself outside of the European Union, they would never have imagined that, almost two years on, Parliament would still be debating whether to keep this country as — essentially — a non-voting member of the EU.Or that their government would still not have set out a detailed blueprint for this country’s relationship with the EU once we have left. So what has gone wrong and who is to blame?There are TWO BASIC RULES of negotiation. Know what you want and do not go into a negotiation unless you are prepared to walk away.Theresa May’s government has FAILED BOTH OF THESE TESTS.Even now, the Government can not say what it wants Britain’s customs arrangements with the EU to be after Brexit. Instead, we’ll have to wait for two working groups to report back before the Cabinet makes up its mind.This failure to know what it is trying to achieve has hobbled Britain in these negotiations — and handed the initiative to the hardliners in the European Commission. Mrs May must take the blame for this.She should never have triggered Article 50, the two-year process for leaving the EU, until she had a clear and precise idea of what she wanted the exit deal to look like.It has also meant that, in the absence of clear UK aims, those conducting the negotiations have treated the whole thing as a damage-limitation exercise.As the Brexit Secretary David Davis, who has been sidelined in the talks in favour of the civil servant Olly Robbins, complains in private, the civil service is not suited to negotiating.It struggles to deal with European chief negotiator Michel Barnier’s take-it-or-leave-it tactics.But the biggest mistake has been the failure to rigorously prepare for no deal. Mrs May used to emphasise that “no deal is better than a bad deal”.But she has never followed through on that rhetoric. There has been no big national effort to get this country as ready as it could be to walk away from the talks.There is plenty of blame to go round for this. The Treasury — aided by the Chancellor Philip Hammond — has refused to make planning for no deal a priority.Why? Because it feared if there was a plan for no deal, the Brexiteers would end up using it. Better, it thought, to make minimal preparations for it to ensure the UK stayed at the negotiating table.But this got it ALL WRONG. The best way to avoid no deal was to plan for it. For WEAKNESS IS PROVOCATIVE. The EU looks at how unready Britain is to walk away and turns the screw.Would Michel Barnier’s team feel free to be so dismissive about Britain’s proposals if they thought we might simply walk out of the talks, taking our £39billion divorce payment with us?It is worth remembering that a report from the House of Lords, hardly a hotbed of Brexiteer sentiment, concluded that Britain was under no legal obligation to pay ANYTHING AT ALL to the EU on leaving.The Government risks being left with the most unpalatable of choices: No deal or stay in a customs union with the EU and the European Economic Area, leaving Britain as, effectively, a non-voting member of the EU.Senior EU figures think they can do this because they do not see any serious attempt by the UK to properly prepare for no deal.If this country had made preparations for going it alone that were so big they were visible from the other side of the Channel, the EU would be engaging in the negotiations in a far more constructive manner and Britain would be on course to secure a much better deal.Leave-supporting Cabinet ministers can not escape their share of the blame for this, either.They should have been far more assertive and pushed for serious no deal planning.They should have insisted that Cabinet was updated every fortnight on Britain’s preparedness to walk away without a deal.They should have demanded that the Government had serious and credible contingency plans to deal with disruption to cross-Channel trade. They should have told Mrs May they would resign if Hammond would not provide the funds necessary to make no deal planning a reality.But there is, as the minutes of the Brexit Inner Cabinet’s most recent meeting make clear, another reason why “EU ministers had no fear of no deal”.They “observed the UK Parliament and prominent Remainers, who had formed a cross-party alliance against Brexit, and thought there was no chance of no deal”.Too many MPs voted for a referendum on our EU membership, then were not prepared to genuinely accept the result when they lost. Too many Tories were prepared to stand at last year’s General Election on a manifesto of leaving the single market and the customs union that they were not actually committed to. That is not being straight with the voters.One of the other reasons EU ministers are not worried about no deal is Mrs May’s loss of the Tory majority in that snap election.Ever since Britain voted for Brexit, the EU has feared the emergence of an alternative economic model on its doorstep.It worried Britain might become a hyper-competitive, low-tax economy 26 miles off its coastline.They expected that Britain would respond to no deal by slashing taxes and regulation to make up for the failure to strike a trade deal with the EU. This gave the EU an incentive to come to an agreement with us.But when the Tory majority disappeared, so did this fear. It is clear this hung parliament does not have the stomach for such a course.Indeed, Mr Hammond said in Germany in January that we would change our “economic model” if we could not get a good trade deal, then took that threat off the table in a visit to France the month after the election. He, unhelpfully, told the French press we would keep up the European economic model even after Brexit.The next big British mistake has been its handling of the Irish border issue. The history of Northern Ireland meant this subject needed to be treated with care. A return to every vehicle being stopped would clearly have been a recipe for trouble.But Britain should never have agreed in December that no new physical infrastructure at the border meant there could not even be number plate recognition cameras.The decision to rule these out has made it far harder to use technology to try to solve the border issues and has been grist to the mill of those who want to use Northern Ireland as a device to keep the whole of the UK in a customs union and “high alignment” with the EU and unable to strike comprehensive free-trade deals with other countries.The Government now finds itself urging the EU to accept a UK-wide “backstop” in an attempt to try to get beyond the Irish border issue knowing that the EU will break off trade talks before they have really begun if there is not progress on this.This backstop, though, is not a good deal for the UK. It would see Britain stuck in a customs union with the EU and following all of Brussels’ rules on goods, yet with no say in making them. It would provide a trade solution for goods, where the EU sells £135billion more to us than we do to them, but not for services, where we sell £92billion more to them.In these circumstances, would the EU really be rushing to complete a trade deal with us? Of course not. It would be in their interest to drag things out, knowing that the backstop would remain in place.If the House of Commons votes for the House of Lords amendment to keep Britain in a customs union with the EU or to take no deal off the table, it will weaken Britain’s negotiating position still further.It will make it almost inevitable that the only deal Brussels is prepared to offer Britain would leave this country as, essentially, a non-voting member of the EU.The Government has made many mistakes in its handling of these negotiations. But this is no excuse for Parliament to compound these errors.MPs should reject these amendments today and the House of Lords should respect the will of the elected House of Commons when the bill returns to it.Then, the Government should get its act together.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

They say the country will become a bureaucratic basket case.That is baffling news for the port workers in Felixstowe.Their system is so efficient that some EU containers, arriving on non-EU ships go through the processing system anyway as it is so painless.Shipping journalist Dean Cable explains: “Some politicians say leaving the EU will be bad for us but it doesn’t have to be and Felixstowe proves that.“Goods come and go without fuss, whether they are from inside the EU or not.”No wonder Brexit naysayers never mention this place when they talk about Britain’s post-Brexit trading arrangements.They would prefer you to think that if we left the customs union, lorries at Dover and Folkestone will be stuck in queues 30 miles long.Our haulage industry will grind to a halt, they claim, and Britain will be gripped by food shortages.But anyone who visits the port of Felixstowe will quickly realise that is utter baloney.For a start, it deals with 25 times more trade than the entire Irish border — which handles £3billion a year — and does so without a hitch.Across the 8,360-acre site on Friday afternoon, things are busy, but calm — without a customs officer in sight.Down at the docks, the vast vessel Marie Maersk, newly arrived from Sri Lanka, was being unloaded by crane, with no complicated paperwork.Dean tells me that it is the 11th largest container ship in the world, capable of holding 18,270 containers. All have come from outside of the customs union but will be on the road within the hour.Felixstowe is proof that leaving the customs union will not be the logistical disaster that some warn it could be.Figures show an estimated 98 per cent of non-EU crates pass through the port of Felixstowe as quickly and easily as goods that arrive from within the EU.This is because the non-EU goods have cleared customs before they even reach Britain thanks to a digital cargo-tracking system called Destin8.Tax officials at HMRC monitor every single non-EU container ship using the system, working out the tariffs and duty owed. Intelligence gathering and data analysis helps identify 80,000 of the four million containers to be searched and monitored for any infringements.People who work in the freight industry are adamant that Felixstowe’s systems can be adapted for Ireland.They say no hard border would need to be built and trade can continue as before.And it will not cost billions of pounds nor take years because everything is digital.Jason Flower is managing director of KWL Logistics and chairman of the Felixstowe Port Users’ Association, an independent trade body which represents 115 warehouse keepers, shipping lines and hauliers — some with business interests in Northern Ireland.Although he voted Remain, he said: “Brexit will work. It’s got to work. The public voted out. Get on with it.”Asked whether there is any need for a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, he says: “Not with documentation nowadays. All they care about is the movement of the cargo and the duties and taxes involved. I don’t see the need for a hard border because everything is digital now.”In Felixstowe, adding EU trade to the Destin8 system could be achieved in a matter of minutes. Alan Long, chief executive of MCP, the company behind Destin8, says: “It would probably involve a few extra keystrokes.”No wonder people in the town of Felixstowe are baffled by Remainers’ obsession with the hard border.“My husband’s a crane driver at the docks. I’m sure talk of a hard border is nonsense.”Prominent Brexiteer and Labour MP Kate Hoey, who is from Northern Ireland, told The Sun: “All this talk of creating a border is ridiculous. There is already a border. The Irish Republic has a different currency, different corporation tax and excise duties. But it isn’t an infrastructure border.“The only people talking about creating a trade border are either Remain politicians trying to undermine Brexit or Sinn Fein politicians using Brexit as an excuse to try to split Northern Ireland from Great Britain.” Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Wonsan is one of several special economic zones in North Korea. It\u0027s a model similar to the one pioneered by China when it opened up in the late 1970s. In theory, there are several benefits.\"North Korea could conduct special policies and give all kinds of privileges to foreign companies to do business in that area,\" Prof Cheng said.\"Also, the special economic zones could help isolate this area from the other part of North Korea so North Korea could go ahead with some special arrangement with foreign economies.\"But reality - and North Korea\u0027s pursuit of the nuclear part of the Byungjin line - got in the way of the plan. \"You see in the past years North Korea has set up more than 20 special economic areas but they\u0027ve basically failed because of international sanctions - foreign companies aren\u0027t allowed to invest in the country.\"That\u0027s what Mr Kim wants from the summit: not economic aid from the US (North Korean statements have been scathing about that idea) but the opportunity to attract foreign investment. That requires sanctions being lifted.Dandong is a Chinese city on the China-North Korea border on the other side of the Yalu River is Sinuiju, another North Korean special economic zone. A single-lane bridge connects the two countries. Here we saw an uneven flow of trucks, trains and tourist make the journey across.Further along the river, there\u0027s an impressive new bridge. It was completed in 2015. Well, nearly. The North Korean side ends in a field, with no connection to a road. Dandong is primed for North Korean trade but it\u0027s currently on pause. We visited the main fish market, which used to stock plenty of North Korean seafood. Sanctions imposed in 2017 put an end to that, although China is said to have relaxed the ban recently.

As things stand, Brexit will come into force at the end of March 2019.  But it could be 2022 before you notice any difference - and the path to the door is littered with obstacles. Some believe Brexit can be stopped. Others fear it could bring down the Government. Theresa May has only a few months to strike a deal.  She has to get the EU Withdrawal bill through, negotiate the future with Brussels, get her Cabinet to agree and keep the peace in the Tory Party.  Meanwhile the whole saga is so fiendishly complicated it risks leaving you in the dark. So here is your guide to what is going to happen, what the key issues mean, and the dangers that lie ahead.  Brexit is Britain\u0027s exit from the European Union. The UK voted 52%-48% in 2016 to leave the 28-nation body after almost 50 years. That means leaving its single market and customs union (see below), cutting legal ties, ending the automatic right for EU citizens to move to Britain, and reducing or ending budget payments to Brussels. What are Hard Brexit and Soft Brexit? Hard Brexit means cutting major ties with the EU and striking out alone, even if it damages the economy. This is backed by a large number of Tory MPs and UKIP. Soft Brexit means sticking as close to EU rules as possible, even if it means giving up freedom and independence. This is backed by a large number of Labour MPs, and a few Tory rebels. The Cabinet and the Tory party are split and Theresa May is trying to go for something in between to please everyone. So is Jeremy Corbyn. When does Brexit happen and when is the deadline?  Britain officially leaves the EU at 11pm on 29 March 2019. However a transition period has been agreed, which means almost all current rules continue until New Year\u0027s Eve 2020. Then there is also a customs \u0027backstop\u0027 (see below) which could continue EU rules into 2021, or even 2022. However, the deadline to agree the main deal is around October 2018, because it needs time to be agreed by MPs and the European Parliament. What is the divorce bill?  Britain\u0027s Brexit \u0027divorce bill\u0027 - the amount it\u0027ll pay after March 2019 - was finally revealed some 534 days after the country voted to leave the EU. Downing Street said the figure would be 40 to 45billion Euros - or between \u0026pound35billion and \u0026pound39billion. The huge sum came despite Boris Johnson previously accusing the EU of extortion and claiming they could go whistle. Brexiteers promised to win back \u0026pound350million a week for the NHS.  However, the \u0026pound350million was never going to come back in full because large amounts of it never actually went to Brussels in the first place. What is the transition period?  Britain has secured a \u0027transition period\u0027 to achieve a smooth Brexit and give businesses certainty. This will give us time to prepare for life outside the EU, such as setting up new customs systems and agencies. But it means Britain has to continue to accept EU rules, including freedom of movement (EU immigration), and European Court of Justice jurisdiction. Britain and Brussels agreed the transition in December 2017. The key details are explained below.  Britain will get a Brexit transition period to 31 December 2020, in which time it follows all EU rules without getting any vote on them, has to pay in full to the EU Budget, and free movement continues. This is embarrassing for Brexiteers who said Britain must not be a vassal state. But it ensures there\u0027s no sudden cliff-edge on 29 March 2019 when Brexit begins A \u0027backstop\u0027 that could keep Northern Ireland in the EU Customs territory must stay in the legal text - weeks after Theresa May said no UK Prime Minister could ever accept it. This would spark fury a it would create a division between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. The exact wording and detail of the backstop, though, hasn\u0027t been agreed. This fudge ensured the rest of the deal could be completed in time Britain will be able to sign and ratify trade deals with non-EU countries during the transition period, a major win for Brexiteers. They would come in to force when the transition ends in December 2020 Britain\u0027s fishing rights will still be set by Brussels during the transition period - the UK will only be \u0027consulted\u0027. This is a huge blow to Brexiteers who boasted they\u0027d take back control, and the Scottish Fishermen’s Federation fumed: This falls far short of an acceptable deal. Igniting a major Tory row, Scottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson said fishermen were deeply frustrated and beyond 2020, I will not support a deal which fails to deliver that full control over fish stocks and vessel access Fellow Scottish Tory Douglas Ross said: There is no spinning this as a good outcome, it would be easier to get someone to drink a pint of cold sick than try to sell this as a success EU citizens who arrive to reside or work in Britain during the transition period (to December 2020) will get the same rights and guarantees as people who arrive now. This was a key EU demand and appears to go further than what Britain last offered UK nationals who arrive to reside or work in the EU during the transition period will get the same rights, which was a key demand by Britain Gibraltar will be included in the transition deal to the extent of EU law that was applicable to it before the deal comes into force  That is the \u0026pound350million-a-week question. The Cabinet hasn’t decided. The EU said we had two choices, the Norway model or the Canadian model, but Theresa May essentially ruled both out. The Norway option (EEA) would see us paying to access the single market and accepting EU rules, including free movement of people. The Canadian-EU agreement (CETA) allows for free trade between the two countries but does not include services which is our largest sector. The Prime Minister claims she will get a bespoke deal for Britain - sometimes called \u0027Canada Plus\u0027.  This will be a free trade arrangement with frictionless borders and include financial services. In other words we want a huge array of the benefits of being in the club - but without paying a membership fee. The Norway model refers to countries being members of the European Economic Area (EEA), but not the European Union. Remaining in the EEA would grant Britain all the freedoms of the EU’s internal market - including the free movement of goods and people. Norway is an EEA member, which is why it\u0027s called the Norway model. It means the country is bound by all the EU regulations for those areas, as well as policies on employment, the environment and consumer protection. But, like Norway, it means the country does not have a say in how those policies are formulated. The Tory Cabinet is split on how closely it will align with EU rules after Brexit. Chancellor Philip Hammond wants us to stay close to the EU to avoid adding red tape and customs delays. But Brexiteers like David Davis, the Brexit Secretary, believe this will limit our ability to strike competitive trade deals with non EU countries. There is a powerful Hard Brexit wing on the Tory benches. More than 50 MPs are in the European Research Group, a pressure campaign led by influential MP Jacob Rees-Mogg. There are fewer Hard Remain MPs on the Tory benches, but they have a huge amount of power because Theresa May has a very thin majority. That means if they team up with a united, Labour they can defeat the government. How is Labour split?  Labour\u0027s leadership says Britain should have a full Customs Union with the EU (see below) but leave the EU single market (also see below). There is an angry wing of about 50 Labour MPs who say leaving the single market is the wrong decision, and often rebel against Jeremy Corbyn. Slowly, they have helped persuade the party leader to shift Labour\u0027s stance towards a \u0027soft\u0027 Brexit - hence the customs union policy. Can Brexit be stopped?  At the moment this looks unlikely.  There are campaigns with multi-million pound backing, such as Best For Britain, that are trying to halt the process as we know it. But stopping Brexit would probably need a second referendum. And we\u0027d need a big change in public opinion to make the pressure hot enough to get one.  Most polls have yet to detect any significant shift since the June 2016 referendum, with those who voted Remain still likely to vote Remain and those who voted Leave still likely to vote Leave. Both Tory Boris Johnson and Labour\u0027s John McDonnell have warned of a public backlash if there was any attempt to overturn the referendum result. Some diehard pro-EU campaigners still believe it is possible to reverse the decision - but most are focusing on trying to stop a hard Brexit. The House of Lords tried to do this through the EU (Withdrawal) Bill, where peers passed 15 amendments turning Hard Brexit to Soft. Labour has insisted it is not backing a second referendum. But several times, senior Labour figures have refused to rule out backing one in future. And many backbench MPs openly back a second referendum, calling it a \u0027People\u0027s Vote\u0027.  Britain and Brussels have agreed EU nationals can continue arriving, working and settling in the UK until December 2020. This will also apply the other way round. But it\u0027s not known what rights people will get if they arrive after that. It\u0027s been suggested EU citizens will get preferential immigration rights compared to people from the rest of the world, but that\u0027s not confirmed. What about EU citizens who live in Britain now? More than 3million EU citizens already live in the UK. They spent months not knowing what would happen, but now it\u0027s confirmed. During 2018, the Home Office will launch an application system for EU nationals seeking to remain in Britain after Brexit. Those who have been in the country for five years by the end of 2020 will be able to apply for settled status - meaning they are free to continue living and working in the UK. People who have arrived by December 31, 2020, but do not have five years\u0027 residence, will be able to apply to stay until are eligible to apply for the status. What about British citizens who live in the EU now?  More than 1million British citizens live in the other 27 EU countries. They will have the same rights to stay there as EU citizens have to stay in the UK. But it\u0027s not clear if they\u0027ll lose the right to move around and settle in any of the other 26 EU countries. Perhaps for this reason, applications for foreign citizenship - especially in Germany - have soared since the Brexit vote.  The single market is the EU\u0027s united system for trading and exchanging without any borders between 28 nations. Theresa May has insisted we will leave it after Brexit. It has many benefits, but in order to stay in it we\u0027d have to sign up for four \u0027freedoms\u0027 - the free movement of goods, services, people and capital. This would leave Britain unable to crack down on immigration. What is the customs union?  The European Union operates as a \u0027customs union\u0027. This means the 28 member states can trade freely with each other without any checks or duties on goods. It also means all the countries in the EU set the same tariffs on imports from non-EU countries. For example, car imports from the US to the EU carry a 10% tariff, while South Africa has to pay up to 16% on the oranges which it exports to the EU. Being in the customs union benefits the UK because the EU is our largest trading partner. But Theresa May wants the UK to leave the customs union, because otherwise we can\u0027t sign trade deals with other countries around the world. What are the two options for customs in future?  The government has been considering two options for customs, and has not chosen which one it\u0027ll stick with yet. Customs partnership: This would see Britain collect tariffs on all imports on behalf of the EU. If the UK tariff is lower than the EU one, then firms would be able to reclaim the difference. This is favoured by Remainers, but Brexiteers including Boris Johnson say it is crazy and will shackle us to Brussels. Maximum Facilitation (\u0027Max Fac\u0027): This would introduce more checks, but use high-tech tracking devices to monitor the flow of goods. Businesses would operate as “trusted traders” and would be able to pay any tariffs at regular intervals rather than every time they cross a border. Boris Johnson wants this, but the civil service say it will cost firms \u0026pound20bn a year in red tape. Why is Northern Ireland such a big problem?  Northern Ireland is the problem that\u0027s been holding up almost all the talks. That\u0027s because it is the UK\u0027s only land border with the EU - the Republic of Ireland. And to make things a lot trickier, Northern Ireland can\u0027t just stick a wall up along that border. It has all kinds of special statuses because of its violent history. The 1990s Good Friday Agreement finally ended the Troubles by banning border checks between Northern Ireland and the Republic. Theresa May has vowed not to bring these checks - a \u0027hard border\u0027 - back, otherwise she risks a return to violence. Yet she also wants to bring in a totally different set of customs and trading rules for the UK compared to the EU. So how does she change the rules in Northern Ireland without isolating it from the Republic? Two years after the Brexit vote, people are still struggling to work it out. What is the customs \u0027backstop\u0027 and why is everyone fighting over it? The EU has a customs union. This means all 28 member states can trade with each other without any checks or duties on goods. Theresa May has said Britain will leave this after December 2020, so she can sign trade deals with non-EU countries. But officials have warned a new UK customs system won\u0027t be ready in time. So they\u0027ve devised a \u0027backstop\u0027 - a backup plan that will carry on some EU customs rules in the UK if there\u0027s no deal. It is designed to stop ports grinding to a halt and Northern Ireland setting up border posts, which could lead to violence. Yet Brexiteers were furious because it had no set end date. In a huge Tory row, they warned it would trap Britain half-in, half-out the EU. After frantic last-minute talks, and threats to quit by Brexit Secretary David Davis, a time limit was put in - December 2021. Yet the government only expects to follow that time limit. It is not legally binding. And the EU poured cold water on it. Britain and the EU also disagree about what the backstop will do. EU plans back in March would have kept Northern Ireland aligned with Brussels customs rules, but Theresa May rejected this because it draws a border between the province and the mainland. So she drew up Britain\u0027s own backstop, which is now being put to the EU for discussion. The UK plan is a temporary customs arrangement allowing totally tariff-free trade between the EU and the whole of the UK. So the UK would carry on being in the EU Customs Union in all but name until December 2021. But the UK also wants to sign new trade deals with nations outside the EU. Britain even wants to implement parts of these deals that don\u0027t relate to the backstop. Brussels has repeatedly said this won\u0027t be possible - so the new plan is setting up for a big battle with the EU. And as time ticks on, the backstop will become less of a Plan B and more of a Plan A. It\u0027ll turn from backstop... to frontstop. The negotiations are not just about trade. The UK and the EU have to discuss data sharing and data protection, regulatory alignment and procurement rules. Decisions have to be taken on whether we remain in some EU agencies such as Europol, European Medicines Agency and the European Aviation Safety Agency. Then we have to agree police and intelligence co-operation on issues such as the European Arrest Warrant, criminal records sharing and freezing criminal assets.  Is that all?   No. The UK also has to work out trade arrangements with countries that currently have trade deals with the EU. Britain would like to roll over these trade deals during the transition period. The problem is that is not in our gift. While some of these countries have signalled they are willing to rollover the trade agreements, others such as South Korea and Chile are more reluctant. India, for instance, could demand we grant more visas in return for a deal. They have sensed an opportunity to exert some leverage on the UK. When will it come to ahead?

Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt unveiled a shake-up today after a backlash over the treatment of paediatrician Dr Hadiza Bawa-Garba.  She was found guilty of gross negligence manslaughter over the death at of six-year-old Jack Adcock after he developed sepsis in 2011.  A tribunal ruled Dr Bawa-Garba, who was working at Leicester Royal Infirmary at the time, should remain on the medical register despite her conviction. But in January the General Medical Council (GMC) had her struck off after taking the case to the High Court.  The GMC\u0027s actions angered campaigning doctors, who said issues like dangerous understaffing, IT failures and inappropriate work conditions were ignored. Now Mr Hunt has announced he has accepted the main findings of a review into the use of gross negligence manslaughter in the NHS. The review, by eminent surgeon Professor Sir Norman Williams, was launched amid fears the fear of criminal proceedings was having a chilling effect. Tory minister Mr Hunt said: When something goes tragically wrong in healthcare, the best apology to grieving families is to guarantee that no-one will experience that same heartache again. I was deeply concerned about the unintended chilling effect on clinicians\u0027 ability to learn from mistakes following recent court rulings. And the actions from this authoritative review will help us promise them that the NHS will support them to learn, rather than seek to blame.  Sir Norman\u0027s report calls for a clearer understanding of when proceedings for gross negligence manslaughter should be brought in healthcare. Medics should be reassured they would apply only in cases of very poor performance and not honest mistakes, the report says. While accepting the findings, Mr Hunt has sought to reassure patients and their families that there will be improved scrutiny of deaths in the NHS, with the roll-out of a system of medical examiners - senior doctors who will look at all patient deaths which are not referred to a coroner. Official said the changes would mean bereaved families would get more information about the circumstances of their loved ones\u0027 deaths while more data would be shared across the NHS to help prevent avoidable deaths.

They\u0027re both men with a short fuse. They\u0027re both suspicious of US media. And they both have their fingers on the nuclear button. But you\u0027d have to be pretty brave to call them both dictators. That\u0027s just what a bungling Fox News host did, however, as the pair landed in Singapore for a first-of-its-kind summit. Abby Huntsman later apologised for her comments on TV as Trump stepped out of Air Force One.  She said during Fox \u0026amp Friends: This is history, we are living history. Regardless of what happens in that meeting between the two dictators, what we are seeing right now, this is history.  Later she admitted: I do want to point out that earlier, as you know on live TV sometimes you don’t always say things perfectly. I called both President Trump and Kim Jong-un a dictator. I did not mean that, my mistake, so I apologise for that.  North Korean media today hailed a new era and Trump tweeted there was excitement in the air! in a heady build-up to the summit in Singapore. The US President is expected to be alone in a room with North Korean dictator Kim Jong-Un for up to two hours when they meet from 2am UK time on Tuesday. Only translators will be present for the meeting at a luxury Singapore resort, a US official said - suggesting there will be no aides or note-takers, a highly unusual move. Officials could then drop in for a further hour but they admitted: We will not be surprised by any scenario.

The Prime Minister finally sent off her crucial plan for a customs \u0027backstop\u0027 last Thursday after a Tory row. But in a blow to the PM, the European Commission today claimed her plan would leave a hard border in Northern Ireland - exactly what she\u0027s trying to stop. In a 12-page presentation, Eurocrats claimed Mrs May\u0027s version of the plan does not cover regulatory controls, leading to a hard border. The backstop is designed to give both sides a \u0027backup plan\u0027 for customs if there is no deal to avoid a hard border by December 2020. The EU has a customs union. This means all 28 member states can trade with each other without any checks or duties on goods. Theresa May has said Britain will leave this after December 2020, so she can sign trade deals with non-EU countries. But officials have warned a new UK customs system won\u0027t be ready in time. So they\u0027ve devised a \u0027backstop\u0027 - a backup plan that will carry on some EU customs rules in the UK if there\u0027s no deal. It is designed to stop ports grinding to a halt and Northern Ireland setting up border posts, which could lead to violence. Yet Brexiteers were furious because it had no set end date. In a huge Tory row, they warned it would trap Britain half-in, half-out the EU. After frantic last-minute talks, and threats to quit by Brexit Secretary David Davis, a time limit was put in - December 2021. Yet the government only expects to follow that time limit. It is not legally binding. And the EU poured cold water on it. Britain and the EU also disagree about what the backstop will do. EU plans back in March would have kept Northern Ireland aligned with Brussels customs rules, but Theresa May rejected this because it draws a border between the province and the mainland. So she drew up Britain\u0027s own backstop, which is now being put to the EU for discussion. The UK plan is a temporary customs arrangement allowing totally tariff-free trade between the EU and the whole of the UK. So the UK would carry on being in the EU Customs Union in all but name until December 2021. But the UK also wants to sign new trade deals with nations outside the EU. Britain even wants to implement parts of these deals that don\u0027t relate to the backstop. Brussels has repeatedly said this won\u0027t be possible - so the new plan is setting up for a big battle with the EU. And as time ticks on, the backstop will become less of a Plan B and more of a Plan A. It\u0027ll turn from backstop... to frontstop. EU chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier had already issued a withering verdict on Mrs May\u0027s proposal last week. Now today\u0027s statement, issued hours after Barnier met UK Brexit Secretary David Davis, goes further by explicitly saying it would create a hard border. The EU\u0027s negotiating team released a presentation which said Theresa May\u0027s so-called backstop leaves key questions unanswered.  Their verdict clearly seems to back Michel Barnier\u0027s original proposal, which Theresa May dismissed in February, and reject Westminster\u0027s latest effort. The chief EU negotiator\u0027s solution would see Northern Ireland remain part of the customs union, effectively creating a hard border down the Irish Sea which both the Tories and the DUP refuse to accept. However the EU would support this option describing it as a timely and workable solution. Officials claim it covers all necessary customs and regulatory controls to avoid a hard border and addresses the specific circumstances on the island of Ireland without pre-determining the future EU-UK relationship. The EU Commission insists the update leaves room for further discussion with our UK counterparts.  The UK government questions the need for any border between the Irish Republic and Northern Ireland. But EU negotiators fear Britain could exploit a back door into its single market for goods - just at the time it\u0027s getting rid of EU rules and customs regulations.  The blow today came as Mrs May makes a plea to Tory rebels ahead of a string of crunch Brexit votes in the House of Commons . One area where Britain and the EU are still split is Brussels\u0027 Galileo space programme - after Eurocrats threatened to cut the UK out. Tory Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson today lashed out at the EU\u0027s unusual and strange attempt to exclude Britain on security grounds.  He told MPs: What we are seeing with the Galileo project is frankly the European Union acting in a most unusual and strange way. Why on earth would they wish to exclude Great Britain from such an integral project for the security of the whole of the European Union and so many others? As Britain is the largest spender on defence in the European Union currently, you\u0027d be thinking they\u0027d be welcoming us into that and hoping that we\u0027d be continuing to support it. If they don\u0027t want us, we can do it independently. The UK has already made clear it will seek a refund of the \u0026pound1billion it has already invested in the project - a rival to GPS - if it withdraws from it. Meanwhile Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable said the chance of a damaging no-deal Brexit was rising.

David Richardson had been released from prison just a few weeks before he died, having developed an addiction to the drug. Despite being caught using Spice two dozen times in jail, he was released early from a four-year sentence, still in the grip of the drug. His inquest heard evidence from the probation service that ‘it was agreed that if he could remain drug free for two months, consideration would be given’ to release on licence. However, David was freed in November - weeks after the last time he was caught. Just over a month after that early release, David was dead.   In his final letter to his mother, written from prison, he described how much he was looking forward to seeing his two children, Manchester Evening News reports .  “How my little (beauties) doing. I don’t half miss them...I can’t wait for this Christmas. We’re gonna have a good’en.” The prisoner and his mother, Maureen, had a plan for Christmas Eve. “I was getting him a Santa suit,” she says. “He was going to come to my house on Christmas Eve, and then see his children to surprise them with presents.” But on December 22, 2016, David was killed. He walked up the M602 at Eccles, at night, and then on an unlit stretch of the M60 at Junction 12, Worsley, where he was hit by a car. A year-and-a-half on, Maureen is adamant that her son was too dependent on Spice and other drugs to be released from prison, and cannot understand how the authorities thought he was fit for release.  While a pupil at St John Fisher Primary in Woodhouse Park, and then St Paul’s RC High in Wythenshawe, David got his nickname - ‘Milky’ - due to his likeness, as a blond lad with round glasses, to The Milky Bar Kid in the chocolate TV advert. It was a name which stuck with him for life, until it ended, aged 36. It was even used on the order of service for his funeral. Maureen is the first to admit that for much of his adult life, her son was no angel. His transformation from the innocent, well-dressed boy, shown in his picture for his confirmation into the Roman Catholic church, to a drug-dependent, disturbed young man was tragically swift. His drug use began at the age of 16, smoking cannabis. But by his early 20s he was using heroin. He turned to theft to finance the habit, picking up more than 20 convictions. But it was Spice - the drug notorious for its dramatic effect on vulnerable users - that took him to his lowest ebb.  “I saw him in prison and I was really worried about him as he was so thin,” Maureen says. “I found out he was selling his dinners in prison and his food to get Spice. “He had to take ‘slaps’ - which is where he gets beaten up by other prisoners and then the assault gets put on Youtube. Your reward is you get Spice. “He was receiving threats at one point while in prison. Some drugs were dropped in the exercise yard by a drone. David picked them up and was supposed to be looking after them for somebody in his cell. “But, being David, it was like putting a kid in a sweet shop. He took all that Spice himself and ended up owing a drug dealer over \u0026pound1,000.” At his inquest, Maureen learnt that between April 2014 and October 2016, David was caught using Spice 24 times in prison. “The 24 times were only the times he was caught using it. I think he was using it daily,” Maureen says. Spice was designed as a synthetic alternative to cannabis. But its effects are much more dramatic than the drug it was designed to mimic. Leaving users in zombie-like catatonic states and triggering psychotic episodes, users have said it is stronger than heroin and crack cocaine. It has gained popularity with vulnerable populations - the homeless and prison inmates - in the last five years, and for a period could be legally bought in shops.  By the time it was outlawed in spring 2016, many were hooked. For someone like David - who was diagnosed in 2009 with depression, pyschosis, and schizophrenia - being introduced to Spice was disastrous. He had shown himself to be capable of beating drugs before - but each time would be pulled back in by bad company. “In his mid 20s I got him to move up to near me in Bolton,” Maureen says. “We got him a little job, because I live near a village and he worked in a pound shop. He loved that job and stopped using hard drugs. “But then he moved back to Wythenshawe and started taking crack cocaine. I used to see him periodically and didn’t realise how bad he had gone.” It was that cocaine addiction that led to David committing robbery and being jailed for four years. But in prison he got no chance to get clean, because Spice was readily available. Following his release from HMP Risley in Warrington, the deterioration in David’s mental health and the extent of his drug problem was apparent. On morning of the day he died, David admitted to hostel staff that he had taken diazepam which was not prescribed to him - breaching the conditions of his licence. Maureen said: “That day, in my opinion, they should have phoned an ambulance with a view to him being sectioned for his own safety. It was known that diazepam had been a trigger for his offending in the past.” In the early evening of December 22, David left the hostel by climbing along the rear wall. He was seen on the M602, where cars dodged him. Great Manchester Police’s helicopter was scrambled to look for him. But at about 7.40pm he was struck by a car.

Royal fans particularly loved one photo of Kate, dressed in a blue \u0026pound39 Zara dress, running across the pitch.

Charlotte Caldwell\u0027s 12-year-old son Billy suffers up to 100 epileptic fits a day. The pair had travelled to Toronto on Thursday to get a six-month supply of cannabis oil to help treat his symptoms but the oil was confiscated by border officials when they tried to re-enter Britain. Ms Caldwell, from Northern Ireland, is scheduled to meet with Home Office Minister Nick Hurd about her son\u0027s medication needs on Monday.  It\u0027s Billy\u0027s anti-epileptic medication that Nick Hurd has taken away, it\u0027s not some sort of joint full of recreational cannabis, she told a press conference. I will just go back to Canada and get more and I will bring it back again because my son has a right to have his anti-epileptic medication in his country, in his own home. Let me tell you something now: we will not stop, we are not going to stop, we are not going to give up, we have love, hope, faith for our kids and we are going to continue. She said Billy was due his next dose at 3.30pm, and warned of the dangers of missing his first treatment in 19 months. The reason they don\u0027t do it is that it can cause really bad side-effects - they wean them down slowly. So what Nick Hurd has just done is most likely signed my son\u0027s death warrant.  She said she would be meeting Mr Hurd at the Home Office on Monday afternoon to plead to him parent to parent to get the oil back. Ms Caldwell, 50, said she was absolutely devastated to have the supply taken away after declaring it to border officials, and claimed one welled up with tears while doing it. They are parents themselves and they were very conflicted about removing the medication from me in fact. one of them had tears in their eyes when he was doing it.

Peruvian sanguches, completos and pl\u0026aacutetano mixto have been tipped as some of the foods that are likely to disrupt the fast food scene across the world. Hispanic takes on hot dogs and doughnuts have also been cited as potential disrupter franchises. Western franchises have dominated the fast food sector across the world up to now, with McDonald’s, Burger King and Subway among the biggest companies in the world. Krispy Kreme was launched this century and now has over 400 sites across the US, with the doughnuts also widely supplied in garages and convenience stores around the world.  But recent research published in the International Business Review suggests the global franchise picture is changing. The research focused on the huge expansion of Brazilian franchises as well as others in Latin America. And according to Leonardo Gonz\u0026aacutelez Dell\u0026aacuten, the fast food scene is ripe for expansion. He said: “The bottom line is that franchises that originate in emerging markets are doing better in other emerging markets than ones that originate in more economically developed countries (MEDCs).  “This is because these businesses do not see high levels of corruption or inefficiencies in doing business as unacceptable obstacles to opening up. “Indeed, the evidence suggests that Brazilian franchise chains, in food and other sectors, do not see corruption as necessarily inhibiting their ability to do business in emerging markets and the least developed countries in Latin America. “In short, they are better able to deal with problems around contracts, complex or contradictory regulations and political instability.  “More generally, emerging market multinationals (MNEs) are more prevalent in less developed countries compared with traditional MNEs – they turn their own experience into a competitive advantage. “With these business experiences behind the teams who have made a success in the Latin America look set to take the world by surprise”.

Polish national Lukasz Herba was today sentenced to 16 years and nine months\u0027 imprisonment after an Italian court convicted him of kidnapping Chloe Ayling.  Adrian Sington, who represents Ms Ayling, said: This has been an incredible burden on her shoulders for the last year in the face of media criticism of her motivation and this is vindication - her story is true. It\u0027s hard if you\u0027re being painted in the press as a liar and now she\u0027s able to be able to say, \u0027I know it\u0027s a bizarre story but it\u0027s a true one\u0027.  One of the difficulties with a psychopath and a narcissist, as Mr Herba is, is that he behaves in such a way that it\u0027s almost impossible to believe that someone could be so stupid and so, in some ways, it\u0027s not surprising that the media found Chloe\u0027s story difficult to believe. Let\u0027s not forget she was bundled into a suitcase, injected with ketamine in the boot of a car and thought she was going to die. Ms Ayling, 20, from Coulsdon, south London, had said she was taken against her will in Milan last summer after believing she was attending a photo shoot. During the trial, police said Ayling had been drugged, handcuffed and transported in a suitcase.  Ayling’s lawyer, Francesco Pesce, said the model had suffered mental and physical abuse during the six-day ordeal. Herba, 30, claimed Ayling had agreed to the scheme to boost her career. The mum-of-one stirred further controversy when she posted a topless picture online hours after an Italian court heard she was pictured holding hands with her kidnapper. Ayling put the photo on her Instagram, showing her clutching a duvet in a risque snap.  The court heard how images appeared to show her and Herba strolling through the streets of Turin together.  He was also said to have demanded 50,000 Bitcoins for her release.  Ayling said she was drugged and bundled into a car by Herba, and only released days later after going clothes shopping. There has been speculation the kidnap was a publicity stunt.  Pictures were shown to the Italian court as jurors were also told that the pair had been in touch on Facebook since 2015.

The North Korean dictator is due to meet US president Donald Trump tomorrow at 2am UK time in what is set to be a historic meeting between the world leaders.  Jong-un arrived in an Air China plane at Cangi Airport on Sunday night in an attempt to trick a would-be assasin.  The other two planes, one of which was Kim\u0027s outdated Soviet-era Ilyushin-62 - known as Air Force Un - also flew to Singapore.  These planes contained items to keep him safe including his own food supply and a portable toilet that will deny determined sewer divers insights into to the supreme leader\u0027s stools, reports the Korean news site Chosun Ilbo .   After he walked down the red carpeted steps from the aircraft, he got into a black Mercedes stretch limo and his bodyguards ran alongside the car to his hotel. Footage showed the bodyguards, dressed in black suits, running alongside his car as part of convoy of vehicles which included an ambulance in case of any assassination attempts. Trump arrived five hours after Kim in Air Force One, after jetting in from Canada where he attended the G7 summit.  Before boarding his plane, Trump said he viewed the trip as a peace mission and will know within the first minute of meeting Kim whether they can strike a deal. The summit will take place at the Capella hotel on Sentosa, a resort island off Singapore\u0027s port with luxury hotels, a Universal Studios theme park and man-made beaches. What do the two sides want? Trump wants North Korea to ditch its nuclear weapons, which Kim threatened to use in strikes on the US mainland. North Korea wants its own security guaranteed and sanctions lifted. Why does North Korea worry about its security? The 1950s conflict between North Korea and the US-backed South ended without a peace treaty, so America and North Korea are technically still at war. Kim, sees the US, with its 30,000 troops in South Korea, as a threat, and the US campaigns in Afghanistan, Iraq and Libya reinforced his view that nuclear weapons are necessary to deter a US intervention. What might be the result of talks? In exchange for economic assistance and security guarantees, North Korea would give up its nuclear weapons. Is accepting North Korea as a nuclear-armed state an option? Some analysts have suggested it is the best way to ease tensions, but doing so could lead South Korea, Japan and even Taiwan to seek their own nuclear arms. Is “denuclearisation” actually feasible? North Korea has talked about denuclearisation for years, but it has not stopped them beefing up their nuclear arsenal and conducting missile tests. What will happen if the summit fails? South Korea is expected to renew diplomatic efforts to restore stability and avoid military conflict. Trump and Kim are staying in separate hotels in the famous Orchard Road area of Singapore, dotted with high-rise luxury apartment blocks, offices and glittering shopping malls. The US President is expected to be alone in a room with North Korean dictator Kim Jong-Un for up to two hours when they meet from 2am UK time on Tuesday. Only translators will be present for the meeting at a luxury Singapore resort, a US official said - suggesting there will be no aides or note-takers, a highly unusual move. Officials could then drop in for a further hour but they admitted: We will not be surprised by any scenario.  Trump himself has said he could make a decision in the first minute or spur of the moment - raising the possibility he could make a commitment with no aides or note-takers present. The US is seeking the complete, verifiable, irreversible denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula. But North Korea has previously rejected the idea of unilateral disarmament.  It has also been reported that Trump will have access to the nuclear button at all times during his two-hour long meeting with Kim.

The talks are set to one-on-one, with translators the only other people allowed in the room. The meeting comes after North and South Korea held their first summit in more than a decade. It was only the third meeting between the leaders of the two countries since the Korean War. Amongst the announcements at the end of the historic meeting was a pledge to sign a formal peace treaty to end the war. Until now, the two countries have technically still been at war, despite the conflict ending in the 1950s. South Korea\u0027s president Moon Jae-in, who came to power in May, and the North Korean dictator also committed to \u0027denuclearisation\u0027 in the peninsular. The divisions between the two countries stretch back to the end of World War II, and are based on political ideology as well as bloody conflict. And while the South has flourished in recent years as a democracy supported by the United States, the North has seen isolation from the international community and has pursued an aggressive military-first policy. Here\u0027s an overview of the origins of the divide, the bitter war that cemented it, and their differing fortunes since.  Japanese rule and World War Two The short-lived Korean Empire had been integrating more with the Empire of Japan at the end of the 19th Century, and by 1905 a treaty formally made Korea a protectorate of Japan. Japan annexed the country with another treaty in 1910, officially taking over sovereignty of its land and people. A Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea was set up in exile in China by those opposed to Japanese rule. In Korea, a series of anti-Japanese protests were put down by soldiers, and over the next decades Japan strengthened its military rule of the peninsula. Following the Sino-Japanese war of 1937 and the outbreak of World War II Japan\u0027s rulers cracked down on Korean culture, and stopped the teaching of the Korean language and history.  During World War II , tens of thousands of Korean men were conscripted into the Japanese military. Up to up to 200,000 girls and women, mainly from Korea and China, were forced into sexual slavery for Japanese soldiers as so-called comfort women. The Provisional Government organised resistance groups against the colonial rulers. In 1940 the Korean Liberation Army was formed as the government declared war on Japan and Germany. Japan surrendered in 1945 after the United States dropped atomic bombs on the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, ending the Second World War.  Following the unconditional surrender of the Japanese, the victorious Allies split the Korean peninsula into two occupational zones. The United States took over the area to the south of the 38th Parallel, while the Soviet Union took the area to the north. The original plan was to work towards a united independent Korea, but the Soviet-US joint commission overseeing the transition failed to come to agreement as Cold War tensions between the two superpowers deepened. Fearing communist expansion in the region, the US established a military government in the south, while the Soviets oversaw the formation of the Provisional People\u0027s Committee led by Kim Il-Sung in the north.  In the north, land was redistributed amongst the people, and key industries were nationalised. The US military government said hundreds of thousands fled south as refugees. By 1947, the US brought the issue of what to do with the peninsula to the UN, against the wishes of the Soviet Union.  The UN passed a resolution stating that free elections should be held and foreign troops withdrawn. The Soviet Union boycotted the vote. Elections were planned in the south only, but strikes and protests broke out as activists feared separate elections would lead to the permanent division of the country. An uprising against the plans by Jeju islanders from April 1948 was met with force by the South Korean military, resulting in up to 30,000 people being killed - around 10 per cent of the island\u0027s population. The general election went ahead in May 1948, and in August, the Republic of Korea officially took over from the US military. The first president, anti-communist Syngman Rhee, had previously been head of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea. In response, in September 1948 the Democratic People\u0027s Republic of Korea was declared in the north, with Kim Il-Sung as leader. Both governments claimed sovereignty of the whole of the Korean peninsular. Soviet forces withdrew from the North in 1948, while US troops pulled out in 1949. The Korean War On June 25, 1950, North Korean forces crossed the 38th Parallel and headed south following a string of bloody border clashes between the two countries. The North Korean military was well-equipped by Stalin\u0027s Soviet Union, and contained veterans from the communist victory in the Chinese Civil War. They advanced with tanks and heavy artillery along the border line. In contrast, the South Korean military was poorly equipped, had no tanks and few aircraft. The invasion was the first major military action of the Cold War, and two days later Rhee fled South Korea\u0027s capital as the North Korean army swept across the country.  As Seoul fell, retreating South Korean forces executed tens of thousands of alleged communists held in prisons, as well as suspected communist sympathisers who had been enrolled in the Bodo League - a \u0027reeducation programme\u0027. It is estimated up to 200,000 people were massacred by South Korean forces. On June 27, the UN passed a resolution recommending that member states provide military support to South Korea. North Korean forces overran 90 per cent of the south before the US-led counter attack, and on September 25, South Korean forces retook Seoul.  South Korean units crossed over the 38th Parallel on October 1, with UN forces following a week later, pushing north until they reached the border with communist China. In November, the Chinese entered the war, and together with the North Korean army forced the UN forces back south. In 1951 the war ground to a stalemate near to the 38th Parallel, but fighting wore on for the next two years while armistice negotiations continued. American bombing destroyed huge numbers of buildings in North Korea, crippling the country\u0027s infrastructure and forcing the population to build homes and factories underground.  The Korean Armistice Agreement was signed on July 27, 1953. It created a four-kilometre wide buffer zone between the two states, called the Korean Demilitarized Zone. The new border crossed the 38th Parallel diagonally, and reflected the position the two forces held at the end of the war. A peace treaty was never signed, and both governments still claim sovereignty across the whole peninsula. The conflict resulted in the death of more than 2.5million people. After the war and the Kim dynasty  Autocratic South Korean President Syngman Rhee remained in office until 1960, when a student uprising forced him from power. After a period of instability, General Park Chung-hee seized control in a military coup and ruled until his assassination in 1979. It took until 1987\u0027s June Democracy Movement for South Korea to move away from an autocratic system of government. The country was invited to join the UN in 1991. It hosted the Olympics in 1988, and the World Cup - jointly with Japan - in 2002. The current president, Moon Jae-in, was elected in 2017.  In North Korea, Kim Il-sung concentrated his power after the war, executing dissenters and building a personality cult around himself. He was nicknamed Great Leader and the population was taught to venerate him. It is Kim Il-sung\u0027s policy of \u0027Juche\u0027 - political independence and economic self reliance - that has remained the country\u0027s ideology to this day, and has resulted in its isolation from the global community.  Until the 1960s, economic growth in North Korea was greater than that of South Korea. By the late 1980s, however, the economy had slowed, and it came close to collapse in 1991 when the Soviet Union fell and aid was suddenly cut off. Il-sung died in 1994 from a sudden heart attack, and supreme power passed to his son Kim Jong-il. His son continued the personality cult of his father, being declared Dear Leader and promoting a \u0027military first\u0027 approach.  The North Korean economy under Kim Jong-il was devastated by a massive famine, with hundreds of thousands of people dying from starvation and disease, and the nation left reliant on foreign aid. The country has still not recovered, with a US delegation in 2011 estimating that a third of children there are malnourished. North Korea became more insulated. Kim Jong-il died in 2011, and his son Kim Jong-un took over as leader.  According to South Korean reports, Kim may have purged more than 300 leading figures from the government to secure his position of power. These include Defense Minister Hyong Yong Chol, who was reportedly killed with anti-aircraft guns in 2015  security minister O Sang Hon, who was reportedly executed with a flamethrower in 2014  and Kim\u0027s uncle Jang Song-Thaek, who it is claimed was eaten alive by 120 starving dogs . He is also believed to have ordered the fatal poisoning of his half-brother , Kim Jong-nam, at an airport in Malaysia in February 2017.  North Korea\u0027s nuclear ambitions began in 1963 under Kim Il-sung, when the government asked the Soviet Union for help in developing a nuclear weapon. The request was refused, but the Soviets agreed to train scientists for a peaceful nuclear programme. Its first research reactor came online in 1965, and a second was built in 1979. In 1994, North Korea came to an agreement with the USA to freeze and eventually dismantle its nuclear weapons programme, but Kim Jong-il\u0027s government admitted in 2002 that it had continued the research. The North Koreans insisted the presence of US nuclear weapons based across the border in South Korea justified their secret weapons development. Meanwhile George W. Bush\u0027s US administration named North Korea as part of an Axis of Evil alongside Iran and Saddam Hussain\u0027s Iraq. In 2006 North Korea announced that it had conducted its first nuclear weapons test. It carried out further tests in 2009, 2013 and two in 2016. In 2017 the country carried out its seventh test, and claimed it was a hydrogen bomb capable of being launched on an intercontinental ballistic missile.  Alongside the development of nuclear warheads, North Korea has been developing the missiles needed to deliver them. In tests at the end of 2017, its Hwasong-15 missile travelled 621 miles and reached an altitude of 2,796 miles. The country described it as the most powerful it has fired to date. In response, President Donald Trump branded Kim Jong-un as \u0027rocket man\u0027, later saying: It is a situation we will handle. We will take care of it. In his 2018 New Year address, Kim hit back at Trump, saying “It’s not a mere threat but a reality that I have a nuclear button on the desk in my office ... All of the mainland United States is within the range of our nuclear strike.” Trump replied with a message on Twitter, tweeting: Kim Jong Un just stated that the “Nuclear Button is on his desk at all times. Will someone from his depleted and food starved regime please inform him that I too have a Nuclear Button, but it is a much bigger \u0026amp more powerful one than his, and my Button works!

people from the opera would all come around, drink some wine and sing some songs,\u0026#8221 he said.\u0026#8220It was mainly classical music that I was interested in when I was very very young.\u0026#8220If there was ever any children\u0026#8217s parts, me and my sister would get dressed up and thrown on stage, I sure to enjoy that.\u0026#8220There was never much singing involved, it was mostly just being children running around on stage.\u0026#8221Tristan said he started playing the cornet when he was four or five, and then moved on to the baritone horn while he was a student at Grange Primary School in Monifieth.\u0026#8220But I always wanted to play the trombone and they didn\u0026#8217t have one in the music department, but eventually the must have got a bit of extra cash and got a trombone so I started playing the trombone,\u0026#8221 he said.\u0026#8220And I did that right thought to near the end of high school.\u0026#8221While he trained and began working as an engineer, he started DJing electronic and hip-hop music, later moving into scratch DJing.\u0026#8220Some of my friends had a band and my best friend had just been asked to be the drummer so he asked if I wanted to come along and do some scratching on top of the music,\u0026#8221 he said.After a few weeks, Tristan asked if they were ok with him bringing along his synthesizers and the band kicked off from there.\u0026#8220It was great, we had a great time doing that and the band was together for about 12 years.\u0026#8221Spending most of his spare time being involved in music and going into so many studios, Tristan said he always had it in the back of his mind that he one day wanted to run his one of his own.He took a few business classes and looked into what it would involve, but the timing didn\u0026#8217t feel quite right.Then in 2007, both his parents passed away within two months of each other.\u0026#8220It kind of just turned my life on it\u0026#8217s head,\u0026#8221 he said.He quit his job and spent six months travelling around Australia with his future wife, before coming back to DundeeThen in 2009 he was told that a charity studio run by his friend\u0026#8217s dad near the Marketgait was up for sale, and Tristan decided to take the chance.\u0026#8220It was quite a big thing for me, a bit of a massive thing for me actually but at that point in my life it was a risk I was willing to take,\u0026#8221 he said.He launched the studio, a band booked one of his rooms full time and the business began to slowly grow, but it wasn\u0026#8217t until about a year and a half after opening that it began to turn profitable.\u0026#8220I remember six months into it being really really worried about things, that I might not be able to keep running,\u0026#8221 he said.\u0026#8220But I persevered with it and it\u0026#8217s worked out.\u0026#8220I\u0026#8217m never going to be a millionaire from running the studio but it\u0026#8217s more of a lifestyle job. I get to spend an awful lot of time with my kids which I\u0026#8217m quite grateful for.\u0026#8221There is still a lot of hard work which goes into the studio, with Tristan and Harris, one of the studio\u0026#8217s staff, staying up until 5am one recent weekend to prepare it for the launch of the Dundee Music Academy, but it\u0026#8217s paying off.The Academy is Tristan\u0026#8217s next big project and he wants to encourage more people to start playing music.\u0026#8220We\u0026#8217ve got big plans for the music academy and high hopes for it,\u0026#8221 he said.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b14fe9ac928b.jpg ","title":"dundee people pictures dundee youngsters take steps to show off their urban moves","story":"\t\t\t\t\tHundreds of little groovers had the chance to show their moves in the city’s biggest dance festival.The festival, which took place at the Gardyne Theatre, saw approximately 600 children showing off what they have learned in their Urban Moves dance classes run by Leisure and Culture Dundee.Running over three days, the dance festival invited different Urban Moves classes to show off their skills to friends, family and other dance enthusiasts, ensuring all of the varying age groups got the opportunity to experience dancing on the big stage.“We have also now extended to evening classes for some of the more senior pupils from S1 upwards.“At the event all the kids were great – with so many children it could have been crazy but they were all fantastic and so keen to get up on the stage.“We work with them all year round to build up their confidence so there was no stage fright. They were all raring to go.”Alongside primary school groups, there was also the chance for the dance programme’s elite dancers from the Urban Moves Junior Company, Urban Moves Training Company and Urban Moves Dance Company to showcase their skills.Alex added: “It was great having the development companies perform each night too.“I think it definitely gave the younger children some inspiration on what they can do and they just loved sharing the stage with them.”The Dance Company was also recently involved in a promotional video for Maggie’s Penguin Parade, which kicks off this summer, and will be heavily involved with shows throughout the next few months.Alex Hare, dance manager for Leisure and Culture Dundee, said the three day event was “absolutely fantastic”.She said: “The weekend was full of incredible dancing and each and every dancer and member of the audience had an amazing time.“The weekend showcase is an annual event and really gives the kids a chance to show the skills they have learned throughout the year in their dance classes.“In partnership with Dundee City Council, Urban Moves goes into primary schools each week after school and teaches the kids new routines and help them develop new skills.The Claypotts Castle PS (P1-3) Urban Moves Junior Group.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/Mervyn-Miller-496x372.jpg ","title":"dundee people trying to find after 73 years mervyns looking for family ties to dundee","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAn adopted man whose mother went into labour while in prison has appealed for information in Tayside as he now believes he has family ties to Dundee.Mervyn Miller, 73, was put up for adoption after he was born three months premature while his unmarried mother was in HM Prison Edinburgh, having been locked up in 1944 for shoplifting.Mervyn said he has lived a “lucky” life but, upon retirement, decided to trace his family history. He has uncovered ties to Dundee and is appealing to anyone who may have known his mother, whose birth certificate he has not found.He believes his mum, Irene Miller or Millar, was born in Canada but grew up and worked in Dundee. Mervyn thinks his maternal grandmother travelled to Canada while pregnant, but returned to Scotland shortly afterwards.He has found a cousin, Freda, and an uncle, Raymond, who live in Dundee, but neither has been able to shed much light on the mystery. Freda’s mum also lived in Dundee and Mervyn suspects she and his mum would have hung about together.He said: “It would be a great satisfaction to know what happened to her. We just can’t find a birth certificate. In a jute mill or other factory, everyone knows everyone so there might be someone in Dundee who knew my mother.”Irene ended up in Liverpool working as a prostitute but that is where the trail goes cold.His father is even more of a mystery, but as Mervyn is mixed-race he believes a man from Pakistan, India or Sri Lanka came to Dundee for the jute industry.Born with spina bifida, Mervyn spent much of his childhood at a children’s centre in Edinburgh.

director Stuart Campbell, who represents fans’ group ArabTRUST on the club board, insists no news over the potential takeover at Tannadice is good news.In a blog post he said: “Since Mike Martin was appointed chairman we’ve seen the implementation of the widely reported ‘root \u0026amp branch’ review of everything that happens at the club.“While we expect to see many more changes reported over the next few months, changes have already been made in finance, recruitment, youth and commercial.“The chairman, directors and staff at Tannadice have been putting in long hours to bring about the changes needed that will give the club the best chance of delivering the promotion to the Premiership and the financial stability we all want.“I’m not evading the ‘elephant in the room’ but really can’t answer any of the questions many of us have on the reported potential takeover/ investment in the club.“ArabTRUST are taking the view at this stage that a lack of information is a positive sign that any negotiations are taking place in a business-like manner and when it’s possible the club will bring us all up to date with any developments.“Too many times in the past we’ve seen gossip drip fed into the media on all sorts of issues where ultimately everyone has been left frustrated and disappointed.“We must also remember any discussions of this nature will be private discussions between

one of two new defensive targets for dundee united","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee United’s search for new centre-backs continues apace as former Dundee defender Julen Etxabeguren and ex-Tannadice man Callum Morris have been added to their list of targets.Both are free agents, though, the Tangerines face a battle to land either signature.Etxabeguren was released by the Dark Blues last month after an injury-hit year and has returned to Spain.Whether he can be enticed back to Scotland remains to be seen, although, he did enjoy his time in Dundee.Morris, meanwhile, told Dunfermline he was leaving them to return to England but a move back to former club United might be enough for him to shelve those plans.The 28-year-old played 45 times for Jackie McNamara at Tannadice over two seasons but, like Etxabeguren, has a history of injuries.He did play 40 games last season for the Pars, however.Also on the list is former Partick man Frederic Frans.The Belgian centre-back is wanted by his former club also, as well as fellow-Championship side Ross County.Meanwhile, United have announced their first pre-season friendly.Csaba Laszlo’s men will head to Brechin City on Tuesday, July 3, kick-off 7.45pm.That sees both city clubs heading to Glebe Park in pre-season because it’s the only grass pitch in the area, apart from Arbroath.n Former Dundee United favourite Nadir Ciftci is leaving Celtic

pub.Husky Levi slipped his harness outside a shop on Perth Road while his owner Carly Stevenson was inside – sparking a huge search operation lasting several hours.But the pet pooch was found three hours later enjoying the company of regulars at the Taybridge Bar.Carly had left Levi tied up outside a newsagent with Ollie, a Staffie, when the drama unfolded.The 29-year-old said: “It must have been around 8pm on Wednesday.“We were on our way to the park and I nipped into the shop.“It’s a regular trip and the dogs have been tied up countless times outside the store. When I came out of the shop Ollie was still there but Levi was gone.“Ollie started going towards the park so we started looking there. As Levi had broken out his harness, his name tag had come away as well.”The search for Levi, who will be two next month, stretched across the city with police officers even keeping an eye out for the dog.Carly said: “Given he is a husky and they have bounds of energy, we knew he could be anywhere.“I put a post up on social media and had family in Broughty Ferry looking for him too. I was obviously extremely worried about what had happened to him.“Two police officers had kindly joined in the search as well.”When Carly received a call from the Scottish SPCA she thought the worst had happened – only to discover Levi had simply befriended some folk having a cigarette outside the pub.She insisted Levi wasn’t in the doghouse for his antics, saying she was simply happy to have him back.She added: “When the call came in they told me, ‘he’s been traced safe and well in the pub’.“I couldn’t believe it as he had been missing from around 8pm until around 11pm.“We’d been searching all over the place and he was just across the road – in the pub of all places.”Kelsie Boland, 21, assistant manager at the bar, said its newest customer had stayed off the booze during his visit.She said: “We knew he was just a pup.“We gave him some food and he was really well behaved and got on well with the staff and the punters.“When Carly came in she was obviously upset but delighted to get him back.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b1a516c449eb.jpg ","title":"jack hamilton signing a great bit of business says derek soutar","story":"\t\t\t\t\tSigning 24-year-old Jack Hamilton is “a great piece of business” according to a man who knows a thing or two about keeping goal for Dundee.Derek ‘Soapy’ Soutar had two spells at Dens Park, totalling eight years, and has seen first-hand how good Hamilton can be.After Soutar suffered an injury in his time at Forfar back in 2012, a young keeper by the name of Hamilton came in on emergency loan to cover at the age of 18.Watching his progress since, Soutar was delighted to see him arrive at Dundee.Soutar said: “I was very surprised Hearts let him go.“He came in on loan at Forfar when he was just 18. He was a great size, very athletic and a really good shot-stopper, great at one-on-ones and his distribution was excellent, too.“With Jon McLaughlin leaving I thought it would be the ideal chance for Craig Levein to put Jack in for pre-season.“He’s moved on, though, and Dundee have a great signing.“I worked with Jack, he’s a great lad and really down to earth personality.“I think it’s a great bit of business by Neil McCann.“He’s a good age with plenty of experience as well at Hearts and all the different levels with Scotland.“It’s a massive signing for Dundee – he could be there for years to come.“He will have to bide his time, though, because Elliott Parish did really well at the end of last season after Scott Bain left.“Every goalie is going to have times when it’s not going for you but Elliott got through that and didn’t do a lot wrong. He’ll take some shifting for Jack.“What it will do is push Parish to be as good as he can because he knows Jack will be breathing down his neck.”After a steady first season at the now renamed Kilmac Stadium, Parish will feel he’s the current No 1 at the club but the arrival of another senior goalie can spur both to excel – and that’s good news for the Dark Blues.Hamilton has represented Scotland at every age level from U/15 to U/21 and was called up to a squad by Gordon Strachan in May 2016.He didn’t get a first senior cap but Soutar reckons he can push his way back into the national set-up by impressing for Dundee.He added: “Not so long ago he was in the Scotland squad.“He maybe lost a bit of confidence last season at Hearts and being on the bench.“He’s very professional and will push himself to the max to make sure he’s ready for pre-season at Dundee.“He’s very level-headed, he’s not one for the big-time if you know what I mean, he’s not a flashy kind of guy.“I know the kind of level Jack can play at, I’ve worked with him and I think he could get himself back in the Scotland set-up while at Dundee.“Whatever fee was paid, he’ll definitely justify it.“Further down the line, he could even get Dundee a fee if he moves on so, for that reason, I think it’s a great piece of business.“Working with (goalkeeping coach) Rab Geddes every week, too, can only bring the best out in Jack.“A three-year deal gives him security and playing for a manager who wants him in Neil McCann will help no end.”The former Dundee and Aberdeen goalie, meanwhile, is still going strong with his Derek Soutar Goalkeeping Academy.“It’s still going really well,” he added. “That’s us had 38 goalies over seven years go on to play pro-youth and we’ve had one recently go out to the US for a scholarship.”Any budding young goalies can find out more on the academy’s Facebook page.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b17b6e6b90a2.jpg ","title":"manchester united boss jose mourinho watches dundees former arsenal midfielder glen kamara amid transfer speculation","story":"\t\t\t\t\tJose Mourinho was watching as Dundee’s Glen Kamara picked up his fourth international cap in Finland’s friendly defeat in Romania.The 22-year-old has drawn plenty of interest in his time at the Dark Blues – Mourinho, however, was only there as a guest of Romanian agent Ioan Becali and stressed in an ad-hoc TV interview he wasn’t looking at players, just enjoying his time off.Kamara, meanwhile, despite only joining up with the Finnish national squad on Monday, played the majority of the second half in Ploiesti.The Finns, ranked 62nd in the world and not at this year’s World Cup, started the friendly match well but fell behind in the first half to Cristean Manea’s 37th-minute strike.In the second period, Kamara made his entrance after 57 minutes for Nottingham Forest’s Thomas Lam but almost immediately the team fell further behind.On 61 minutes, winger Ciprian Deac finished from close range to give the Romanians a home victory.Finland boss Markku Kanerva said: “The start was challenging but we looked good. We fought well and did not give up.“Of course, we should not be satisfied with this result but we did not have a full squad.“At the end, we got a little bit to attack more.“I had to think a little about the team when Pyry Soiri and Glen Kamara were only involved on Monday for the first time so they only played the second period.“There was little to be done in the last third.

In other words, we are going to reward success – and reward it quite handsomely.“However, we’re not going to reward failure.

When I was having a hard time I would talk to my mum a lot, and my guidance teachers at school helped, too.”She added that she hoped her money would help support those in need.“I was really sad at my

redevelopment of Inverness Castle has been broadly welcomed.Already there have been suggestions for the site ranging from demolishing the entire block to creating a green space.But any action to redevelop the concrete carbuncles will not happen immediately as possible options have yet to be drawn up ahead of a public consultation, while tenants in some units still have several years left on the leases.They include the Scottish Children\u0027 Reporter Admin-istration (SCRA) which has stated its intentions to remain in its unit until the end of the lease in October 2025 while the Shapla Indian Restaurant is among the businesses yet to be contacted by the council on how the takeover and potential plans might impact on its future.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspRestaurant owner Shabaro Ali said this week\u0027 announcement had come as a surprise, although he welcomed the news.\"Obviously, if Highland Council is going to redevelop the site, it is good for the city, it is good for us, it is good for everyone,\" he said.With about another 10 years remaining on the lease, Mr Ali wants the restaurant to remain in its prime riverside location where it has been for the last 22 years.\"I am sure Highland Council will try to keep everyone happy,\" he said.Orkney businesswoman Judith Glue opened her shop in Bridge Street 10 years ago and although she has yet to be directly approached by her new landlord, she was not unduly worried about the change in ownership,\"I hope it will be positive for businesses to be a part of a brand new project which would be good for Inverness,\" she said. \"Until they get in touch and tell us about the plans, there is not a lot I can say.\"The SCRA, meanwhile, occupies the main concrete block nearest the river which many would like to see removed.When contacted by the Inverness Courier last week ahead of the official announcement, a spokeswoman said there were no plans to move out.\"This is where our staff are based and where we hold children\u0027 hearings,\" she said.Following discussions with the council, that position remained unchanged this week.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspScotland\u0027 rural economy secretary Fergus Ewing \u0026ndash also the Inverness and Nairn MSP and co-chairman of the steering group overseeing the castle redevelopment \u0026ndash warned the project would take time.\"I don\u0026rsquot wish

That will be the case here and it\u0027 important that there\u0027 a sense of ownership of citizens in the city.\"He said the aim of the group, which had met 14 times over the last three-and-a-half years, was to create an international-class attraction which drew people to Inverness rather than being something people simply saw when in the Highland capital.LDN Architects will look at the Bridge Street site to help create a masterplan by autumn prior to public consultation. A Highland Council spokeswoman said the local authority would become the landlord of any occupants or tenants.\"There will be no changes to the buildings until consultation has taken place, apart from any minor repairs which a landlord would be responsible for,\" she said.Monday 11 Jun 2018 11:35 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04111000/04111987.jpg","title":"British Empire Medal recipient honoured","story":"\u0026nbspAN Inverness man has been honoured to celebrate 50 years of volunteering with the RAF Association.John Maclean (83), who was born in Inverness but now lives in Peterhead and is chairman of the association\u0027 branch in the town, has been giving up his time to help others since the end of his active service in the 1960s.He also served in a number of senior roles in the organisation, and now his efforts have been recognised after he was awarded the British Empire Medal.Mr Maclean said: \"It\u0027 nice to have your hard work recognised.\"I took out life membership when I was leaving the air force in 1966 and soon after I started volunteering with the association.\"It becomes like a big family.

But a story like that is so dramatic that surely it would have passed down through the family.\"Mr Newton managed to track down the woman by following clues from sources such as reports of the fire in newspapers including the Inverness Courier, plus help from the family historian at the Highland Archive Centre.Having identified the butchers A\u0026ampD Macdonald, along with the location of the family farm in Glenmoriston, he subsequently discovered the great-granddaughter of Alexander Macdonald had married in Dundee in 2009 but was living in America.\"I do get a bit obsessive when it comes to researching local history,\" he conceded. \"It takes on a life of its own.\"It is like being part historian and part detective. You have to follow the clues and work out what is going on.\"He has now written to her outlining the story and other details of her family history and is awaiting a reply.From researching the 1901 census, Mr Newton also discovered the dog\u0027 owner was a Gaelic speaker. He speculated the dog might only have responded to Gaelic commands, which would explain why it refused to leave its post when the fire broke out as the owner was not present.If no definitive answer is forthcoming from America, the public will be invited to help name the dog.The council has come up with a shortlist of potential names including Dileas, Gaelic for faithful.

I think that says it all.“He was such a competitor. That’s what always struck you about him.“The ceremony is a brilliant way to commemorate his life. It shows his family a lot of folk are thinking about him.”After the service, fans praised the touching tribute.Duncan Smith, 46, of Heathryfold, said: “It was brilliant. Absolutely superb, and quite emotional.“He was a proper Aberdeen loon.“The Gothenburg Greats were my heroes when I was a kid.”Valerie Donald, 53, of Hardgate, said: “It was just brilliant. It was really emotional, and it was very well organised as well.“There were lots of lovely stories about him, they put a lot of thought into it.”Graham Morrice, 56, from Woodside, said: “It was a great tribute to a great man. Aberdeen thought the world of him, and he thought the world of Aberdeen.”Two fans, Patricia and Ali Anderson, travelled from Elgin to be at the ceremony.Ali said: “It was brilliant.“There’s not many people who would get that.”Patricia, who knew him, added: “It was just exactly him. That’s exactly what he was like. He was a wonderful person.”Tributes, which included football shirts, scarves and banners, as well as numerous flowers, were lined up in the ground as well as flower displays carrying the messages“Stand Free” and “RIP” Tattie.Amid the sadness were plenty of smiles as fans heard tales from the former Dons star’s life, with many speakers greeted with cheers and prolonged applause.The event also included videos of Neale, and included his recent appearance at the Gothenburg Greats night on May 11, as well as excerpts from interviews and press calls over the years.Images spanned his entire career, including his famous goal against Rangers in the 1982 Scottish Cup final, and his time as manager for Ross County.A book of condolence was set up in the lower concourse of the Richard Donald Stand for anyone who wanted to leave their thoughts and well-wishes following the ceremony.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"head gardener appointed at aberdeen royal infirmary","story":"\t\t\t\t\tPlans to create a staff garden at an Aberdeen hospital have taken a step forward with the appointment of a head gardener and new design ideas for the space.The idea for the garden, located at Aberdeen Royal Infimary, was conceived after the success of the site’s Robertson Family Roof Garden.A dedicated staff-only facility, it will be accessed via swipe card and will be available 24 hours a day.Similar to the Robertson Family Roof Garden, which opened in 2016, the garden will be charitably funded and maintained.It will be located in the internal quadrangle, off the main corridor of ARI – which is currently home to the Grampian Hospitals Art Trust portable buildings.It has been designed to act as a space where staff can enjoy fresh air during their breaks and improve their health and wellbeing.The project, which it is hoped will be completed next year, has now appointed Diana Robertson as its head gardener – she previously filled the same role at Drum Castle.NHS Grampian’s healthcare chaplain the Rev James Falconer is spearheading the project.He said: “We are making progress although we are still at the very early stages.“We’re very pleased to have Diana Roberston as our head gardener – she will be excellent.“We also have some exciting plans for the design of the garden.

Therefore, we support separating pedestrians, cyclists and motorists through an expansion of the network of walking and cycling paths across Scotland.We would like to stress, however, that measures like these will not single-handedly lead to safer roads. The road mentality in Scotland still favours the motorist over more vulnerable road users, which presents a huge barrier to more people taking up active lifestyles.More needs to be done to change our road culture for people in Scotland to feel safer regardless of their means of transportation, ultimately empowering them to lead healthier and more active lifestyles.Perhaps it is time we started to beat the ‘presumed liability’ drum once again?Brenda Mitchell, Road Traffic Accident Law (Scotland) LLP, Edinburgh.Sir,Some people have difficulty getting up and down the steps on the Glasgow bus. We asked West Coast Motors about this and they gave us the answer we wanted.All Citylink buses are fitted with an access ramp, worked by the driver. A platform comes out on to the pavement, with a holding bar, and is then raised up to floor level. This is designed as a wheelchair lift, where two seats at the front have to be arranged to be taken out, to give plenty of room.It was agreed, however, that if someone felt nervous about climbing up or down the stairs, they could also use the access platform. Once they have paid their ticket, they can walk to a seat.West Coast Motors asks anyone wanting this service to please remember two things.Firstly, book your single or return tickets by phone or on the Citylink website.Then, 48 hours before your journey, phone Citylink and tell them the times and details of the booking you have made and let them know you will be using the access ramp. The telephone number is 08712 663333.Kirsty McCuaig and Patricia Crawford, Mid Argyll Buddies.Sir,The ongoing effects of weather, bureaucracy and concern for the future continue to put our countryside under pressure, with few avenues to turn to for support.This can have dramatic consequences for the rural economy and the people who live and work there.The Prince’s Countryside Fund is committed to supporting community-led projects that will re-invigorate and sustain farming networks and the countryside by providing services and amenities through its grant programme.Open for applications until June 14, grants are available for up to £50,000. If you are involved in a community-run or farming support project and think your organisation may benefit – or if you know someone who might –  visit  www.princescountrysidefund. org.uk/grants.The fund has supported a diverse range of projects, including a community transport app in Argyll and projects on Barra, Orkney and Shetland. We are proud to have distributed more than £9 million since 2010 to more than 250 projects led by these grassroots organisations.It is crucial we help rural areas during these times of change to retain a thriving countryside and encourage a sustainable farming sector in the UK and would encourage people to apply for our funding.Claire Saunders, director, The Prince’s Countryside Fund.Sir,At first sight, it seems odd that the controversy over the reported disturbance to common gulls, oystercatchers and black guillemots at the old oil depot in Ardrishaig is focused on a breeding colony of common gulls.I’m no bird expert and hadn’t realised common gulls are less common than the bigger varieties or that they’re a declining species.But among the reasons given for this are predation by mink and the loss of open rubbish dumps and both might be contributing factors in Mid Argyll.It’s surely hardly surprising that the only breeding colony along the canal is at the Ardrishaig end, where the urbanisation around the tidal flats of Loch Gilp and the Lingerton dump offer prime scavenging opportunities.I don’t know whether they lose out to the bigger gull species when it comes to local island nesting sites, or whether the old Gleaner site might offer other advantages, for example, maybe less vulnerable to mink predation – but could it be the gulls are there primarily because of man-made feeding opportunities and that they’ll find an alternative site that’s similarly convenient?Likewise, the smaller populations of oystercatchers and black guillemots, however, although they’re also both amber listed they don’t scavenge and seem to be more dependent on the sea and shore for their livelihoods.Their decline might be of more concern but they’re hopefully less swayed towards easy pickings around Loch Gilp and more evenly distributed to Loch Crinan.Perhaps Jim Dickson and Andrew Tongue can enlighten us further on just how endangered the populations of these three species are in Mid Argyll.Robert Wakeham, Lochgilphead.Sir,Please would the parents of the young girl who may have witnessed a recent incident with a man and dog in Inveraray Main Street contact my husband and I through this newspaper?We saw a man who, we believe, mistreated a dog in the street at 8.30pm on Sunday April 29.We are both keen to know this young person is alright as she appeared to be frightened, running off at speed with her two dogs.Knowing she was fine would put our minds at rest.

If she does choose to ignore the vote and force through this legislation, she will be breaking the conventions of the 20-year-old devolution settlement and imposing a power grab upon Scotland against our will.Brendan O\u0026#8217Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"science matters natures patterns","story":"\t\tDorothy H CrawfordUpdated: 20/05/18, 11:47 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe natural world abounds in beautiful patterns, each evolved to enhance survival of a species \u0026#8211 the extravagant, iridescent peacock’s tail, which serves to attract a mate, while intricate orchid flowers entice pollinators and tigers’ stripes provide camouflage.But not all nature’s patterns are quite as showy it is the mathematical symmetries that I find most intriguing.Italian mathematician Leonardo Fibonacci lived in 12th century Algeria when Indian numerals were introduced to the West via the Middle East.  In his book, Liber Abaci (published in 1202), he describes a numerical sequence, now called the Fibonacci sequence, in which each number is the sum of the previous two digits: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 ad infinitum. He formulated this recurrence in relation to rabbit breeding, but it turns out to be exceedingly wide-spread in nature, from tree branching to mollusc shell growth to bee reproduction.Plant leaves are like solar panels, absorbing sunlight to power energy-providing photosynthesis.  Thus, leaves appear in a spiral around the stem, each positioned to optimise sunlight capture.  The ratio of leaves to turns is always a ration of Fibonacci numbers 3 leaves to 1 turn for hazel, 8/3 for pear and 13/5 for almond trees.  The angle between consecutive leaves is always close to 137.5o, called ‘the golden angle’ – perfect for maximising energy production.The number of petals in most flowers also follows the Fibonacci sequence: lilies have 3, buttercups 5, delphinium 8, common marigolds 13, asters 21.  But even more striking are the complex spirals of seed-heads of sunflowers, fir cones and pineapples.  In each case new seeds forming in the centre of the flower push older seeds out into mesmerising patterns of interlocking, clockwise and anticlockwise spirals.The numbers of spirals in both directions are consecutive Fibonacci numbers with 5 and 8 or 8 and 13 in pineapples, 8 and 13 in fir cones, and numbers as high as 144 and 233 recorded in sunflower heads.Why? Because these configurations pack in the most seeds.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column 25","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 21/05/18, 3:33 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Some would argue it has been an eyesore that should have been knocked down long before now and replaced with a more modern building.But it\u0026#8217s sad to see the old Inveraray Community Hall crumble and rot with neglect.What makes the building\u0026#8217s current predicament all the more galling is that there was the chance, according to Inspire Inveraray, to make the building safe six years ago.

As with other gull species which are opportunist in diet, junk food and bits of plastic provided by us humans can be inadvertently consumed.Over many years the Gleaner oil depot, which has a concrete bund in case of oil spillage, has provided a safe nesting site for around 20 pairs. The suggestion that this colony could easily find an alternative site is perhaps wishful thinking as suitable sites nearby in Mid Argyll are already occupied by other gull species or don’t have the required habitat features.Thankfully, however, this should not prove necessary. Following a productive on-site meeting last week with the Scottish Canals\u0026#8217 environmental scientist, the project architect and TSL contractors we noted 10-15 birds sitting on eggs and unaffected by the work going on around them.Planned works over the coming weeks should not affect these gulls, Oystercatchers or Black Guillemots from nesting and will also not impede the building work which is scheduled to be completed by next spring.The Mid Argyll hub project and new canal museum will largely reflect the social and cultural heritage of the Crinan Canal, but should also encompass the important and often decreasing natural history of the Crinan Canal corridor. These breeding birds are also a part of this and should not just be something to ‘chase off’ to somewhere else.Excellent viewing and educational opportunities from the new build will be possible to watch this colony raise their chicks as well as providing a point to lookout for other wildlife on the loch.Nearby, the tidal estuary of Loch Gilp provides us with an often highly under-valued unofficial nature reserve that links Ardrishaig with Lochgilphead, which in winter hosts important numbers of duck and waders, in summer includes breeding Eider ducks and Common Terns and during migration is a vital stopping off point during adverse weather for passage Whooper swans, Brent geese and Black-tailed Godwits to name a few.Increasingly good work is being undertaken by locals and the Phoenix Trust to help clear up some of the increasing amounts of shoreline rubbish.Keep up the good work!Jim Dickson, Argyll Bird Recorder, CairnbaanSir,I have been out and about Islay the past week speaking to my constituents, visiting local businesses and monitoring the roads department\u0026#8217s progress with road repairs.Unfortunately CalMac management\u0026#8217s shocking handling of our local ferry service is really taking it\u0026#8217s toll on many local businesses that depend heavily of Islay\u0026#8217s growing tourist trade.

This scattershot approach to pothole repairs is as random as it is ineffective.In the future we will need to see a more long term resurfacing solution to our local roads with less short term, random and piecemeal patchwork.Cllr Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,In the run up to National Volunteering Week (June 1- 7), Cats Protection would like to extend our thanks to the many thousands of volunteers throughout the country who offer their time and expertise to help cats and kittens across the UK.In 2017, our 10,200-strong volunteer network contributed an incredible 5.5 million hours, each volunteer gifting a wealth of expertise and immeasurable passion to the charity. Their dedication enabled Cats Protection to help around 200,000 cats and kittens nationwide.Cats Protection is always on the lookout for new volunteers to join the UK’s biggest cat community. Though a large part of our work is helping cats, through fostering and rehoming, our volunteers have the opportunity to become involved with a range of interesting activities such as organising fundraising events, helping with publicity or managing funds and resources to benefit the greatest amount of cats.Volunteering can offer the chance to develop skills such as time management, interpersonal skills and teamwork, making CVs much more attractive and, of course, helping cats.Anyone who is interested in becoming a volunteer can go to our website www.cats.org.uk/get- involved/volunteering  to find out more.Julie Meredith, head of volunteering development, Cats Protection,Sir,I really love being active, especially the feeling after and that’s why I’m supporting Bowel Cancer UK and Beating Bowel Cancer’s latest fundraising campaign to get sponsored to do 30 minutes of physical activity for 30 days in June.Step up for 30 is a fantastic way for you to be more physically active to reduce your risk of bowel cancer – the UK’s second biggest cancer killer. This can be anything from yoga, walking in the sunshine (I walk everywhere) or taking your favourite class at the gym.While you’re getting fitter and feeling healthier, you’ll be raising money to fund the highest quality research and essential information and support services that will save lives from bowel cancer.Take on the challenge and sign up at bowelcanceruk.org.uk/stepupfor30.Gaby Roslin, TV and radio presenterPICS:The common gull has been seen nesting at the disused oil depot. no_a21Gleanergull01Gulls at the former Gleaner site. no_a21Gleanergull02\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"lochgilphead kids get kitted out","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 30/05/18, 5:11 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowLochgilphead Soccer Centre is delighted to have taken delivery of a quality rain jacket for each of the kids associated with the centre and Red Star YFC.That’s 120 rain jackets in total.As well as making sure the kids look smart and feel part of the club they will also help keep them dry and warm when the weather is a bit wet and windy.The rain jackets have been sponsored by Mid Argyll Youth Development Services (MAYDS) and the Soccer Centre would like to say a huge thank you to MAYDS for this sponsorship and ongoing support.Five teams from Lochgilphead travelled to the Oban Football Festival on a Saturday April 28.

After a pit stop in the Royal Burgh it was on to Fort William, then Inverness and back home again- all to raise money for Cancer Research UK and Target Ovarian Cancer.Spokesperson for Breast Way Round, Laura White, said: ‘This year was full of fun, laughter, meeting new family members and although the daily miles are hard going, the weather and the beauty of the Scottish scenery made it that little bit easier.’As well as the sponsored trek, the bikers raised money in more traditional ways, such as bucket shaking (the men wearing bras) and hosting a raffle and auction in Caol Community Centre. The most coveted item, a patchwork quilt made by rider Cathy Anderson, went for a whopping £700.The annual trip was started in 2008 by Shirley-Ann McKnight as a last tour of Scotland for fellow biker and close friend, Alyson Porter, who was suffering from cancer. Sadly, Alyson never made it to her trip and now each year the journey is retraced in celebration of her life and all those affected by cancer.Since 2008, more than 600 riders have participated, each clad with a pink mohawk courtesy of Hairy-RS, and the team has raised £347,000 for Macmillan Cancer Support.

She died because there was no match, but I signed up because of her.\u0026#8217Brett received his transplant in October 2015 and, after a long recovery, is now healthy and well.The identity of recipient and donor must be kept confidential for two years, to protect them both, but the pair exchanged cards, giving Brett and David the chance to learn a bit about each other.Then, on Sunday June 3, the long-awaited meeting took place in Campbeltown.Brett continued: \u0026#8216I had butterflies before we met. I was a little bit lost for words but I gave David a hug and shook hands and said thank you.

The ‘Highway Services’ would be located at Bogend Toll near Symington and could create 30 jobs. A Shell petrol station and Londis shop are part of the vision for the site. A raft of documents have been lodged with South Ayrshire Council as part of a planning application. London-based Grove Garages is behind the proposal, which would see two buildings erected.   The company has an agreement with Shell and Londis but is still in talks to sign-up a coffee firm.  The plan includes eight fuel pumps, 11 parking spaces, two car wash bays and pumps for HGVs.  The coffee shop would have a floor space of 260sqm with 29 car spaces and a drive through at the back. A supporting statement said: “The location of the site represents an ideal opportunity for a roadside servies area to cater for the frequent tourist, haulage and commuter traffic using the A77. It said the development would ensure the “reuse of a visually and environmentally poor site in a prominent location alongside one of Scotland’s main tourist routes, the A77.”  The site used to be a field belonging to Dyke Farm. Access to the site would be from the B730 adjoining the A77 north bound carriageway. Cars could enter from the southbound carriageway through the existing flyover. Chargers would also be available for electric cars. A design and access statement said: “The proposals give back purpose to an unused site, which has potential to provide an important service to the local area and indeed the wider area. The design proposals are considered to be respectful to the local environment and are in line with local policy and guidelines. No decision has been made on the application yet.

Following a long battle with neuroblastoma, the 17-year-old died peacefully surrounded by dad Chris, mum Connie, and sister Olivia. It was a fight that captured not just the hearts and minds of Ayrshire, but the world beyond. Vanessa, who displayed courage which belied her condition, would rarely be seen without a smile on her face. For almost a decade, her name became synonymous with the fight against the aggressive cancer. Almost \u0026pound1million was raised with the aim of sending Vanessa abroad for life-saving treatment. That dream was realised and in January 2013, the family received the news they longed for – that the cancer was in remission.  Vanessa would return to school and rejoin classmates as a hugely popular figure at Marr College. Life, as normal as it could ever be, was good again for this inspirational girl. But the cancer would return and spread to Vanessa’s brain, with her family receiving the crushing news that her condition was terminal. As ever, Vanessa fought bravely until the last before she passed away just days short of her 18th birthday. Now her family are vowing that her fight will live on in her legacy. Dad Chris told the Post: “We are devastated at our loss.  “Vanessa was a huge inspiration to Connie, Olivia and I and so many more. “She achieved lots during her short but fulfilled life, she did everything she wanted to do and lived life to the full. “She never complained about anything, even though her situation was dire and she knew it. “We are privileged to have had such an inspirational and beautiful daughter.”  Vanessa’s funeral will take place on Friday, June 22 at 11.30am at Dreghorn Crematorium and then on to Troon Town Hall for a Celebration of Life. Chris added: “We’d like to ask that people wear bright colours and for the gents not to wear black ties. “That is what Vanessa would have wanted.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12539593.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/14478946.jpg","title":"lawrence shankland agrees new deal","story":"NewsLawrence Shankland agrees new deal to stay at Ayr United for Championship pushThe 29-goal striker has put pen to paper on a new deal at Somerset Park.\u0026nbspShareByStuart WilsonLochlin Highet13:14, 15 MAY 2018Updated13:18, 15 MAY 2018NewsShankland is staying on at Somerset (Image: Daily Record)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailLawrence Shankland insists money can’t buy happiness after he sensationally spurned a host of lucrative offers to pen a new deal at Ayr United.

Shankland, 22, told the Ayrshire Post: “It’s a great club to be a part of. The main thing for this decision is that I am enjoying my football. The gaffer has been great with me and that’s why I came here. He gave me a chance to get back into football. I am happy and I don’t think there’s any amount of money that beats happiness.

Boss Ian McCall said: Lawrence could have doubled his money elsewhere and had offers from the Premiership up here and League One down in England. But the affection he has had from our supporters has played a huge part in his decision. It’s a huge piece of business for this club. Be in no doubt that Lawrence could easily have gone, but he has made a footballing decision.

After three years in the sport, he is number one in the world for his doubles category and number three in the world for singles. He competes in the mainstream tennis ranks and is in the top 10 for the South/West Scotland overall.

Since then we haven’t looked back and he has became a fantastic kid.  “You would never know he had this syndrome and that’s credit to the hard work done.” Dominic decided to give something back to the charities that have helped him over the years. He climbed Goat Fell with a group of friends and raised \u0026pound810 for Bibic and South Ayrshire Autistic Society. Anthony said: “We are very proud of him. “A lot of people now do fundraising for national charities but the local ones don’t get as much exposure or sponsors. We wanted to help Bibic as they were instrumental in helping the way Dominic is today and SAAS helped Dominic from a very young age.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"troon church help build new","story":"NewsTroon church to help build new school for hurricane victimsThe Troon church has raised £170,000 to help transform people’s lives in Haiti.\u0026nbspShareBySarah Hilley14:28, 7 JUN 2018NewsPastor Richard Woods with Minister Rolex visiting Muirhead Primary (Image: Copyright unknown)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email Building a school for hurricane victims was once a dream for Seagate Church.

The Ayrshire Hospice Starlight event has seen fundraising cash pouring in – with money still coming. Hundreds set off on the annual pilgrimage from Ayr Racecourse, which this year celebrated its tenth gig on the spin. Graham Strawhorn, the hospice’s fundraising officer, said: “We were once again very lucky with the weather and initial feedback from our walkers has been fabulous. “It will take time to receive sponsor money from all our walkers, however, I anticipate we will have raised in excess of \u0026pound50,000, which is an amazing amount for the Hospice. “It’s always a fantastic moment when all our walkers, supporters and sponsors finally congregate pre-walk in the Ayrshire Suite at the racecourse for this unique event, supporting the hospice in their own special way.  “Whether it is in support of a relative, friend or colleague who suffers from life limiting illness or in celebration/in memory of a loved one, events like the Starlight Walk always show us how amazing our community support is. “When we look around the Ayrshire Suite each year, we are reminded of how many people are touched by our cause and we are, as always, deeply grateful for their support and their fantastic fundraising efforts.” Graham added: “As always, funds raised from events like the Starlight Walk will be used to help improve the quality of each day for our patients, helping them to live as actively as they can to the end of their lives – however long that may be and wherever that may be.” The hospice requires to raise \u0026pound4.3 million each year to continue funding its critical service. Graham said: “The ongoing commitment, energy and passion from the community is humbling and is certainly support we couldn’t do without.” This year’s successful event was sponsored by Ayr Audi with support from the Ayrshire Post, Healthy Working Lives, Tesco, McKissock Electrical, The Cook School Scotland, Air Image Photography and South Ayrshire Council.

months old, Finn Mackin was diagnosed with a rare and dangerous form of leukaemia after a suspicious lump was found on one of his eyes.\nTumours developed and it was considered that chemotherapy was the Stonehaven toddler\u0027s only hope.\nBut several unsuccessful doses of treatment failed to cure him from cancer during a four-month stay at the Royal Aberdeen Children\u0026rsquos Hospital.\nAnd consultants decided the only remaining option of saving Finn\u0027s life was a high-risk stem cell transplant.\nDuring countrywide searches for donors, it was found that Anthony in Galashiels was the perfect match.\nThe youngster underwent a successful transplant at the end of 2015, followed by more than 50 blood transfusions, before eventually being declared cancer-free.\nFinn remains cancer-free

Anthony Nolan\u0026nbsppassed on my number and Finn\u0027s mum made contact.\n\"It turned out I was a perfect match for Finn - a 12 out of 12, which could only be bettered if he had a twin.\n\"I have

Immediately Jewson Campbeltown chipped in for a couple, leaving 13 up for grabs.CDJFA said a small part of this will help towards the running costs of the festival. The remainder will purchase new equipment.In June 2012, what started out as a return exchange with Lochgilphead resulted in CDJFA\u0026#8217s idea for an annual football festival. Soon teams from Oban, Islay and Tarbert attended, followed by central-belt squads.CDJFA caters for football in South Kintyre for children aged from three to 18.In February 2012, CDJFA joined Campbeltown Pupils AFC, Campbeltown Soccer Centre and educational football to form Campbeltown and District Community Football Club.It had the simple objective to bring all local football organisations under one umbrella for the first time.In August 2012, CDJFA elected a new committee which agreed to bring the soccer centre and school football under the auspices of CDJFA to avoid duplication of effort and to give children and youths as many opportunities to play football as possible.This also involved signing up to the SFA’s quality mark scheme, providing a coaching framework and a player pathway for children which leads to the  amateur football team Campbeltown Pupils AFC.In early 2013, with nearly 200 youngsters attending CDJFA sessions, it registered Campbeltown Pupils Youth FC with the SYFA and more exchanges home and away started.In August 2013, 2001s, U13s were accepted into the Dunbartonshire Football Development League (DFDL) – the first time a youth team in Campbeltown had played in a national league.In late 2013, CDJFA was awarded the SFA’s quality mark standard award in recognition of its efforts.In January 2015, CDJFA progressed to development status of the SFA’s quality mark scheme.In 2017, two 11-a-side teams were entered into the DFDL at 2005s and 2002s.Tomorrow parents and helpers will assemble at 9am on the Meadows to lay out the pitches.Kick-off for the 2006/07/08/09 seven-a-side age groups is 12.30pm with the 2010/11/12s and girls section at 1pm.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dinghy sailors delight at record may weather","story":"It particularly suited sailors at Campbeltown Sailing Club\u0026#8217s (CSC) reinstated Wednesday evening sessions organised by Kintyre Seasports Project\u0026#8217s Sid Gallagher.The action continues this Wednesday, from 7pm and all are welcome, especially total beginners, as all specialist equipment is provided.CSC\u0026#8217s Iain McGlashan said: \u0026#8216It is another good forecast for this Wednesday so some along if you can.\u0026#8216Wednesday evening sailing continues until  28 June.

It might make you laugh.Somewhere along the line, in the last five or six years, the world seems to have developed a serious crack in its funny bone.And I do mean serious, no crack intended.And there I go again, being flippant, trying to raise a smile in one or two readers, even if it might resemble a risus sardonicus. (It’s how people on Sardinia used to grin, that’s why.)It’s a congenital condition – like my idiocy, claims my wife– that ever since I was young I made outrageous statements and people would say to me: \u0026#8216You can’t be serious.\u0026#8217 \u0026#8216Not on a regular basis, no,\u0026#8217 was my usual reply.For the greater part of my 70-odd years, while laughter was still an acceptable knee-jerk reaction to almost anything, I prospered, in a vaguely penniless way, as a freelance writer of would-be humorous journalism.Nothing too fancy, no slipping on banana skins, but not rocket science either.  (Although the rotation of the Earth really makes my day.)In retrospect, I see now that my humour wasn’t serious enough. It had no underlying message.  It had no sociological content.  It was not of the variety that allowed people to feel wise, nod wisely, and say something wise, like: \u0026#8216Very wise…\u0026#8217The mistakes of the past – of my past – included trying to make people lose control and laugh aloud, rather than just being able to smirk knowingly at my cleverness, if I ever was.We live in a much more buttoned-up, uptight and insecure society than we used to (do you feel my sociological message approaching?) and it has affected the sort of things we feel we are permitted to laugh at, or not permitted to laugh at.Scorn and ridicule can no longer be directed at certain people with impunity – the dishonourable exception being bankers and politicians, of course, who are still fair game, and rightly so, even if out on bail and technically innocent because they haven’t been charged yet.But when did you last hear a blitz of jokes from a television comedian about a small, ethnic, obese, female bishop, even if she was his mother-in-law?Don’t worry, the news isn’t all bad, and I can report that sometimes outbreaks of laughter can occur in the most unusual places – Dundee, for example – and at the most unexpected times.Not long ago I saw a funeral procession led by a slow-marching, black-suited chaplain who was laughing his head off as he walked along in front of the hearse.As I watched in amazement, his happy demeanour began to affect his slow progress, which became a sprightly strut, and it seemed at any moment he might twirl his top hat in his hands, or even produce a rabbit from it.Only when I caught sight of the wireless device attached to his ear did I guess he was probably listening to dance music on a radio earbud. Death is no respecter of parsons.Let’s hope the worst extremes of political correctness will gradually fade away, as common sense brings a return to humorous nonsense, and seriousness wilts in the face of jocularity.A life without laughter?You must be joking.David Aitken,Dundee.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"flags fly as putting green opens","story":"There are 18 holes on the seaside green next to the children\u0026#8217s play park and staff also have three play tents, mats for younger children and a small selection of safe toys.South Kintyre Development Trust (SKDT) which manages the attraction has putters to suit all heights and a scorecard is provided.At the end of May SKDT was awarded £75,000 from the Big Lottery Fund (BLF).A BLF press release stated: \u0026#8216This funding will enable the organisation to not only continue but develop their activities at Campbeltown village hall.\u0026#8217At the opening were South Kintyre Development Trust\u0026#8217s Shaun Brown,  putting green staff Tina Chestnut and Peter Lusher with Morag McMillan. 25_c23puttinggreen01Baby Julia Skibinska, 11 months, was happy to play by the putting green. 25_c23puttinggreen02Cate McMillan, 11 months, chewed on some plastic ice cream. 25_c23puttinggreen03\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letter mok run thankyou","story":"The continued outstanding success of Mok Run race weekend is a reflection of the ever-increasing dedication and commitment its hard working committee, community volunteers, local businesses, enthusiastic runners and crowd supporter’s display year after year.On behalf of myself and the Mok Run committee I would like to say a massive thank you to those who contributed their free time and energy to make this happen for the 13th consecutive year.Each year we are given tremendous support from many individuals and organisations listed here and this is very much appreciated.Sincere thanks to: Campbeltown Co-op, Wee Toon Sports , McFadyens, Mach Dunes, Tunnocks, AM Transport, Argyll Bakeries, Seafield Hotel, Campbeltown Pottery, Kintyre Agricultural Society,  Jim Martin Supplies, Killegruer Caravan Site, Machrihanish Holiday Park, Glen Scotia, Spring Bank, Beinn An Tuirc, Live Argyll,  Stewart Balfour and Sutherland, Campbeltown Running Club, Jogscotland and Wee Toon Warriors.By supporting this event, you have made a concrete contribution to the greater community.I would also like to extend my grateful thanks to: all the MOK Run committee members who work tirelessly behind the scenes our race marshals \u0026#8211 without whom this event would not happen race sweepers  race day commentator Councillor John Armour Gavin Reid Johnny Durnan David McMillan Willie Ralston Barrs Clochkeil Councillor Donald Kelly Argyll and Bute Council amenities team Campbeltown Police Office Southend Scouts Campbeltown\u0026#8217s: Young Fire Fighters Coastguard Sea Cadets Police Scotland Youth Volunteers massage therapists Brass Band Kintyre Schools Pipe Band West Coast EMT Jamie G  South Kintyre Sports Council \u0026#8211 for making our legendary post race ceilidh such a success Dalintober primary pupils for their motivational posters to our photographers: John McFadyen Campbeltown Courier\u0026#8217s Mark Davey Kenny Craig and Greg and Norma Grogan for capturing the spirit of the weekend Fiona and Donna Robertson and all the Junior MOK Run volunteers and to many of our other volunteers who took the time to help on race day.Apologies if I have missed anyone.A special thank you once again goes to the residents of Limecraigs, for taking the time to decorate the street, provide well received ‘showers’ along with the local fire brigade ‘shower’ who came out in full force to cheer the runners on in the final leg of the 10K route.As one runner summed it up on our facebook page: \u0026#8216Fantastic day !\u0026#8216Thanking all the organisers, marshals, water-givers, water-hosers, sweety-givers, pipers, drummers, sandwich and pastry makers, and everyone else involved.

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.  After filming, a surprise screening of The Silent Child was organised by Rachel at Maisie\u0026rsquos school, Red Oaks Primary, in August.

Persimmon Homes is hoping to get the go-ahead \u0026ldquoin principle from East Lothian Council for the mixed-use development, which includes a commercial hub with hotel, retail facilities and cafe/restaurant.  Community facilities such as a residential neighbourhood centre, playing fields, changing facilities and public parks are proposed.  Also planned is the construction of a grade-separated junction on the A1, roads and foot/cycle paths, as well as improvement to the Musselburgh rail halt.  Submission of the planning application in principle follows a Proposal of Application Notice and public consultation exercise for the major scheme, which included an exhibition on the draft masterplan at The Brunton last year.  A planning statement from Holder Planning, acting for Persimmon, read: \u0026ldquoThe application site is allocated for the mixed use development proposed in the soon-to-be adopted East Lothian Local Development Plan.  \u0026ldquoThe proposed development will deliver 1,500 homes across the site. These homes will comprise a range of housing types. Twenty-five per cent of the housing provision will be affordable as defined by the council.  \u0026ldquoA primary school is proposed that will accommodate the requirements arising from residential development on the wider site. It is located centrally in the application site within walking distance of new homes via a network of paths that offer safe and convenient links. The detailed design will be in accordance with the requirements of the education authority, East Lothian Council.  \u0026ldquoThe masterplan proposes enhancing a pedestrian link under the A1 that will link the site areas together, allowing new neighbourhoods and services to the west, identified in the wider masterplan, to gain access to Musselburgh Station and services in Musselburgh.  \u0026ldquoThe proposal incorporates a significant network of multi-functional open spaces and semi-natural landscape areas, including allotments/community growing space, natural play areas, sports pitches and outdoor gym facilities, and seating. This framework of green space will contribute to the legibility of the neighbourhood\u0026rsquos spatial pattern, establishing distinct areas of new housing linked together via a network of green foot and cycle routes.  A new research and innovation quarter for East Lothian offering more than 20 hectares of new commercial space is proposed.  The planning statement added: \u0026ldquoWith strong links to the adjacent Queen Margaret University, the site offers the potential to build upon the reputation of Edinburgh and the Lothians for its research and innovation.  Barry Turner, spokesman for Musselburgh Conservation Society, said: \u0026ldquoThe issue at Craighall is that major development here will be very close to major development in Edinburgh at Newcraighall and in Midlothian at Shawfair, turning the whole area into a cross-boundary urban sprawl and effectively an extension to Edinburgh\u0026rsquos built-up area.  Predicting that the plan for 1,500 houses would be approved, given that was the number in the Local Development Plan, he added: \u0026ldquoAll that we can hope for is that conditions will be put in place to make this amount of housing as acceptable as possible in terms of layout, design, amenities and access to walking and cycling routes and to public transport.  \u0026ldquoOf note is that the secondary-age children here will have to get to Musselburgh Grammar School, which is some distance away and not an easy walk, certainly not from the other side of the A1.  \u0026ldquoThe recently promoted Active Travel Network shows no cycle link to Musselburgh Grammar School. We are worried about the prospect of increased car usage to get kids to and from school thus adding to the gradually worsening traffic problems in the town.  Jim Kirkpatrick, managing director of Persimmon Homes East Scotland, said: \u0026ldquoWe have had extensive engagement with East Lothian Council and the local community prior to the application being lodged and have generally been encouraged by the positive response to our masterplan.  \u0026ldquoThe comments of Musselburgh Conservation Society are noted and we believe the issues raised are addressed in the suite of information provided to the council.  \u0026ldquoThe application is fully compliant with the proposals contained within the emerging East Lothian Local Development Plan and we look forward to working with officers and other stakeholders during the determination process."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7864264.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"SEPA water quality report  how clean is the water at your beach ","story":"              A MUSSELBURGH beach has been branded \u0026lsquopoor\u0026rsquo for its water quality in a report by the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA).

Plans put forward by Dears Pharmacy were turned down by Lothian Health Board at a meeting last month.  A three-person Pharmacy Practices Committee (PPC) panel, chaired by East Lothian councillor Fiona O\u0026rsquoDonnell, unanimously refused the application.  The decision notice, published on NHS Lothian\u0026rsquos website, said that there were \u0026ldquono gaps in the existing provision of services within the neighbourhood as the other pharmacies in the area could provide the full range of pharmaceutical services.  For village residents, that means a trip to Gullane or Haddington.  The report adds: \u0026ldquoThe committee also noted that consultations by telephone were offered by one of the pharmacies in the area.  \u0026ldquoIt was also noted that extended hours provision was offered by Asda at The Jewel on the east side of Edinburgh, a distance of only 13 miles.  It also stated that there was a \u0026ldquohigh level of car ownership in the village and that public transport links were \u0026ldquogood, meaning residents could travel to other pharmacies.  However, the decision has been criticised by Dears Pharmacy and East Lothian MSP Iain Gray.  He said: \u0026ldquoI supported the application for a pharmacy, both because there is none in the village and because it could help keep the Post Office.  \u0026ldquoI was very disappointed with the decision to refuse it. I understand that there are laid-down criteria to be followed but in my view they must be wrong because they led to the wrong decision in this case.  \u0026ldquoI remain convinced that the people of Aberlady would benefit from a pharmacy without having to travel to Gullane, and have promised to support the application again if there is an appeal.  \u0026ldquoI will also be writing to the chief pharmacist and NHS Lothian about my concerns that the process is flawed.  Mahyar Nickkho-Amiry, operations director at Dears, confirmed to the Courier they would appeal the decision.  He described the decision as \u0026ldquoactive discrimination against village residents, adding: \u0026ldquoIt is a slap to the people of Aberlady. Because this is an affluent area, people are being forced to drive to Gullane or Haddington, whereas if the village was less affluent they would have stood more of a chance.  He said that had the proposals been approved, the pharmacy would have brought jobs to the village.  Donald Hay, chairman of Gullane Area Community Council, also criticised the decision.  He said: \u0026ldquoCommunity responses were not taken into account and the net result is the village could end up with no banking facilities, no Post Office and no pharmacy.  \u0026ldquoIt makes bleak reading for the village for the future.  The petition has gathered more than 700 signatures online since it was created.  Those who sign are also asked to give reasons online and Gary Hitchen wrote: \u0026ldquoI find it impossible to understand how this can have been refused.  \u0026ldquoThe provision of a pharmacy in Aberlady can only be a good thing and if it also ensures the future of the Post Office that is an added bonus.  \u0026ldquoVillages are being destroyed and turned into commuter satellites by local businesses closing \u0026ndash please don\u0026rsquot let Aberlady be next.

Between April 1 last year and the end of March 2018, 2,006 three-day emergency food supplies were given to local people.  Excluding holidays and weekends, it means that, on average, between eight and 10 food parcels are handed out Monday to Friday by the charity.  The number of three-day emergency food supplies distributed rose by 12 per cent from the previous year.  The figure mirrors what is happening across the UK, which has shown a 13 per cent increase in food parcels given out.  In 2017-2018 benefit changes/delays accounted for 757 East Lothian cases with 1,666 people affected, including 617 children. In addition, 595 cases were referred for emergency food due to being refused a crisis grant, affecting 937 people, of which 253 were under the age of 16.  A total of 31,604 kilos of food was given out last year by the county\u0026rsquos foodbank, with 50,292kgs donated.  Peter Dicker, foodbank manager, said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquoll continue to provide vital support when it matters most \u0026ndash we\u0026rsquore dedicated to ensuring that people in our community with no money for food are able to access emergency support, and that has only been possible in the last year because of the incredible generosity shown by local people in donating food, time and funds.  East Lothian MSP Iain Gray condemned the figures, saying: \u0026ldquoThese shocking figures underline the fact that problems with changes to the benefits system have made a significant contribution to the rise in foodbank referrals.  \u0026ldquoGovernments at Holyrood and Westminster can no longer sit back and accept the ever increasing number of people being forced to use foodbanks.

As many as 1,600 homes \u0026ndash as well as business units, a supermarket, primary school and various green spaces \u0026ndash are planned for the former opencast mine site at Blindwells.  The first housebuilder is expected to be announced this summer, with work on housing getting under way potentially by the end of the year.  In the meantime, preparatory work has been carried out on the site, which is sandwiched between the A1 north of Tranent and the A198 south of Cockenzie and Port Seton.  Now Hargreaves, which is behind the proposals, is looking to create an access to the site off the roundabout to the north of the A1 at Bankton Junction.  Iain Slater, development and estates director, said the new exit would be permanent, although it would initially be limited to construction traffic.  Other works are planned for the junction, which links the A1 with the A198.  Mr Slater said: \u0026ldquoAs part of the permission the road layout will be altered to allow for the additional cars generated from the Blindwells development.  \u0026ldquoThese works include widening of the A198 approaching the roundabout to increase capacity [as well as] the installation of a filter lane to allow cars leaving the A1 heading east to go round to Tranent without stopping at the roundabout. There are also plans for traffic lights to assist with traffic flows should the need arise.  As many as 350 jobs could be created during the lengthy building period at the site.  Construction work on the 1,600 homes could take 12-15 years, with early plans already drawn up for a second phase further to the east which could see another 1,600 homes, as well as leisure space and a cemetery."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7870497.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Tranent singer Caitlyn Vanbeck  39 s first single takes charts by storm","story":"              TRANENT singer Caitlyn Vanbeck\u0026rsquos first single flew up the charts when it was released on Monday.

Dad Michael, long-standing chairman of Gullane Sports Development Trust, said: \u0026ldquoWhen Jess passed away, we had a memorial service for her and decided to use it to donate to the Edinburgh Children\u0026rsquos Hospital Charity. Quickly thereafter, we learnt about an initiative involving music therapy they were running with Tinderbox Orchestra in the hospital. We met with one of the trustees initially and we decided to put in place something that would allow Jess to help other kids.  The memorial service, which was held at Aberlady Parish Church, raised more than \u0026pound2,000, with money continuing to be donated by members of the public and through organised events.  Michael, 52, said: \u0026ldquoWe were approached by Gullane and Aberlady Parish Churches and they asked if they could run an event in Jess\u0026rsquo memory, which they did last Sunday.  \u0026ldquoFrom the family point of view, it was another show of overwhelming support by the village and the community. We have raised a substantial amount of money. Gullane and Aberlady Parish Churches posted on Facebook that it had raised about \u0026pound1,800 for the fund and Gullane Athletic [FC] are running an event in August in support of the fund.  Twelve members of staff at North Berwick High School also took part in the recent Edinburgh Marathon Relay.  Split into three teams, they raised more than \u0026pound1,500 for The Royal Hospital for Sick Children Jess Mackie Memorial Fund, Richmond\u0026rsquos Hope and Leuchie House.  Jess, who was in S3 at the secondary school, was, like her twin sister Lauren, a keen singer.  Her dad told the Courier Jess \u0026ldquoloved singing and tried to help people and raise their spirits through her voice.  That love of singing and trying to help people has been mirrored through the success of the memorial fund, which sits at about \u0026pound9,800.  Michael added: \u0026ldquoI think that the fund reflects Jess completely. It reflects the impact she had while only 14 years old.  \u0026ldquoIt reflects the impact she had on people that she met and what she did in terms of her church singing, singing in local care homes, school concerts, helping out at various events like for the Bethany Christian Trust and Leuchie House. I think that reflects what she did while she was here.  The project aims to ensure children and young people who are feeling vulnerable in hospital are given the chance to enjoy music, which can have an enormous and positive impact, helping ignite a spark in them and giving them back a sense of control.  Michael added: \u0026ldquoMusic is a great comforter at times and what Tinderbox do is amazing for the kids.  \u0026ldquoWe had no hesitation in supporting what they do.  Janet Anderson, who is involved with the choirs at the two villages\u0026rsquo churches, also paid tribute to the talented teenager.  She said: \u0026ldquoI could not speak more highly of Jess.  \u0026ldquoShe did not think she had a special talent, she was just the most unassuming, normal girl you would ever meet.  \u0026ldquoShe was so pretty, so kind and so thoughtful and generous and she never thought she was anything special.

Chester, from Dunbar, is one of 13 pets, including cats, dogs and even a rat, taking part in the PDSA Pet Fit Club.  Together they weigh more than 200 kilogrammes and need to shed 75kg to reach their ideal weights.  Ten-year-old Chester, who lives with the Gilmour family on Newhouse Avenue, is looking to shift 2.6kg \u0026ndash or six pounds \u0026ndash to reach his ideal weight.  Chester, who tips the scales at 7.6kg, was gaining so much weight that his owners thought he must have an underlying medical condition. But when tests came back negative, it was clear Chester\u0026rsquos appetite and lazy ways were the root of the problem.  Owner Lisa said: \u0026ldquoWe realised everyone in the house was feeding him without knowing he\u0026rsquod already being fed, so he was getting fed by all four of us every day!  \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquove tried to help him lose weight, even putting a collar on him that says \u0026lsquoDo not feed me!\u0026rsquo for the neighbours, but that hasn\u0026rsquot worked.  \u0026ldquoHe eats whatever he can find including crisps left on the floor by the kids. He even stole my dad\u0026rsquos cheesecake that was on the kitchen counter! Another time my son woke up to the sound of rattling and he was trying to claw his way into a box of chocolates.  Lisa, along with partner Lindsay and sons Rhys and Ryan, got Chester when he was just a kitten.  Now they are determined to do what they can to help their pet lose some weight and be happier.  Lisa, who works in the family newsagent, added: \u0026ldquoHe\u0026rsquos getting older now and his weight will play on his joints if we don\u0026rsquot do something to help him. He can\u0026rsquot be comfortable carrying all that weight around and we want him to be happier and healthier as he ages.  Chester\u0026rsquos six-month Pet Fit Club diet and exercise programme will be specially tailored and overseen by the vets and nurses at Edinburgh PDSA Pet Hospital.  He is up against seven dogs, including a Cavalier King Charles spaniel who once ate a set of false teeth, a cat too fat to fit through the cat flap, and a rat who is double his ideal bodyweight.  If crowned the winner, Chester will receive a year\u0026rsquos supply of pet food, a pet-friendly holiday and a pet hamper.  Kathryn Marshall, PDSA Veterinary Care Assistant, will be helping to oversee Chester\u0026rsquos diet.  She said: \u0026ldquoWith the help of PDSA and Pet Fit Club, Lisa and Chester are making the necessary diet, exercise and lifestyle changes to help get Chester down to a healthier weight.  \u0026ldquoWe will support them every step of the way over the next six months to ensure they succeed."},{"url":null,"title":"Log found at Yellowcraig beach transformed into stunning violin","story":"              A VIOLIN maker has crafted a violin from driftwood found on an East Lothian beach to help raise awareness about the environment and the plight of the oceans.

Dean Conner, 33, of Links Avenue, has been handed an anti-social behaviour order (ASBO) following an application by East Lothian Council.  The court was presented with details of the alleged anti-social behaviour of Mr Conner, including shouting, swearing and fighting within a property at Links Avenue, and disposing of items and bags of rubbish outwith a domestic bin within the communal garden.  The terms of the ASBO prohibit Mr Conner from behaving in an anti-social manner including shouting and swearing at neighbours and other residents in and around Links Avenue.  He is also banned from having more than two visitors to his property at any one time except those who are there in the course of their employment.  Mr Conner had received an interim ASBO earlier this year.  A council spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThere is a significant history of anti-social behaviour complaints made against Mr Conner which has caused considerable alarm and distress to others.  \u0026ldquoEast Lothian Council, with the full support of Police Scotland, will take the strongest possible action against those who behave in an anti-social fashion.

Len Smith, 92, was conscripted at the age of 18 and was a supply lorry driver for the British Liberation Army.  He landed at Gold Beach, Normandy, where he said he was not shot at and saw little combat.  But he drove some of the first troops into Berlin in 1945 and moved supplies through a war-ravaged France, Belgium, Holland and Germany.  Despite his actions, modest Len, who went on to work in the civil service, said he had never thought of himself as veteran, never mind a hero.  He told the Courier: \u0026ldquoThere were thousands of young men like me. I never considered myself a veteran until the recent events marking the anniversary led to me looking back.  \u0026ldquoAt the time we just got on with it the real heroes are the soldiers who fought and died over there.  Mr Smith was one of eight children born in Pencaitland to local couple John and Euphemia Smith.  His sister Ellen, 97, still lives in Pencaitland and he visits the area regularly but after he was demobbed in 1947, Mr Smith moved to Longlevens, Gloucestershire, to find work.  Now a widower, Mr Smith\u0026rsquos sister sends him the Courier every week so he can keep up with local news.  His L\u0026eacutegion d\u0026rsquoHonneur medal was sent to his home in Cheltenham by post and contained a letter from Jean-Pierre Jouyet, French ambassador to the UK, which said: \u0026ldquoI offer you my warmest congratulations on this high honour, which recognises your military engagement and steadfast involvement in the liberation of France during the Second World War.  \u0026ldquoAs we contemplate this Europe of peace, we must never forget the heroes like you who came from Britain and the Commonwealth to begin the liberation of Europe by liberating France.  But Mr Smith insists he was just a young man doing a job.  He said: \u0026ldquoI didn\u0026rsquot know how the war was going, I didn\u0026rsquot read anything about the war. I was a young lad and I had no fear.  \u0026ldquoI just thought \u0026lsquoget on with it\u0026rsquo.  However, he remembers thinking about how worried his mother would be.  Len\u0026rsquos brothers James and Thomas were also in active service and James was in the D-Day landings. All three came home.  He said: \u0026ldquoWhen we came back my mum was overjoyed, she got three sons back uninjured.  Last year, Mr Smith returned to the Normandy beaches on a British Legion tour organised for veterans. He said: \u0026ldquoI wasn\u0026rsquot involved in the D-Day landings the people that were are the heroes."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7252400.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"  39 Important progress  39  at Knox Academy  say inspectors","story":"              A SECONDARY school which came under fire from Government inspectors last year has made \u0026ldquosome important progress.  Education Scotland visited Knox Academy in Haddington at the end of 2016 and told parents that the school needed to \u0026ldquorevisit its \u0026ldquovision and values.  The inspection report, which was released in March last year, highlighted a number of areas in which the school could improve. \u0026lsquoLeadership of change\u0026rsquo and \u0026lsquolearning, teaching and assessment\u0026rsquo were ranked as \u0026lsquosatisfactory\u0026rsquo, while \u0026lsquoensuring wellbeing, equality and inclusion\u0026rsquo was described as \u0026lsquoweak\u0026rsquo.  Inspectors returned to the school 12 months on from the original report for a follow-up inspection, which led to a new report being published on Tuesday.  The inspection team talked to young people at the school and worked closely with the interim headteacher Lauren Rodger, who is returning to North Berwick High School after the summer holidays.  She will be replaced by Susan Cook, currently acting headteacher at Trinity Academy, Edinburgh  Other members of staff were also spoken to, to hear about the steps the school had taken to improve on areas previously identified in the original inspection.  Education Scotland noted the following key improvements:  - The interim headteacher has provided effective leadership in taking forward work to secure improvements, including a review of the school values  - Staff have developed a range of policies to improve practice in equalities and inclusion, including a new safeguarding policy  - The recently created Pupil Support Faculty is now better placed to address the needs of young people, and those with social, emotional and behavioural needs in particular  - The school has made progress in establishing a more positive learning environment for all.  The report did note that there were still some improvements to be made.  Issues highlighted included using evidence from self-evaluation activities to ensure consistency in learning and teaching across the school reviewing the purpose of the pupil support base to ensure there was a greater focus on learning for the young people using it and ensuring there was a whole school approach to equalities and inclusion.  Fiona Robertson, head of education at East Lothian Council, praised staff at the school for their efforts.  She said: \u0026ldquoI am pleased that Education Scotland acknowledges that Knox Academy has made important progress since the last inspection, and I would like to thank all the staff and pupils for their hard work and commitment in making these improvements.  \u0026ldquoIt is really encouraging that the positive relationships between pupils and teachers, and the fact that almost all young people recognise the value of learning in their lives, was noted.  \u0026ldquoThis is a strong basis for ensuring that the school continues to be a positive learning environment for staff and pupils alike.  And she added: \u0026ldquoWe will continue to work with the school and Education Scotland to make further improvements, and to working with Susan Cook, our new headteacher, who joins the school in August.  Education Scotland will continue to work with East Lothian Council regarding the school\u0026rsquos capacity to improve and will return to carry out another inspection within 18 months."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7898185.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Thousands oppose Dunbar town centre parking charge plans","story":"              MORE than 2,000 people have signed a petition against the idea of parking charges being introduced on Dunbar High Street.  A public consultation looking at potential parking solutions throughout East Lothian came to a close last month.  Meetings and workshops were held throughout the county by East Lothian Council, including one in Dunbar Royal British Legion.  A number of suggestions were put forward, including for a disc parking system where visitors to the busy street would set a disc showing when they had parked.  Another idea being explored is parking charges \u0026ndash but that has met with the opposition of Dunbar Trades\u0026rsquo Association (DTA).  Philip Mellor, DTA chairman, said that the group \u0026ldquostrongly oppose the introduction of parking charges.  A petition, which was put in various businesses in the town, has attracted more than 2,000 signatures.  Mr Mellor added: \u0026ldquoThe DTA feel introducing parking charges to High Street and other key off-street parking areas will have a detrimental effect on our High Street and the local economy.  \u0026ldquoThe current system since the introduction of traffic wardens has already addressed concerns around space for shoppers on High Street and it now seems counterintuitive to then introduce a measure which will drive more customers away to out-of-town developments.  \u0026ldquoWhilst parking during heavy summer visitor times can be difficult, it is very few special event days where parking is congested enough to even consider parking charges viable the majority of the time parking is available and this potential charge seems to be nothing more than a money-raising exercise at the expense yet again of already-struggling independent business owners.  A spokesman for East Lothian Council said \u0026ldquoall responses would be taken into consideration as it looked to develop a strategy.  He added: \u0026ldquoThe draft Local Transport Strategy (LTS) sets out ways in which the council can meet both national and local objectives sustainably, while supporting the local economy and environment.  \u0026ldquoOur consultation on the draft LTS recently closed and we are grateful to everyone who responded or attended one of our workshops.

John, 35, from Port Seton, won \u0026pound1 million in the EuroMillions draw on June 26, 2015, but he remained in his job as a roofer, insisting he wanted to keep working.  He took on the challenge to climb more than 4,400 feet and faced treacherous weather conditions to mark the Lottery\u0026rsquos milestone and tick off a lifelong dream from his bucket list.  It comes as new research reveals that more than half of the millionaires are now spending more on experiences rather than possessions.  Looking at their shopping trends across time, out have gone designer watches, ride-on mowers, racehorses and conservatories, and in have come protecting woodlands, paying university fees and bar/games rooms.  John said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove always wanted to climb Ben Nevis so when the opportunity arose, I was up for the challenge.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom not an avid hill walker, nor do I have much climbing experience, so I was a bit nervous as I knew I would have my work cut out \u0026ndash but excited to be part of this once-in-a-lifetime celebration.  \u0026ldquoScotland was looking glorious in the sunshine when we initially left ground level however, the conditions quickly changed as we reached the halfway mark \u0026ndash typical Scottish weather!  \u0026ldquoVisibility was poor, I couldn\u0026rsquot see two or three feet in front of me, and the wind speeds were averaging 40mph.  \u0026ldquoThe heavy snow on the ground made it more challenging \u0026ndash but to me, it was all part of the adventure.  \u0026ldquoWith tough climbing, there were moments I was unsure if I was going to make it to the top, so I can\u0026rsquot put into words how I felt when I finally reached the summit.  \u0026ldquoTo know I was standing on the UK\u0026rsquos highest peak was an unbelievable achievement, made all the better with a chilled glass of champagne in my hand.  \u0026ldquoI was honoured that the National Lottery asked me to participate in this opportunity out of all the millionaires in Scotland \u0026ndash it\u0026rsquos certainly one I will never forget.

Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said extending the March 29 departure date is one of a number of \u0026ldquodifferent scenarios that could be pursed if a withdrawal agreement fails to materialise in the coming months.  In an interview with Irish broadcaster TV3, Mr Varadkar also raised the prospect of scheduling an extra EU Council summit this year if sufficient progress is not made by October\u0026rsquos crunch meeting.  The autumn summit is seen by many as an effective deadline for a withdrawal treaty to be sealed ahead of ratification by member states.  An exit deal is seemingly still a distance away. The EU and UK remain at odds over the shape of a \u0026ldquobackstop position to maintain free movement at the Irish border, if a wider trade deal is not ultimately agreed, with Prime Minister Theresa May struggling to secure consensus within her own Cabinet.  Mr Varadkar said while his government was making contingency plans for a hard Brexit, he insisted that preparatory work did not include for the provision of infrastructure on the 310-mile frontier with Northern Ireland.  When the UK formally notified the EU in March 2017 of its intention to leave the union \u0026ndash by triggering Article 50 of the Lisbon treaty \u0026ndash a two-year deadline for its exit was automatically set.  Stressing that a no-deal scenario is still hypothetical, Mr Varadkar added: \u0026ldquoYou\u0026rsquoll know that there are a number of different scenarios that could arise if we\u0026rsquore in a no-deal situation.  \u0026ldquoFor example, it is possible to extend Article 50, to allow more time for negotiations to take place. There is the possibility of an interim deal, or a transition period, pending an outcome or final negotiations around the transition period.  \u0026ldquoBut one of our red lines \u0026ndash and this should be no surprise to anyone \u0026ndash is that we cannot countenance a hard border with physical infrastructure, with customs and checks \u0026ndash all of those things \u0026ndash between Northern Ireland and Ireland.  \u0026ldquoThat would be an abrogation of the Good Friday Agreement, a solemn agreement we made 20 years ago, and a legal agreement that is registered with the United Nations, signed by the United Kingdom Government.  On the prospect on an additional EU Council summit, something suggested by his predecessor as taoiseach Enda Kenny, Mr Varadkar said: \u0026ldquoEnda Kenny in his speech made a very valid point.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove heard some people talking about the possibility of a crunch late-night meeting in Brussels in late October, something akin to a last-minute budget compromise or a Fisheries Council.  \u0026ldquoThat, of course, as he pointed out, will not be the case \u0026ndash because when the EU member states, the 27 of us, discuss Brexit, we discuss it without the UK in the room. So this won\u0026rsquot be a drafting session \u0026ndash we\u0026rsquoll have to have agreement in advance of the summit in October.  \u0026ldquoEnda Kenny suggested that if we aren\u0026rsquot in a position to do that, we may need an extra meeting \u0026ndash perhaps in September or October, or even after that, in November. I think that was a very helpful suggestion that will have to be considered.  \u0026ldquo(It\u0026rsquos) too soon to make a decision on that, but we\u0026rsquoll have to consider it in the months ahead."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/6511581.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Petition over Cockenzie site taken to Holyrood","story":"              PRESSURE has been piled on the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos planning minister as local politicians demanded he reverse a decision to call in plans for the former Cockenzie Power Station site.  Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard MSP last week met East Lothian Labour Party campaigners at Holyrood as they delivered a petition signed by more than 1,000 people to Kevin Stewart MSP.  While Councillor Lachlan Bruce, ward member for Preston, Seton, Gosford was joined by South of Scotland MSP Michelle Ballantyne, both Conservative, as they sent letters to Mr Stewart calling for the same action (see image inset).  The campaign comes after the minister called in a planning application by Inch Cape Offshore Ltd (ICOL) to build a substation \u0026ndash which would bring energy ashore from a planned offshore wind farm \u0026ndash on a large section of the site, which was recently purchased by East Lothian Council from ScottishPower.  That sparked cross-party condemnation from county politicians, who fear it could jeopardise local plans to create jobs and boost the economy on the site.  Mr Leonard added his signature to the Hands Off Cockenzie petition before it was submitted.  Iain Gray (Lab), East Lothian MSP said: \u0026ldquoMinisters claim the call-in is because the site is of national importance, but even the leader of the SNP Group on East Lothian Council has condemned the decision as unnecessary.  \u0026ldquoBy signing our petition in such large numbers, local people have sent a clear message they want East Lothian to decide on decisions about the future of the site.  Meanwhile, Mr Bruce said he had asked Mr Stewart to send the decision back to the council. He said: \u0026ldquoI think it is only right that this decision is made locally by the council on behalf of local residents.

Poundworld, which is owned by TPG Capital, has 335 stores.  The stores in and around Glasgow set to go are:\u0026nbspClydebank, Cumbernauld, East Kilbride, Glasgow Argyle, Glasgow Forge, Glasgow Forge Retail Park, Greenock, Hamilton, Motherwell, Paisley, Port Glasgow, Shawlands and Wishaw.  Bargain Buys in\u0026nbspAirdrie, Kilmarnock and Paisley will also close.  Poundworld\u0027s collapse comes after both Toys R Us and Maplin fell into administration earlier this year.  Deloitte will try to find a buyer for the business, and has said there are no redundancies or store closures at this time.  Clare Boardman, joint administrator at Deloitte, said: \u0026ldquoThe retail trading environment in the UK remains extremely challenging and Poundworld has been seeking to address this through a restructure of its business. Unfortunately, this has not been possible.  She said the business was hit by falling footfall, alongside rising costs and weak consumer confidence.  A spokesman for TPG said putting the business into administration was a \u0026ldquodifficult decision.  \u0026ldquoWe invested in Poundworld because of our belief in how the company serves its customers and the strength of its employees, he added.  \u0026ldquoDespite investing resources to strengthen the business, the decline in UK retail and challenging behaviour affected Poundworld significantly.  It is understood that TPG and Poundworld\u0026rsquos management rejected offers to buy the business out of a pre-pack administration, and were hoping to sell it as a solvent business.  Other parties named as possible buyers were turnaround specialist Alteri Investors and Poundworld\u0026rsquos founder Chris Edwards.  But a deal could not be struck.  Poundworld\u0026rsquos losses widened in 2016-17 to \u0026pound17.1 million, from \u0026pound5.4 million of losses the year before.  The news came just days after House of Fraser detailed its plans to shut 31 stores, affecting around 6,000 jobs.  House of Fraser is seeking landlord approval for the restructuring plan, which is a form of insolvency known as a Company Voluntary Agreement (CVA).  A raft of CVAs have been struck in recent months as retailers struggle amid surging costs, rising business rates, competition from online rivals and a slowdown in consumer spending.  Other retailers undertaking CVAs in a bid to keep trading include New Look, Mothercare and Carpetright.  Restaurant businesses have also been seeking to cut their costs with store closure programmes, with Carluccio\u0026rsquos, Byron and Prezzo all pushing through CVAs this year.

The Edinburgh parade was part of Processions, a mass participation artwork taking place simultaneously in the capitals of the UK to mark the achievements of the women\u0026rsquos suffrage movement.  The women and girls on the march wore suffragette colours of green, violet and white and were choreographed to appear as a moving suffragette flag.  The Edinburgh participants gathered at the Meadows before heading off through the city, ending by marching down the Royal Mile to the sounds of a piper playing Flower Of Scotland and past the Scottish Parliament.  Those taking part spanned all ages and many carried banners covering a range of causes.  These included embroidered banners thanking the \u0026ldquosister suffragettes, others proclaiming the suffragette slogans \u0026ldquoEquality for Women and \u0026ldquoDeeds Not Words and some simply stating \u0026ldquo100 years.  Modern political causes were also in evidence, with banners for the WASPI women fighting for pension equality.  Political parties were among the groups taking part in the parade, which was open to women and girls and those identifying as such, and other organisations involved included the Girl Guides and the Scottish Women\u0026rsquos Institute.  The event was produced by Artichoke and commissioned by 14-18 NOW, the UK\u0026rsquos arts programme for the First World War centenary.  Cabinet Secretary for Culture, Tourism and External Affairs Fiona Hyslop said: \u0026ldquoProcessions is a great opportunity to celebrate the centenary of some women getting the vote, an important milestone in our country\u0026rsquos history.  \u0026ldquoAs we mark this anniversary and while we have come a long way since 1918, this event also offers an occasion for us all to reflect on the challenges and opportunities that still lie ahead.  \u0026ldquoEquality for women is at the heart of the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos vision for an equal Scotland and our Programme for Government set out our ambitions, including legislating for gender balance on public sector boards, creating a new Advisory Council on Women and Girls, and piloting a returners project to help women back in to the workplace after a career break.  \u0026ldquoOur goal for all women and girls \u0026ndash in Scotland and around the world \u0026ndash is that they have a fair chance to succeed in life, no matter their gender.

Businessman Arron Banks, the founder of the Leave. EU group, is due to give evidence to the Commons inquiry into \u0026lsquofake news\u0026rsquo this week.  After initially refusing, he has now agreed but says he is the victim of a \u0026ldquowitch hunt.  In his book, The Bad Boys of Brexit, Mr Banks admitted a single meeting with the Russian Ambassador to the UK, Alexander Yakovenko, in September 2015.  However the Sunday Times and Observer reported an email trail revealing further meetings between the two men and Leave.EU spokesman Andy Wigmore.  At one meeting, in November 2015, the day after the Leave.EU launch, the ambassador introduced Mr Banks and Mr Wigmore to a Russian businessman who offered a potentially highly lucrative business deal involving six Russian goldmines.  Mr Banks also visited Moscow in February 2016, during the referendum campaign.  And in November 2016, three days after Mr Banks and Mr Wigmore met President-elect Donald Trump in New York, they had a lunch with the ambassador.  Mr Banks told the Sunday Times he also handed over phone numbers for members of Mr Trump\u0026rsquos transition team to Russian officials.  Damian Collins, chair of the Commons Digital, Culture, Media and Sport committee, said the discovery of the links was \u0026ldquobig news and very relevant to his \u0027fake news\u0026rsquo inquiry.  He told BBC Sunday Politics that the public had a \u0026ldquoright to know the nature of the contacts.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe want to understand more to what extent Mr Banks profited from his relationship with the Russian embassy. Did he make money out of it?  \u0026ldquoDid he use that money to fund campaigns? If he didn\u0027t then that\u0027s fine but given the prominent role he played we\u0027ve got the right to ask these questions.\"  Mr Banks, who gave \u0026pound12m in donations to Ukip and the Leave side, told the Sunday Times: \u0026ldquoI had two boozy lunches with the Russian ambassador and another cup of tea with him. Bite me. It\u0026rsquos a convenient political witch-hunt, both over Brexit and Trump.  He later joked to Reuters that he was \u0026ldquostill waiting for the cheque from Moscow.  He said: \"This is just complete, absolute garbage - it is like the Salem witch hunt. They just keep on screaming \u0027witch\u0027, \u0027witch\u0027. They are trying to discredit everyone involved in Brexit.\"  Mr Wigmore said Leave.EU never offered any campaign information to any Russian.  The extent of the links with Russia was revealed in a cache of 40,000 emails shared by Mr Banks and Mr Wigmore with the journalist Isabel Oakeshott, who ghost-wrote The Bad Boys of Brexit.  She said the two men had been \u0026ldquoshamelessly used by the Russians, but that did not invalidate the judgment of the 17.4m people who voted to leave the EU.  Leave.EU was last month fined \u0026pound70,000 for breaching election law in the EU referendum.  The Electoral Commission said the group, which was separate from the official Vote Leave campaign, failed to report at least \u0026pound77,380 of its spending.  It has also referred Leave.EU chief executive Liz Bilney to the police.  Mr Banks called it a \"politically motivated attack\"."},{"url":null,"title":"Film festival brings more talent to its opening night gala","story":"              Film festival chiefs have announced more talent to their line-up of stars ahead of an opening night gala.

Transport minister Humza Yousaf said the legislation would give local authorities a new model to revitalise bus services.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe are also providing clearer options for authorities to pursue local franchising or provide services themselves in appropriate circumstances.  \"Beyond bus services, this Bill will allow for decriminalised enforcement of low emission zones, double parking and parking on pavements.  \"This will help transform our towns and cities into cleaner, more accessible and more pleasant spaces to travel and enjoy.
