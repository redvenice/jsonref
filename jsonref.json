Heard filed for orce the following year, and the orce was finalized in 2017.The former spouses have both been in court during three weeks of testimony at the grand neo-Gothic court building.Ms Wass reminded Mr Justice Nicol there were \u0027well-documented episodes of violence and destruction\u0027 over Depp\u0027s adult life and that the actor had accepted he was violent to inanimate objects but not people.However, she said there was an incident earlier in his career when he assaulted a photographer with a plank of wood when under the influence of drink and drugs.She also said his evidence that he was not violent towards people was \u0027meaningless\u0027 when he was as intoxicated as he was on occasions and \u0027wouldn\u0027t have known what he was doing\u0027.Ms Wass continued: \u0027In answer to what we suggest is overwhelming evidence of domestic violence or wife-beating behaviour, catalogued over a three-year period between 2013 and 2016, Mr Depp\u0027s response is to claim that he is a victim of an elaborate hoax that has been perpetrated against him by Ms Heard and her friends.\u0027The barrister said Depp had accused Heard and her friends of \u0027having painted on injuries, manipulated photographs and destroyed property which they then went on to photograph in order to create what he describes as some sort of insurance policy for Ms Heard\u0027.Ms Wass added: \u0027What exactly Ms Heard was insuring against in the course of this hoax remains unexplained.\u0027She told the court that such a hoax \u0027would have entailed Ms Heard engaging in a pre-planned conspiracy over the period of the entire relationship with Mr Depp\u0027, adding: \u0027Such a suggestion, we say, is risible.\u0027Ms Wass told the court: \u0027The approach taken by Mr Depp from the time Ms Heard obtained a domestic violence restraining order against him on May 27 2016 was as follows: to deny that he ever assaulted Ms Heard, to accuse Ms Heard of being the violent party and to reverse his role with hers.\u0027"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/27/09/0C068B1800000578-5548741-Kate_and_Gerry_McCann_mark_the_fourth_anniversary_of_the_disappe-m-2_1524816157149.jpg","title":"Madeleine McCann investigators resume digging German allotment","story":"Share this articleShare this articleFall Maddie: Polizei setzt Spurensuche in Garten bei Hannover fortFall Maddie in Hannover: Ermittler finden Keller auf Gartengelände - News Inland - Bild.de"},{"url":null,"title":"Oldham overtakes lockdown Leicester highest second coronavirus infection rate England","story":"Share this articleExplained: What caused Oldham\u0027s new coronavirus crisis, where are the spikes in infection rates and how will the town get out of this?

For it to be a successful night, remember it’s all in the planning ... Since coronavirus has shrunk our social spheres, intimate garden parties have become something of a trend. Thanks to street-wide WhatsApp chats and local volunteer groups, eclectic new friendships have been forged – and as the weather’s improved, online quizzes with distant relatives have segued into alfresco drinks with new and nearby friends.While we’re all being urged to stay alert, the easing of lockdown rules means we can meet up with more of our friends. Outside the permitted bubbles in each area, the 2-metre rule remains in place in Scotland and Wales, while iniduals in England and Northern Ireland must stay at least 1 metre apart.But groups of friends can now gather together outside – any sized group from up to two households can meet in Wales up to six people from different households in England, with no limit on people from two different households in Northern Ireland, groups of up to 30 people can meet and in Scotland, up to 15 people from up to five different households can meet outside per day – all while keeping a distance.All of which means summer isn’t cancelled, it just looks somewhat different to how we imagined – but we can still get ready to brush up on our barbecuing and hosting skills.Now it’s trickier to go to the corner shop for extras, planning is of the essence. Here are our tips for hosting the perfect post-lockdown barbecue, and enjoying a safely sociable summer.Be considerateThe first rule of new-normal socialising is to be respectful of everyone’s boundaries. You might not mind sharing food with your guests, but others might be more anxious. Find out what everyone’s comfortable with before you plan your party – and if one of your friends would prefer to bring their own food, be prepared to be OK with that.Shop smartThanks to socially distanced shopping, the etiquette of putting on a barbecue has changed, too – it’s now perfectly reasonable to ask people to bring their own food or drink if they want something specific. Meanwhile, make sure you provide enough basics, to avoid a dash to the shops, mask in hand. You can find barbecue calculators online that will tell you how much meat, veg, side dishes and drink to buy depending on the number of people attending.Buy localWhile your online shop is ideal for stocking up on basics, a barbecue is the perfect excuse to explore your local area and uncover some hidden foodie gems. From artisan ciabatta rolls and locally produced meats, to small-batch chutneys, cheeses and ale, it’s a great time to support the independent stores reopening after lockdown. As well as boosting the economy, buying locally sourced produce keeps your carbon footprint clean, too.Stock up on masksJust as you’d make sure a guest didn’t drive home after a few drinks, protecting them if they have to get a cab or public transport home is equally thoughtful. Buy some masks to hand out to anyone who might suddenly need one at the end of the evening.Play it safeYou can’t control the weather – but you can make sure staying safe feels like a natural part of the party, rather than a chore. Put out plenty of hand sanitisers and wipes for guests, hand out glasses marked with their names, and hang 2-metre-long strips of bunting as a visual reminder not to mingle too closely. Spacing out your garden furniture around a central hub, such as a fire pit, will also help remind people to keep a distance without dampening the atmosphere.Create a signature dishWith more of us cooking at home than ever, it’s worth taking the time to develop a dish that will really wow your guests. Whether it’s making a lip-smacking vegan pulled “pork” (try BOSH’s for inspiration) or perfecting an all-American regional burger (make George Motz your go-to for recipes), head to your local butcher or farmers’ market, and start planning a grill everyone will remember for the right reasons.This advertiser content was paid for by the UK government.

While there, he spent the whole time refreshing his phone. He originally intended the work to be a short animation, but was convinced by his agent to try writing a book instead.“Long story short, after a tax bill came through I was like, ‘I need to learn how to write books.’ So I went to Waterstones and studied the hell out of some picture books,” he said.He then approached his friend Dapo Adeola, an illustrator and character designer, and asked him to draw the character of Rocket. “I just told him she was a black girl, with big hair, and glasses – it was like he had a cable to my brain,” said Bryon.Adeola said his depiction of Rocket was inspired by one of his nieces. “I tried to capture her curiosity and zest for knowledge in Rocket’s mannerisms as well as her innocently self-assured attitude to problem solving, traits that should be celebrated in both boys and girls. At the time I looked around and space in picture books was dominated by young boys, young white boys, to be precise. I wanted to see what I could do that was original, and stands out.”Bryon said that reading the book to children at events had been “incredible”. “When you read the story out loud to kids, they don’t lie, if they find it boring they’ll tell you. We had the exact opposite,” he said. “We were reading it to groups of school kids, a hundred at a time. A lot of them, the minute they see Rocket and her big brother Jamal, especially young black kids, their eyes light up. When you see something that represents you, that’s a really powerful moment.”Waterstones children’s buyer Florentyna Martin said that Look Up! had recast the “mould of traditional picture-book storytelling for a new era”, and that Rocket was “a little person with big dreams, who has captured our hearts”, praising her “boundless enthusiasm, curious nature and kind spirit as a hero for us all”.Look Up! won both the overall Waterstones children’s book of the year prize, and the illustrated book category. Liz Hyder’s young adult dystopia Bearmouth won the older readers’ category, while High-Rise Mystery, Sharna Jackson’s whodunnit starring sister sleuths Nik and Norva, took the category for younger readers.Bearmouth, in which the protagonist, Newt, has worked in a coalmine since the age of four, is a “powerfully atmospheric story … with an addictive narrative”, said Martin, while High-Rise Mystery was praised as “a fresh, pacey and exciting angle for the genre”.Jackson said she had loved the mystery genre since she was small, but felt that “the typically posh, vintage, white and stuffy characters and settings were due an update”.High-Rise Mystery was an experiment “to see if mystery’s codes and conventions could be transposed to today in a new context, to a working-class setting, led by two contemporary, clever and funny black girls”.“I like to think that winning this prize means that the experiment was a success, so thank you,” she said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3f4a1872f0dc6f3dee966f375180f1f3e94c5877/0_150_3633_2180/master/3633.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n\u0026s=ac5141f84e7385c7be626b449b8d0057","title":"the future of education or just hype the rise of minerva the worlds most selective university","story":"A Silicon Valley startup could offer a template for universities shifting their courses online due to coronavirus No one could accuse CEO and businessman Ben Nelson of lacking ambition. “I wanted to create a university that serves as a model for other institutions, by being indisputably the best university in the world,” he says, bouncing up and down on a video call from his San Francisco office. “Unless you demonstrate that you are the absolute best, that you can provide an education that Harvard, Cambridge and Oxford cannot come close to, no one will listen. And we are doing exactly that.”The other draw is Minerva’s unusual curriculum, which is rooted in Nelson’s student campaigning at the University of Pennsylvania 25 years ago. “I realised that colleges were fundamentally failing in their promise to educate,” he says. “A liberal arts education is supposed to teach students to think freely, critically and logically. But our elite universities no longer do that at all.”The Minerva offering is very different to what most UK students were accustomed to, prior to the coronavirus pandemic shifting universities online. There are no lectures, faculty buildings, or exams. All teaching is done through online video classes. There is only one programme of study for first years, and rather than reading maths or history, students take courses aimed at teaching transferrable skills such as critical thinking and problem-solving, through classes named “multimodal communications”, “empirical analyses” and “complex systems”. Subject specialisms are chosen in the second year. There is no campus students are housed in a residence hall in San Francisco in their first year. Subsequent year groups spend semesters variously in Seoul, Hyderabad, Berlin, Buenos Aires, London and Taipei.The first undergraduate class enrolled in 2014. Among them was British teenager Kayla Cohen, who, armed with top A-level grades, had been selected out of 2,000 applicants to join a cohort of just 30 freshers. “It was a privilege, it was exciting,” says Cohen, now a 25-year-old graduate. “I remember the thrill of going to San Francisco, meeting my class, and feeling like I was joining the birth of something special.”Twenty-year-old Jade Bowler has just completed her first year at Minerva, and admits she was sceptical when she first learned about the institution from an online advert. “I was half-convinced it was a scam, it sounded like a cult,” she says. Bowler originally planned to read biology at Bristol University, so there was surprise when she decided to go to an obscure new US university. “I posted about my choice on social media and had thousands of people telling me not to go. But I just had a gut feeling that this was the future of education.”Minerva’s appeal, Bowler says, was its practical teaching style. “It’s so different from just sitting in a lecture theatre. You learn as you do, not learn by rote. And I have learned so much more in the past year than in any year of my life.”Study after study has shown the efficacy of active learning, and Nelson says Minerva has taken that research and implemented it. As such, professors are not supposed to speak in classes for any longer than a few minutes at a time, and students are expected to contribute to class discussions and group work.The online live video platform Forum is instrumental in facilitating this. “To achieve this kind of education, you have to have data,” says Nelson. “You have to actually be able to track how engaged every single student is.” This is achieved through a system that colour-codes students based on how much they talk in class.Allison Littlejohn, professor of learning technology at University College London, worries about the implications of data gathering for students. “Staff can see when a student logs on, how long they spend on an activity, how much they contribute to a discussion. There are real problems with this method: it puts a lot of pressure on students, and there are issues with privacy and surveillance. Everything a student does is monitored.”Currently half a dozen UK students have offers to study at Minerva this autumn. But despite its undeniable novelty, Littlejohn is doubtful that a university without lecture halls, societies and sports teams has mass appeal. “Lots of people go to campus-based universities not just for love of their subject, but for the whole experience of being a student on a campus, and all the social and extracurricular opportunities that offers,” she says. But Nelson believes the lack of a campus is a draw for some students. “At Minerva, you live in the heart of a city, in seven different countries,” he says. “There’s no campus cafeteria, or bar, or gym – your gym is the gym at the end of the road. Instead, you live as an adult in a city. You learn to be a global citizen.”Either way, Minerva’s innovations certainly pose a challenge to a sclerotic university model in both the US and the UK. Even if the venture does not upend the landscape of higher education in the way Nelson intends, campuses across the world will at some point have to address the deficiencies he identifies – and many already are as a result of the pandemic.“Many campuses are now realising the importance of flexible online learning, flipped classrooms, and interdisciplinary programmes,” Littlejohn agrees. But she adds: “There will always be a place for the campus, and for in-person teaching. At a campus with world-leading researchers, you see how academics spend their time and what they do. You see first-hand how knowledge is created.”The other crucial question is what’s really driving the success of Minerva’s graduates. Nick Hillman, director of the Higher Education Policy Institute, says: “A mix of excellent pre-university qualifications and a hyped-up higher education is likely to be a winning one. It is worth noting that it is much easier to deliver an excellent education to people with high prior qualifications than to students with more challenging backgrounds.”For the time being, Minerva graduates seem satisfied with their gamble. “I’ve learned so much, and I’m not sure I’d leave any other university with that same conclusion,” says Liberty Pim, who has just finished her final year. “Minerva built a completely new university without the constraints of a traditional university. When I applied it felt like a big risk, but it paid off.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f5390906082c236a013494e14959bad0980e13e8/0_24_1024_614/master/1024.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=fc9563f392444d31e282179d1c84edbf","title":"tomboy celine sciamma south korea box office","story":"Céline Sciamma’s 2011 sophomore effort has become an unlikely hit thanks to South Korea’s own feminist reckoning – and the clever use of merchandiseTomboy, the second film by Portrait of a Lady on Fire director Céline Sciamma, premiered at the Berlin film festival almost a decade ago in 2011. Following a summer in the life of a 10-year-old who’s recently moved to a new neighbourhood, the film won acclaim (and criticism, when it was included in the curriculum in French schools) around the world for its depiction of a child experimenting outside gender norms, and has built up a steady fanbase ever since.But it was never released in South Korea – at least, not until Portrait of a Lady on Fire swept the country’s box office earlier this year to the tune of nearly 150,000 admissions, becoming the most successful French film in Korea for more than five years. After that success, Tomboy was released on 14 May, and at time of writing, has had over 30,000 admissions, and tens of thousands of Instagram posts using the hashtag 톰보이 (literally Tomboi in Korean).This isn’t just a one-off, however. It’s the latest example of a continuing interest in female-directed and driven stories among Korean audiences. Seoul Pride film festival organiser and activist Dave Kim suggests that interest in women’s rights in South Korean society has risen dramatically in recent years, impacting not only real life but also what is popular at the cinema. “After #MeToo in 2018, there was a rising support for feminism in Korea. This has strongly affected the arthouse film market also. The main audience group is young women and they have become more willing to watch more films with a feminist idea or directed by a female director.”Seoul-based producer and film journalist Pierce Conran agrees. “A lot of the indie successes over the last year or two in Korea have been about marginalised women, films about young women or girls … and themes of identity,” he says. “Portrait of a Lady on Fire was able to latch on to that in a big way.”#MeToo has had a dramatic effect in South Korea. The country had always ranked low among OECD countries on women’s rights, particularly in terms of pay parity and the number of women in political roles. South Korea had its Harvey Weinstein equivalent in An hee-jung, a high-flying politician brought down by sexual assault allegations. As in the US and Europe, it prompted a similar wave of women sharing their experiences and support. But Tomboy’s success is also down to a uniquely astute form of marketing, particularly on social media. South Korea’s biggest cinema attendees are young people, particularly women aged between 20 and 35. Like a number of independent releases in South Korea, Tomboy’s distributor offered ingeniously designed special pins, decorative tape and photo cards that depict key scenes from the film, handed out at special screenings or awarded after seeing the film a certain number of times. One set of pins, for example, mirrors a scene in Tomboy with the young protagonist’s first kiss, with folds in the presenting card enabling the characters’ eyes to be covered. .“More and more people are collecting these items to remember and celebrate the movies,” says designer Oh Sebeom. “Audiences now want to see not only the beauty of the merchandise, but also how they capture the meaning and details of the movie.” According to Oh, the benefit isn’t purely to turn a profit: these items aren’t mass produced like collectible popcorn buckets but limited-edition pieces designed to sustain interest throughout a film’s theatrical run. Scroll Instagram and you’ll see countless posts of these sold-out items from fans. “The audience was able to naturally promote the movie on social media,” says Choi Yuri, chief executive of OURS, the marketing firm working on the film, predicting that the popularity of such promotional items “will grow even more”.But do gimmicks like this work? Just look at the box office figures. Though South Korea’s population of 51 million is dwarfed by those of Russia and China, the country is frequently at the top of global box office grosses, and increasing year on year. Latest reports from UniFrance and Statista found that South Koreans attended cinemas on average 4.3 times each in 2019, much more often than people in the UK (2.64 times), Australia (3.38 times), or the US (3.77 times). Even after the Covid-19 outbreak, while occupancy limits were imposed and major studio releases were postponed, South Korean cinemas never closed, giving increased opportunities for independent films such as Tomboy, which normally have to fight for screens.“That mindset is prominent – you see so many collectibles for different films,” says Hieu Chau, a film programmer and founder of the website Filmed in Ether. Chau points to other forms of entertainment – K-pop, for example – that are able to drive a fervent social media following through similar experiential elements, offering exclusive items and in-person opportunities that are primed for sharing, and a way of adding value to an otherwise intangible thing. “It’s a way for you to take a piece of the film with you, and physically show your support for it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/febf2b20a36d500142170d8b397f5c46d56af747/363_1141_5207_3124/master/5207.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fcb684402195ecaa15caf47063dbe599","title":"how to make hummus recipe felicity cloake","story":"How to make the nation’s favourite dip with just a few store-cupboard ingredientsRemember the great hummus crisis of 2017, when the country went into meltdown over a temporary shortage of chickpea puree? Ah, they were happy days … Anyway, now the problem is more likely to be that you can’t face going to the shops to buy hummus, but the solution is the same: if you’ve got the ingredients, make your own.Prep 10 min, plus soakingCook Zero to 2 hr+, depending on the chickpeasServes 4200g dried chickpeas, or 1 x 400g tin or jar (see step 1)1½ tsp bicarbonate of soda (optional)3 garlic cloves, or to taste6 tbsp tahiniJuice of 1 lemon, or more to taste1 generous pinch ground cuminFine salt, to tasteExtra-virgin olive oil, to topIf you’re using dried chickpeas, which is my preference, because I think they have a better flavour, put them in a large bowl and cover with twice the volume of cold water.If you’re using a tin, skip straight to step four – the jarred Spanish kind are pricey, but their buttery texture makes it worth it if you can run to the expense.Stir in a teaspoon of bicarbonate of soda, if using, and leave to soak for 24 hours – this will help the chickpeas soften more quickly, and give the finished hummus a creamier consistency, but if you don’t have it available, or really don’t like the flavour even in small amounts, leave it out.Drain and rinse the chickpeas, put them in a large pan with the remaining bicarb and cover again with cold water. Bring to a boil, then turn down the heat and leave to simmer gently until tender, adding more water if necessary – this will probably take a couple of hours, depending on the age of the chickpeas they should be easy to crush, but not falling apart.Leave the chickpeas to cool in the cooking liquid, then drain well, reserving the water. If using tinned or jarred chickpeas, drain them, and likewise keep their liquid. Set aside a spoonful of the chickpeas to use as a garnish. If you’d like a really silky end product, remove the papery skins (which should be falling off by this point anyway), by rubbing the chickpeas between your fingers it’s a fiddly job, true, but I think well worth it.Peel and crush the garlic (three cloves are my preference for this amount of chickpeas, but you may wish to add more, or less, depending on your tolerance for raw garlic), and put half of it in a small bowl.Stir in the tahini and half the lemon juice, to make a stiff paste, then gradually beat in just enough of the reserved chickpea water to loosen it to a pourable liquid consistency.Put this and the drained chickpeas in a food processor (or, if you’re using a stick blender, a sturdy bowl if you don’t have either, you can use a pestle and mortar to crush the chickpeas in batches, provided you have the time and patience – though you’ll need then to press it through a sieve to get the mix to the right texture.Blitz the chickpeas until really smooth, then add the cumin, a good pinch of salt and the rest of the garlic. With the motor still running, drizzle in enough of the reserved cooking water to get the desired consistency – the hummus should hold its shape, but not be heavy or claggy. Taste and add more salt, lemon or garlic, if you think it needs it.Spoon the hummus into a serving bowl and then pour a little olive oil around the side. Finish by scattering the reserved chickpeas in the centre you could also add a sprinkle of sesame seeds, za’atar, sumac or smoked paprika, if you fancy it, or indeed some fresh herbs such as finely chopped coriander or mint.Purists may be horrified, but hummus is a very versatile base. Add pureed cooked beetroot or other vegetables (roast red peppers or squash are particularly nice), or swap some of the chickpeas for other beans or pulses, if you prefer. Homemade (or, indeed, shop-bought) hummus is the perfect home for that almost empty jar of harissa or the last handful of frozen peas, so be creative."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f2502a160c8289869466ffe3ec5c14307eff4457/0_0_1575_945/master/1575.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=6c16e163459aa57367dbc40dd68e0ab7","title":"brentford swansea city championship play off semi final second leg match report","story":"A night for moving on. For shedding baggage, and laying the past to rest. On the night Brentford said their farewells to Griffin Park, they came closer to top-flight football than they have done at any point since 1947. They did so with a sparkling modern brand of football quite at odds with the weathered girders and sardine seats of their old home.Fulham or Cardiff lie in wait at a deserted Wembley Stadium on Tuesday, the final fixture in this strangest of seasons, and if Brentford are to break their hoodoo of eight successive play-off failures they can ask for few better platforms. Few better front-threes than Saïd Benrahma, Ollie Watkins and Bryan Mbeumo. Few better midfield conductors than Mathias Jensen, who amid the mayhem and flying tackles ran this game on strings.Few better owners than the visionary Matthew Benham. Few better managers than Thomas Frank, who as well as instilling an elastic, spine-tingling, relentlessly percussive style of play has also forced Brentford to dream big, to write a new chapter in a cherished history.Of course, breaking into the world’s richest league requires more than a healthy sense of predestination. You need to suffer and you need to sweat, and on a warm evening both these sides played their part in an arrestingly physical encounter. Frank had promised in the buildup he would carry his exhausted players off the pitch at the end if necessary, and in a stunning, full-throttle opening 15 minutes that turned the tie on its head, his team were as good as his word.It began, as so many of Brentford’s moves do, from the very back: the goalkeeper David Raya finding Jensen, the Denmark Under-21 midfielder on the fringes of the full team. All night Jensen pulled Swansea this way and that, and here he played the sort of defence-splitting pass – fully 60 yards, all along the ground, straight down the middle – that you wanted to watch again and again. It was a pass with its own impossible choreography, right down to the perfectly-timed run of Watkins, who finished with an assassin’s cool for his 26th goal of the season.Perhaps Swansea were a little concussed by the brutal, geometric coldness of that goal. Certainly that would explain the momentary loss of defensive shape that allowed Benrahma to advance to the edge of their area just moments later. As Swansea’s midfield collapsed on to the back three like a boxer sinking into the deadly embrace of the ropes, Benrahma had all the time in the world to flop a delicious cross on to the head of Emiliano Marcondes. In the space of four minutes Brentford were 2-0 up and Swansea’s one-goal cushion had turned into an ejector seat.The dangerous Benrahma was beginning to grow into the game, enjoying a string of decent openings, at one point clattering the inside of a post after a magical little exchange with Jensen. Swansea’s best chance came through Conor Gallagher, and as half-time approached they had just about managed to stem the bleeding. But within barely a minute of the restart, Brentford hit them again: Jensen again, releasing Rico Henry (reprieved from suspension after being sent off in the first leg), crossing for Mbeumo to volley home with authority and swagger.With 12 minutes to go, Pontus Jansson’s terrible fluffed clearance was punished by a marvellous bit of inspiration from Rhian Brewster, lifting the ball over the advancing Raya from 30 yards. Now, as Swansea threw themselves into one last effort, Brentford’s defence would step up. Raya made a wonderful save from Connor Roberts. Christian Norgaard made two or three crucial clearances in a row. And for all the miles in the legs, the 101 matches these two sides had already dragged themselves through this season, remarkably the final stages of the game were just as intense and spellbinding as the first.A striking and unfamiliar sound filled the air in the minutes after full-time. Fans pouring out of the pubs and the terraced houses into Braemar Road, gathering outside the ground and giving the old place a raucous send-off. There is talk of a proper farewell at some point, perhaps even a socially-distanced exhibition game. But in a sense, this was the perfect way for it to end. The stands will soon be houses. A gleaming new chapel awaits just one stop up the line at Kew Bridge.Time, in more senses than one, for Brentford to take the next step."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/90007902e3da0c022168c5d7f9e327a88bc641c1/106_307_1568_940/master/1568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=917b5917faef4a6830176da6596fa605","title":"manchester city agree terms with 25m ferran torres of valencia","story":"Manchester City have agreed a deal to sign Ferran Torres from Valencia for £24.5m (€27m) plus add-ons after successful talks on Wednesday.Pep Guardiola, having sanctioned the sale of Leroy Sané to Bayern Munich after the Germany forward refused a new contract, targeted Torres to add to his attacking options after an impressive season in which the 20-year-old became Valencia’s youngest goalscorer in the Champions League.Torres has agreed personal terms with City on a contract until 2025 and is understood to be keen on working with Guardiola. Despite Valencia initially demanding €45m for a player who in November became the youngest in their history to play 50 La Liga games, they have accepted a lower bid with significant add-ons given he has only one year left on his deal.City are also in the market for central defenders and have held talks with Bournemouth over Nathan Aké. Their director of football, Txiki Begiristain, has said he is expecting a “strange” transfer window given that it will remain open for several weeks after the start of the new season on 12 September.“We have to be ready,” he told City’s website. “We have less time than ever, so people will have to move fast.

Never before have fans held such influenceAs implausible and preposterous as it may be, let’s imagine a post Covid-19 world where football fans are finally allowed back into Premier League grounds but elect en masse not to go. Not because home drinking, tedious family Zoom quizzes and banana bread baking have eclipsed the sport in popularity, but because after months spent locked out of stadiums match-going supporters have realised the importance of their role cannot be overstated and unilaterally opt to stay away until certain conditions are met.Even before a ball has been kicked it is reasonably safe to assume that Saturday’s FA Cup final will be the worst of all time. A traditionally grand occasion that will be memorable for all the wrong and weirdest of reasons, the Football Association’s showpiece event has been reduced to little more than a surreal meander through the motions this season, in order to fulfil contractual obligations and keep the financial and football record books up to date.Carnations may well adorn lapels, there will be half-hearted pre-match smoke and mirrors, and Arsenal or Chelsea will prevail. The trophy will be handed over and hoisted skywards following an awkward presentation soundtracked by a pyrotechnic display designed to ert global attention from the depressingly bare look of the cavernous empty and iconic stadium in which one of the most famous games in world football has just been played.Contested to the sound of no hands clapping or fans chanting, the game itself may well be a classic but the occasion will be uncharacteristically desolate and grim. It will still matter of course it will. For all its neatness as a soundbite, the notion that football without fans is nothing is just not true and a Cup final played with nobody in attendance is, at least for those on the pitch, marginally better than no Cup final at all.

Whether it’s on pitches, indoor and outdoor courts, gymnasiums, back gardens and yards, waste ground, scrubland, these finals are generally played wherever there’s room for one enthusiast or more to chase a rolling, bouncing ball. But for the presence of those playing, these locations would more often than not be forlorn, empty and unattended, demonstrating that football without fans is generally a very healthy, popular and largely beneficial use of the players’ time.It is not widely known but the sum total of no spectators were in attendance to witness the best goal ever scored. An Exocet header from outside the penalty area – or where the penalty area would have been if the pitch had been marked – the ball was fumbled on to the inside of the upright by a butterfingered schoolboy nicknamed Beaver before bouncing over the goalline that also wasn’t there. The young goalkeeper’s clumsy intervention was not enough to keep the ball out but probably prevented the silence from the sidelines that greeted the stunning effort being broken by the satisfying sound of a rippling goal net. I say probably, because in the absence of anything so glamorous as an actual goal net it was impossible to tell.In the absence of applause or pleasing sound effects, the scorer was forced to settle for the usual congratulatory pats on the head and boots up the arse from a few surprised teammates before a bell went and arguably the most insignificant kickabout in the history of the sport came to an end. Except it wasn’t completely insignificant because more than 30 years later I still recall that wonderful header I scored with fondness and crystal clarity. Far more importantly, it is finally a matter of public record.The 15-year-old me had long since made peace with the fact he would never score in an FA Cup final but on Saturday somebody else who dreamed of doing so as a child almost certainly will. Technically, achieving such a milestone in front of 90,000 unoccupied and utterly indifferent seats will not render their accomplishment any less significant, except it almost certainly will.Top-level football without fans is not nothing but it has become abundantly clear in recent weeks it is little more than a pale imitation of itself. The fact that this faded, facsimile, fan-free football is a sterile, anodyne and largely pointless pursuit will not have gone unnoticed by the grasping clubs, governing bodies and broadcasting companies who rely on the sport and those who watch it for their billions. Never before have football fans enjoyed such influence, although they will almost inevitably choose not to use it.Imagine if they did. Imagine a scenario where they mobilised and decided enough is enough. One in which, upon being welcomed back into their vast and long-vacant enormo-domes in the coming months, they chose instead to stay away subject to a list of not entirely unreasonable demands being met.Much cheaper tickets. No more paywalls, or at the very least a significant reduction in TV subscriptions, which would then be capped. An end to club gouging, the disturbing recent proliferation of gambling advertising and the rescheduling of matches for the benefit of armchair viewers at the expense of matchgoing fans. A guaranteed and substantial trickle-down redistribution of wealth from the top of the game to grassroots that, if needs be, comes out of the pockets of players, agents and owners who earn more money than any one person could possibly need. And they’re just a few off the top of the collective head for starters.In his illuminating book Can We Have Our Football Back?, published long before lockdown, John Nicholson, the world’s most idealistic football writer, insists repeatedly that fans have always had the power. There may never be a better time to wield it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/02ca2b34aca535690caaac5b04dc78a6b62b394c/0_320_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=acd3930be0aeb8d6fab87273746df3b0","title":"unwind in malta your long weekend itinerary for a dose of r and r","story":"With more than 300 days of sunshine a year, it’s always the right time to kick back and relax in this culture-rich countryWritten about by Homer as the archipelago where the nymph Calypso so beguiled Ulysses that he stayed for seven years, the Maltese islands remain idyllically beautiful. They offer visitors spectacular beaches, cobalt sea, prehistoric sites dating back more than 5,000 years, and soul-soothingly beautiful natural landscapes. With more than 300 days of sunshine a year, Malta is ideal for some restorative R\u0026ampR, and you can get here with minimal stress, no jet lag, and only a short-haul flight from the UK.Day one: soak up VallettaStart to unwind in Valletta, Malta’s elegant coastal capital, where five-star and boutique hotels offer spa treatments, massages and hot tubs and pools overlooking beautiful views. You could spend your first day exploring some of the attractions of this Unesco world heritage site, one of the world’s most beautiful and unspoilt cities. Its pedestrianised centre is full of pavement cafes to relax and enjoy a drink in the warm sunshine. You can dine in the evening at outdoor, sea-facing restaurants, eating fresh seafood and other delicious local cuisine, and enjoy the warm Mediterranean sun.Day two: more spas, speedboats and the ‘silent city’Valletta is renowned for its spectacular boutique hotels, such as the glorious Palazzo Consiglia with an underground spa and rooftop pool. One suite in SU29 has a rooftop Jacuzzi-with-a-view, as do the suites in the historic townhouse of Casa Ellul. Locanda La Gelsomina, over the harbour in the even-more-relaxing small town of Birgu, offers in-house massages, private yoga and a Japanese Zen sound bath.Once you’ve spent a day smoothing out any knots, it’s an easy trip by bus or car to take it easy on the beautiful beaches of Golden Bay or Għajn Tuffieħa for a day of beach relaxation. This astoundingly scenic chain of soft-sanded beaches is lapped by the warm Mediterranean Sea, and offers every kind of watersports: indulge in some stand-up paddleboarding, waterskiing or take a speedboat along the coast to see the otherworldly rock formations and caves that glint with reflected blue light. The beachfront Radisson Blu Resort \u0026amp Spa has superb spa facilities, or you could base yourself in a seaside town such as Mellieħa, close to another white-sanded beach, with lots of hotel choices.A cobweb-clearing walk along Malta’s Dingli cliffs offers sweeping panoramas for miles across the ocean, and you could finish the day with a meal in the tranquil “silent city” of Mdina. This hilltop, walled, golden-stone old capital, with its atmospheric and historic narrow lanes, is best experienced after all the daytime visitors have ebbed away.Days three and four: go Zen in GozoOn your third and fourth days, slow down your pace even more by heading to the neighbouring smaller island of Gozo, only a short trip by ferry. Hidden coves are reached via flights of vertiginous steps, with pale copper sands lapped by azure waters. Artist and poet Edward Lear visited in the 19th century and was so taken with this curious, dramatic landscape that he invented words to describe it: calling it “pomskizillious” and “gromophiberous”.Gozo’s country roads are ideal for cycling or walks, with sea views and seemingly hugely outsized churches in the middle of the countryside. The island’s famous for the warmth and hospitality of its locals, and is the kind of place where no one bothers locking their front door. Gozo is famous for its large, rentable “farmhouses” with gardens and pools, as well as some spectacular hotels, such as chic haven ThirtySeven and the five-star hideaway Kempinski Hotel San Lawrenz. You can also dine on spectacular fresh Mediterranean produce here. Gozo has many renowned restaurants, serving zero-mileage local cuisine cooked by some of the best chefs on the archipelago, with ingredients such as the local fresh cheese, locally grown tomatoes and olives, fresh fish, and local wines.Gozo’s five-star spas offer a wide range of treatments and therapies from across the world as well as saunas, Jacuzzis, steam rooms and indoor swimming pools.A longer restIf two days isn’t long enough, extend your Gozo trip with yoga and pilates retreats, which are ideal for longer wellness stays. The week-long Paola’s BodyBarre retreat, for example, gives you the chance to take part in daily pilates, barre, fitness and yoga fusion sessions, as well as excursions to copper-sanded Ramla Bay, the cerulean Blue Lagoon, Gozo’s coastal salt pans, and the vast Ġgantija temples, which predate Stonehenge. The next retreat will take place in 2021, for more information email: office.uk@visitmalta.It’s remarkable how many relaxation and wellness activities you can fit in over a four-day weekend trip to Malta, recharging in beautiful settings or keeping active outdoors (although longer trips to Malta and Gozo are to be encouraged – there’s a lot that cannot be covered in a four-day trip). Book your wellness trip to Malta today to restore a sense of balance, for a holiday whose effects will last long after your return.In the wake of Covid-19 things are changing fast, so do check the latest advice from the Foreign Office before making any travel decisions and contact any hotels, restaurants or attractions mentioned in this article for the latest information on availability and opening times.

The landing site is one of the most promising spots for any microbial Martians to have been preserved in rock formed when the crater held a lake nine times larger than Loch Ness.The $2.7bn (£2.1bn) rover carries a suite of instruments to analyse rocks for “biosignatures” – the chemical hallmarks of life – but will cache other samples on the surface for collection and return to Earth onboard a future mission.Bad weather and technical glitches aside, the Perseverance mission will embark on its half-a-billion kilometre voyage at 12.50pm BST on Thursday when the engines of the Atlas V rocket it is strapped to light up at Cape Canaveral, Florida.With coronavirus raging in the southern state, few scientists and engineers will be in Florida to witness the launch and will instead follow events online.“It’s an early launch for us,” said Ken Williford, the deputy project scientist at Nasa’s jet propulsion laboratory in Pasadena, California. “I’ll need to be up around 3am, though I don’t know if I’ll be able to sleep.“Our plan was to have thousands of people there. Our science team alone is 400 people and everybody was going to be invited. It’s very different. We’ll be celebrating remotely.” Even without the pandemic to contend with, the mission has been a challenge. Beyond developing powerful new instruments and an upgraded autopilot system, engineers built a helicopter for the rover to deploy, the first to take to the air on another planet.Named Ingenuity, the 1.8kg helicopter will be a “pathfinder” for future rotorcraft that scout ahead of robotic rovers, and perhaps even astronauts, and explore terrain beyond the reach of either, said MiMi Aung, the Ingenuity project manager. Should Perseverance touch down safely, Ingenuity will attempt up to five flights over 30 days, clawing into the thin Martian air with four 1.2-metre-long carbon-fibre blades spinning at 2,400rpm.“The nervousness and nail-biting will come on the surface,” Aung told the . “Surviving the first night for us is going to be huge.”But first it has to get there. Trips to Mars are daunting feats and the recent successes of Nasa’s Mars Insight and Curiosity missions do nothing to change that. The low Martian gravity and the rarefied atmosphere make entry, descent and landing so fraught that flight engineers are prone to use the word “terror”.After seven months of interplanetary travel, in February 2021 the spacecraft will punch into the Martian sky at such a speed that its heat shield will sear at 2,370C (4,298F). With thrusters for control, the probe will streak towards its landing site, pop a parachute and then cut it loose, descending the final 10km to the surface on eight retrorockets.All being well, Perseverance will land in the Jezero crater on the western edge of Isidis Planitia, a giant impact basin north of the Martian equator. The site was picked from more than 60 candidates because of its promise for preserving signs of life. The crater was once home to an ancient lake and river delta that may have collected and buried Martian microbes and locked them in rocks made from compacted clay or mud.Mounted on the end of its robotic arm are two instruments that Perseverance will use to search for signs of past life, or promising rocks to return to Earth. The Pixl (planetary instrument for X-ray lithochemistry) can blast rocks with a small but powerful beam to reveal their elemental makeup. Another tool, named Sherloc, will scan rocks for organic molecules and minerals. Hints of life may lie not only in organics, but the textures and patterns of compounds scientists see in the rocks.“It is very likely that any signs of life we do find will be very ambiguous, very difficult to interpret, and difficult or impossible to achieve true scientific consensus on,” Williford said. “We have very good capabilities for finding potential signs of life, but we’ll need to get those samples back and have many different people study them with many different techniques for years to achieve anything like scientific consensus.”Mark Sephton, an astrobiologist at Imperial College London, is part of the team that will decide which half a kilo of rocks to bring back to Earth, an unprecedented feat Nasa may achieve with the European Space Agency in 2031.“We could be about to step over quite a profound threshold,” he said. “We talk about the possibility of finding life on Mars, but people forget that if that happens and it’s conclusive, that’s a step change. That’s a line you cross and you never go back. It tells us that everywhere in the universe, where you’ve got the right conditions, the right raw materials, and a bit of time, that life should spring up.“I’m excited, but nervous that anything might happen which stops the opportunity of a lifetime. It’s such a privilege to be involved. It’s historical. I don’t want anything to go wrong.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/253c03e731041d7019d453b1c9e388170030da97/185_175_3515_2108/master/3515.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=55f23fb26a97548209d3695ddccd2492","title":"uk food tsar obesity drive percy pigs henry dimbleby co founder of leon","story":"Co-founder of Leon thinks so-called ‘natural’ sweets are misleading over sugar contentHenry Dimbleby, a co-founder of the restaurant chain Leon, was appointed by the government to lead a landmark review of Britain’s food system to determine a national strategy.

Percy Pigs are a sweet that is marketed on the front with all-natural fruit juice and it’s right by your kids’ little fingers. And on the back, if you understand calorie labelling, the first four ingredients are forms of sugar. I just think that is not right. I think that is genuinely misleading. The reason I pick M\u0026ampS is because they have integrity as one of their values, but it is rampant in the food world: Low-fat which is actually high in sugar. “Free from” this, that and the other.Yes CEOs have to respond to commercial pressures, but they are not unable to take any value-based decisions.Should sweets have plain packaging?No. I think we would get a massive backlash. I went to a party the other day where all of the children were just given carrot batons. There wasn’t any cake or any sweets, and in those little children’s eyes I saw a joyless future. There’s something about plain packaging on sweets that for me would feel like too much government intervention.On ‘healthy’ fruit snacksSome of those - not all of those - are the kind of thing that are being clothed in a veneer of goodness and actually may be no better for you than a Mars bar. Not all of them. It depends what the level of fibre is and the level of sugar.On his weightI wouldn’t recommend any diets that I have used. My weight oscillates between the high end of healthy weight and the low end of obese, and it is a conscious struggle. Basically, we have been putting on weight since the 50s so our will power hasn’t had a sudden collapse, we’ve just gradually put on weight consistently since the 50s, and I think it’s for us to lose weight but the government can make it much easier. We have a tendency to want to eat foods that are high in fat and sugar and those foods are everywhere and marketed at us.What has Covid-19 taught us about the food supply chain?The biggest weakness it has exposed is the wake-up call on health. 1.6m years of life are lost every year to ill health and death from diet-related diseases.

I think the most difficult challenge may be in the field, maintaining a high standard throughout and keeping that intensity.”Other challenges for Morgan have been more familiar. We are frequently informed that there are more players who England want to play than spaces available. That still seems to apply even though six of Morgan’s World Cup winners are engaged in the Test series and so are not available.“Selection was particularly difficult,” said Morgan. “Over the last four-and-a-bit years we’ve always had tough decisions to make and I think everybody who was left out had a tough call.”Those batsmen may be gifted and most of them are remarkably old. Of the specialists in this squad only Tom Banton of Somerset is under 29. “I think there is the perception that they’ve almost had their chance and their time has gone,” said Morgan. “Whereas we see it that going into the next World Cup, we need experienced guys making good decisions under pressure. That’s exactly what we’re after and experience lends itself to that. We’ll continue to give opportunities but it’s to those guys we feel might have an impact in selection on the next two T20 World Cups or the next 50-over World Cup.”Possible teams for the first ODI at the Ageas Bowl, Thursday 30 JulyIreland are now led by Andy Balbirnie and they have omitted some familiar names such as Gary Wilson, George Dockrell and Mark Adair. But some old favourites remain in Kevin O’Brien, William Porterfield and Boyd Rankin. Most unfamiliar on this side of the water are Gareth Delany, Harry Tector and the all-rounder Curtis Campher.This match heralds the start of the Super League, the qualification process for the 2023 World Cup. “This Super League is our opportunity to get in,” says Balbirnie. “And it’s going to be super-tough.”One other innovation is that no-balls will be called by the third umpire in this series, hopefully not too often."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a62c5043c1fd509eadf163df8a067fbe35ca2450/0_174_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8501c5a878c4fc66f92daf71574f3b94","title":"snooker players treated like lab rats ronnie osullivan return fans crucible world championship","story":"Ronnie O’Sullivan claims snooker players are being treated like “lab rats” at this year’s world championship and claims anyone unconcerned by the decision to allow some spectators into the event must have a “death wish”.O’Sullivan, a five-times champion, expressed support for a fellow player Anthony Hamilton, who has asthma and said he fears for his health at the Crucible, which is currently one of three venues piloting the safe return of spectators during the coronavirus pandemic.O’Sullivan, who will start his campaign against Thailand’s Thepchaiya Un-Nooh on Sunday, said: “They’re treating this snooker event like lab rats really, so what can you do?Declining to directly address O’Sullivan’s comments, World Snooker Tour referenced an earlier statement in which it stressed safety was of “paramount concern”, and said the choice of the Crucible to stage the first indoor event with an audience constituted a “fantastic triumph” for the game.Spectators with tickets for sessions must undergo a series of strict protocols prior and during their visits, including signing a code of conduct and wearing face masks as they make their way to their seats, although they can be removed during play.O’Sullivan declined to elaborate on why he had made the decision to play despite his belief that it was “not a risk worth taking”, and revealed he had personal reasons for treating the potential spread of the virus with the utmost caution.He added: “I have the option not to play, but I’ve decided to play. I’ve got my plan in place, I’ll pitch up to play and hope everything’s fine, and if I don’t feel comfortable we’ll have to decide at that point.“I am still very careful about who I hang around with and where I go. It’s not just me who is affected – my mum is high-risk, she had pneumonia last year, so I actually haven’t come within 20 feet of my mum.“I’ve known people that have died from Covid-19. It hits home a lot harder when you’ve experienced someone dying and you’ve experienced the reality of talking to someone on the frontline, telling you the actual reality of what it’s like.“That’s when it hits home. Until you’ve heard those stories and you’ve experienced it, it’s easy to have the attitude that it’s all been blown out of proportion. I am one of those people that have taken it seriously, like Anthony Hamilton.”O’Sullivan, meanwhile, stressed he was delighted with the identity of his first-round opponent, who has officially been recorded as the fastest current player in the game. “Thepchaiya is the one opponent I don’t mind losing to,” he said.“There are some players you just don’t want to lose to, but Thepchaiya is not one of those guys. He is the most lovely man, a humble guy from Thailand, and everyone would love to see him win tournaments.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/019ac9a032b2f0d966e6fa5a5052904c5177ecab/0_383_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=14ba7de98e8701eb856b7b5364823ea0","title":"tennis ash barty pulls out of us open","story":"World No 1 Ashleigh Barty has withdrawn from the US Open in a massive blow to the New York grand slam.Not comfortable about travelling during the coronavirus pandemic, Barty is the biggest name yet to opt out of the major because of the global health crisis.“My team and I have decided that we won’t be travelling to the US and Western and Southern Open and the US Open this year,” Barty said in a statement issued by her manager.Barty is still weighing up whether to resume her season in Europe and ultimately try to defend her French Open crown in Paris.The claycourt major was rescheduled from May-June to a 27 September start.“I will make my decision on the French Open and the surrounding WTA European tournaments in the coming weeks,” Barty said.Barty has been closely monitoring the coronavirus situation at home in Queensland for months.The 24-year-old was among a raft of big names to express concerns about the US Open going ahead as planned in the same annual time slot despite Flushing Meadows at one stage being used as an emergency hospital for the outbreak.Men’s world No1 Novak Djokovic and defending US Open champion Rafael Nadal were also doubtful starters but both have since entered the Southern and Western Open, which has been moved from Cincinnati to New York after USTA officials will create a biosecurity hub for three weeks.But women’s world No2 Simona Halep, 2018 winner Naomi Osaka and defending champion Bianca Andreescu have not entered the Southern and Western Open, which starts on 15 August.The US Open kicks off on 31 August and will be held in its usual home in Flushing Meadows, Queens but will be played without fans in attendance to limit the spread of the virus.Deaths from Covid-19 surpassed 150,000 in the United States on Wednesday, more than any other country and nearly a quarter of the world’s total, according to a Reuters tally."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b3404d6b95f6ee45a4a605bf8fe3bbb478b3e51e/42_738_2756_1654/master/2756.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=df65d883eef93e4651d24229831db9df","title":"talking horses deirdre can light up glorious goodwood again in nassau stakes horse racing","story":"The track, trip and quickening ground will suit last year’s winner of the Group One race ideallyFancy Blue was Donnacha O’Brien’s first runner in France when she took the Prix de Diane (French Oaks) at Chantilly this month, and the 21-year-old trainer will aim to repeat the trick when the same filly is his first runner in Britain in Thursday’s Group One Nassau Stakes.The daughter of Deep Impact is lightly-raced and still improving but faces a very different calibre of opponent as she steps outside her own age group for the first time, against three previous Group One winners.Nazeef is going for her seventh win in row but beat a relatively weak field to land the Falmouth Stakes last time, which leaves last year’s Nassau winner, Deirdre, as potentially the biggest danger to Fancy Blue.

Now, aged 80, she explains why she’s making time for them, alongside regular tennis and core-strengthening pilatesThe card dropped through the letterbox just as I was leaving for my regular coaching session at the tennis club. “Welcome to your ninth decade,” it said. I’d just turned 80 and was planning to celebrate by doing a tandem skye for a local charity.I wasn’t shocked by the card’s message (no, really). I was prepared by the good-ageing philosophy of a thoughtful man called Cecil Kellehar who was fourscore years when he wrote for Choice, the lifestyle magazine for over-50s that I edited in the 1990s. Take it as it comes. Don’t rail against it. Have someone to love. Have something to do. Have something to look forward to. Keep fit.The last one’s easy: I’ve played tennis since I was 10 and do so three times a week if I can. I’d even been asked to join an over-75s group playing indoors every week. Covid-19 and the lockdown ended that, as well as something else I was really looking forward to: jumping out of a plane. Meanwhile, I’m in a weekly Zoom choir and we happily sing out to our heart’s content.I’ve got a husband and family (at a distance) to love and I’m always writing (journalists are like that), so that is certainly something to do. Emailing my MP about doing more to erase the inequalities revealed by the pandemic keeps me occupied.“Take it as it comes”, was my dad’s philosophy too. But sometimes you just can’t accept what life throws at you. Incontinence, for instance. Reading Miriam Margolyes’ frank account of hanging on to her pee, I related instinctively. We all know if you laugh for too long you can leak!But why on earth should it happen? Why is it so commonplace? At the end of the 1960s, after I’d had my two daughters, the health visitor encouraged me to do pelvic floor exercises daily. But I was a full-time working mother with a mortgage, and life went at such a speed that I never paid enough attention to my own body. When my son arrived in the mid 1970s, living pace was even faster – and tennis was put on hold.By the mid 1980s, I was back on the court, expending energy and eradicating angst built up from working long hours on women’s magazines. Fashion, beauty makeovers and diets, Princess Diana and Fergie, royal gardens and fabulous knitting patterns kept me occupied. It was a strange time. My periods were all over the place, as were my emotions – and I was putting on weight.It’s marvellous that we talk freely about women’s health today and it’s easier to find a sympathetic ear and a wealth of options to deal with oestrogen deficiency and menstrual problems. My heart went out to British tennis player Heather Watson whose performance in an important tournament was affected by the time of the month. Now you can avoid periods entirely if you want, with no ill effects – certainly no red or wet patches on tennis whites.My solution was twice-yearly HRT implants, which kept me stable until the 1990s, when I unexpectedly started leaking urine. My GP said my bladder had prolapsed, dropped down into my vagina, so I began doing pelvic floor exercises with a vengeance. I was inspired by Diana Moran, the Green Goddess, who created a range of keep-fit exercises for Choice. She made it all look so easy!At 60, I retired, just after the second of my older sisters died of ovarian cancer. Fearing this would be my fate, too, I used some pension money to go private to remove my womb and ovaries – and had a bladder “lift”. Fortunately, it didn’t involve the mesh, which has been devastating for many and is now banned. Mine was just a stitch, my surgeon said.For 10 years, every Saturday morning I attended a pilates class – our lovely instructor Lidia helped us focus on strengthening the core: making the abdomen and back muscles stronger helps your pelvic floor muscles to control the bladder. We lay on our backs, breathing deeply in and out as we lowered first one leg then the other to the side, eight to 10 times.I kick myself that I didn’t continue with pilates after we moved to the country. The wee problems recurred and I was back to wearing pads. Things improved a little when my GP suspected vaginal atrophy – caused by lack of oestrogen – and prescribed Vagifem, oestradiol tablets inserted like a pessary.Despite all this, I found I still often make an urgent dash for the loo. As a consumer journalist for more than 45 years, I’m always looking for ways to make things better. Panties with integral pads are useful, as accidents are contained. I bought a Kegel8 Ultra 20 electronic pelvic toner, a device with a spoon-like object that goes into the vagina. It was difficult to lie down for half an hour a day with this in place, and I discovered the prolapse was back. This doesn’t happen to everyone, I hasten to say.Then I read about Finnish Innovotherapy, a non-invasive training method using specially designed shorts and electrodes to generate contractions of the muscles. Five days a week, 30 minutes a day over 12 weeks certainly improved my awareness of my pelvic floor and the leaking lessened. It was a costly remedy: I bought it over six months, interest free. It may not be a realistic option for everyone – and you still have to do exercises.One thing I’ve learned about myself is that I need to be given instructions, and having downloaded MyPFF app onto my iPad I squeeze and breathe to order. And there’s new hope: I came across Alex Miller, a Canadian fitness trainer, who believes she has found why our pelvic floor muscles lose their ability to work properly. As we age, we slump! Do you notice yourself hunching over – when you’re using a laptop, driving, sitting at the table or in an armchair. Instead of being upright, our head and chin go forward, as does the abdomen. Raise your shoulders and chin, bring your head back and your body is properly aligned.Her combination of pilates and yoga exercises have shown me the error of my ways. I sit up straight, hold my tummy muscles in, breathing deeply in and out, and try to remember to use MyPFF app every day. When Covid-19 is gone, I’ll be ready to jump out of the plane – wearing a parachute, and hopefully no pad!As incontinence affects one in three women over 35, we should all be having more open conversations about this everyday condition that impacts women of all ages.

It’s flattish, and gives an insight into the mining history of the county – the tramway used to provide the mines their transport route to the sea. You can see the old mines scattered across the landscape as you pedal along. Park at Portreath and stop off at the Hub bike shop and cafe for picnic supplies (or a puncture repair kit). If 22 miles is too far, park at Bissoe and enjoy a circular ride.RachelThe Family Cycle Trail in the Forest of Dean is a gentle meander through this ancient hunting forest. The path is an old railway route from the area’s mining days. History enthusiasts can visit heritage sites on the way, but those just along for the views and the wildlife won’t be disappointed. Look out for wild boar (the largest population in England) and pine martens as you cycle. Stop off for lunch at one of the numerous picnic spots along the way. It’s circular, fully waymarked and suitable for the whole family, including the dog. Melissa LeeFor the millions of us living in the south-east of the capital, the Sustrans Waterlink Way is a hidden treasure. I pick up the track under the Docklands Light Railway bridge at Deptford (the route starts at nearby Greenwich) and enjoy the pleasant, flat and traffic-free six miles along pretty rivers and through local parks. You’ll finish in Beckenham, birthplace of David Bowie. Book a swim at the now re-opened Beckenham Place Park  lake and bring a picnic to have in the area’s biggest green space before starting the return leg. A great option for a mini-adventure in the city.Lucy AtkinsonWe love the Marriott’s Way, which follows the route of a disused trainline between Norwich and the Bure Valley in Aylsham. It’s 26 miles of footpath and cycleway, with lots of wildlife and local history. You can access it in central Norwich, and there are exits to visit villages and pubs along the way. The first eight miles is paved, making it easy for children after that there are tracks interspersing the paved paths and fields. It’s so beautiful in summer: you could be cycling in rural France! It has handy mile markers all the way along so you can keep track of distance.Amanda CashWe never tire of the Wirral Circular Trail, a former railway line connecting West Kirby to Chester. It’s safe, flat and with cafe and park stops aplenty. Take in the views of north Wales and Dee estuary, have a breather on the beach at Calday or Thurstaston, stop off at Parkgate for award-winning ice-cream at Nicholls, then continue on through the birdlife haven of (recently reopened) Burton Marshes and cross the border into Cheshire and on to the Chester Greenway. Alternatively, follow the inland route at Neston to Willaston for eats and refreshments at Pollard’s Inn.

But, despite its huge legacy, there is still much to be done when it comes to representation on British TVThree sharp-suited black men in bow ties walk into the British National Party headquarters, eager to join the racist outfit. But first they must answer some questions. So began one sketch from The Real McCoy, the groundbreaking BBC show that, 30 years ago, brought a black British perspective to TV.“England versus West Indies in the cricket. Who do you support?” asks the recruiter. “Millwall,” replies one of the men, cleverly sidestepping the question. “England and Cameroon are playing football. Who do you support?” “England,” says one. “Why?” asks the recruiter, incredulous. “Paul Ince, Paul Parker, Des Walker …” the men reply, listing England’s black players of the era.“The joke still works,” says the show’s producer, Charlie Hanson. “Today they’d just need to walk into an English Defence League office to make the point.”But then the gag takes an unexpected turn. The black men suggest that they are more British than the white racist. “But I was here first!” he wails. “Tacitus, the Roman scribe said the first people he saw when he came to Britain were black,” replies one. “David MacRitchie the historian agreed,” says the second. “Archaeologists Gerald Macey and Godfrey Higgins came to the same conclusion and they were white,” says the third. Where does that leave me, asks the white man. “About two weeks,” says the first man, “to go back to the the Caucasus mountains where you were naked and covered in hair.” They slam the door on him.It has been 25 years since The Real McCoy was on our screens, which, given how many times Dad’s Army has been broadcast in the interim, is disappointing. One of the show’s stars, Felix Dexter, once said that the Beeb appeared to give “no recognition that the show ever existed”. How sad that he died before the BBC decided to put up all five series on iPlayer from this week. “It’s been a long time coming,” says his fellow star Judith Jacob. “If I had a pound for every time I’ve been asked when it’s coming back, I wouldn’t be talking to you. They said they’d lost the tapes. And then they turned up. Strange that.”Jacob, who had already starred in Channel 4’s black sitcom No Problem! and as health visitor Carmel Roberts in EastEnders before being asked to appear in the show, recalls The Real McCoy fondly. “I just remember how we would perform a sketch and if it made us laugh, it was in. If not, out. Simple economics.” The show was performed before a live studio audience, and Jacob says the crowds laughed so much that often they would have to do as many as five takes.In one sketch set in a 17th-century west African village, Jacob played a woman listening as an elder read to a crowd from a flyer nailed up by an English soldier, inviting villagers on an adventure of a lifetime across the ocean, with free travel, board and lodging on arrival. The other villagers are excited, but Jacob says: “There must be some catch.” She’s right. Turning over the flyer, there is a sketch of the accommodation – a slave ship.Words are certainly cheap: when Greg Dyke took over from John Birt as director general of the BBC in 2000, he criticised it for being “hideously white’” because of the scarcity of black and Asian people working within it. But despite that indictment, arguably, it remained so. Indeed, a decade ago, the comedian Stephen K Amos suggested that black comedy on TV was rationed. “It’s one in, one out,” he said.Why did black and Asian shows fail to build on The Real McCoy? Some have cited the critical and ratings failure of The Crouches, the BBC sitcom starring a black cast that ran between 2003 and 05. Standup Angie Le Mar told the  that after the Crouches flopped “the BBC pulled back and said: ‘We can’t do black sitcoms.’ That’s too much pressure. Why do we always have to be fantastic, or die?”Hanson has another explanation. After The Real McCoy ended, TV became more culturally conservative. For a while, Channel 4 became a reliable source of black and ethnic minority comic talent. Hanson produced Desmond’s (1989-94), starring Norman Beaton, and the fledgling channel was also responsible for Get Up, Stand Up (1994-99), a black standup show. Many of these programme were commissioned by Farrukh Dhondy when he served as commissioning editor for multicultural programming. But that post no longer exists and C4’s radical remit is long dead. It was a similar story at the London network LWT, where erse commissioning decreased in the wake of ITV’s re-formation. As for the BBC, its problem with commissioning and representing black and Asian talent was typified by how The Real McCoy originated. One day in 1990, Hanson says he was summoned to meet the BBC’s head of comedy Robin Nash: “He realised that the BBC was not fulfilling its ersity remit and something had to be done.” Hanson had worked with the the Black Theatre Co-Operative and produced comedy gigs in south London, working with many of the comedy talents who would appear on the show, including Curtis and Ishmael, Robbie Gee and Leo Chester (AKA Leo Muhammad), so he was a good person to call in. But there was something wrong with this picture: a white executive was commissioning a white producer to remedy the problem of black underrepresentation.“It’s still the same,” says Jacob when I put this to her. She is thrilled to see The Real McCoy back on screens, but her joy is tempered by the fact that it never revolutionised British TV as she hoped. True, The Real McCoy now has a belated successor in Famalam (whose cast acknowledge the debt to Jacob and her peers), but that has taken nearly a quarter of a century. She thinks Sarpong and her BBC colleagues have their work cut out to improve black and Asian representation, not just on screen but behind it, from commissioning editors to makeup artists.Today, the best non-white British comedy talent is often found not in theatres or comedy clubs but online. Think how the Coventry schoolteacher and successful YouTuber Guz Khan was signed up by the BBC to make Man Like Mobeen. Or how Kayode Ewumi made a hit webseries called #HoodDocumentary, which was picked up in 2016 by the BBC who commissioned him to make the excellent sitcom Enterprice two years later.The Real McCoy benefited from being given a prime-time slot on the schedules when it premiered at 9pm on BBC Two in May 1991 and garnered regular audiences of 5 million, many of them white. “It wasn’t just for black or Asian people,” says Jacob. “Funny isn’t black or white. I watched Dad’s Army, at 10,000 levels it has nothing to do with me, but I laugh at it.”While the Real McCoy’s political gags – on slavery, racism and multicultural incomprehension – are as depressingly pertinent today as they were in the early 1990s, what also makes it essential viewing, whatever your ethnicity, is that it remains funny. I love Dexter as Nathaniel the bumptious trainee accountant from Lagos, rudely schooling West Indians in the audience how to speak proper English. “What I have noticed,” he says, waving a cane, “is that if there is an aitch in front of the vowel you are taking it away. And if there isn’t one, you are putting it in. For example: ‘My friend Harchibald is in ’ospital. They are keeping ’im in hovernight.’” Or the peerless Llewella Gideon as Miss Hortense Pretentious, the black Margaret Thatcher clone running as a Tory candidate. “Britain is for the English,” she tells the party conference chillingly to rapturous applause, “and so we need to keep the foreigners out.” Or Misery’s West Indian restaurant, where the only thing on the menu is abuse from the surly staff. It’s been too long: how lovely that they are back.The Real McCoy is available on iPlayer now"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f645fbde50c4b27a235f7edf1b75c0e4c783cd38/0_27_2616_1569/master/2616.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=cd86d5d03110b5c2e95f27e7d0fd7bbe","title":"it meant everything scenes from a remarkable graduation day","story":"The socially distanced ceremony was an unprecedented event for the Mississippi high school graduates – and a moving celebration of their hard-earned achievementsby  Oliver Laughland in Lexington photographs by Annie FlanaganAs an early summer sun beat down over a brick school building, red sequins on an outdoor stage rippled in the gentle breeze and Dr James Henderson took a minute to adjust his robe and face mask in the reflection of a car mirror.Henderson, superintendent of Holmes County Consolidated school district in the Mississippi delta, approached the lectern in front of a line of cars covered in balloons and handwritten messages of support.He cleared his breath. Lowered his mask. And boomed into a microphone over the hum of car engines. “I now confirm that you, the 2020 Holmes County Central high school class, are completers of high school in the great state of Mississippi. Congratulations to my graduates,” he said.A muted round of applause seemed to evaporate into the open air, before Pomp and Circumstance blasted over the loudspeakers to a near-empty parking lot.“We had to give them something, because they have lost so much,” Henderson said. “Giving them the opportunity to walk across that stage. For their parents to see them walk, it’s just the ultimate, right?”Among Holmes county’s class of 2020 were aspiring business people, doctors and surgeons, accountants, sports therapists, scientists and writers. Each was graduating into a time of economic and political uncertainty, just days before the country erupted into mass protest following the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Although personal tragedy had marked some of their childhoods, every student spoke with clarity about their vision of the future.“Today is different from how I imagined it because not all my family can come to support me. I have my mom, my two sisters and my girlfriend. My dad called me last night to tell me how proud he was, because he wasn’t in my life like he should have been. My grandaddy just recovered from Covid so he’s watching online. My best memory of high school is catching an interception during a football game against Cleveland Central this year. I worked so hard for that moment. I’ve dealt with depression and anxiety, but I push myself so hard to make everyone proud. I’m going to Northeast Community college, and my dream is to play football professionally. But if my dream is not what God has planned, I want to be a physical therapist.”“Finishing school during the pandemic was hard, because where I live we really don’t have internet service. I had to sit by a window and try to get signal, to get all my work together and have a chance to graduate.They cancelled prom because of the pandemic, and I was just really sad because I never got to experience it and pick out a dress.I want to show my mom that the daughter she raised, the person I became, made all her work worth it. She did it for a reason. I’m planning on joining the army reserves, I want to branch out and see the world.”“I consider the class of 2020 to be possibly the strongest class in history. It’s been so different for us to go through all of this and still be successful.I spent two days writing my salutatorian speech to make sure it came from my heart. I told my class to stay focused, keep a tunnel vision on your dreams and let there be no limitations on you.This year’s valedictorian, Issac Randle Jr, delivered a speech urging his class to “live life and not let life live you”. His parents watched on from a parked red pickup truck, decorated with the words: “Quarantine couldn’t hold me I’m free at last.”They cheered as Randle was the first to pick up his diploma, a broad smile across his face. He will attend the University of Mississippi to study accounting under a grant and a scholarship.“He stayed the course,” said his mother Matilda. “And knowing that his hard work paid off. It just feels incredible.” The Randles planned to celebrate at home with a large family meal.Matilda Randle was far from the only proud parent that morning sitting quarantined inside their vehicle. Christine Baker, who had recently been furloughed from her job at a local car factory due to the pandemic, wore a T-shirt with her daughter Ma’Kiyah’s picture printed on it. She had raised her as a single parent.“I thanked God for allowing me to watch her walk that stage,” Baker said, tears in her eyes. “It meant everything to me. I went beyond and beneath, and put my life on the back burner to raise her.”The school district is preparing for a return to lessons next month. But as Covid-19 cases in the county surged over the summer and parents voiced their reluctance to send children back in person, there will be only online classes for high school students this term.Henderson watched in horror from Holmes county as Donald Trump thrust the issue of school return into the ongoing culture wars during the pandemic.“It seems like the federal government only cares about themselves and no one else. That the economy is more important to him than human beings,” he said. “But we here are taking care of ourselves.”Amber: “I’m going to Coahoma Community college this fall to study criminal justice. I want to be a lawyer. I see what’s going on in my community and there’s a lot of people getting charged unfairly. I want to be able to help those people.”“My fondest memory of high school will always be going with my classmates on field trips to experience different things out there in the world.I’m planning to go to college and study cosmetology. I want to open my own hair and nail salon, but I want to do it outside of Mississippi. I want to see something other than this state.”“There’s a lot of people dying and suffering right now, and I would love to be a part of the help. I’m going to Texas Southern University to study biology and then I want to train to become an anesthesiologist.It’s a dream I’ve had since middle school, watching Grey’s Anatomy and being interested in the simple jobs, besides the doctors and nurses, that people don’t really recognize.But tonight I’m just going to celebrate with family and have a cookout.”A number of Holmes County Central students were grappling with the loss of close family in recent years. The county has the 11th-lowest average life expectancy in the United States, at 71 years, which is seven and a half years below the national average.Tony Christopher Jr’s father passed away in February 2017 after a brief hospitalization. “They didn’t tell us too much about it, I just woke up one day and they told us he was in the hospital,” Christopher said, an image of his father printed on his graduation stole. “I just know he’d be very proud of me graduating because it’s something he didn’t do.”Mercedes Black lost her aunt to illness in April 2019. “If it wasn’t for her I wouldn’t have made it this far,” Black said, an image of her aunt adorning her graduation cap that was decorated in flowers. “When I was struggling in school she would help, she always told me to never give up. All she told me was that she wanted to see me graduate and walk that stage, and I just hate that she couldn’t be here to see us. She was like my second mom.”For a moment the ceremony dispensed with social distancing as Tamia Anderson took to the stage. As she collected her diploma, Henderson offered her a split-second hug as her great grandmother Roosevelt Anderson and grandmother Janice Harper screamed with joy from their car: “That’s my baby! You go girl!”In June 2018 Tamia’s mother took her own life. The aftermath was laced with trauma.“I didn’t really deal with it how I should have,” Anderson said. “I bottled up my emotions and it ended up turning into anger.”She was almost moved to an alternative school, but took time out for counseling and was allowed to return after a hearing. Tamia graduated almost at the top of her class.The Anderson family moved to Mississippi from Chicago 20 years ago after all three of Roosevelt’s sons were killed in the city, leaving Janice the only child still alive.“I moved here to get away from Chicago,” Roosevelt said. “I wanted to find a place where the family could always come for peace and rest.”The tragedy of the suicide compounded generations of grief. Tamia thought of her mother as she collected her diploma.“She’s smiling so hard right now, I can feel it all over me,” she said as she exited the stage. The family returned home straight after, to a residence in the hills outside Lexington with manicured lawns, blooming flowers and a horse grazing in a small field.Tamia walked to her mother’s grave in a plot by the house, and reflected on the completion of her high school education.“It means so much to me,” she said of the ability to graduate in person. “You have no idea.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e890cb2689be785c1a094f5fb1c66e9ebd3b9d16/0_0_1920_1152/master/1920.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c475b5de7184a621cd84b6cff62d4568","title":"seth rogen israel palestinians jewish actor","story":"Actor says when he was younger he wasn’t told Palestinians lived on land that became the Jewish stateSeth Rogen has said he was “fed a huge amount of lies about Israel” as a young Jewish person, stoking controversy around the country’s sometimes fraught relationship with many North American Jews.The Canadian-US actor, who attended Jewish camp and whose parents met on a kibbutz in Israel, said the fact that the Jewish state was created on land where Palestinians were living had always been omitted.“They never tell you that, ‘Oh, by the way, there were people there’. They make it seem like it was just like sitting there, like the fucking door’s open.”More than 700,000 Palestinians were driven out of their homes or fled fighting in the 1948 war that led to Israel’s creation. Today, those families and their descendants make up around 5.6 million refugees.Rogen and Maron, who is also Jewish, were speaking to promote Rogen’s new comedy, An American Pickle, which tells the story of a Jewish immigrant from the 1920s who falls into a vat of brine and wakes up in modern-day Brooklyn.The pair talked and joked at length about Israel and also spoke about antisemitism, which Rogen said remains pervasive and prevalent.“I remember my dad frankly telling me, ‘People hate Jews. Just be aware of that. They just do.’ And it’s honestly something that I am so glad was instilled in me from a young age. Because if it wasn’t, I would constantly be shocked at how much motherfuckers hate Jews.”Zionists have pointed to the Holocaust and centuries of bloody antisemitism as evidence that Jews will never be safe without a state. Rogen, however, argued, “you don’t keep something you’re trying to preserve all in one place”.Asked if he would ever go to live in Israel, Rogen said no. Maron replied: “I’m the same way, and we’re gonna piss off a bunch of Jews.”Lahav Harkov, a senior contributing editor to the Jerusalem Post newspaper, criticised Rogen’s comments on Twitter, saying they were “made from a position of really, really great privilege – and ignorance - if he can’t understand why Israel makes sense to millions of Jews around the world”.Among Zionists, there is anxiety that North American Jews, who could possibly outnumber Israeli Jews, are becoming less supportive of the Jewish state, even as surveys often show the opposite.The debate has frequently reignited after high-profile figures, often Jewish, express views that are highly critical of Israel.Most recently, Peter Beinart, a prominent Jewish American political commentator, was both derided and lauded for commentaries in which he questioned whether he could remain both a liberal and also support the Jewish state while millions of Palestinians continued to be denied basic rights."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/816dbe7055fa60a2f4b5d4cd980a736c4021867d/0_0_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=21145c44397dbe6ff00927bd8e05b3b8","title":"vietnam on high alert coronavirus cases major cities hanoi","story":"First local case in three months reported over the weekend in holiday spot of Da NangVietnam is on high alert and bracing for a rise in coronavirus cases, after local media reported that infections have been detected in the capital, Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh City and the Central Highlands region.The country’s prime minister, Nguyen Xuan Phuc warned on Wednesday that every province and every city was at risk, adding that the new “wave” appeared to be different to that seen in Vietnam earlier this year.Vietnam, which has been praised for its response to the pandemic, reported its first local case for more than three months last weekend, after a man in the central city of Da Nang became ill. Officials have said that the recent infections involve a new strain of the virus that has originated outside of the country, and which seemed to be more virulent.So far, 30 cases of the virus have been detected in or around Da Nang, while two cases have been confirmed in Ho Chi Minh City, and one has been reported in both Hanoi and Central Highlands. There are growing fears that tens of thousands of people holidaying in the coastal city of Da Nang may have transported the virus across the country over recent weeks.“We have to act more swiftly and more fiercely in order to control the outbreak,” the state broadcaster VTV reported Phuc as telling a meeting of government officials. He said tourist hubs throughout the country should increase vigilance.Epidemics of infectious diseases behave in different ways but the\u0026nbsp1918 influenza pandemic\u0026nbspthat killed more than 50 million people is regarded as a key example of a pandemic that occurred in multiple waves, with the latter more severe than the first. It has been replicated – albeit more mildly – in subsequent flu pandemics.How and why multiple-wave outbreaks occur, and how subsequent waves of infection can be prevented, has become a staple of epidemiological modelling studies and pandemic preparation, which have looked at everything from social behaviour and health policy to vaccination and the buildup of community immunity, also known as herd immunity.This is being watched very carefully. Without a vaccine, and with no widespread immunity to the new disease, one alarm is being sounded by the experience of Singapore, which has seen a sudden\u0026nbspresurgence in infections\u0026nbspdespite being lauded for its early handling of the outbreak.Although Singapore instituted a strong contact tracing system for its general population, the disease re-emerged in\u0026nbspcramped dormitory accommodation\u0026nbspused by thousands of foreign workers with inadequate hygiene facilities and shared canteens.Singapore’s experience, although very specific, has demonstrated the ability of the disease to come back strongly in places where people are in close proximity and its ability to exploit any weakness in public health regimes set up to counter it.In June 2020, Beijing suffered from a new cluster of coronavirus cases which caused authorities to re-implement restrictions that China had previously been able to lift. In the UK, the city of Leicester was unable to come out of lockdown because of the development of a new spike of coronavirus cases. Clusters also emerged in Melbourne, requiring a re-imposition of lockdown conditions.Conventional wisdom among scientists suggests second waves of resistant infections occur after the capacity for treatment and isolation becomes exhausted. In this case the concern is that the social and political consensus supporting lockdowns is being overtaken by public frustration and the urgent need to reopen economies.The threat declines when susceptibility of the population to the disease falls below a certain threshold or when widespread vaccination becomes available.In general terms the ratio of susceptible and immune iniduals in a population at the end of one wave determines the potential magnitude of a subsequent wave. The worry is that with\u0026nbspa vaccine still many months away, and the real rate of infection only being guessed at, populations worldwide remain highly vulnerable to both resurgence and subsequent waves.The government is evacuating 80,000 people from Da Nang, mostly tourists who had been taking advantage of discounted travel deals, who will be required to isolate at home. The city has been placed under strict lockdown, with flights suspended.VTV reported that the cases in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City were linked to the cluster in Da Nang.Life in Vietnam had been returning to normal, with many people no longer wearing face masks and domestic tourism booming, but the country is again on high alert. In Hanoi, authorities are tracing people who may have had close contact with a man who works in a pizza restaurant and who is suspected of having Covid-19. Barriers have been placed near to the man’s home, while the restaurant and local area have been disinfected.In Ho Chi Minh City, a hotel has been locked down and a nearby hospital in Binh Tan district has stopped receiving patients for three days, after two suspected Covid-19 cases emerged.About 18,000 tourists who had been in Da Nang have returned to Ho Chi Minh City, officials said on Tuesday. Hanoi authorities had earlier said they were expecting 15,000 to 20,000 to return from the city.The country responded with speed and agility to the pandemic earlier this year, deploying aggressive contact-tracing systems and quarantine measures – avoiding a major outbreak. Despite sharing a border with China, Vietnam has recorded 446 450 Covid-19 cases, and no fatalities.This figure does not include 140 construction workers infected with Covid-19 who were evacuated from Equatorial Guinea on Wednesday, and who will be treated at a hospital outside Hanoi.The source of the new cases is not clear, though the government has responded with a series of arrests linked to illegal immigration. Vietnam remains shut to most foreign travellers, and anyone who enters the country must quarantine on arrival.Reuters contributed to this report"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3aa82aca290a54a947b724c21da584e26d11dd87/0_262_3922_2353/master/3922.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2fede0b473ca8339eee64a356b34f8a5","title":"global report australia sees record daily case rise as global infections near 17m","story":"State of Victoria reports 723 new cases and 13 deaths US deaths pass 150,000 Japan lifts ban on re-entry or some foreign residentsAustralia has reported a record rise in coronavirus infections and deaths, with the state of Victoria announcing more than 700 new cases and 13 deaths, as the state continues to battle significant outbreaks in the aged care sector and among healthcare workers. It comes as global cases passed 17m, after five of the last seven days saw one-day jumps of more than 250,000 new infections.The 723 new cases announced by the Victorian premier Daniel Andrews marked the 25th consecutive day of triple-digit increases in Australia’s second most populous state. Ten of the 13 deaths are believed to be connected to aged care homes. Australia’s previous deadliest day was Sunday, when 10 people were reported to have died.In response to the record high, Andrews announced that from midnight on Thursday, people living in several regional districts south-west of Melbourne would no longer be allowed any visitors to their homes. Andrews also mandated the wearing of face coverings outside home for the entire state, from this Sunday.In the state of Queensland, meanwhile, two coronavirus-infected Brisbane teenagers who dodged quarantine after returning from Victoria will face court, as the state braces itself for a possible outbreak of community transmission. The 19-year-olds returned from Melbourne via Sydney but allegedly lied on their border declaration form to avoid having to quarantine at their own expense in a hotel. A third woman travelled with them, but at this stage has tested negative to the virus and remains in quarantine.The actions of the women has sparked a massive tracing mission for Queensland Health. Shopping centres, restaurants, a school, a church, and aged care centres have been closed.

At PMQs and on the BBC, Johnson said the number of families or children in poverty had fallen by 400,000 since 2010 – after the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, said child poverty had risen by 600,000. Anna Feuchtwang, the chair of End Child Poverty, said the 600,000 figure was correct and “there are actually 1.5 million children classed as low income and materially deprived”.

About 800 million children and young people under the age of 19 are likely to have blood levels of lead at or above 5 micrograms per decilitre (5μgdl), according to the report. There is no safe level for lead exposure, according to the World Health Organization, but levels above 5μgdl are regarded by the US Centers for Disease Control as a cause for action.

It does our economy no good if corruption and illicit funding is allowed to go unchallenged.”West said the report raised questions about the Conservatives’ failure to crack down on money laundering. “The Tories have had 10 years to sort out tax havens in British jurisdictions, but there are concerns that funding from Russian donors to Johnson’s Tory party coffers could be holding them back.”In its response to the Russia report, the government said it was clear that tackling illicit finance and driving dirty money and money launderers out of the UK was a priority. “We are not complacent and we will ensure the full weight of law enforcement bears down on dirty money,” it said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/befdb3516489ab157eb48e8f35f0074c1443c5f7/0_0_3500_2330/master/3500.jpg?width=1010\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=946a5de3210c2e9ea055d72669cbb8cc 2020w","title":"scaled down hajj begins in coronavirus era in pictures","story":"Attendance limited to 10,000 people already residing in Saudi Arabia, rather than the usual 2 million including from abroad, amid Covid-19 restrictions"},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"New Fortress Energy has said is pushing ahead to develop LNG terminal in Shannon EstuaryTillage has strong environmental benefits compared to other types of farming, report saysFacility means fusion takes step towards generating clean energy source at scale"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Michael Viney: Irish numbers have more than doubled since the counts of Operation Seafarer in 1970Michael Viney: A predator denning in parks, gardens and wasteland gets mixed responsesA beefed-up, independent National Parks and Wildlife Service would be just the ticketMichael Viney: Wild grasses have loved the mood swings of our climate this yearAnother Life: As one of many of the world\u0026rsquos declining seabirds, puffins are now receiving much more necessary and serious attentionAnother Life: A new book on the founders of the Tyler Prize shows their political influenceAvian science journal Ibis reports \u0026lsquogreat conservation concern\u0026rsquo about the speciesAnother Life: Dairy farmer Bruce Thompson examines impact of worming drug on beetlesMichael Viney: Crumbling hilltop trig pillars\u0026rsquo played key role in the mapping of IrelandAntipodean flatworms pose risk to indigenous variety which could have severe knock-on effectsAnother Life: Some floaters circle territories and sneak the odd \u0026lsquoextra-pair copulation\u0026rsquoMichael Viney: Plant intelligence rests in the ways by which they solve their problemsA Life on Our Planet is a terrifying catalogue of our self-sabotaging transgressionsGreys carry squirrel-pox virus which is fatal to Ireland\u0026rsquos native redsAnother Life: The disappearance of this bird from cities has prompted much researchRobinson has followed Mair\u0026eacutead, his wife and collaborator, into the list of Covid-19 fatalitiesWill Covid-19 begin a resurgence of the 1970s withdrawal from growth-driven capitalism?Greater industry involvement required if bovine TB to be eliminated by 2030 targetMichael Viney: Camera traps are now used as a regular part of hare monitoringMarine life with very specific habitat needs threatened in the face of sweeping changeThree terrapins as pets seems a bit ambitious considering their needs"},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

The outgoing government argued Simon Coveney should keep his official ministerial car after stepping down as tánaiste because of his frequent visits to Northern Ireland as Minister for Foreign Affairs. Mr Coveney travelled by car to the North 44 times in 2019 and while the number of trips will be less frequent this year because of the Covid-19 pandemic, Government sources said he travelled across the Border (mostly to Belfast) at least once – and sometimes twice – when the Dáil was in session.It is understood that Mr Coveney himself made no request, formal or informal, to retain the car.Outgoing taoiseach Leo Varadkar asked Government Secretary General Martin Fraser to contact the Secretary General of the Department of Justice, Aidan O’Driscoll, to inquire about retaining the State car. The Government is struggling to the finish line of a tumultuous Dáil term as it emerged on Wednesday that the Secretary General of the Department of the Taoiseach had approached his counterpart in the Department of Justice and asked him to contact the Garda Commissioner about a security detail for the former tánaiste. Under a 2011 agreement, Garda drivers are usually made available only to the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and the Minister for Justice. In the Dáil on Wednesday Labour leader Alan Kelly claimed Mr Coveney was using a State car and Garda drivers “without permission” because no Cabinet decision was made to approve the move. He said a Minister going around in a Garda car “costing €200,000 a year without permission” raised “serious questions”.Garda vehicleBefore he became tánaiste Mr Coveney used his own car with civilian drivers. However, whenever he crossed the Border, he was required to change to an unmarked Garda vehicle driven by a Garda driver, which was then escorted by the Police Service of Northern Ireland to his destination. Given the frequency of his travel to the North, it was argued that the practice of using his own car and swapping cars at the Border would not result in significant savings. Moreover, it would also have security implications, said the sources. Separately, on Wednesday a review by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection determined that 85 out of the 2,500 who had their pandemic unemployment payment stopped for leaving the country may in fact be entitled to it. The department said it would be contacting each of these iniduals in the coming days. The Government U-turned and said it would continue the payment for those who travelled to green list countries. Several sources insisted that Minister for Social Protection Heather Humphreys’ decision to change tack had been communicated to the Taoiseach, Micheál Martin, beforehand. However, the fallout from the controversy continued.

It predicted a third of all pubs in the capital could go.Three Dublin pubs have publicly announced that they will not be reopening – the Queens in Dalkey, The Donaghmede Inn in Donaghmede, and The Cardiff Inn, Finglas. LVA chief executive Donall O’Keeffe said seven others have privately said that they are finished, adding that the pubs that do reopen will have to operate at 50 per cent capacity or less. He said Covid-19 has been the “straw that broke the camel’s back” since many pubs in the capital were already struggling with high rents. Rural pubs could be even worse off.LVA president Ronan Hughes, who owns the Swan pub in Aungier Street, said publicans were in “very pessimistic mood”. City-centre pubs were struggling badly, while those in the suburbs “seem to be doing a bit better”."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4317038.1596050455!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"taoiseach urged to rebuke colleague over lazy public servants claim","story":"A Government backbencher has accused public servants of laziness and claimed that they are using the Covid-19 pandemic as an excuse to “lie on the couch and watch box sets”. Video: Oireachtas TVSinn Féin housing spokesman Eoin Ó Broin has written to Micheál Martin about the comments by Sligo-Leitrim TD Marc MacSharry which he said were “wrong, offensive and isive”.Mr MacSharry had alleged that public sector productivity had fallen and this was “unacceptable” as he launched a broadside attack on “many elements of our State agencies, Government departments and local authorities” who he claimed were opportunistic in using the crisis “to do nothing”.The Fianna Fáil TD said he had had “dealings” recently with one State agency “where no one will be back in that office until the end of August”. They are working from home and “you have to talk to an answering machine”.In the letter to the Taoiseach, Mr Ó Broin asked if Mr MacSharry’s remarks “are representative of the policies of Fianna Fáil and of your Government? If not I would strongly urge you to make a public comment on the matter distancing you, your party and your Government from such remarks”.Defending the public service Mr Ó Broin said that “both public and private sector workers are doing everything they can in the national interest while at the same time making significant sacrifices”. “To be treated in this manner by a Government TD will undoubtedly impact on morale and cohesion in the public sector. “It also potentially creates ision between public and private sector workers.”Mr MacSharry had praised staff in the Department of Social Protection who had got so many Covid-related schemes up and running and “managed to get money to people pretty quickly, in the main. They deserve much credit”.But he contrasted that effort with “many elements” in the public service who are “using this situation as cover to lie on the couch and watch box sets, returning an odd call here and there and doing the maximum of the minimum to tick over during this period”.Whether it was “opportunism... laziness andor poor management, it needs to be addressed because the country needs all its officials working at full tilt to get productivity levels up to the maximum so we get through this crisis in the best possible way”. He contrasted poor public sector performance with private sector activity much of which was back “at full tilt”.He said staff in his own office “did not stop for an hour since the onset of Covid-19”. Speaking during a debate on legislation putting the pandemic unemployment payment on a statutory footing, Mr MacSharry said he knew Minister for Enterprise Heather Humphreys had “worked at full tilt throughout this time. I know I have, as have many colleagues, probably all, in the political world. “Many people are not, however, and that needs to be addressed.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4309990.1595345270!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"pity the expert in these sceptical times","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tToo often good science is countered by ignorance.  This is evident in the US, where objectivity has become a matter of opinion. The plight of the federal government’s top infectious diseases expert Dr Anthony Fauci is the prime illustration of this. Photograph: Leah MillisReuters These are hard times for experts notably scientists and doctors who believe data (and their interpretation of it) should be allowed speak for itself and, where appropriate, prompt a response in the best interests of the human race or the world we live in. For those working on Covid-19 and climate change it can be particularly rough terrain.Global authorities in their field of endeavour should not be dismissed so easily, especially those with a record of fashioning effective responses to global crises such as AIDS, Ebola or an overheating planet – or who have added greatly to fundamental knowledge.Too often good science is countered by vitriol accusations of lack of independence and instant condemnation with “yes but...” from non-experts. This is evident in the US, where objectivity has become a matter of opinion. The plight of the federal government’s top infectious diseases expert Dr Anthony Fauci is the prime illustration of this.President Donald Trump, an exponent of anti-science, constantly adds to the cauldron of social media tyranny and displays little respect for those with greater knowledge than himself.His trade adviser Peter Navarro recently declared Fauci was “wrong about everything” – no doubt doing the bidding of his master a man who has never admitted a single mistake in office.The modern phenomenon goes beyond the US. The Irish environmentalist Prof Terry Hughes, an authority on decline of coral reef systems, highlighted on twitter a photograph of a protester whose placard read: “At the start of every disaster movie there is a scientist being ignored” – and added “I have a lot of friends who can relate to this.”This is everyday reality and complicating matters are pigheaded populist leaders, as illustrated this month when UK prime minister Boris Johnson indicated in parliament he had not read a Government-commissioned report warning of a second coronavirus wave next winter which could cost 120,000 lives. He then insisted unconvincingly he was aware of it.Fortunately science has a more prominent position within Irish society. There is widespread recognition of its merits while scientists engender a high level of trust. Strategic investment in a knowledge-based economy has helped. The response to the emerging pandemic, where the public heeded the recommendations of National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET), is proof of this.Were it always so easy.“When you mix science and politics, you get politics,” according to John M Barry author of The Great Influenza: The Story of the Deadliest Pandemic in History. With the coronavirus, the US has proved politics hasn’t worked, he believes. So to “fully reopen both the economy and schools safely...we have to return to science”.The dynamic is different in Ireland though resolution is equally difficult to achieve, such is the deviousness of Covid-19. The politicians have to balance what the science is saying, economic consequences and wellbeing.Independent networkThis is typical of modern policy challenges facing governments characterised by a mixture of complexity, uncertainty and ambiguity. That is why there is a compelling case for an independent network of scientific advisers to advise government “on the formidable scientific challenges facing Ireland” as outlined by Royal Irish Academy president Dr Mary Canning.“Policymakers are increasingly confronted with highly complex policy issues requiring multiple forms of knowledge, including scientific insights, experiential knowledge and local perspectives,” she explained.This should be provided by a multi-disciplinary network of specialists in a similar way to NPHET but on a permanent basis. Just look what might be coming down the tracks: a flu pandemic a storm surge driven by a hurricane that heads for Ireland rather than the Caribbean, unprecedented sea level rise caused by melting Arctic ice sheets, and dramatic ageing of our population post 2050.The physicist and science communicator Brian Greene revealed the extent of his concern about the disconnect between specialists and the public when asked by the Financial Times, what is the greatest challenge of our time?He responded: “Many would focus on the most immediate: saving the planet from the devastation wrought by human activity. I’d like to add changing the mindset of the public to recognise that the tools of rational investigation, of science, are available to everyone – and have the capacity not only to radically transform the challenges we face, but also to realise enormous opportunities. The health of democracy requires that every citizen has some familiarity with scientific ideas.”There is much work to do on this front to bring us all to that better – and safer – place."},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"Australian state reports daily record of 723 new infections as PM calls for patienceNajib convicted of all seven charges in first trial linked to multibillion dollar scandalHarry Harris\u0026rsquos facial hair had offended some South Koreans with reminder of Japanese ruleGood-natured crowd witnesses Chinese officials moving in as US consulate closesExperts say unfolding disaster exacerbated by mistimed lockdown ordered by Narendra ModiMove is seen as a retaliation for China\u0026rsquos removal from its consulate in Houston, TexasThere is a real fear in China that things are starting to spin out of controlRecord 10 deaths confirmed as Victoria\u0026rsquos second wave is driven by workplace spreadLockdown declared in border town as \u0026lsquorunaway\u0026rsquo returns from South - state media\u0026lsquoWhy are they playing Radiohead?

Photograph:  Colin KeeganCollinsThe public debate in Ireland since the pandemic struck has revealed a prevalent assumption that travelling outside the island means going on holiday.Apart from being age and class-specific, this belief is deeply off-kilter for a nation with one of the highest proportions of its citizens living abroad in the world. One in six, according to a 2016 assessment, the highest level in the OECD.The equation of overseas travel with holidays, evident in statements by both government and opposition politicians, involves two key flawed assumptions.One is an idea that overseas summer holidays are a universal norm, rather than a luxury enjoyed by some. (The adoption of the term “staycation” to mean a holiday in Ireland, rather than the previously more common meaning of a holiday in your own house, is another illustration. Isn’t the quintessential summer holiday in Wexford? For whom is this a downgrade from a “real” holiday?)The other assumption involves a peculiar blindness to the reality that Irish families and work practices are international.“It’s bizarre . . . There can hardly be a household in the country without someone who can’t get home,” was how the disconnect was described to me by Dr Marc Scully, a lecturer in the psychology department at Mary Immaculate College Limerick who studies migration and the Irish diaspora.Flawed framingCoverage in the Irish media is also culpable for the flawed framing of the issue. As one of the Irish stranded abroad, it was jarring and disconcerting to read news about the government’s travel advice framed as a consumer story, and illustrated with photographs of beaches and headlines lamenting the loss of holidays this summer.The equation of travel with holidays was repeated throughout the furore over the Department of Social Protection’s cancellation of benefit payments to people who were found to be travelling through ports or airports.“If a person chooses to ignore public health advice and go on holidays, they are not just unavailable for work for the duration of their holiday, they are also unavailable for the two-week quarantine period on their return,” Minister for Social Protection Heather Humphreys said in defence of the practice.This illustrates an assumption that if people are in an airport, they are there for leisure reasons.I’m a 2009 graduate. Airports don’t mean holidays to me. They mean work, and how I see my family.Dr Scully himself lived in Ireland while working in Britain for six months, taking a plane full of weary commuters each week on the red eye from Cork airport.“If this had happened three years ago, I would have been faced with the decision of: do I resign my job, or do I face not seeing my wife and son for six months? I can only imagine there are people who have had to make that decision,” Dr Scully said.“Or people who are caring for family members, who have suddenly had to make the decision of: do I quit my job, or do I suddenly try to sort out the caring responsibilities elsewhere?”“There’s a way of life there that has suddenly stopped,” he observed.Here are some reasons why people can be in an airport. On their way to collect someone from hospital. Going to a job interview. Seeing a solicitor about a will. On the way to hospital themselves.Airport storiesListen to the stories of those who were stopped in Dublin airport by the welfare officers and this is the reality that is reflected.Roman Shortall was stopped before boarding a flight to Romania with his family. Shortall’s wife, now a naturalised Irish citizen, is originally from Romania, and they were going to see a terminally ill relative. Their child benefit payments were stopped.Ciaran Cooney is a guitarist and singer with the Irish Celtic show who is resident in Ireland but earns 70 per cent of his income working abroad. His pandemic unemployment payment was stopped after he was checked boarding a flight to Glasgow to spend nine days with his partner, who he had not seen for 15 weeks. He had no income for six weeks and had to move back in with his parents.“There is no consideration for people who are in relationships with people who live outside the state or those of us who work abroad for a living but were fully tax compliant in Ireland all the time,” he wrote of the incident.To be absolutely clear: this is not a challenge to the government’s advice on travel. It’s an appeal to ground the debate in the reality of what travel means to the Irish population as a whole, and not the subsection that is primarily concerned about overseas holidays.Prior to the pandemic, Dublin to London was one of the busiest air routes in the world. That’s down to work and family ties, not tourism. This mobility is fundamental to how Ireland has operated as a nation since at least the last recession.

Instead, pebbles were collected in bags and sterilised in advance. Hand sanitiser and soap were also in ample supply. All expenses were covered by the Saudi government, including healthcare for anyone who falls ill during the pilgrimage.  Words aren\u0027t enough to explain how blessed I feel and how amazing the arrangements have been, Ammar Khaled, a 29-year-old Saudi resident from India, told the Associated Press. They have taken every possible precaution,” he added. With people based overseas forbidden from joining Hajj, the 1,000 places for Saudi residents were hotly contested. Residents were required to fill out an application form, with around a third of the places reserved for Saudi security and medical staff. Applicants had to be between 20 and 50 years old with no terminal illnesses, and all were tested for coronavirus before they were allowed to take part. As many applications were rejected, there was some grumbling on Saudi social media once the results were announced, and some pilgrims said they had resisted the urge to announce their success on social media for fear of making their friends jealous. The Hajj follows a route the Prophet Muhammad walked nearly 1,400 years ago and is believed to trace the footsteps of the prophets Ibrahim and Ismail, or Abraham and Ishmael as they are named in the Bible.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"stonehenges giant sarsens came marlborough downs say archaeologists","story":"The prehistoric builders of Stonehenge are renowned for hauling the megalithic bluestones 140 miles from the Preseli Mountains in north Pembrokeshire, west Wales, to their final home on Salisbury Plain, Wiltshire.However, perhaps the mammoth journey, roughly 4,500 years ago, proved too much for them – for when it came to later sourcing the larger sarsen stones, they looked closer to home.Archaeologists from English Heritage and the University of Sheffield have solved a centuries-old mystery and concluded that the sarsens originated in the West Woods of the Marlborough Downs, just 15 miles north of Stonehenge.It is not far from the Neolithic monument site of Avebury, and the area is likely to have been a significant or ritual landscape. The monument at Avebury is a Neolithic henge containing three stone circles, around the village of Avebury, Wiltshire.The breakthrough came when a piece of core – drilled from Stonehenge\u0027s Stone 58 during repair work in the 1950s – was returned to English Heritage from the US last year, which gave archaeologists the chance to analyse the chemical make-up without damaging the monument.English Heritage historian Susan Greaney said: The bluestones we\u0027ve known come from mid-west Wales from the 1920s, and they were easy to source because there are inclusions and quartz which you can match to the outcrop. The large stones are pretty uniform and just look like a big block, so it\u0027s difficult to interrogate them and find where they are from. The new research used X-ray spectrometry to look at the very small trace elements, and it was found the Stonehenge sarsens matched those in the Marlborough Downs. The sarsens average approximately 20 tonnes but can be as heavy  as 30, and the largest is 30 feet long. There are no sarsens of this size left in the downs, that\u0027s why it\u0027s been such a mystery and some people have suggested they come from elsewhere as you get outcrops in other places where you have chalkland, like Decon and Kent,” Ms Greaney added. The West Wood was overlooked because its under ancient woodland, and a lot of sarsens were removed in the 19th century for roadstones, particularly in Swindon, but there are still sarsens buried in amongst the trees.To be able to pinpoint the area that Stonehenge’s builders used to source their materials around 2,500 BC is a real thrill.While the Preseli stones were probably chosen for ritual or location reasons, the sarsens were likely to have been picked for their size, archaeologists believe. But although 10 times shorter than the journey from Wales, moving 30 tonne stones would still have proven a tricky prospect and the sarsens may have moved on the River Avon for part of the way.We can now say, when sourcing the sarsens, the overriding objective was size – they wanted the biggest, most substantial stones they could find and it made sense to get them from as nearby as possible, said Ms Greaney. This is in stark contrast to the source of the bluestones, where something quite different – a sacred connection to these mountains perhaps – was at play. Yet again, this evidence highlights just how carefully considered and deliberate the building of this phase of Stonehenge was.Professor David Nash, a geomorphologist from the University of Brighton, said: It has been really exciting to harness 21st-century science to understand the Neolithic past, and finally answer a question that archaeologists have been debating for centuries.”The team is now hoping to carry out more survey work on the Marlborough Downs, looking for sarsen chips and wedges which might indicate where the original location of the stones.The research was published in the journal Science Advances.In 2008, the X-ray spectrometry technique was used to visualise the paint below Vincent van Gogh\u0027s Patch of Grass and pick out the inidual brush strokes as well as the  flesh tones of the hidden head of a woman.Cornell University has also used it to analyse inscriptions from Greek and Roman pottery. Carvings that have been entirely worn away on the surface can still be visible through the tiny amount of iron left by a chisel, allowing words to emerge from seemingly smooth stone.In 2011, an unfinished self-portrait of Rembrandt was discovered under another painting using X-ray fluorescence.Conservation experts used the technique to understand the origins of the 1,400-year-old Staffordshire Hoard, a collection of more than 3,500 Anglo-Saxon artefacts discovered by a metal detector enthusiast in a field in Staffordshire in 2009.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"us announces withdrawal 11000 troops delinquent germany","story":"The US has announced it is to withdraw nearly 12,000 troops from Germany, in a move Donald Trump said was intended to punish the “delinquent” Nato member for not spending enough on defence.The US president had declared his intention last month to cut by about a third the 36,000-strong US troop contingent in Germany, faulting its ally for failing to meet the alliance’s spending target and accusing it of taking advantage of America on trade.Of the troops leaving - a mix of Army and Air Force units - some 5,400 will be relocated to Italy and elsewhere in Europe, while 6,400 forces will be returned to the US and will in time redeploy to the continent.As part of the shakeup, which is estimated to cost billions of dollars, the US’s European Command headquarters and Special Operations Command Europe will also be moved from Stuttgart to Belgium.Germany\u0027s Defense Ministry refused to comment on the moves, saying the plans needed to be discussed internally first.Mark Esper, US Defence Secretary, cast the decision as a way to “enhance deterrence against Russia” and strengthen Nato.However, Mr Trump later told journalists: “they\u0027re not paying their bills. It\u0027s very simple. They\u0027re delinquent. He added that he might rethink the decision to pull troops out of Germany if they start paying their bills.“We don’t want to be the suckers anymore,” he said. “The United States has been taken advantage of for 25 years, both on trade and on the military.”The president has repeatedly accused Germany of failing to pay bills, which is a misstatement of the issue. Nato nations have pledged to dedicate 2 per cent of their gross domestic product to defense spending by 2024, and Germany is still short of that goal, at about 1.4 per cent.Defence officials too yesterday insisted that the decision as to where to house the US troops leaving Germany was not influenced by whether the new host country was meeting the two per cent target.Belgium and Italy, the two countries that will be receiving US troops from Germany, spend an even smaller percentage on defence than Berlin does.Members of the Republican Party have criticised the move as a gift to Russia and a threat to US national security. It remains to be seen if Congress would approve the funds for such a major relocation and if the plan would remain intact if Joe Biden, presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, is elected.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"western liberals covid myopia condemning worlds poorest","story":"Lockdown has polarised British society widening the gulf between the haves and have-nots, in a culture war yielding familiar tropes and characters. “Just stay at home, it’s not hard,” says the lawyer to the electrician. “Don’t sunbathe in the park!” cries Pandora from her Notting Hill townhouse. There is some truth in the caricature. But few have noted how the Pandora effect is also playing out on a monstrous global scale, inflicting unimaginable suffering. Around the world, lockdowns are pushing the already impoverished into outright destitution. Stay-at-home orders – bad enough for employees in countries with welfare states – become lethal for hand-to-mouth workers reliant on a daily income to survive. An estimated one billion people globally depend on money sent home from family members abroad, yet as millions have been laid off and confined, jobless, to their homes, remittances are projected to fall by a fifth this year in what the World Bank calls “the sharpest decline in recent history”. Environmentalists may rejoice at the plunge in air traffic, but the collapse in tourism has also destroyed one highly effective way of transferring wealth from advanced economies to developing ones. Farmers in the developing world, unable to sell their produce, face ruin due to the destruction of global supply chains. Restrictions on movement, and a collapse in funding for humanitarian agencies, are blocking the distribution of aid to the neediest people on earth. Lockdown-associated economic turmoil is weighing particularly heavily on the young and vulnerable. In India, destitution is propelling desperate parents into the arms of human traffickers, with their false promises of lucrative jobs for children in mega-cities like New Delhi and Mumbai. According to the UN, Covid-linked malnutrition is causing the deaths of an additional 10,000 children a month. Tragically, lockdowns look set to kill many more youngsters than the virus itself.Such consequences, long predicted, are now too blatant to ignore. Yet the parochialism and narrow-mindedness of our debate has been extraordinary. Obsessing over the possibility of a second wave, our Government seems incapable of computing the economic consequences of not lifting lockdown, domestically and for the world beyond Europe. Despite the wildly differing circumstances, bodies such as the World Health Organisation have largely promoted the same, Western playbook of containment. Their advice ignores what should be core variables such as when stay-at-home orders mean confining millions in cramped, poorly sanitised conditions, or that the exorbitant human cost of an economic downturn will be greater with millions already below the poverty line. Even the comparatively young demographics of developing nations has been widely overlooked. There are alternatives to this clunky template. Primarily to avert economic meltdown, Pakistan rolled back many of its shutdown measures in a modified strategy designed to balance lives and livelihoods – an approach so far vindicated by falling case numbers. President Imran Khan has even broached the question of long-term coexistence with the virus – something few UK lawmakers have been bold enough to do.It may seem an odd concept, at a time of creeping poverty, but there is an air of luxury – even decadence – about our lockdown obsession. In a form of latter-day imperialism, countries that can afford to weather the economic storm (or believe they can) are demanding their model be imposed on impoverished countries for which it guarantees catastrophe. How ironic, yet how unsurprising, that Western liberals, immersed in identity politics and “check your privilege”, have ignored the unequal effects of lockdown on the global economy.It should require little imagination to perceive the colossal humanitarian harm of closing down entire societies and economies. Yet Covid myopia has blinded too many to the fact that decisions, policies and changes in consumer habits cannot be disentangled from the wider world. For months, those who raised such concerns have been shouted down by lockdown fanatics with cries of “one life is too many”. No longer. The developing world cannot afford to hunker down and await the virus’s eradication. Neither can we. More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/07/21/15/5.-kiss-you-video-still.jpg","title":"celebrate 10 years of one direction with spotifys new platform experiences","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.Calling all 1D stans!

A man on a neighbouring plot told the agency that the garden had not been used for the last two years.German authorities said last month they had identified a 43-year-old German citizen as a suspect in the case and are investigating him on suspicion of murder.Brueckner, 43, is currently in prison for drug dealing, and is appealing a conviction for the 2005 rape of a 72-year-old American woman in Praia da Luz. The attack happened a year and a half before Madeleine’s disappearance.Germany’s Federal Criminal Police Office (BKA) has said Brueckner had a history of child sex offences and other crimes, including drug trafficking and burgling holiday apartments in Portugal.Having spent many years in Portugal since 1995, after fleeing a German prison sentence, he was last registered as living in the German city of Braunschweig, which is about 64km (40 miles) from Hanover.Scotland Yard has previously admitted Brueckner was among 600 people previously considered of potential significance during the McCann inquiry, but was not considered a suspect until a 2017 appeal unearthed new information.Additional reporting by PANo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Archaeologists have solved one of Stonehenge’s greatest mysteries — the precise source of the world-famous prehistoric temple’s largest stones.A new scientific breakthrough has, for the first time, allowed geologists to pinpoint almost exactly where Stonehenge’s giant stone uprights and lintels came from.Up until now, all that archaeologists knew with reasonable certainty was that the stones (a type of rock known as sarsen) had been brought in around 2500BC by the great temple’s Neolithic builders from the Marlborough Downs or immediately adjacent areas — a 75 sq miles area, 15-25 miles north of Stonehenge.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesBut now scientists from the University of Brighton have traced the stones to a small very specific two sq mile part of that range of hills — a patch of woodland just south of the village of Lockeridge, Wiltshire.In prehistoric and indeed later times, that area (now known as West Woods) seems to have been strewn with particularly large sarsen boulders, geochemically identical to those used to build Stonehenge.Humans reached Americas 11,000 years earlier than previously thoughtRecent detailed examination of the West Woods area by Reading University archaeologist, Katy Whitaker, suggests that the builders of Stonehenge probably chose it as their source of stone because of the exceptional sizes and relative flatness of many of its sarsen boulders.New archaeological research about the site has revealed that even 1200 years before Stonehenge was built, the West Woods area’s great sarsen slabs were used to construct a massive local prehistoric tomb.Now that the source of Stonehenge’s great stones has finally been identified, archaeological attention is likely to turn to discovering the precise route used by the monument’s prehistoric builders to move the giant 20-40tn stones from West Woods to Stonehenge (a distance of around 15 miles).There are two main options — an eastern route down the Wiltshire Avon Valley and a western route across Salisbury Plain.The western option would have involved a short segment where they would have had to haul the boulders up a 14 per cent gradient for around 300m.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailBut the eastern option would probably have involved hauling the giant stones (around 80 of them) for at least six miles along a river valley through relatively dense woodland and scrub. It would almost certainly not have been possible to use a raft on that river (the Wiltshire Avon) because the width of raft required to transport such large boulders would almost certainly have been much greater than the width of the river itself.On the balance of probabilities, it’s perhaps more likely that the builders of Stonehenge opted for the western route, despite the need to haul the stones up a hill.That route would have taken them south from West Woods across the southern part of the Marlborough Downs and down a very steep hill into the Vale of Pewsey. They would then have taken what was perhaps an already ancient trackway past (or indeed through) a huge prehistoric ritual and ceremonial complex (at Marden) across the river Avon and then up onto Salisbury Plain.It was that ascent onto Salisbury Plain, which involved the only moderately steep part of the journey (the 14 per cent gradient). Then they would have crossed the relatively flat and unforested plain to Stonehenge itself.If they did opt for this, on balance easier, western route, then the fact that they (and their massive stones) would have passed by or through the Marden ritual complex is potentially significant.In architectural terms, Stonehenge was destined to be the most impressive religious complex in Neolithic Britain — but Marden may well have been the biggest.Archaeological investigations over recent years (led by archaeologist, Dr Jim Leary, now of the University of York) have revealed that the Marden complex consisted of three great monuments — a vast 500m diameter banked enclosure north of the River Avon, a huge roughly 20m tall, 70m diameter ceremonial mound in the centre of that enclosure — and another banked enclosure, south of the river, surrounded by a 100m diameter circle of massive 1m diameter wooden “obelisks”.Having discovered the source of the giant stones of Stonehenge, archaeologists may soon be in in a position to make another potentially significant discovery about more than 100 fragments of sarsen stone found at Marden.In deploying the same scientific techniques used to pinpoint the source of the Stonehenge sarsens, scientists may ultimately be able to discover where the Marden fragments came from. Detailed preliminary examination of those enigmatic fragments will begin later this year.Those fragments appear to have been gathered together in the Marden ritual complex at around the same time that the Stonehenge sarsens may have been passing through that monument.So if it were ultimately to turn out that the Marden fragments came from West Woods, then it is conceivable that those fragments may have been removed from Stonehenge-bound sarsen boulders — potentially to shape them (and thus reduce their weight) prior to their ascent onto Salisbury Plain.Sarsen stone, the type of rock used to build Stonehenge and Avebury stone circle, may well have been regarded as profoundly mysterious by prehistoric people — because they normally only occur as loose or semi-buried boulders, completely unconnected to any bedrock. Indeed, the bedrock in the Marlborough Downs is chalk — so the presence (back in the Neolithic) of hundreds of thousands of often huge boulders composed of an obviously totally different type of stone (sometimes even arranged in straight lines across the landscape) would have been seen by prehistoric people as unusual.Worldwide, anomalous stones have often been regarded by many cultures as spiritually and physically interchangeable with humans — sometimes with a belief that particular stones contained the souls, spirits or even the transformed mortal remains of the dead. The belief was widespread, occurring on virtually every continent.It is likely therefore that the builders of Stonehenge, Avebury and other stone circles perceived sarsen in both practical construction terms and also in more spiritual ones.In geological terms, sarsen is just a very hard sandstone. It was formed around 50 million years ago when fresh groundwater gradually deposited additional silica while flowing through sand deposits. In some places, that silica then acted as a natural “glue” to bind trillions of sand grains together, thus forming solid rock.When later erosion subsequently removed the surrounding “unglued” (ie loose) sand, all that was left were the sarsen boulders.Because the chemicals in the original sand varied from locality to locality, modern scientists have now been able to develop a way of producing very accurate chemical fingerprints for sarsen stones from different locations. The system has been developed by University of Brighton geomorphologist and geographer, Professor David Nash. He has now used it to solve the mystery of where Stonehenge’s sarsens came from. It’s the first time that sarsen “fingerprinting” has been used to solve a major archaeological puzzle. The new British Academy funded research is being published today by the American on-line free-access journal Science Advances.“It has been really exciting to harness 21st-century science to understand the Neolithic past, and finally answer a question that archaeologists have been debating for centuries,” said Professor Nash.“We can now say, when sourcing the sarsens, the overriding objective was size,” said English Heritage senior properties historian Susan Greaney.‘Astonishing’ discovery of ancient monument next to Stonehenge“The builders of Stonehenge wanted the biggest, most substantial stones they could find,” she added.As well as the giant sarsen stones, Stonehenge also has a significant number of much smaller stones (the so-called bluestones). Over the years, scientists have succeeded in demonstrating that those smaller (2-3tn) standing stones were brought by Stonehenge’s builders from southwest Wales.Professor Nash was able to analyse the Stonehenge sarsens because a core extracted from one of the monuments giant stones during repair work in the 1950s (and taken to America by one of the engineers involved in that work) was returned to English Heritage last year.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

This is by no means a downgrade – after all, international tourists marvel at the UK’s impressive array of country house hotels, seaside cottages, boutique hotels, traditional inns, pubs-with-rooms and campsites on offer. But for a holiday to remember, a spot of glamping is hard to beat.For those of us who’ve had our appreciation for nature reawakened by lockdown, a glamping stay at a British yurt, gypsy caravan, shepherd’s hut or barn delivers a change of scene, outdoorsy activities, locally-sourced food, charming surroundings, luxury and comfort. Here are some key things to think about before your book...A beginners\u0027 guide to glamping Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesGiven the wide range of accommodation on offer, there really is a British glampsite perfect for every traveller. Just make sure you ask yourself a few simple questions before you book.For example, is there phone signal or Wi-Fi? A forced digital detox could be stressful if you’d hoped to stay contactable, but some travellers will consider it a bonus to be out of reach.Also, is there a pub, cafe or shop within walking distance, or will you need to arrive fully self-sufficient? Strolling to a local farm shop for daily provisions adds to the charm of glamping, whereas driving 30 minutes to the nearest supermarket is less of a joy.Equally importantly, what are your rainy options? This might be anything from a Scrabble marathon with a bottle of Merlot, or an underground caving adventure.Stay safe and have fun with this important travel guidance:Only travel in a car with members of your household andor support bubbleAlways wear a face covering or mask on public transportWash your hands before putting on your face covering and after you’ve taken it offWash your face covering dailyWhere possible, leave the car behind and reach your destination by walking or cyclingThe joy of glamping is that you can be packed in under half an hour – there’s no need to spend hours decanting instant coffee into tiny containers, searching for your head torch in the loft, and spending the drive wondering if you forgot the tent pegs. Bad weather is less of a concern too: a week under canvas isn’t much of a holiday, but cosying up in a gypsy caravan or yurt during a storm can be downright romantic.It\u0027s this convenience, comfort and peace of mind that you’re paying for when you book a glampsite, so don’t overthink the trip or stress about your packing list. Leave that to the camping crew.Whether you\u0027re an extrovert adventurer or a laid-back stargazer, there\u0027s a glamping holiday in the UK for you. Here are great staycation selections to inspire you...Go back to your rootsThe Faraway Treehouse in Cumbria is straight out of a fairy tale, with plush velvet curtains, a roll top bath and a balcony to spot deer from during the day. The treehouse is bound to be a hit with families, but it’s a ridiculously romantic getaway for couples too.Faraway Treehouse sleeps two (with space for two children at no additional charge), from £165 per night.Get away from it allTo really get away from it all, take the ferry to the Isle of Skye and bunker down in a beautifully decorated yurt from Skye Yurts. Be sure to stay for at least five nights to hike this gorgeous island, kayak the coves, dine at the Michelin-starred Kinloch Lodge and generally feel a world away from reality.Base rate is £80 per night for two people.Step back in time – with modern comfortsLawnsgate Camping in the North York Moors offers glamping options including a yurt, gypsy caravan (pictured above) and cabin, as well as conventional tent pitchesThis is a working farm that has been in the family for generations, so it’s the real deal, and the picturesque nearby villages and on-site llama-trekking means there’s plenty to do.The Yurt is from £90 per night The Gypsy Caravan is £55 per night and The Game Larder is £60 per night. Watch the starsThe popular glampsite Finn Lough in Enniskillen offers superb stargazing opportunities through the transparent walls of the camping ‘bubbles’.Kayaking, hiking, wakeboarding and other outdoor activities are available nearby, and this scenic corner of Northern Ireland is also well worth exploring by bike or car.Prices start at £265 per night for domes or £145 for suites.Talk with the animalsYou don’t need to splurge on an African safari to spend the night surrounded by lions, tigers and bears.Glamping prices start from £350 per night.How Gilcombe Farm got ready to welcome glampers When events had to be postponed, Amelia Griffin and husband Simon Gerrard, pictured above, sought a new venture to add to their Crescent Moon events company.The solution? A glamping site on 300-acre Gilcombe Farm just outside Bruton in Somerset, near where they live. “It’s lovely countryside,” Griffin says. “There’s loads of gorgeous walks, and people can come just to enjoy the great outdoors.”The site hosts 10 Lotus Belle tents with comfortable Moroccan-style interiors, each eight metres apart with their own designated toilet and mini kitchen. “We could have put more tents in, but didn’t want to because of the present situation,” Griffin explains.Four-day bookings from Thursday to Monday enable the tents to be cleaned and left empty for a few days, and hand sanitiser is widely available on the site.The farm shop offers local produce and delivers to the tents. The couple have also added yoga classes, and outdoor film screenings when all 10 tents are booked.Your staycation checklist: know before you goMany locations across the UK are reopening but are restricting visitor numbers and offering pre-booked time slots.

All money raised from the auction will go to The Independent’s appeal partner, The Felix Project, London’s largest food surplus distribution charity. Our campaign has so far raised £7.5m towards our £10m goal which includes a pledge to open London’s largest community kitchen to tackle food poverty.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHighlights from the Sotheby’s Help the Hungry auction include a drawing from Tracey Emin, a series of three etchings by Anish Kapoor, Mark Wallinger’s “Ghost”, and Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith’s “We Have Only Got Each Other” placard.British-Nigerian artist Yinka Shonibare also joins the catalogue with his “Unstructured Icons - Aristocrat I” alongside a pair of polished steel reliefs by Michael Craig-Martin and a floral plate by Chinese artist Ai Weiwei.   How to support our campaignSotheby’s senior director Oliver Barker said: “We are grateful to the artists who have generously contributed their works and we’re looking forward to channelling part of the excitement of our major sales in London this month into a cause which will provide food and comfort to the capital’s most vulnerable.”  Evgeny Lebedev, proprietor of The Independent, said: “We are delighted to be raising money with Sotheby’s and some of the world’s leading contemporary artists to help build London’s biggest community kitchen that will continue to feed those in need for years to come.”The Felix Project distributes nutritious food that would otherwise go to waste to 350 frontline charities, schools and holiday programmes in London.Founder Justin Byam Shaw said: “Although our food is surplus and donated to us and we have over 1,500 volunteers, our costs are still spiralling. “The coming unemployment crisis means we are in this for the long term. This new community kitchen will provide a high-quality meal for homeless Londoners, cooked by great chefs using surplus food.” Turner Prize-winning artist Mark Wallinger said: “I am delighted to contribute to help raise funds for The Felix Project, a fantastic charity that does such vital work in providing food for vulnerable people throughout London, work that is ever more necessary in our current crisis.”Sotheby’s Help The Hungry Auction will go live on 20 July and will run until 30 July.Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Activists are working to save the 4,000 goats at a farm where workers were caught brutally attacking the animals in a scandal that led to three people being sacked.Animal-rights group Surge is also pressing farm bosses to accept help in switching to farming plants instead of goats.The owner of Far Marsh Farm in East Yorkshire told The Independent it may have to shut down after secret camera footage revealed workers inflicting agonising injuries on the animals.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesGoats were punched, hit with a pole, dragged by their ears and slammed down, leaving some so crippled they struggled to stand up.The farm is one of a number that supplied goat milk to St Helen’s Farm, the UK’s biggest goat-milk brand, before The Independent exposed the cruelty.Farm at centre of goat cruelty scandal may have to close, owners sayMarks \u0026amp Spencer and all the big supermarkets except Morrisons said they pulled from sale St Helen’s products, including milk, cheese and butter, after seeing the footage.Surge, which obtained the footage – filmed last month – says it has secured spaces at animal sanctuaries for 42 of Far Marsh Farm’s goats, and is appealing to people who could home others to join a rescue operation.The group also wants supporters to contact St Helen’s to lobby for the goats to be handed over.The activists are working with a company that specialises in helping dairy farmers to switch to producing plant milk and convert their land into sanctuaries.The company, Refarm’d, is offering to use the farm infrastructure to set up “vertical” farms – where plants are grown on suspended shelves in stacks. Advocates of vertical farming say benefits include eliminating run-off of polluted water and reducing food air miles.Goats punched, hit and ‘left lame’ at farm supplying supermarket milkThe video footage showed goats at Far Marsh Farm crying out in pain as they were held by their necks, had their ears tagged or had their tails twisted.

We are horrified. We had no idea this was going on.

At a time when Londoners from all walks of life are struggling due to the impact of coronavirus, the importance of love and care from others has been magnified tenfold.The phrase comes from a work made by the artist Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith – one of several fantastic lots in an auction kicking off today at sothebys to support The Independent’s Help the Hungry appeal.Over the past four months we have raised more than £7.5m for food redistribution charity The Felix Project – a cause for which we have pledged to raise £10m as well as to open central London’s largest community kitchen.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe auction is an opportunity to get your hands on works by some amazing artists – more likely to be seen on the walls of a museum than your living room. They can also be viewed at Sotheby’s, 34-35 New Bond Street.Ceramic has been a recurring motif for Ai Weiwei (a 1995 series of photographs showed him dropping a Han dynasty urn) and he has often used porcelain, for centuries a secret formula known only to Chinese makers. Flowers, too, are significant – when his passport was taken Ai put a bunch of fresh flowers in a bike basket outside his studio every day until he was able to travel freely. This small plate holds a great deal of meaning.Yinka Shonibare deconstructions of icons of western power couldn’t be more current. This elegant woodcut print, using vivid Batik textiles, transposes animal masks from Mali onto the faces of English aristocratic figures enriched off the back of colonisation and slavery. The patterns of textiles overlay the repeating patterns of power and show how history’s long fingers reach into our present.Unfailingly optimistic, Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith’s work is always a call to care. He’s known for his colourful and impassioned but peaceful slogans (“Make Art Not War” seems like a good standard to live by) and his advocacy of art as a tool for education and understanding. We Have Only Got Each Other quotes his late mother, the artist Deirdre Borlase, spoken in response to the isions revealed during the Brexit campaign — but its universal meaning is clear.I’m a sucker for a good drawing – I’ve always felt that even at 500-odd years distance, it’s the form that brings you closest to an artist the sweep of a human hand that has just left the page. After many years of deeply mining her own emotions and experiences in her work, Emin is an artist at the height of her powers. Her raw, almost agonisingly expressive draughtsmanship gets me every time and this little sketch nails the feeling of having a really good cry.These three etchings – a supremely generous donation from Anish Kapoor, more usually known for the interactive theatricality of his large-scale sculptures – exude a quiet drama. Their simplicity belies their seductiveness velvety and intense, they draw you in, never quite revealing their secrets.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Wallinger was inspired by X-rays of Old Masters, which he thinks of as akin to spirit photography: “The revelation of the invisible, supernatural life of a painting.”A reminder of the pre-lockdown era, when we were able to wander the Hayward Gallery and bathe in the sea of pulsating colour that was Riley’s superb exhibition. This screenprint is from a series that vibrates right off the paper (Tate owns an edition of Elongated Triangles 5, so you’ll be in good company if you get your hands on this one).The essence of things is what Michael Craig-Martin seeks in his work, and colour is part of seducing the viewer to really look at the objects that make up our world. These sculptural reliefs in polished steel come from a series that pays homage to designers and architects whose vision has shaped what we think of as “modern”. You can’t sit on them, but look at them.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.A gridlock in the UK’s visa processing system has left people unable to work or travel to see dying relatives during the pandemic despite being legally resident, prompting renewed criticism of the Home Office’s privatised visa service.Hundreds and possibly thousands of foreign nationals have been left in a “state of limbo” after being informed that although visa centres have reopened, they must continue to wait before they can proceed with submitting their biometrics.Foreign nationals in the UK are required to submit their biometric information, such as fingerprints, in order to obtain a visa. This process usually takes place in centres across the country run by firm Sopra Steria, which is contracted by the Home Office to deliver the service.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesBefore the private company took over the contract last year, applicants could go to their local post office to provide biometric data. Under Sopra Steria’s service, they must attend one of six “core centres” across the country that offer a free service, or one of another 51 that usually charge a fee starting from £69.99.However, these centres were closed in March because of the lockdown, putting the process on hold. A phased reopening of the centres began on 1 June, but nearly two months on, many applicants are still “in limbo”.People left without proof of UK status as visa centre fees soarAt the start of July, the Home Office informed applicants who had previously applied for UK visas that they would be put through a new process which would reuse biometrics they had submitted previously, and that therefore they could not book an appointment at one of the visa centres. But there has been no update since on when this new process will begin.Meanwhile, first-time applicants, who can still book appointments, have found that there are no free appointments being offered by Sopra Steria, despite the fact that all core centres are supposed to provide slots without charge. This has left some unable to afford to submit their biometrics, or having to travel long distances to do so.David Pountney, senior solicitor at Greater Manchester Immigration Aid Unit (GMIAU), told The Independent there would be hundreds, if not thousands, of people in this situation.“Without having that current, valid immigration document, people run into difficulties. People don’t have the documents and they don’t have anything else they can use to prove their right to be here,” he said.“Although in theory an employer or a landlord could contact the Home Office to check their immigration status, they’re not likely to, and even if they do, the Home Office sometimes get it wrong.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailMr Pountney said the lack of clarity around the new system of reusing biometrics was making it “impossible” to advise clients: “Clients keep asking us when something is going to happen, and we just don’t know. We’ve got no clarity on who is likely to be covered by this new system or what the process is, so we have to play it by ear.”Andrew Tingley, partner and head of immigration at Womble Bond Dickinson (UK) LLP, said: “Thousand of applicants are currently in limbo as a result of the Home Office policy of allowing the re-use of biometrics.” He argued that visa applicants should be given the choice on whether to opt into the new system of reusing biometrics.Filipino national Sharon Phillips, 32, moved to the UK in December 2019 to join her husband Hywel on a six-month finance visa. They married in February and applied for her spouse visa in May, but the closure of visa centres meant she couldn’t submit her biometrics at the time.The couple assumed that once the centres opened in June, they would be able to continue with the process, but they are still waiting – and until Sharon obtains her spouse visa, she is unable to work.Sharon, who worked as a domestic worker in Malaysia before she came to the UK, said: “It’s frustrating. I can’t work. I can’t travel. I can’t do anything right now. I was hoping to work in a care home. I know there are vacancies in care homes at the moment. I want to, but what do I do?“Financially I don’t have anything right now. I’m totally reliant on my husband. He’s also supporting my family back home in the Philippines.“I’m just at home. I have nothing to look forward to. I’m hoping none of my family get sick because if that happens, I won’t be able to go back home to see them. We’re just waiting and waiting. I’m just stuck in limbo.”Hywel, 31, who met Sharon while studying in Malaysia, said: “It’s hard to believe that they shut down all visa processing for three months, when it’s such an essential service. And it looks like there was no forward thinking about how to deal with the backlog once it reopened.“We’ve been trying to wait patiently, but there’s so much uncertainty. We’ve now been told we have to go down this path of reusing biometrics, but it’s a new system that hasn’t been tested, and there’s no date for it yet. Will it be one more month? Will it be three more months? We really don’t know how long this will take.”Emre and Elif Gunes said they were feeling “desperate” because, as a result of the delays, they have been unable to travel to Turkey to visit Elif’s father, who has cancer and has been in a critical state since 13 July.The Turkish couple, both of whom work as engineers in the UK, applied for an extension in April as the visas were set to expire on 19 June, but – although the process should normally take a few weeks – they still haven’t been able to submit their biometrics in order to complete the process.They were hopeful when Sopra Steria announced on 1 June that appointments would be allocated by the order of the application submission dates, but they have since been told that they will be going through the new process of reusing previously submitted biometrics, and have been given no time frame as to when it will be up and running.Elif, 29, said: ”I feel guilt and desperation every second of every day knowing that my family needs my support more than ever before, but I cannot promise them I will be there soon. This adds another unbearable dimension to my existing sorrow and fears.“My heart beats fast whenever my phone rings, not only because I am scared to hear any more bad news about my father’s situation but also I do not know what is going to happen to my job and life here if I choose to go home. Do I have to leave my job and life behind just because this visa extension process is not working properly? This is the pressure I am under constantly.”Emre, 31, said that on top of the distress of being unable to see his father-in-law, he was concerned about losing his job and, in the current situation, being unable to find a new one: “It was already too much stress for me. What I am going to do if I lose my job due to the pandemic? Will it be possible to find a new job with sponsorship?”Debasish Dash, a mathematician who has been working in the UK since 2016, has been unable to take up a job as a lecturer at Strathclyde University, which he was supposed to start at the beginning of July, because it has not been possible for him to complete the visa process.The 33-year-old Indian national, who applied for a Global Talent Visa – which the government introduced in February to attract “talented and promising iniduals in specific sectors” – is currently working at Cambridge University in a job that he was supposed to have left a month ago. The university has been able to source additional research funding for him to continue, but this will end in August.“I will be unemployed. Researchers are not paid a lot. Because of the government’s mistake I’ll have to dig into my savings and start paying my rent and my bills from my savings. It just makes no sense,” he said.“It’s nonsense. Everything was in place for me to start the new job in July, but now I don’t know how long I will have to wait because the government is not telling us anything.“Banks and post offices were open. Why were visa centres closed for two months? Even since they’ve opened, why is there a complete lack of urgency? They’re very slow and they’re giving us no time frame. They’re trying to attract talented people, yet they’re putting me through this stress.”Another Indian national, who didn’t want to be named, said he was afraid to go outside in case anyone in authority requested to see his residence permit, which he is currently unable to provide because his visa ran out on 30 May, and he hasn’t been able to process his new one because has been told to wait for the new biometrics service.The 25-year-old, who moved to the UK in January 2017 and works in the IT sector, said: “I find it tough to go out because police may ask for your permit to stay in the UK and I don’t have that. I’ve hardly been out in the last two months.“I’m worried. I don’t have any proof of my status to show I’m eligible to be in this country. I can’t do anything. It’s important to have freedom and to have a visa to show you’re allowed to be in this country. What we’re going through is something no one is noticing.”The young man said he was also distressed by the fact that his sister had recently given birth to her first child in India, and he had been unable to travel to see his family.A Sopra Steria spokesperson said: “We recognise it has been a difficult time for people unable to access appointments because of the global pandemic.”They confirmed that the firm was looking to introduce new measures involving the reuse of fingerprint biometrics that have been recorded in a previous application, and said more information would be provided on this “very soon”.The spokesperson said that since the phased reopening of centres on 1 June, the company had made “significant” progress in reducing the number of customers waiting for an appointment and was working to release new appointments.A Home Office spokesperson said: “The Covid-19 pandemic has had an impact on some visa services as we operate with a reduced capacity to observe social distancing. We’ve adapted our working practices in order to clear applications as soon as possible, which includes reusing the fingerprint biometrics of some of our customers to re-enrol and stop people having to attend in person.”UK Visas and Immigration\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The culture secretary was asked about the boss of Heathrow Airport saying the UK “needs a passenger testing regime and fast” and claiming travellers are being forced to play “quarantine roulette” on Wednesday. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesMr Dowden told BBC Breakfast the “challenge” was ”it is not the case you can simply test somebody and be sure they don’t have” coronavirus. “It can incubate over a period of time,” he said, “so there’s not a silver bullet of just testing immediately at the border.” What are the UK lockdown rules now?How to ease yourself back into socialising once lockdown liftsThe new lost generationWhich countries are seeing a second wave of coronavirus?How to wear a face mask safelyThe UK reimposed the self-isolation requirement for people arriving from Spain on Sunday, making the announcement just five hours before the change in policy came into force.Heathrow’s chief executive, John Holland-Kaye, called on the government to help ease quarantine restrictions on passengers arriving from higher-risk countries with a scheme for coronavirus tests on landing.The airport boss said the testing could be “up and running” in a fortnight after Boris Johnson, the British prime minister, warned further European nations could lose their exempted status amid signs of a “second wave” of Covid-19.Mr Holland-Kaye suggested on Tuesday tests could be done on arrival at a cost of £150, and then a follow-up test done days later. Speaking to BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, Mr Dowden said: “We are not at the point where there is a viable alternative to the 14-day quarantine.”The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.As ballot papers go out today for the Liberal Democrat leadership contest, Sir Ed Davey’s campaign has been boosted by a joint letter from 167 prominent party figures – including former leaders Tim Farron and Sir Menzies Campbell and five of the party’s 11 MPs – endorsing his candidacy.With the delayed election finally getting under way in earnest, a think tank report found that the Lib Dems’ best route back to electoral success lies in “cosying up” to Sir Keir Starmer’s Labour, as the party’s most winnable seats lie in a “yellow halo” in the London suburbs and home counties of the southeast where they are the main rivals to Tories.Mr Davey has made it clear he would position the party to the left of centre and has firmly ruled out a repeat of the 2010 Tory-Lib Dem coalition, while rival Layla Moran has said she would “never say never” to a pact with Sir Keir.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesToday’s letter – seen by The Independent – states that Mr Davey has the “experience, vision and judgement” to rebuild the party following three bruising elections which have seen its numbers at Westminster savagely reduced and former leader Jo Swinson even losing her own seat in December.Signed by MPs Mr Farron, Daisy Cooper, Munira Wilson, Sarah Olney and Christine Jardine as well as ex-deputy leader Malcolm Bruce, former MPs including Paul Burstow and Sarah Wollaston and the author of the post-mortem into the 2019 election debacle, Dorothy Thornhill, the letter states: “Ed has presented a clear, coherent vision for the future of the party that stands for a fairer, greener, more caring country.

Only by moving on from the coalition and rebuilding trust will we win again and deliver the progressive change our country so desperately needs.

But many are expected to respond immediately as voting slips appear on doormats and in email inboxes, making the next few days crucial to the campaign.KIngston and Surbiton MP Mr Davey said he was “proud that so many people – from grassroots activists to a majority of my colleagues in parliament – are putting their faith in me as the candidate with the experience, vision and judgement necessary to rebuild the party and take on Boris Johnson”.He added: ”Our country faces huge challenges, as does our party. The election review showed there are no quick fixes to these challenges and I am determined to rebuild our party on solid foundations so we can elect more Liberal Democrats into town halls, council chambers and parliaments across the country.”The scale of the challenge facing the victor in this summer’s poll was laid bare in the UK in a Changing Europe report, which noted that “there is no such thing as a Lib Dem safe seat – even for the party’s leader”.Its authors, led by Tim Bale, professor of politics at Queen Mary, University of London, said there was a “distinct possibility” of the new leader taking the party into “long-term paralysis” as happened to its forerunner Liberal Party between 1945 and the formation of the SDP in 1983, when Commons representation rarely scraped into double figures.And the new leader will inherit a new core vote of educated graduates in the southeast and university cities, which has virtually displaced the former liberal heartlands of the southwest and the Celtic fringe.Despite losing seats in 2019, the report found Lib Dems are now “within realistic touching distance” of securing 50 seats where they either won or came a close second in December. They either hold or are highly competitive in 30 per cent of the 64 seats with most graduates as voters.And the overwhelming bulk of their main target seats – 23 out of the 29 most winnable – are Tory-held, with just nine where Labour and Lib Dems took first and second places in 2019.“The areas of growth – where Jo Swinson did better than Nick Clegg – provide a ‘yellow halo’ of new electoral strength for the party in parts of London, Surrey, Oxfordshire, Berkshire, Hampshire and Cambridgeshire,” wrote Prof Bale.“In theory, this provides the conditions for a symbiotic relationship with Keir Starmer’s Labour Party. In practice, of course, things might not be quite so easy – not when many Lib Dem activists are also councillors – or would-be councillors – on local authorities where there is no love lost between them and their Labour counterparts. For some of them, the building of some kind of progressive alliance nationally will be far lower down their list of priorities than taking on and beating Labour locally.”The report warned: “Both candidates for the Lib Dem leadership will have to live with the real possibility that political and personal defeat could end up being the price of taking the job. But it is a job that brings with it a genuine opportunity to grow the party once again – if, that is, they make the right strategic calls.”UK in a changing europe\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.MPs have accused the government of being detached from reality after it prioritised premium food retailers like Marks \u0026amp Spencer and Waitrose over discount chains for inclusion in its free school meal voucher programme.The Commons Environment and Food Committee said the system, designed to ensure children from low income families were fed while schools were closed for the pandemic, was set up with commendable speed in response to the pandemic.But they criticised the design of the scheme, which meant the vouchers initially could not be used at supermarkets like Aldi and Lidl or local corner shops, but could be spent at M\u0026ampS and Waitrose — where the vouchers would buy significant less.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesMPs accepted that “some teething problems were inevitable” with the scheme, but said they were “disappointed at the apparent lack of willingness to quickly adapt the scheme in response to the issues that emerged”.“The system has been beset by significant problems, ultimately leading to about a third of children experiencing greater food insecurity in the first month,” they said in a report released on Thursday after taking evidence from food poverty experts.Free school meal vouchers scheme in trouble as key stores excludedJohnson U-turn on school meals after Rashford campaign“A particular problem was the government’s immediate reliance on the larger retailers to participate in the scheme, with discounters and convenience stores excluded for technical reasons, even when they were able to offer workable voucher schemes which would have helped more children. There was a need for closer collaboration on the part of both government and retailers. “The government did not sufficiently consider the realities of where families dependent on free school meals were most likely to shop for food. Although more retailers were added to the scheme, we consider that this took too long.”The MPs are calling on the government to appoint a minister to food security and consult on whether a right to food should be enshrined in legislation.And they said the food insecurity situation exacerbated by the pandemic was likely to get worse before it got better.Stephanie Wood, CEO of the charity School Food Matters, told the committee in evidence that “lots of people are really angry that DfE has defaulted to the big six supermarkets, two of which are really irrelevant when it comes to families on low income: Marks \u0026amp Sparks and Waitrose”.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

After a significant delay Aldi, McColls, Iceland and the Company Shop group eventually joined the scheme.

Food banks and other food redistribution organisations have reacted heroically to a shocking spike in demand for food aid, but this problem is likely to get worse before it gets better. It is therefore essential that the government appoints a new minister for food security who will stop this issue falling between the cracks.  “The government’s actions to lock-down the country and close businesses were necessary, but they had huge impacts on the food sector and on food security. Defra’s response once the crisis hit was commendable, but despite warnings from other countries, it seemed as though the government was constantly playing catch-up in trying to support the food industry during this crisis. The pandemic also highlighted our reliance on key workers, and I unreservedly thank those in the food supply chain whose work kept the nation fed throughout the crisis. “In the future, the government will need to communicate better with the public. The voucher scheme for free school meals failed to recognise where families using them were likely to shop and encouraging everyone to shop online, when supermarkets had warned they would struggle to meet demand, set the scene for public frustration.  We want the government to learn lessons for the future.” Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Former IMF chief Christine Lagarde has praised female leaders around the world for their “stunning” response to the coronavirus pandemic, especially when compared to their male counterparts.Ms Lagarde, who now heads the European Central Bank, said the policies adopted by female heads of state were proactive and their communication style was clear.“I would say that for myself I’ve learned that women tend to do a better job,” she said. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesShe added: “This is my woman’s bias and I indulge in ceding to this bias.”The top 10 worst affected countries are all led by men, both in terms of total number of cases and cases per million people.It is difficult to make a like-for-like comparison without considering factors like health expenditure, tourism and population density. There are also far fewer women in positions of power, with only around 10 per cent of countries having a female leader.A recently released study attempted to factor in these variables, finding that on every metric female-led countries performed better than male-led countries.When comparing countries with similar population sizes, such as Ireland and New Zealand, the researchers found that countries with women in charge experienced far fewer cases.The paper, written by economists Supriya Garikipati and Uma Kambhampati, hypothesised that female-led countries fared better due to qualities shared by female leaders.Previous studies have found that women are more risk averse and favour a style of leadership that is empathetic and science-based.The researchers suggested that these traits meant women leaders are risk averse with regard to lives, but prepared to take significant risks with their economies by locking down early.Prioritising economic outcomes has been one of the reasons for the US not imposing a nationwide lockdown, which has contributed to surging case numbers.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It was used in and around the area of Praia da Luz.“We believe he was living in this van for days, possibly weeks, and may have been using it on  May ,” the investigators added.The second vehicle is a  British Jaguar, model XJR , with a German number plate and registered in Germany.This car is believed to have been in the Praia da Luz and surrounding areas in  and .Christian B was a twisted loner at school who was hated by all the other children, a former classmate revealed.The murder suspect spent his days annoying the other children and getting into a string of fights.He also goaded teachers but then laughed in their face when they reacted, the former pupil revealed.He told The Sun: “I have only ever had one fight in my le – and that was with Christian B.“He spent a year being sneaky and snidey with me, never stopping with the comments.“One day I exploded and told him I wished he would go back to the children’s home from where he had come from.“We all knew he was adopted, so I shouldn’t have said that but I lost my temper with him.“He jumped on me and we traded punches until a teacher pulled me apart.“Everyone hated him in class and they all kept their distance.“But it wasn’t just the children – it was the teachers as well.Police have just  months to nail the prime suspect in the abduction of Madeleine, according to her family’s lawyer.Rogerio Alves says the clock is ticking on the -year mystery due to a -year time limit on prosecutions in Portugal.He told ITV: “We have a  years time barrier, even to manslaughter, to homicide, to certain sexual offences — and even to the most serious kind of kidnapping.“So we are still on time. But time is getting short now.”A former friend said Christian B fantasised about creating a Josef Fritzl-style dungeon at his home.Christian B’s pal said: “He had a cellar and he said he wanted to line it with heavy plates, like the guy in Austria.”The sex offender allegedly revealed his fantasy to a pal while living in the German city of Brunswick after ing to his home country from Portugal.Christian Bs pal – who wanted to remain anonymous – led a TV crew to the house where the twice convicted paedophile was living around .He alleged that the now -year-old German had confided in him that he dreamed of turning the cellar of his rented home into a basement liar.Christian B is said to have wanted to create a dungeon like the one Fritzl built with soundproof walls.There is no evidence to suggest the suspect ever followed through on this idea.Christian Bs pal said: “He had a cellar and he said he wanted to line it with heavy plates, like the guy in Austria.”Madeleine would now be  years old.She was born May , , and went missing a little more than a week before her fourth birthday.Prior to the th anniversary of her disappearance, the McCanns said in an update on their FindMadeleine website: #It is now  years since we were last with Madeleine.#Her th birthday is to follow in the next couple of weeks# the latter tangibly, painfully, bringing it home to us what we have missed and continue to miss as a family.#The investigation to find Madeleine remains open and continues, even though, in a way dferent to the ideal.#We remain grateful for the ongoing efforts and commitment from all those involved in the search to find her and we hope and pray, as always, that our efforts will be fruitful.#Thank you to everyone still offering their support and good wishes for Madeleine and ourselves.#Such solidarity continues to strengthen us.#Investigators were seen pushing a skip onto a fork lt on the land in Seelze, Hanover.Police investigators have been pictured holding drones as they continue the search on Christian Bs allotment in Hanover.Locals near the site of Christian Bs former allotment site where he is said to have lived in a caravan say they saw ers nearby. A e team was reportedly spotted searching the River Leine in the nearby town of Seelze. The river is located at the back of the former property.Wolfgang Kossak, , who owns the plot next to Christian Bs, said many of the plots were sub-let.He recalled the suspect as a stranger who “caused a lot of trouble” visiting the site around .Christian B #had the garden next to mine# and he #arrived in  and left within a year#, he said.#He told me that he living off the grid, that he had not registered with the authorities – no one knew he was there,# Mr Kossak told the MailOnline.“Christian is remembered for selling weed when he lived here. The block where he lived always stunk of cannabis, he was the local dealer.”The plot is four miles from his last known address in Hanover and just two miles from where the -year-old worked in a car workshop.He rented a garage at Euro Hobbywerkstatt in Hannover # a few miles down the road from the allotment currently being excavated by German police. He was ­nicknamed “the ­screwdriver” because he always smelled of oil and petrol.The extensive search at the site near Hanover, Germany, began after another allotment holder at the site tipped off cops after watching a Crimewatch TV show. The show features a range of unsolved crimes which included Madeleines case.Christian B previously boasted to the owner of an allotment he rented in Braunschweig, northern Germany, that he wanted to put perspex glass over a hole in the ground at her site.The search of the site # currently in its third day # is due to continue for another two days, cops confirmed.Dozens of officers are taking part in the hunt for clues that might solve one of the worlds most infamous crimes.British police officers are also taking part in the investigation and have reportedly already quizzed a garage owner who rented a workspace to Christian B.Around  officers are continuing to work on the scene of the plot of land once used by suspect Christian B.An area of trees has been cleared and a mini excavator has been used to dig the land.A total of three skips have been taken away for the material to be examined, Sky News reports.A range of tools from metal detectors to ground-penetrating radar equipment and snfer dogs are all being utilised in the search. #They have dug a big hole here, around  metres long and  to ft deep,# Sky reporter Martin Brunt said from the scene.#They are sting and raking through the piles of soil that have been tipped around the edge of that hole and the excavator is now filling the hole.#German police discovered what may have been a basement or a hidden cellar room in the remains of the foundations of a building in the allotment where kidnapping suspect Christian B allegedly lived in , Bild.de reports.Neighbours say the wooden shed was demolished in late  or  – months after Madeleine disappeared.Investigators have been removing slabs of building materials and large square stones were also excavated from the site.Wolfgang Kossack, , who owns the plot adjacent told MailOnline: #At the time there was a building on the garden. It was a small wooden structure with only one room to keep tools and other things but it had a kitchen. #The building was not really a house, you might call it a shed. But it had a cellar and underneath there would be foundations. This building was destroyed in .#The first photos of what might have been discovered in Christian Bs garden lot has been revealed. Investigators were seen carrying a skip full of debris and other unidentied material from the lot of land outside Hannover this afternoon.Officers digging at a site used by the suspect in the Madeleine McCann case appeared to fight back tears today as new photos emerged from the scene.One officer appeared emotional with a hand covering his mouth at the scene of the excavation The public prosecutors office in Braunschweig confirmed the operation, which began yesterday, and said it will last several days. A source close to German investigators admitted “momentum had been lost” in the probe.German prosecutors had boasted that Christian B was their man and they had #concrete evidence# Madeleine was dead.“In an investigation of this kind the first few weeks after the suspect’s name is released are absolutely vital,” our source told The Sun Online. “Detectives remain convinced Christian B was involved in Madeleine’s disappearance but they still need that crucial part of the jigsaw.#THE prime suspect in the Madeleine McCann case was called from a phone linked to a paedophile on the night she vanished.Christian B spent  minutes on the mystery call.A Brit private investigator found the number was once linked to another German paedo.Former cop Mark Williams-Thomas, who exposed Jimmy Savile, said: “It is hugely signicant that a paedophile operating in Germany on the dark web, discussing and exchanging child abuse material, held the number that called B.“It is a huge coincidence that the user is — like B — German and also uses the dark web to discuss the sexual abuse of children. The question that now needs answering is did the suspect hold that number in  “And,he did, what were two dangerous paedophiles discussing in a call an hour or so before Madeleine disappeared.”The man who owned the allotment next to Christian B said he once told him he was #living off the grid.#Wolfgang Kossack, , said he only realised the link to suspect when cops started digging up the land.#He told me that he was living off the grid, that he had not registered with the authorities – no one knew he was there,# he told the Mail Online.#He never did any gardening. He did not plant anything or try to grow anything. He just sat around drinking beer.#Police are using tools ranging from excavators, shovels and snfer dogs to investigate the plot.It is now the third day of the search in Seelze, near Hannover, believed to be in connection with the  Portugal disappearance of Madeleine McCann.German police officers were seen leaving the digging site with ground radar specialist equipment.Ground-penetrating radar is an instrument used in order to detect electromagnetic contrasts in the soil.It contains antenna to send and detect electromagnetic waves at given frequencies to detect subsurface objects and changes in material properties.When the energy encounters a buried object or a boundary between materials it can be reflected or scattered back to the surface. Police carry a container towards the site where they started digging in an allotment area in Seelze, near Hannover, Germany.Suspect, Christian B, is said to have lived there for a while some years ago.The plot is four miles from Christian Bs last known fixed address in Hanover and just two miles from where the -year-old worked in a car workshop.The suspect is said to have been living at the site in around  or  in a caravan after ing from Portugal, Haz.de reports.An unnamed source told Bild that Christian B had once lived on the site in a caravan for a short while.One neighbour was said to have recognised him from the photo, and recalled seeing his yellow and white VW Camper van, which German police last month appealed for information on.They added Christian B was often seen with the VW at the allotment where he also had two dogs and where he had often rowed with locals.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Teenagers, it turns out, are a bit of an ordeal.Studies show that mums and dads of teens are  per cent more stressed than  years ago.There’s not just the financial pressures from teens, the constant keepie-uppie with phones, computers and fashion, but the added pleasure of social media.Then throw into the mix hormones, curfews, risky behaviours, smoking, drinking and sex and you have a ­wonderful pottage of purgatory.When your children reach their teens they need to question your authority in order to find the impetus to break away and become independent adults. And they don’t do this lightly. No, they make sure they also judge and question your parenting and basically suck the le out of you.For most of us women it also often coincides with the menopause and ­possibly mid-le crises. I mean, could there be a more perfect storm  Unsurprisingly, girls are more antagonistic towards the female parent. And research shows the task of setting limits for their teenagers falls more to mothers than it does to fathers.I have four childrenand they are all very dferent. One no longer lives at home. He’s  and is my Goldenballs, as his teenage years really lulled me into a  sense of security, being largely painless.I also have two girls, aged  and , plus a boy of . So far . . . and I do love you, girls, BUT . . . the boys are proving simpler, less complicated. Unconscious bias, possibly.Lockdown with these hoodlums forced me to question my sanity, made me feel like I was in freefall and wonder what the hell I had been thinking all those times in the past when my ­Fallopian tubes would jump for joy as soon as I saw a man.I’m a liberal parent. I haven’t sought to make my children my “friends” but I ­certainly wasn’t prepared for the ­contempt, defiance, audacity and ­confrontation that has arrived. About everything, from changing the toilet rollto rudeness , politenessand lack of empathy . I’m not allowed to utter the words, “Well, when I was a teenager”, because allegedly I’ve never been one.I can’t offer advice because I “don’t understand”. I’m not allowed to discipline because that’s “damaging”.I’ve been reprimanded for calling one of the Ungratefuls “lazy”. In modern times, this is “injurious and prejudicial”, I was told. Yes, she used those words. I did once try to explain that she’s intelligent and could go far. “Intelligent” is also detrimental to her mental wellbeing, I was informed.Give me strength.At the beginning of lockdown, I would cry out loud and scream from time to time — just to let off steam because I felt utterly trapped.And because I was parenting on my own, I guess there is no need for orce or separation or marriage breakdown now.But I felt utterly blindsided by the scale of the task because teens nowadays are savvy buggers who are well versed in conversations about ious “conditions” everyone seems to be struggling with — mental health, eating disorders, anxiety.Which is great. But not so great when you’re trying to run through a minefield to get to the other side before they ­criticise your parenting abilities and make you feel like a complete sham.Things have improved slightly. It was that or murder. But it has sapped me of all my energy and made me question what I was thinking when I thought that having kids was a great idea.I joke, of course. They can bring me enormous pleasure when they actually do change the toilet roll. Butyou think weaning and sleep-training is tough, wait until you join the Bewildered Mum Of Teens Club.A very close friend of mine always used to say: “Small children, small problems. Big children, big problems.” So enjoy your little eight-pounder while you can.I exaggerate not when I say I’m sometimes scared to open my mouth at home because one of the Ungratefuls has been a ­passionate advocate of social justice since she first strung a sentence together. Often, I am jokingly and harmlessly inappropriate and un-PC, only succeeding in pushing my middle-age boundaries in a woke world of righteous fundamentalists. But it was when my -year-old Ungrateful sat at the table with a look of absolute panic on his face that I realised things have gone too far. All he had asked his ­sister was: “Can you pass the black pepper  Or is that racist ”I WAS disturbed to learn that the puppy Katie Price bought for her -year-old daughter Princess died in an accident at home. There’s more than one lesson there for a young girl, I would have thought.I was equally disturbed to learn there has been an increase in people buying puppies during lockdown – because apparently, what  is there to do  Except puppies require a lot of work and attention, demand constant ­surveillance and are sentient beings with needs that require a long-term emotional and financial commitment.I worry about how many of these pets will be surrendered or neglected once “normal le” resumes.And why people won’t consider ­adopting rescue dogs when shelters and rescue centres are brimming with ownerless animals.A dog is for le. Not just for lockdown.LOVELY newsreader George Alagiah said that when he first came to England from Ghana at the age of  and headed to boarding school, he made damn sure he had a cut-glass English accent in order to avoid racist and classist bullies.As a foreigner who arrived from Sweden at the same age, I had the same ambition – I wanted to sound like the locals and did not want to stand out.I became all the more determined after slipping up when getting “soup” and “soap” confused, mistaking a sofa “suite” for a sofa “suit” and always referring to spiders’ “cod webs”.It burned like hell to be laughed at because you couldn’t speak properly.Now, I’m pleased to say, my grammar and English is often better than my peers’ because I had to learn everything from scratch and I didn’t want to attract attention.Until I decided on a job in TV, that is.HANDSOME Viking eye-candy Dolph Lundgren has just got engaged.

What we saw in  was the virus change and the second wave was dferent from the first wave and it affected a dferent group of people - particularly younger people.The Spanish flu pandemic - the deadliest outbreak of the virus in history - emerged in March  with the hallmarks of a seasonal virus.As it coincided with the First World War, the virus spread through army troops from across the globe.  Cases appeared to drop off over the summer - and there was hope at the beginning of August  that the virus had run its course.But from September to November of that year, the death rate skyrocketed and unlike the first wave, this strain affected young, healthy people too.Experts describe it as W curve - where there are high numbers of deaths among the very young and old, as well as a huge spike in the middle, with otherwise healthy  to -year-olds being struck down.The pandemic ended by the summer of , as those had been infected around the world had either died or developed immunity, according to History.In , scientists revealed that they had solved the mystery of how the Spanish started and why it became so deadly.A study by the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences found that people born after  had not been exposed to the kind of virus which devastated the world in .This explains why the deadly pandemic largely targeted young adults while older patients, who had built up some immunity, would often make a full recovery, reports National Geographic.Prof Kirby stressed that people who are overweight may also be at a higher risk of a second wave of coronavirus.He said: We do have a massive problem with weight in this country and we do need to address it. A message that came from this conference to patients all over the world isyou want to protect yourself against the second wave that is coming down the track then getting fit and losing weight is absolutely crucial.Earlier this week, the Government announced its strategy to tackling the obesity crisis in the UK.The new “Better Health” campaign, run by Public Health England, calls on everyone to “embrace a healthier lestyle”.Supported by the NHS, the scheme will allow GPs to refer more patients to the likes of WeightWatchers.GPs will also prescribe exercise, such as cycling and gym classes, and patients will be given access to weight loss apps.Staff in doctors’ surgeries will also be trained as “healthy weight coaches” to give people advice on how to stay trim.Meanwhile, shops will be banned from offering Buy One Get One Free deals on junk food and placing treats near store entrances and tills.Large restaurants, cafes and takeaways must put calorie labels on menus, so customers can make informed choices.And adverts for food high in fat, sugar or salt will be axed from TV and websites before the pm watershed.Ministers will consult on expanding this to cover all times of day and night.Health charities last night welcomed the “world-leading” plans.But critics said it will push up food prices and see cash-strapped families losing out on supermarket bargains.Evidence of a link between obesity and increased risk from Covid was a “wake-up call” to ministers.Mr Johnson has lost over a stone by exercising and watching his food since his brush with the virus. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

During the religious event, women forgo makeup and perfume and wear loose-fitting clothing and a head covering in order to focus inwardly. Men dress in seamless, white garments to emphasise the equality of all Muslims and prevent wealthier pilgrims from donning more elaborate garments.During the first rites of Hajj, Muslims circle the Kaaba - the square building at the centre of the Grand Mosque - counter-clockwise seven times while reciting supplications to God.They then walk between two hills where Ibrahims we, Hagar, is believed to have run as she searched for water for her dying son.This year, pilgrims will only be able to drink water from this Zamzam well that is packaged in plastic bottles.

People have been asked to work from home where possible, avoid unnecessary travel, and socially distance. The government also banned gatherings of more than  people, banned visits to nursing home, and closed secondary schools and universities. Primary schools have stayed open, in part to ensure more healthcare workers could continue going to work.

There has been speculation that the lighter-touch approach will allow Swedens population to develop herd immunity, but the extent to which recovered coronavirus patients enjoy immunity remains uncertain. Speaking to reporters in Stockholm on Tuesday, Tegnell said: The curves go down, and the curves over the seriously ill begin to be very close to zero. As a whole, it is very positive.He also addressed the question of face masks, which the World Health Organisation continues to recommend people use when social distancing isnt practicable. “With numbers diminishing very quickly in Sweden, we see no point in wearing a face mask in Sweden, not even on public transport,” he said.Swedens death toll, currently ,, has been high in comparison to neighbouring countries of a similar size.

Many of the European countries that have begun to reopen their borders to foreign visitors are still yet to allow entry to people travelling from Sweden. The countrys healthcare system also initially struggled to cope with the impact of the virus, with  people at one point being admitted to intensive care every day, though that figure has now fallen to only a handful of people each week. In cases per capita, Sweden now has a similar rate of infection to the UK, and its government has argued that its strategy will be easier to maintain in the long-term. Speaking to Euronews this week, Jan Albert, a professor of infectious disease control at the Karolinska Institute and the author of a recent study on coronavirus in Sweden, said that the issue of herd immunity remained a big unknown. There are so many unknown factors about how many actually develop antibodies and other types of immune responses after going through the disease, and how many will be required to have had the disease in order to see herd immunity, he said. Speaking to Unherd about his countrys response last week, Tegnell said: “It is better to have a more complete discussion around this in say  months, after next summer. Then I think we can more fairly judge what has been good in some countries and bad in other countries.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Government insiders say the move is set to be announced in an effort to stop a new spike of infections. The Chief Medical Officer is due to make an announcement later today after details leaked to a string of newspapers overnight. The Times and Dailyreport people will need to self-isolate for  days after their symptoms begin. Currently it is  days - even though those peopleaposs close contacts, their households, and people coming back from Spain, must all isolate for  days. The current dference is between people who could be incubating the virus, and havenapost yet got symptoms, have a longer period before they are safe. However, ening the -day period would bring the rules closer in line with quarantine regulations for those ing from countries such as Spain. It comes as increases in new cases spark alarm, with Oldham overtaking Leicester as the second worst coronavirus hotspot in England, behind Blackburn with Darwen.  Asked about the move, Health Secretary Matt Hancock told Sky News: “This is a decision that’s clinically led. The chief medical officer will be setting out details later today. “I can’t steal his thunder but what I will say is we will always do what is necessary to protect people and we’re guided by the clinical judgment, by the science in this.” Mr Hancock warned that a “second wave” of coronavirus is “starting to roll across Europe”. He added: The broader point is that there is a serious concern about a second wave thataposs clearly now moving across Europe and we need to take action - action to protect this country and protect everybody in it. Andthat means increasing the number of days that people who tested positive have to self-isolate then so be it because these measures are necessary to keep people safe.Boris Johnson is reportedly worried about a second spike of the virus, with the official death toll now standing at ,.

He told the All-Party Parliamentary Groupon Coronavirus: I would say in relation to the second spike issue or something coming, the levels of concern among our members - the people who are leading NHS trusts, who are leading in primary care and all levels in the systems - is very high. Thereaposs real concern about winter and the compounding factors there, but also about an earlier spike. He said non-Covid- productivity in NHS trusts was currently at about %.

The Labour leader urged ministers to consider testing people at airports when theyto the UK and then testing them again a few days later.British tourists in Spain faced chaos when the Government abruptly decided to scrap quarantine-free travel with the country at the weekend - forcing people to isolate for  days on ing home. Cabinet Minister Oliver Dowden said there was no viable alternative to the two-week quarantine period for ing tourists, and insisted testing people at airports was not a silver bullet. However Mr Starmer pointed to evidence suggesting the -day isolation period could be reduced with multiple tests. Speaking on a visit to Falmouth, the Labour leader said: Thereaposs some evidence it could be shortened to  or nine days but that depends on really effective testing and that is why we have pushed the Government so hard on testing. Thereaposs the capacity to test, the Government needs to use that to test on arrival and then after a short interval becausethat period of  days can be brought down to eight, nine or  then obviously thereaposs a huge benefit in that. Mr Starmer said Labour supported the need for quarantine measures but he added: Itaposs really unfortunate for those in other countries and I really feel for them but it is necessary that we take all preventative measures to prevent a second spike.  Heathrow boss John Holland-Kaye pleaded with the Government to allow tests to ease restrictions - and said the airport would be ready to go in two weeks. He said: Weaposve started to mobilise on that so we can be ready as fast as possible. The speed really depends on the Government and them putting the legislation in place to allow people to come out of quarantine earlythey have passed two tests, and deciding whether the second test has to be after five days or eight days or some other time.

The new polling carried out by YouGov for Shelter, revealed parents living in privately rented homes are almost twice as likely to be worried about homelessness than parents living in secure social homes. The charity has warned that a chronic lack of social housing is leaving families with few options to escape the insecurity of private renting as the economic lockdown continues to ease, according to a new report. Shelter Chief Exec Polly Neate: “Families are going hungry and taking on risky debt to pay private rent, and yet for too many even these sacrices won’t be enough to avoid homelessness. These parents need a way out of living hand to mouth, but so far, the government has offered them no alternative to private renting.  This must changewe are ever going to build this country back better. Around one in seven respondents said they had cut back on food in recent months to help pay their rent, and one in five had taken on debt, such as an overdraft or payday loan. David Renard, Local Government Association housing spokesman, commented:Councils have serious concerns about the risk of homelessness many private renters face as a result of the coronavirus crisis. We are clear that building , social homes a year must form a central part of the national recovery. To give further protection to private tenants, the Government should also bring forward its pledge to end aposno-fault evictionsapos and commit to maintaining local housing allowance rates at the lowest third of market rents, so that tenants have greater security and households can meet their housing costs.

The Silver Voices campaign group has pledged to force ministers into a rethink by “gumming up” the work of the TV licensing system. It claims that the BBC “has been lazy and cynical in agreeing exemptions only where pension credit is claimed” as only % of those eligible for the benefit currently claim it and those who just miss out on the top-up cash will be left struggling to pay for their licence. From August  the free licences for over-s will only apply to those who receive Pension Credit. The Mirror has called on the Government to keep its manesto promise and agree to fund the free licence fee.  It comes as pensioner led protests against the changes were due in half a dozen towns and cities across the UK. Socially distanced protests are planned in London, Newcastle, Oxford, Norwich, Liverpool, Irvine and Belfast. The disruption plan calls for over-s to stop Direct Debit payments to pay the licence fee, and tell the BBC that in future they will only correspond with TV Licensing by post, and only pay by cheque. It is aimed at making the cost of administering and enforcing the licence fee “much more expensive than keeping the free licence for a relatively small group”. From Saturday an estimated . million over-s who currently receive free licences will have to pay £. a year to watch their favourite shows. The Conservatives pledged at the  election to protect free licences for the rest of that Parliament, which was due to run until .No has blamed the corporation for introducing the charge - and called on them to reverse course. The BBC has said that keeping licences free for all over-s would cost £million by -. Dennis Reed, Director of Silver Voices said: “The BBC has had years to budget so that it could continue to provide free licences for the over s but now it is pleading poverty. “The only real poverty from this decision is for millions of older people who will struggle to pay the licence fee of £-, which is approximately equivalent to one week’s state pension. “Scrapping the free licence during a pandemic which has hammered the physical and mental health of the over s is beyond belief. “From Saturday our direct action against TV Licensing will reflect the fury of older people about this decision”. Jan Shortt, General Secretary of the NPC said: “The free TV licence for all over ’s is a universal entitlement to supplement our poor state pension.

Preventing a new wave of the virus is essentialwe want to save lives, protect the economy and avoid a winter crisis in the NHS. This requires everyone to follow the guidance on social distancing and face coverings. But there is also a responsibility on the Government to protect the public. The key to successfully easing the lockdown without risking a second wave is to have a ing test and trace system. We know from South Korea, Germany and Singapore that effective testing is crucialwe want to contain levels of infections. That way we can get people back to work, children back to school and society back to near normal as soon as possible. Despite Boris Johnson’s claim to have a world-beating system, NHS Test and Trace is still not fully operational. Test results take too long and the number of people reached has fallen since launch. The mobile app promised by Matt Hancock seems to have disappeared completely. Lives and livelihoods depend on fixing these failures. The Prime Minister should ditch his groundless boasting and focus on delivering a test and trace system that actually works. Wild at heart  Britain’s rich and ied wildle is a blessing to our country. But it is threatened by modern farming, pollution and over-development. A quarter of the UK’s mammals could disappearwe continue to destroy their habitats.

And it has been fantastic to see how many people, young and not-so young, have been doing the same. We’ve all been finding new ways to come together and do our best to make sure nobody is left isolated or alone. Just to give one example, Scouts have been teaming up with the British Red Cross in “Care for Care Homes”, carrying out more than , acts of kindness. Initiatives such as this have been vital because they go to show that it is community that makes us – and every single person matters. The question we must face now is how we bottle that amazing spirit of togetherness so it can be something that keeps us going into the future, with all the uncertainties confronting us. I’m asking everyone, including all those involved in Scouts, to have their say in this important new survey launched today. We’ll be there playing our part, but what a great idea it is to ask as many people as possible what they think are the best ways we can all continue to support each other.

Oldham, Greater Manchester, has overtaken Leicester as the area with the second highest infection rate in England.The town had . cases for every , people in the seven days to July .Leicester’s has dropped to . and the Government is today expected to review its guidance on the lockdown imposed in late June. Blackburn with Darwen, Lancs, now has the highest infection rate in England, at . cases per ,. Restrictions have been imposed in Rochdale and Stockport, both in Gtr Manchester, and Wrexham, North Wales, due to new spikes.Wrexham currently has % of all Welsh infections the Army has been brought in to run Covid- testing centres. Prof Jose Vazquez-Boland, chair of infectious diseases at Edinburgh University, said: “We are facing a comeback of community transmission after removing the lockdown measures.The efficacy of lockdowns is only temporary. There will be a resurgence of new cases every time social restriction measures are lted as long as the virus remains in circulation.” Cambridge University’s MRC Biostatistics Unit estimates there are around , new infections a day in the UK. It put the R reproductive rate at near  in most regions. One expert saidinfection rates are not lowered we could face a second wave. Prof James Naismith. director of the Rosalind Franklin Institute in Oxford. said: “I fearwe fail to check this flare-up, we will head into winter with a high level of ­circulating virus. “With normal winter illnesses such as flu, we could see ato exponential growth in cases that overwhelms the NHS and requires complete lockdown. We have only a short time to get our systems ready to prevent this.” New NHS Test and Trace data will be released today but so far the system has only been reaching around a third of symptomatic cases. Confirmed cases are still low but increases were recorded each day last week for the first time since April.  Local authorities complain they are not getting detailed enough testing data in time to take action. Experts warn that a series of new spikes is likely till a vaccine is rolled out or regular, widespread testing is in place. Officials in Oldham have pleaded with people to follow new restrictions. Justin Brierley, , runs a shoe shop in the town’s market. He said: “Business is poor as it is, so it’s very worrying that cases are rising again. We’ve done everything we can to abide by the social distancing measures. I’m not confident I can rebuild my business for a second time.” Experts are calling for better sick pay and laws preventing staff being penalised for taking time off. Delayed test results also mean many contacts of those who test positive are not being told to self-isolate fast enough. Prof Naismith added: “The Government intervention that will make the most dference in keeping the lid on this flare-up is the isolation of positive cases. Not enough effort has been put into measures [like] financial support.” One in  Brits, or .% of the population, has been infected with Covid-, a study shows. UK Biobank tested more than , people for antibodies, which indicate past infection. Blackburn Darwen  In Blackburn and Darwen residents have been told to limit the number of people from the same household visiting another household to just two. The council also wants masks to be worn in enclosed public spaces, including shops, workplaces, libraries, museums, health centres, hair and beauty salons. And it said handshakes should be replaced with bumping elbows. Oldham  In Oldham , residents have been told to keep visitors away from their homes. And they are also being urged to maintain a strict two metre social distance when they leave the house. Care homes are not allowing visitors and those people who are “shielding” will also be asked to continue to do so for another two weeks from Friday. Leicester In Leicester in late June non-essential shops were asked to close, just two weeks after they had re-opened. Bars and restaurants did not open on July  as planned and the government advised against all but essential travel. Restrictions have been eased in some areas and the government is expected to announce a review of its advice on Thursday. Rochdale  Rochdale council told residents to wear masks a week before the government’s own guidance. It also advised people to use them in all public places, not just shops. The council said no more than two people should be allowed to visit private homes and it advised against any physical contact with people outside the household. Stockport  Stockport council has issued a reminder of the ‘key steps’ to stop the spread of the virus. These include keeping two metres apart from people outside the home and having a test as soon as people suffer symptoms, no matter how mild.

This follows fresh outbreaks in Spain and other countries, with signs suggesting the arrival of a second wave in continental Europe. Meanwhile Brits ing from Spain were suddenly and without warning told to quarantine for  days, in an announcement at the weekend.And Professor Kirby says we could be right to be worried, as he held a conference for doctors and top experts to discuss what has been learnt about Covid- since it took hold in Europe. And he warned that younger people could be more at risk as the virus changes in the second wave. While Covid- affected mainly older people, ethnic minorities and those with underlying health conditions, younger people could be more at risk, in an echo of a previous pandemic.The  Spanish Flu pandemic claimed the lives of  million people across the world.It broke out in March  and mainly affected the elderly and infirm during the First World War. By August , it was hoped the pandemic was coming to an end, but the death spiked again in September to November. But the virus had developed into a new strain, and this hit young, healthy people. Speaking on BBC Radio aposs Today programme, Prof Kirby said: The winter is coming and almost certainly a second wave of this virus is coming.  What we saw in  was the virus change and the second wave was dferent from the first wave and it affected a dferent group of people - particularly younger people. Pandemic experts fear Covid- could go through a similar aposW curveapos as the Spanish Flu - the deadliest pandemic in history. The Spanish Flu first saw a aposU curveapos - two major spikes in deaths among the very old and very young. But this became a aposW curveapos - as death rates spiked among healthy  to -year-olds.Doctors in America are also said to fear death trends will be similar to those documented in the Spanish Flu, NY reports.Dr. Raul Vasquez, CEO of the Greater Buffalo United Accountable Healthcare Network, told the news site that the Spanish Flu came in three waves, with the aposU curveapos representing the first two waves. But in the final wave, the curve on the graph became a W shape as a third demographic of those aged  to -years-old saw disproportionate deaths, and not just the old or very young. In the Spanish Flu pandemic, it was all over by the summer of . The brutal reality then was that everyone who had caught the virus had either been killed, or had developed immunity to it. Retired Surgeon Prof Kirby also said obesity was a massive problem and overweight people are at higher risk of the second wave. He said: We do have a massive problem with weight in this country and we do need to address it. A message that came from this conference to patients all over the world isyou want to protect yourself against the second wave that is coming down the track then getting fit and losing weight is absolutely crucial.

The -year-old motorcyclist was killed in a road crash in August last year, and has since been the subject of an international row. His mother Charlotte Charles and father Tim Dunn said they had decided to scatter his ashes in Weymouth, Dorset, where the Dunns took their annual family holidays. The teen was last in his favourite town in July  and Mrs Charles described today as the hardest day weaposve ever had to face in our lives. Mrs Charles and Mr Dunn, alongside their partners Bruce and Tracey and other extended family members, travelled down to say goodbye to Harry.Mrs Charles said that although it will feel like they are setting him free, the fighting will continue to get US suspect Anne Sacoolas back to the UK. Askedher sonaposs funeral provided any closure, Mrs Charles said: No, and we were really numb back then - very much a bunch of zombies, to put it mildly. We donapost remember a lot about the first few weeks at all. Obviously weaposve been through so much since then - weaposve been to hell and back on many, many occasions. Weaposre not numb any more, we just hurt all day every day. The hurt is there constantly and it never, ever goes away. But now,  months on, today is going to be the hardest day weaposve ever had to face in our lives, and I canapost imagine it getting any harder. You shouldnapost have to scatter your own childaposs ashes. Mr Dunn said he hoped the family could have peace after scattering the ashes. Asked why they picked Weymouth, he said: From a very early age, Tracey and I first came with Harry and Niall to Weymouth on our first family holiday back in , and every year we would come back on the same week. It became a tradition, and as we know poor Harry died last year and today is exactly the last day he was here - he came for a night with his friends... so itaposs a year to the day since he was last in Weymouth and weaposre here to scatter his ashes and let him ride free.Mrs Charles added: We can rest assured that heaposs definitely out there riding the skies and going everywhere that he wants to go. Weaposve found a beautul spot where we are going to take him and weaposre sure that the wind will carry his ashes and the waves will be splashing up on the rocks to help him travel too. So weaposll feel like weaposve set him free. Commenting on what is next for the family, Mrs Charles said: Proper closure. Which is to make sure that Anne Sacoolas goes through the UK justice system. That has to happen. You and I would have had to have done it - in my view she is no dferent. So we will keep fighting - today is going to be extremely tough, but the determination never wavers, ever. It doesnapost matter what today takes out of us, tomorrow will be yet another day of fighting. Today is just for us but the fighting will continue.

Michael Seed, , known as Basil the Ghost, was living on an average of less than £, a year before the  heist, a court has heard. The frugal alarm specialist was arrested in , two years after the rest of the gang were jailed, and got  years for his part in the , £.million burglary. Prosecutor Philip Evans QC told the confiscation hearing that the court has to decideSeed had a criminal lestyle, what the benefit was and whether he gained from it. Mr Evans told Woolwich Crown Court: There is simply no supporting evidence of the defendantaposs assertion that he was running a jewellery business. Richard Sutton QC, defending, said his client had been living on around the same amount as the state pension. He said: “It does not suggest that this is a man living on the proceeds of crime. This is small beer indeed.” Seed was one of two raiders who climbed into the vault to loot  safe deposit boxes after the ageing criminals had bored through the thick concrete using a diamond-tipped drill. He is the son of a DNA pioneer who inherited his fatheraposs brilliant mind, but used his talents to further a career in crime. Seed evaded capture for three years before police raided his flat in Islington, north London - around two miles from Hatton Garden - in March . He denied any involvement in the heist, but was found guilty of conspiring to burgle, handle stolen goods and convert or transfer criminal property.  Judge Christopher Kinch QC, during the March  sentencing, told Seed: Your role was a central one. You were at the heart of the core activities that had to be carried out. You were not just there to fetch and carry. In my judgment this must rank among the worst offences of its type. Seedaposs fellow Hatton Garden ringleaders Brian Reader, , John Kenny Collins, , Daniel Jones, , and Terry Perkins, who died in prison last year aged , were all jailed in .

Police Scotland and Scottish SPCA have launched an investigation into the incident filmed by a fellow driver near Lochgelly in Fe, Scotland. The short clip shows the lurcher-type dog running just inches from the car’s spinning wheels before getting a fright and attempting to run away.The sickening act has sparked fury amongst animal lovers including local dog walking company GeoPaw, reports the Daily Record. A spokesperson said: “I almost cannot believe what I’m seeing. “This may look funny to some folk but going by comments from those who have seen the video the dog was absolutely terried. “It’s also extremely dangerous and just the height of stupidity. It’s unbelievable that any human can treat animals like this in this day and age. It’s just sickening.”  A spokesperson for the Scottish SPCA said the matter had not been reported to it, but that Police Scotland would act as the lead agency for any investigation. Officers have confirmed that an investigation is underway after the incident was reported to them.They added that an officer was sent to the scene - known locally as the stock car road - but the offending driver and vehicle could not be traced. Some dog owners suggested police should be treating the incident with greater urgency since the vehicle’s number plate was clearly visible. Dog owner Jenner Sterritt said: “I’ve seen time and time again, people complaining about all types of animal abuse, but they are letting the animals down big time.” The incident comes amid concerns about the treatment of greyhounds or other dogs used for racing across parts of Europe.

The immortal bird has stunned diners at the KFC in Blackpool, Lancashire, where it has been feasting on scraps of chips and chicken since the end of May. It seems unfazed by the cm arrow pierced through the middle of it. Despite it attracting the attention of worried customers who want to take it to the vet, the plucky gull, which is still able to fly, has so far evaded capture. Residents of the seaside resort are now living in fear the thug who shot the poor gull may strike again and calling on visitors to be vigilant. Blackpool-based property developer, Mark Leech, , first captured the bird on camera at the end of May during a trip to KFC with his family. The dad-of-two said: “I was very alarmed when I first saw the seagull. “The injury looked le-threatening to such a small animal. “I tried to lure it over with a chip to catch it and take it to the vets, but it wouldn’t take the bait.  “If there was a big cage with some food in there, I think it could be caught. “What’s disturbing is there’s someone out there willing to shoot innocent animals. “It makes you think – who will be next ” The seagull is thought to have been shot straight on with the cm arrow, the feather end of which is sticking out near the bird’s head.

They claim that Meghan was upset by the call, saying that she said very little while on the phone, instead choosing instead to simply listen to the counsel. They write: But after hanging up, she felt frustrated and emotional. While she knew the aide had good intentions, the surreal experience of having someone from her boyfriendaposs office tell her what kind of jewelry to wear or not to smile at a photographer was too much.  They said she felt distraught, and damnedshe did, and damnedshe didnapost. Meghan reportedly discussed the incident with a friend, saying: I canapost win. They make out like Iaposm to blame for these pictures, that it looks like Iaposm encouraging them, that me even acknowledging the cameras may not be sending the right message. I donapost know what to say. It was only yesterday that people online were saying I look miserable in pictures, because I was trying to just ignore the [photographer]. The necklace is the latest in a number of claims to emerge from the book, which will be released next month. It discusses a reported fallout between Harry and William, saying the Duke of Sussex was angered by what he perceived as his brotheraposs snobbish attitude to his bride. Harry was offended by Williamaposs unwanted advice to take as much time as you need to get to know this girl, it is alleged. It also claims that things were tough between Kate and Meghan, saying the strain was evident at the King Power Royal Charity Polo Day last year. “While the doting mothers were photographed next to each other with their children, the two appeared to barely exchange a word,” write the authors. Tensions peaked at their final joint engagement, the Commonwealth service at Westminster, in March. It’s claimed: “although Meghan tried to make eye contact with Kate, the duchess barely acknowledged her”. The book also features details of the coupleaposs first date and the night news of their relationship was leaked. They write: One night late in October in Toronto, Harry was happy, and so was Meghan. Until their received a call from one of Harryaposs aides at Kensington Palace. It wasnapost good news. A tabloid was going to run with the story of their relationship. Their main worry was that her place would be besieged by photographers within  hours.

Ebony Gooding, , her sister Tamara, , and cousin Rosie Trumpet, , have told how they were ganged up on by the youngsters while a five-year-old boy screamed racist abuse. The trio of childrenaposs entertainers had been booked to play at a garden party for a four-year-old.Ebony told the Sun that the children immediately began punching and kicking them.The women were dressed as the characters Marshall, Chase and Sky from the popular Channel  cartoon show, but Rosieaposs Chase costume was knocked off her by the childrenaposs blows. Ebony says five children took hold of her and pulled down on the head of her Sky costume. She was unable to see and was easily pushed around by the mob before one of the children took hold a microphone and racial slurs were repeatedly shouted, they claim.Ebony said: “We kept doing crying gestures to get them to calm down. No one was controlling them and they were just being allowed to attack us.” The women fled but parents closed the gates to stop them getting to their car, telling them they were not going to be getting out of the site. Demands were made by the parents of the boy whose birthday they had been booked to perform at. They wanted the £ deposit back - the trio intending to charge £ in total, money they have yet to receive - and the women were warned by another adult present that the dad was a complete lunatic so they should do as he asked.  The friends called the  emergency number and a massive police presence descended on the site near Leighton Buzzard, Bedfordshire. Ebony said there were at least eight police officers, three riot vans and three police cars. The petried woman added: It was surreal and felt so over the top for a four-year-old’s birthday party but I can understand why they did not want to take any chances.

The victim, -year-old Victor King, was a professional bridge player and described as one of the good guys — one that would never hurt a soul. The former IT worker for Travelers insurance had recently taken Thompson in as a tenant for his spare bedroom. An arrest warrant states Thompson had threatened his landlord with the huge sword in a row about him not paying the rent. Mr King had reported this to the police a day before he was decapitated, on Sunday. He claimed Thompson waved the blade at him. The victimaposs friends alerted police when they could not get hold of him on Sunday, before officers along with firefighters forced their way into Mr Kingaposs home and found a gruesome scene. When Thompson was pulled over in his car in the city after a manhunt, he refused to speak. The arrest warrant states he scribbled on a piece of paper the words - paper in glove compart in Jeep is all you need. This is when police found the paperwork. Thompson, who has previous convictions for robbery and assault, has remained silent. Thompson, who has previous convictions for assault and robbery, was arraigned Tuesday in Superior Court,  and was held on  million bail. Mr Kingaposs cousin told reporters his relative had worked in IT for the insurance firm for more than two decades.

For updates on coronavirus, follow our live blog HERE He added that members of the Trump administrationaposs coronavirus task force had pointed out to governors the importance of getting ahead of the curve. What we are seeing now is what actually took place a couple of weeks ago. If we don’t start initiating rather strict adherence to the five principles I just mentioned, what inevitably is going to happen is that the states that are not yet in trouble will likely get into trouble.  If you’re not getting your arms around and suppressing that surge that’s coming up, that’s just a little bit below the radar screen, before you know it, two to three weeks down the pike, you’re in trouble, he added. It comes after data showed one person in the US died about every minute from Covid- on Wednesday as the national death toll surpassed , - the highest in the world. This total is three times that of the UKaposs coronavirus death toll. The US recorded , new deaths yesterday, the biggest one-day increase since , on May , according to data. The countryaposs coronavirus deaths are rising at their fastest rate in two months and have increased by , in the past  days."},{"url":null,"title":"man brutally smacks child public","story":"NewsMan brutally smacks child in public before swearing at girl in disturbing footageThe alarming footage which has been condemned on social media shows the man repeatedly smacking the child in public, before swearing at a young girl next to himShareCommentsByJamie Hawkins:,  JUL Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news us-news video man-filmed-brutally-spanking-child-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,articleTypeName:brightcoveVideo,url:https:www.mirror sport football news video swansea-v-brentford-match-pics-,articleUrl:https:www.mirror sport football news breaking-brentford-book-championship-play-,thumbnailUrl:,duration:,videoId:,isVideoRelation:,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,IASVisRestrictToGeo:UK-IE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,RRET-.cutOffDate:--T::,tcfVersionOne:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,swipeNavigation:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,irisClientToken:,disableAHS:true,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,mpulse.enabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,appNexusVideoPrebidEnabled:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,evergreenArticle:,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,IASVisRestrictToGeo:UK-IE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,RRET-.cutOffDate:--T::,tcfVersionOne:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,swipeNavigation:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,irisClientToken:,disableAHS:true,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,mpulse.enabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,appNexusVideoPrebidEnabled:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news world-news man-brutally-smacks-child-public-\"\" %, rgba, rgba, url\"News, views and top stories .

Disturbing footage shows the man stood up while repeatedly hitting the young boy on the bottom as heaposs sat on a chair. The man then sits the boy upright, before confronting the girl who is also sat on a chair next to him. He tells her to Sit your a** down while pointing right in her face. It is not known how the man knows the two children. The video, which has been shared thousands of times on social media left  parents shocked at the harshness of the punishment. One person tweeted: This is gross and anyone condoning it is disgusting as well. If you have to hit your kids to make them listen, you’re the problem. Another condemned the behaviour. They tweeted: Yes, it’s wrong. Hitting solves nothing. It makes you fear the hell out of someone. That kind of fear isn’t parenting. Just because your parents did this to you, doesn’t make it right. There are better ways to communicate than putting hands on someone, especially a child.  That is far too much, another wrote. Kids are learning and growing still. Theyaposre not full adults who understand everything. This kind of hitting is abuse. Wrong, another commented. If you have to resort to hitting a child then you’ve lost control. It’s no longer a teachable moment. I’m okay with spanking but this was VERY hard and too many times.  But disturbingly many didnapost see an issue with the punishment. One person tweeted: Right. His job is not to be their friend. Its to prepare them for the real world so they can navigate it without his protection. Pain teaches you what NOT to do, another said, while the video has even caught the attention of sport stars.  Former athlete Jay Albert tweeted: That’s what my parents did to me and I made two Olympic teams and finals. Professional boxer Jamel Herring added: Got my a** whooped as a kid... plus those whoopings in public not only embarrass you, it gets your act together.

For years, Japanaposs north coast had been the site of the disturbing phenomenon, with rickety fishing vessels arriving more than ,km from where they set out. In  the numbers were unprecedented with more than  damaged boats landing, containing a total of  bodies, compared to  vessels the year before. Some have speculated the weather that year was to blame and that North Koreaaposs aging fishing population had something to do with the problem. But a study by non-profit Global Fishing Watch and published today in journal Science Advances has been able to shed some light on the matter. Researchers used satellite technologies to analyse marine traffic in northeast Asia in  and , and discovered hundreds of dark fishing fleets - believed to be Chinese - have been operating in North Korean waters - apparently illegally. This meant ushering out North Korean boats and forcing them on ill-advised ventures into Russian and Japanese waters, poorly equipped for long distance travel.For foreigners, fishing in waters off the North Korean coast or trading fish caught there internationally is against the law - but it doesnapost appear to have deterred the huge swathes of rogue ships, according to the report. The paperaposs authors estimate in  and  alone these ships caught more than , metric tons of Pacic flying squid, a particularly valuable seafood - worth £ million. Jaeyoon Park, a senior data scientist at Global Fishing Watch and co-lead author of the study, said: It is the largest known case of illegal fishing perpetrated by vessels originating from one country operating in another nationaposs waters. Another author, Jungsam Lee, said the North Korean vesselsapos decision to try their luck in distant foreign waters would have proved catastrophic for many of the fisherman.  It is too dangerous for them to work in the same waters as the Chinese trawlers, he explained. Thataposs why theyaposre pushed to work in Russian and Japanese waters and that explains why some of North Koreaaposs damaged vessels showed up on the beaches of Japan. Northeast Asiaaposs waters are some of the most contested seas in the world, but fish stocks are in dramatic decline. The Pacic flying squid stocks have dropped  per cent in South Korean waters and  per cent Japanese waters since , according to Global Fishing Watch.

We expect that there will be strong legacy from our partnership approach with our private, voluntary and independentproviders that will continue to change the way we perceive ELC.”Zoe Williamson, manager of VIP Childcare in Elgin, said of the funding: “This funding has come at a welcome time for our nursery and others like us. While we already incorporated outdoor learning as standard this will enable us to invest in outdoor play equipment and expand our outdoor provision to allow more time outside.”Leann Cairns, a childminder in Lossiemouth, said: “We know the benefits to children of being outdoors, both in their health and learning, so this funding will enable me to develop more activities to enhance the time spent outside.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_config   n t t tCancellation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Evening Express website including all Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening Express n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb and ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t tMonthly n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayUnlimited access to all articles on the Evening Express website.

Once again, the separatists# numbers simply don#t add up.Councillor Alastair Redman # Kintyre and Islands wardSir,Exactly two years ago I was diagnosed with stage three, oestrogen positive breast cancer.I’d just come back from a week#s holiday in Spain with Isabel and Margaret. Days before I went on holiday I’d had a biopsy following referral from my GP. Although there wasn’t a cloud in the sky, my holiday was definitely clouded by impending results#I had chosen to wait until after my holiday to get them.The journey that Monday to go to Gartnavel is one I’ll never forget. My partner Frank didn’t shut up the whole way there, obviously he was nervous. I couldn’t be bothered with the small talk and just wanted him to shut up. Obviously I was nervous and he was just trying to keep my mind off it, but I was too busy silently praying. The number  is something I see all the time so I spent the whole journey looking for the number on someone’s licence plate #I saw it everything would be ok. I didn#t see it. That might sound a bit daft, but fear does crazy things to you.Walking into the consultant#s room and finding a nurse waiting there confirmed my worst fears. #It’s a wee cancer,# said Mr Wilson. The words echoing in my head, I couldn’t hear anything after that. I remember taking a deep breath and looking at Frank. I will never, ever forget the look on his face.My only question that day was #am I going to lose my breasts # The answer was no, and thankfully Frank was there to take in what was being said my head was spinning. The question I really wanted to ask was #am I going to die # I was too scared to ask that question.I didn’t cry until I walked out the hospital, then I bawled. Frank was amazing, and he didn’t talk like a budgie on the way home.The journey home was horrendous. I was terried about telling my mum. How do you tell your mum that her only child has cancer  I hadn’t told her anything about finding a lump. I couldn’t cope with worrying about her worrying about me # butit happens again I#d do it dferently and she’ll be the first to know. By the time I got home I had no more tears left.The relief telling mum was a huge weight off my shoulders. What ensued after my initial diagnosis was two weeks of crying every day. Telling the girls at work was so emotional, and in fact I was exhausted with it all.Once surgery and treatment plans were in place I was in a better place. Time to get the head down and get on with it, and that#s what I did. I was full of positivity and determination, and I think my sense of humour helped enormously.The treatment was bad, but it was necessary. The ongoing treatment is bad but it#s necessary. I’m alive and that’s what matters. My le has changed forever, nothing will be the same. My le has been ided into Before Cancer and After Cancer  I now have a new #normal#.I don’t know what the future holds, who does, but I intend to live my le happily, positively and most definitely to the fullest!I will never forget the support, both physically and emotionally that I received from my nearest and dearest, and of course from the whole community. The strength you have given me continues, and for that I am truly grateful.Please, pleaseyou find an abnormality or you just feel something isn’t quite right, act upon it and seek attention.I know it’s a dficult time with this horrid virus but it’s important to remember that early detection saves lives.Stay safe and take care.Yvie Young, Lochgilphead"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures june 26 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAvril Lockhart from Cairnbaan sent us this week#s photograph.Taken at Bellanoch, the photo shows the bike that Avril, as a key worker, has been lent by Alec Ohnstad of the Ardrishaig Bothy.

However, there are still numerous restrictions in place, including no operation of locks and bridges, limited services and limited staff available on the ground. This remains the position.#We are, however, pleased to let you know that Scottish Canals is planning to re-open canals to navigation in line with the announcement that Scotland’s tourism sector is preparing to reopen during phase three of the Scottish Government route map on July .

The noise is constant and intrusive for  –  hours in a day, the decibel level in excess of  dB where sounds above  dB are harmful to hearing.This is a serious issue for residents who cannot open their doors and windows, cannot use their gardens, pets are terried, it is often impossible to have a conversation, or a phone call. The noise from hundreds of bikes is explosive and destructive.The speeds are terrying, they travel in intimidating packs, the noise is threatening and the bikers have no respect for the communities they are speeding through. They pass multiple residential entrances with limited sight lines with no care for risk. The offensive noise seems to come from two actions modying motorbike exhausts and extreme acceleration in legal bikes.If a car made a similar noise, spewed out the same polluting omissions, or did the same ridiculous speeds they would be pulled over by the police, but bikers appear above the law.As technology reduces the noise pollution of cars, planes and other forms of transport, it seems motorbikes are exempt. Bikers claim #loud pipes save lives# but is safety really the motivation for deliberately creating excessive noise Noise counts as a statutory nuisance it either unreasaonably and substantially interferes with the user or enjoyment of a home or other premises or is likely to injure health.The problem on A is known to all the statutory agencies, but nothing is done.If this is a national problem, what action needs to be taken Concerned Loch Fyne-side resident Sir,I am not qualied to judge economic competence, but considering the party he represents, I think that Councillor Redman might find it advisable to be wary of the phrase #colossal mismanagement# .For my part, I would consider a degree of incompetence to be preferable to the great damage caused over the last decade to  per cent of the UK’s people, as well as to its institutions and its reputation by the cruel, self-serving, xenophobic, elitist, dishonestregime currently in Westminster.Name supplied, LochgilpheadSir,Our charity#s support for blind and partially sighted people affected by the coronavirus lockdown has received a £, boost from the Scottish Government#s Wellbeing Fund.With this extra funding we will be able to support an additional  people and respond to the increased demand for more in-depth, one-to-one emotional support.The practical and psychological effects of losing your sight can have a signicant impact on people’s well-being, and this current situation has exacerbated the anxiety and isolation felt by many.Access to essential services such as food and medicines is more dficult as is social distancing, vital information on staying safe isn#t always in accessible formats, and many of our older members aren#t always confident about using new technology to stay in touch with others.Everyone accessing RNIB#s confidential counselling service will receive eight weekly sessions with an accredited counsellor, delivered via telephone and online, with each session normally lasting an hour.The funding will enable us to reduce the waiting list for emergency mental health sessions and also let existing clients access additional sessions.The RNIB helpline is available on   .James Adams, RNIB Scotland directorSir,Every pub across Scotland should be allowed to stock and sell beer from local independent brewers, to help them recover post-lockdown.CAMRA, the Campaign for Real Ale has launched the #Cheers for Choice# campaign.The campaign wants these arrangements to be relaxed, and MSPs are also being urged to support the Tied Pubs Bill being put forward in the Scottish Parliament by Labour MSP Neil Bibby. The legislation would give tied pub tenants protections in law, including a right to be able to sell guest beers in their pubs.Allowing small and independent brewers to sell into all pubs will also improve consumer choice and allow pub-goers to support local brewing businesses.It also makes business sense, with  per cent of pub-goers saying they would be less likely to go back to a pubit doesn’t have a range of brews from small and independent producers.Sarah Crawford, CAMRA Director for Scotland, Kirkcaldy"},{"url":null,"title":"could a two way conversation transform scotlands health","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSome of us have learned in lockdown the importance of other people, and have been longing for these first personal contacts.There have been surprises in discovering just what is important in le, and the comfort of knowing you are not alone in your likes, as your favourite brand of chocolate is again sold out.We have also been made aware that the way we behave makes a dference to the future. It has taken a national emergency to get the government to acknowledge that it needs our compliance and, for that, must give us the information we need.Suddenly the choices we make are seen as vitally important, and we have a part to play in achieving success for ourselves and our community. Can this be a foundation for a future partnership that could transform the health of Scotland and the pressure on our services As a physiotherapist I became aware that there was little that one could do to impose solutions there had to be a relationship that involved two way listening, mutual trust and support to do what was necessary. In this pandemic Nicola Sturgeon has said that we have behaved in a way that saved lives and protected the NHS.When this is over we could be at the beginning of another le-altering journey.It will demand a huge sht in expectations. There is an amazing bias in society towards the idea of decrepitude and dependency in old age, when in fact encouraging dependency increases a slide into that very state. During past months many of these attitudes have been exposed and caused outrage but they are long standing and deep seated.If you have been trying to escape into fiction you might have no better idea of what is possible. Alison Flood interviewed crime writers about their work, and this is what she found.Ian Rankin is now writing about a John Rebus who has health issues, James Lee Burke has his detective Robicheaux meditating on mortality in his early s and Mark Billingham has slowed his Tom Thorne down a bit because he is in his s. Michael Connelly does not believe that it is credible to have his Harry Bosch with a badge and gun and still working for the LAPD, this in a country where the President is  and one of the presidential hopefuls .Worst of all, Sara Paretsky created a feisty, strong woman for her books, only to succumb to popular misconceptions and stop her age at  because she didn#t #want Vi to be helpless#.These fictional creations battle the evils they see in their society.

Perhaps for the first time in their lives they have heard the bark of deer or spotted something in nature that is totally new to them. And many will have seen footage of the animals and creatures that tentatively stepped into urban settings whilst humankind remained under lockdown.But that is changing as we ease back into a new normality.Economics and peoples’ livelihoods are, of course, firmly entwined with modern day living, human survival and wellbeing it is extremely important that we find a route to recovery and many are suffering deeply. But what we do not want to do is fall back into the same old traps that were so detrimental to the wildle, nature and ecosystems of our planet. Finding a way forward and a new balance is not just crucial for other species but for that of our own children and future generations too.Many will have been shocked at the sudden increase in fly tipping during lockdown plus the thoughtless parking and abandonment of picnic rubbish, disposable barbecues and indiscriminate toileting as lockdown eased. All have grave consequences for wildle and nature.The result is the burning, choking, strangling, trapping or poisoning of animals, birds, plants and aquatic le.Taking care of our surroundings and appreciating nature is a real joy. Teaching children the beauty of the outdoors and how to care for it can bring a lelong love for natureyou love something you usually wish to protect it.And learning never stops for any of us. Sometimes it is the basics that are needed before we move on to the complexities of natural navigation or learning our stars.So for this month here is one tip : learn how to go to the toilet in the outdoors!Doing this responsibly and teaching your children makes for a lelong enjoyment of walking and exploring without the bane of wondering where the next toilet is.

It is now one of the most beautul drives in the place, and as a drive it would be destroyed.#The line from Glasgow to Oban took  years to build and finally opened in , proving extremely popular with holidaymakers for many years. The proposed branch line from Dalmally to Inveraray was never built, despite plans to #hide# the railway from the duke’s view. A plan from  shows a proposed tunnel to carry the line through the duke’s policies near to the castle. This proposal, like many others, was defeated in the House of Lords.Instead, provision was made at Dalmally for a waiting room, the #Duke’s Room#, at Dalmally Station where visitors arriving by train could await the arrival of a carriage in comfort.This is just one of innumerable fascinating stories stored within the Argyll Papers, the family and estate archive of the Campbell family, dukes of Argyll.The Friends of the Argyll Papers was established to support the development of the archive and to promote its use and enjoyment by a wide audience.It has been described as one of the most important private archives in Britain, offering a rich resource for Scottish and British history from the th to the st centuries.

Without action and proper investment from central government vital public services will be at risk.This news of huge strain on local authority budgets comes as the SNP is delaying in opening up Scotland’s hospitality and tourism industry. Instead of following other parts of the UK and opening the sector on July , the separatists are forcing businesses to wait until July .This delay will cost businesses millions at a time when thousands of jobs are already on the line.The SNP is risking people#s livelihoods. It needs to accept responsibility for that and take action now.Councillor Alastair Redman,Sir,People occasionally ignore the elephant in the room to support their point of view, but in his latest letter, Councillor Alastair Redman has ignored an entire herd in his living room.In his latest rant he states that the SNP is failing councils as the cost of coronavirus could hit more than £ million, but surely these costs would be the same no matter who was in power He also suggests that #essential local services have been underfunded for years# yet fails to mention the years of needless austerity cuts, actioned by his party and their collaborators, to bail out the greedy and risky practices of the banks, which reduced funding to a devastatingly low level in general. It is worth noting that the Scottish Government has put a greater percentage of their curtailed income into NHS Scotland than any part part of the UK. This has helped NHS Scotland to outperform all of the others, in the UK, for the past five years. This is paying idends now.He s to his familiar attempt to insult by referring to citizens who want to take responsibility for making and managing decisions and working to make their country prosper within the priorities set by its citizens as #separatists#. I’m glad to be described as a separatist because the alternative is to be an apologist for an unrepresentative government in Westminster and to abdicate decision making to that same out-of-touch group.It is Councillor Redman’s final point, however, that demonstrates his blinkered sycophancy. His suggestion that the Scottish Government should follow the example of other parts of the UK. Could he really be saying that we should follow the chaotic shambles and incompetence that has emanated from his chums at Westminster  Does he seriously think that any sensible person, irrespective of their own political affiliation and from any of the devolved nations, would swap what their government#s have done for the Westminster model Sadly, nowhere in his missive does Councillor Redman take time to mention the health and safety of our citizens.It is this, together with scientic advice and without political point scoring, that is driving the Scottish Government#s response to this tragic pandemic.Kevin MacKaveney, TarbertSir,Following reports of littering around Argyll and Bute, including the Isle of Islay, the issue was discussed at a recent meeting of Islay Community Council where community councillors heard that items like rubber gloves have been found dumped in ditches.It is always very disappointing to hear about littering and fly-tipping but doubly so in an area like Islay where residents take such an understandable pride in their environment.We also need to bear in mind that items like disposable gloves can pose a threat to livestock. As well as being profoundly antisocial, this kind of behaviour can be positively harmful.Those acting irresponsibly should remember that there can be serious consequences to their thoughtlessness.Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands MSPSir,We all have a role to play in the recovery of the country’s tourism industry after its reopening on July .Scots could help by taking a trip, visiting an attraction or experience, shopping locally, dining out and booking a staycation.Scottish tourism is facing its biggest challenge in a generation and will need financial support for some time to come to help it recover. The Scottish public has a crucial part to play in helping this happen.It#s easy to not think of yourself as a tourist in your own country but many of the experiences that we often enjoy with loved ones, such as holidays, shopping or eating out, all contribute to our visitor economy.July  marked a new era for the industry as we start to welcome back visitors and take our first steps on the road to a safe and responsible recovery. However, reopening won’t be the same for all businesses, many are still adapting to this #new normal#, so it#s important that we recognise that as we move forward to try and restore our industry.We look forward to helping Scots rediscover their own country in a way that is safe for everyone # visitors, residents and those working within the industry. Recovery will require our collective efforts and we must act as one to ensure the best possible outcomes for the whole of the visitor economy.Malcolm Roughead, VisitScotland chief executive"},{"url":null,"title":"the time for change is is now july 17 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsThis isn’t really a campaign, it’s just the things that we should all be thinking aboutwe want Argyll # and the world – to be a recognisable place for our children and grandchildren to live in.The economic crisis could be seen as an opportunity to get started on the work that we know needs to happen.I think that many people in Argyll could continue to work from home people who have lost their jobs could be retrained, or use their existing skills, to do the work that is necessary for Argyll to become carbon-neutral. Walking and cycling infrastructure needs to be improved, trees can be planted, and renewable energy can be expanded and made more efficient.Transport and food are the most obvious areas for behavioural change in Argyll. We need to be promoting the benefits of electric cars and making them preferable to petrol or diesel cars.We can easily bring food production and consumption closer together by shopping and eating more locally and more naturally. Farming in Argyll is generally quite low impact, but does not have the capacity to feed everyone in the area, meaning that we have to buy in meat which is less sustainably farmed to make up the dference. If everyone ate only the meat that is produced locally, we could dramatically reduce the emissions caused from the transport of imported meat, as well as supporting our local market and ensuring that it remains natural and sustainable. Reducing food waste is also an easy behavioural change.Acting on climate change is all about thinking of others. Across the globe, the people who see the most adverse effects of climate change so far are those who are already marginalised and vulnerable.Kindness and common decency indicate that we must act with the needs of these people in mind, with the knowledge thatwe do not act, ‘these people’ will soon become us and our children.One thing that I think would make a huge dference would bewe all took #our whole selves# to work with us.Whatworld leaders were constantly thinking: #what would my children say about my role in this decision # This kind of moral thinking would make a huge dference in the future of industry and politics, and the more we educate the next generation, the more influence they will have on their parents.Everyone can make changes such as cutting down on their meat and dairy consumption, shopping locally, re-using plastic containers, recycling, composting, reducing food waste, buying fewer new things, using a renewable energy supplier, and cutting down or cutting out air travel.At the Paris Agreement in ,  nations decided to take measures to limit the global temperature increase to . degrees above pre-industrial levels. Our current behaviour will not allow for this.A rise of  degrees celsius above pre-industrial levels will mean that large areas of land around the equator will be uninhabitable, resulting in huge numbers of refugees fleeing for their survival. Sea level rise caused by the rapid melting of the ice caps will mean that small island states such as Kiribati and Tuvalu will be submerged. The combination of the loss of arable land and ocean acidication due to temperature increase will mean global food shortages, such that we have never seen before.The rich will still be able to buy food, but those who are already marginalised and vulnerable will find it increasingly dficult to access basic amenities like food and clean water, further stretching the inequality gap.It’s not too late to make changes, but it soon will be.We all need to have climate change in the forefront of our minds when making any kind of decision, be it personal or business. It is an omnipresent issue and every decision, however big or small, will have an effect."},{"url":null,"title":"science matters are aircraft vapour trails harmful","story":"Dorothy H CrawfordUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAlthough much reduced by the Coronavirus pandemic, everyone has seen the vapour trails produced by high-flying aircraft as they streak across the sky. But what are they  and are they harmful Officially called contrails , these ephemeral, cloud-like structures are primarily made of ice crystals. They form at altitudes over , metres from water vapour in the aircraft’s engine exhaust as it freezes almost instantaneously at temperatures below minus  degrees celsius. There are, however, plenty of other volatiles and solid components in engine exhaust, including soot particles that often act as a nucleus around which the ice crystals form.Official figures show that air traffic contributes around five per cent of greenhouse gases. Yet these estimates only account for CO emissions. They do not include the effect of contrails, which can persist for hours and even expand into cirrus clouds several miles wide. These clouds, which are most abundant over North America and Europe, trap heat within Earth’s atmosphere, so do they improve our climate or contribute to global warming Air traffic has been steadily increasing year-on-year, so, assuming the coronavirus effect is a temporary one, estimates suggest that the distance flown by passengers will double every  years, and that air traffic will quadruple by . Therefore, it is imperative to determine how the increase in clouds created by contrails might affect us.In a recent study*, scientists used a climate model to analyse the future impact of contrails on climate change, taking into account their predicted increase balanced against any likely changes in engine soot emissions.The results show a three-fold increase in contrail cirrus coverage by , despite a  per cent reduction in soot emissions due to improved fuel and engine efficiency. These predictions cover all major air traffic routes and are mostly due to increased air traffic volume, although a sht to flying at higher altitudes also contributes. The area with the greatest increase will be Eastern Asia, where the largest rise in air traffic is expected.This previously unaccounted for, non-CO, climate impact of air traffic is now reckoned to have a more damaging effect on climate change than all the CO emitted from aircraft engines.*Atmos.

Instead, they were directed at some national policies and how they impacted on rural development.Argyll and Bute Council had been #more than helpful# to local businesses in the recovery from lockdown, the company added.Mr MacLeod also suggested Scottish Water should be encouraged to allow small developments to be served by inidual septic tanks or bio-discs.In addition, the provision of water and electricity to remote rural locations should be subsidised by the Scottish Government, he added, which would help make projects more affordable.Furthermore, the cost of #impact studies# should not fall on the developer, he said.Another issue was the requirement of registered social landlords that housing is built to extremely high specications, he said.Mr MacLeod said: #That high standard does, of course, ensure the houses are well insulated and easily maintained. The standard, however, drives costs up dramatically and can make small, rural developments unaffordable.Careful planning of the specication could reduce building costs but still produce warm, highly insulated and comfortable homes.#While there is Scottish Government funding for affordable housing and funding through the Highlands and Islands Enterprise Agency for workshop units, there is no funding for #combined# units which incorporate a home and a workspace.This would allow young entrepreneurs to acquire a starter home or a home worker to relocate.Argyll and Bute Council has one of the highest approval rates for new planning applications in Scotland.It said: #Masterplans are rarely implemented in Argyll and Bute but they are used occasionally to enable the partial development of larger areas of land.#Infrastructure costs make up a signicant proportion of the cost of new build housing particularly in smaller scale developments.#"},{"url":null,"title":"a welcome awaits at kilmartin church","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsServices are scheduled to re-start at Glassary, Kilmartin and Ford Parish Church early next month.Trustees hope to open the modern and welcoming church building at Barr Mhor, Kilmartin, for worship from Sunday August , starting at am.Social distancing will allow for up to  people to attend and everyone is expected to wear a face covering.

around us as it changes.\"Lloyd, who previously worked as a Sunday Timesjournalist, was inspired to begin a career as a childrens author after seeing the joy his children experienced when they learnt new things during their years in home-schooling.Particularly that of one of his daughters who was astonished to learn all about Antarctica ndash home of her then favourite animal, the penguin.\"I believe fundamentally, especially now having done thousands of talks in schools and festivals over the last  years, that humans generally reach peak curiosity at the age of nine or ,\" Lloyd said.\"Then things start to get in the way, like puberty and your friendship groups change and going from primary to secondary school.\"But at the age of nine or  youve got that purity of curiosity where youre old enough to know that you have an identity and youre curious enough to want to know where you fit in.\"Theres nothing you cant talk to a nine or -year-old about ndash provided you dont patronise them, provided you dont have an expectation of them that they cant meet.\"If you can meet them as fellow kindred spirits on this rock travelling around the sun, in this incredible galaxy,

The male has a pale pink body with a black head, wings, and tail. Additionally, during the breeding season the male develops a wispy crest and the black colour becomes glossier with a purplish green or blue sheen.The female is less vibrant than the male. Both sexes appear much duller outside of their breeding season.Furthermore, the rosy starling does not mimic other species, unlike its well-known cousin.What the two species have in common is murmuration ndash an astonishing and mesmerising aerial spectacle large flocks of these birds gather and perform a real show as they swoop, e and swirl across the sky in beautul shape-shting clouds. It is a phenomenon that pleases the eye of every observer.The rosy starlingrsquos breeding area stretches from the Balkans and Turkey to Central Asia and north-west China.

Stuart invited me to his garden.The next morning, my fianceacute Chris and I rushed to Port Seton. As we were walking towards Stuartrsquos house, we saw another birder looking around hoping to spot the rosy starling. As soon as we arrived at Stuartrsquos house, I saw this magnicent pink bird flying past the house and landing on the bird feeder to start its feast.Stuart and his we Gillian welcomed us in their garden, where I spent half an hour photographing the gorgeous rosy starling and chatting to Stuart and Gillian. I also took some time to admire their beautul dogs Hugo and Hobbes. These dogs were just wonderful, not every day you see dogs as well behaved as these two!My first and, I hope, not last experience with the rosy starling was unforgettable!

Nobody knew what to expect.ldquoGala day itself was amazing, from the glorious weather to the great response we got from the locals as we travelled around in convoy tooting and waving, visiting many streets of the town which the normal gala parade doesnrsquot visit. The people of Prestonpans certainly came out to show their support and for that we are truly grateful.ldquoWe would like to take this opportunity to thank the future Queen Lily [Bennion] and her royal court, as well as their families for their patience and understanding. Thanks to Connor from Sneddon Media for travelling with us and capturing the fantastic photos, which are on our Facebook page lsquoPrestonpans Gala Dayrsquo.ldquoFinally, thanks to the dedicated committee members who once again gave up their time to make the event possible.ldquoWe hope to be back doing some fundraisers in the not too distant future to help us fund and prepare as we look forward to Gala Day  on Saturday, June .After Lockdown Gala Day, Graeme took to social media to share his thoughts on the event.He said: ldquoPrestonpans, you didnrsquot disappoint us.ldquoThe fantastic efforts made from everyone to put up your bunting and decorate your streets, please repeat this next year. It was great to see so many of you as we travelled around as many streets as we could while visiting the members of the royal court.ldquoTo the royal court children, we didnrsquot want to forget that it would have been your day, we can still have your special day next year.ldquoTo Queen Lily, you were absolutely stunning, even reducing some of the committee to tears your mum and dad will be proud of you, the way you conducted yourself on what should have been your special day. To you, the community of Prestonpans for coming out and showing your appreciation as we passed by quietlyin our cars, doing the alternative gala parade. Hopefully you enjoyed it.He also thanked his fellow gala committee members for giving up their time and ensuring gala day traditions

initiative to provide additional space for physical distancing to protect public health, work has started on a temporary cycle route between Prestonpans and Cockenzie and Port Seton which will run parallel to the main B Edinburgh Road.The three-metre wide path will be created by laying hard surfacing down on the grass verge on the north side of the carriageway between the two communities.The path will run alongside the footpath between the boatyard access at Prestonpans to just past the old power station with a white line separating the cyclepath and walkway.This is the councilrsquos latest project to improvesocial distancing in the wake of the Covid- crisis.The local authority received pound.million from the Scottish Governmentrsquos Spaces for People fund to introduce ious countywide measures to make it easier to social distance in town centres and improve cycle and pedestrian paths.As well as the roadside cycle route, the speed limit on Edinburgh Road, which is normally mph, will be reduced to mph and speed limits in the twocommunities reduced to just mph.The plan for the cycle path has seen dozens of painted stones created by local schoolchildren, which line the footpath, move across to the other side of the road.The stones are a symbol of hope and unity during the Covid- crisis, and many similar displays have been created throughout East Lothian and the whole country.Councillor Norman Hampshire, environment spokesperson at East Lothian Council, said: ldquoWe received many comments in the public consultation around Spaces for People on the need to provide suitable space for people cycling.ldquoMany people are currently cycling this route and we need to cater for the current increase in cyclists during the pandemic period.ldquoIn common with other Spaces for People measures, this route is for temporary use as we gradually move out of restrictions and will also provide a viable alternative to the use of the private car and or public transport for shorter-distanced essential or leisure trips in the area.The works also include the introduction of temporary crossings of Edinburgh Road at either end of the route through the use of lsquobuildoutsrsquo and bolt-down bollards.In addition, the proposals also include traffic calming measures on Edinburgh Road to slow down traffic with a temporary reduction in the speed limit to mph between the two communities, in tandem with the introduction of mph limits within the communities themselves.MrHampshire added: ldquoWe were aware of a collection of painted stones that have been carefully laid by local schoolchildren alongside the existing footway along Edinburgh Road and recognise that these are important to the local community.ldquoThe community council arranged for these to be carefully collected prior to the start of the works and they have been relocated on the other side of the road."},{"url":null,"title":"column-job-figures-worrying","story":"Furloughing has

It is a fantastic museum and project that tells the story of the arearsquos extensive industrial history, including of the Tranent-Cockenzie Waggonway, built in  and associated with the coal and salt industries.Nearby sits Cockenzie House, a mansion and gardens dating from the th century. It is now home to a brilliant wee cafe and numerous craft businesses well worth a visit.In between Longniddry and Port Seton sits Seton Colligate Church, considered ldquoone of the finest medieval collegiate churches in Scotland.

There was cloud cover, no wind and a sticky humidity.

Among the long list of suggestions that Ive given a whirl are eating Marmite sandwiches, spraying a fine mist of Listerine and taking garlic tablets .Smoke can act as a deterrent, which has seen me huddling next to barbecues and bonfires like they are two-bar electric fires on cold winter mornings.Ive donned midge nets that give me the forlorn air of a beekeeper who has lost her hive, or a grieving Victorian widow.

Credit: Jevelin Getty ImagesAnything that rubs against your face for hours on end is bound to cause some irritationmdashand face masks are no dferent. lsquoWhen it comes to cloth or surgical masks, we are primarily seeing mild skin irritation, mild comedones , and reactions to the fabric itselfrsquo, Allie McAllister, BSN, FNP-C, DCNP, explains. lsquoWhile just wearing a mask can cause friction which can be irritating to the skin, the types of materials, dyes, and detergents in the mask can also cause irritation and rashesrsquo.Besides rashes and chafing, face masks can also lead to breakouts. It makes sense when you think about itmdashyour mask is creating a moist, warm environment against your skin, which is perfect for bacteria to thrive. lsquoBreakouts can occur from sweat, dirt, and moisture being trapped under the maskrsquo, McAllister says.How to protect your skin from your face maskAlways start with a clean face. Credit: Getty ImagesFor starters, McAllister says you should always thoroughly wash your face before you put on your mask and after you take it off Cerave Hydrating Facial Cleanser in particular because its gentle and non-irritating. Then, McAllister recommends, lsquoIf you know yoursquoll be wearing your mask for a long period of time I would suggest applying a thin layer of Aquaphor Healing Ointment to the areas that will come in direct contact with the mask.rsquoYou can also try an anti-chafing balm, like Body Glide which is is a favourite of Reviewed staffers who run. Apply it on areas where your mask typically rubs against your skin, like the nose, cheeks, chin, or ears.Keep in mind, too you should wash your face mask regularly in the laundrymdashand McAllister agrees. She suggests using a detergent specically for sensitive skin thats free of any dyes or perfumes.Bonus: If you have the luxury of picking and choosing your mask , McAllister says the type of fabric can make a big dference in your masks comfort. She recommends a soft cotton fabric thats more breathable than other alternatives.McAllister says once again to start with Aquaphoryou notice any irritation or discomfort. However, she advises that you speak to a dermatologistthe irritation is more severe or does not resolve with Aquaphor.And as for breakouts, our lestyle writer and beauty guru Jessica Kasparian has a few products she swears by. lsquoIf a blemish pops up, I love the Mario Badescu Drying Lotion, which uses isopropyl alcohol to dry up pimples and calamine lotion to soothersquo, she says, adding, lsquoI also love hydrocolloid patches like the CosRX Acne Pimple Master Patch set. Theyre clear dots that extract impurities while also creating a protective layer over the pimple so nothing  can irritate itrsquo. Jessica also says that she makes sure to focus on her chin and lower face when washing her face since thats the area covered by a mask.The product experts at Reviewed have all your shopping needs covered.

This experiment is reaching its most dficult phase yet, the bit where the Government has to somehow let people start doing normal things ndash like going back to work and spending money to keep the economy going ndash while simultaneously reminding us that we wersquore not out of the woods yet.

The second is closely related: the state cannot tell us exactly how to manage this risk in every single circumstance. We may get health advice and government guidance, but ultimately we have to navigate this new, more precarious world on our own.How we do this, and, crucially, how we feel about doing it, depends on many dferent things, of course, not least our age and underlying health, our financial situation and, to a signicant extent, our personality.I know there are some who believe that through lting lockdown restrictions politicians in Westminster and Holyrood are very deliberately handing over responsibility ndash and thus blame ndash to the public for what comes next. And there may be some truth to this.

How could it be otherwise given the extraordinary events of the last six months  And whatrsquos the alternative to us being public health guinea pigs  Staying at home forever Community levels of the virus in Scotland are now low and falling. Our hospitals lie empty. We have a test and trace system in place to ndash hopefully ndash crack down on infections. Meanwhile, wellbeing continues to suffer under the restrictions and hundreds of thousands of jobs hang in the balance. All of these things mean we can and should lt the lockdown. And lting restrictions means the vast majority of folkmust decide for themselves what level of risk they are comfortable contending with, taking into consideration how it might affect their family and community as well as their own personal circumstances.We can help ourselves along the way. Firstly by staying up to date ndash through trusted, legitimate scientic and public information sources ndash about how the virus is transmitted and the best ways to stay safe.We can also resist the temptation to judge others for their decisions. Frankly, Irsquom sick of the army of armchair virologists spouting their culture war vitriol on social media. On one side you have those who seem to relish the lockdown, the class swots who shout too loudly about how they follow every part of the guidanceand seem to revel in the idea of a second wave. On the other side, you have the virus deniers. Both groups peddle fear and misinformation, whether that is their intention or not.At the end of the day none of us, not even the scientists, know whether and when there will be another wave of the virus.

Those that belong to the pea and bean familyfor example, in summer, can store nitrogen in their roots,that can be ploughed back into the earth.Which crops make good green manures At this time of year they include mustard, fodder radish, fenugreek, buckwheat and phacelia, which can be slotted in in six to eight week gaps when the ground is cleared between crops. Some sown in early autumn, including winter beans, grazing rye and winter tares, will last through the winter and can be dug into the soil when it warms up in spring.How long do they take to grow Some, such as mustard, are fast-germinating. Two weeks after sowing youll find the ground covered with small seedlings, and after six weeks, these can be chopped and folded into the soil to add nutrients.Fenugreek is another nitrogen-fixer for summer, really fast growing and its bushy plants are great for suppressing weeds. It can be planted in late spring or summer and grown for up to three months.When do I cut them down Chop the fast-growing ones when you need the ground back. Just dig them up, chopping up the leaves and stems as you go to speed up decomposition. Leave them a few days to wilt and then dig them into the soil.Longer term crops such as alfalfa, red clover and trefoil can be left in the ground for a year and clipped from time to time to stop them from going woody. They are ideal for soil thats been overused and needs to rest.What benefits do they provide Clover, fenugreek, winter beans and alfalfa are good nitrogen-fixers, storing nitrogen in their roots, while clover and phacelia flowers are a magnet for beneficial insects, which can help pollinate crops, so leave some to flower. Italian ryegrass and buckwheat have root systems that will help break up heavy ground.When can I plant crops in the space again A few weeks after youve dug in your green manure, you can sow late crops such as onion and garlic.WhatI want to wait If you have no crops to fill the space, cover the green manure-treated bed with cardboard or landscape fabric to keep the nutrients from the green manure in, which will give you a great seedbed to sow seeds in come spring.What  can I grow to help my crops Try growing comfrey, which absorbs nutrients and minerals and can be made into a liquid feed. Just cut it down to the ground, fill a bucket with the leaves and stems of the plant, packing them in tightly and then filling the bucket with water.Set it aside for three weeks , then strain off the liquid into a container with a tight lid. When you want to feed your plants, dilute the liquid with water at a ratio of around : and feed your plants weekly into autumn."},{"url":null,"title":"food-chef-tom-kerridge-shares-passion-bbqs","story":"Barbecues at the ready because chef Tom Kerridge, holder of two Michelin stars, has a trove of summertime cooking treats to share.During the course of his new show, Tom Kerridge Barbecues - on the Food Network, the chef will be showing off some old and new recipes using charcoal, smoke and fire.He talks about his favourite dish from the series and why everyone - including professional chefs - are prone to barbecue disasters from time to time.How did this series come about \"I filmed with Food Network last year, a big series for the States, they gave me a call and said listen do you want to do something with barbecues... it was actually a really good, fun thing to do.

It is the number of wealth in Hinduism, the number of gates of heaven in Islam, and is a lucky number in China and Japan, also because of its mythological connection to prosperity.And today I am going to make my case for the power of eight for Scottish unionism, a bedraggled concept which appears in slow decline. There should be no inevitability about this, however, and indeed I would suggest that they may find their own form of prosperity should they follow these eight simple rules. - Understand where you are and why yoursquore thereIn considering the narrative of last weekrsquos visit by Boris Johnson, which was presumably pre-briefed by Downing Street, one would be forgiven for thinking that nobody in the Prime Ministerrsquos operation has seen any of the news which has emanated from Scotland over the last  years. To suddenly be plunged into apparent lsquopanic modersquo is to misunderstand unionismrsquos position. Unionismrsquos deficit has been coming for years. Indeed, far from being a resounding victory, it looks increasingly as though the  referendum simply came early enough on the x-axis for unionism to survive. But unionism is not in the doldrums because of any irresistible pull-factor inherent in Scottish nationalism rather, there is a signicant push-factor involved. Unionism is stuck in an unappealing, perpetual panic, reacting to everything, offering nothing positive. SNP wins an election unionists create the Calman Commission. Yes almost wins the referendum unionists create the Vow and the Smith Commission. It is a humiliating lack of thought, understanding and planning all rolled into one. - Be less emotionalI appreciate I am in the minority as someone who does not feel particularly nationalistic or patriotic, either towards Britain or Scotland, however unionistsrsquo emotional, sometimes rather hysterical, obsession with lsquoour precious unionrsquo is preventing sensible decision making. Too many unionists exude the air of people who are confused and embittered that the general population doesnrsquot share their unrequited love. A more clinical approach, which is much more characteristic of nationalist leaders, would create the space for far more sensible decision making.: Nicola Sturgeon facing questions over her knowledge of Alex Salmond probe - Stop visiting Scotland to lsquosave the unionrsquoThis is a foolish endeavour for a number of reasons, but most obviously it underlines the fact that members of the Cabinet seldom come to Scotland, a part of the UK which they have just as much right to visit as anywhere , including England. Cabinet visits would be far less controversial, more normal indeed,they happened more often. - Stop talking Scotland downUnionists think this is a nationalist trope, but they are wrong: the tone of unionist communications is counterproductive and corrosive. Coronavirus has turbocharged the temptation to revert to this approach, and the notion that an independent Scotland could not have afforded furlough and a range of other measures is now a centrepiece of unionist messaging. It is, of course, nonsense, and while an independent Scotland would inevitably face uncertainty in its initial years, there is no reason to expect that it would not rapidly develop the ideological maturity to create a wealthy country.:Michael Gove not distracted by independence support surge as devolution key to union case - Stop doing the nationalistsrsquo work for themA great deal of unionist action plays directly into the hands of nationalism. Because of the raw emotion , Unionists tend to define victory as denying the SNP something that it wants, without understanding that this plays perfectly into the nationalist narrative. The prime example of this, which is coming at unionists like a herd of buffalo, is the current policy of saying no to a second independence referendum, evenit is secured with a majority of seats, perhaps even votes, on a clear manesto commitment. Unionists may see this as a clever tactic which puts Nicola Sturgeon in a hole, but in the medium- to long-term it is an appalling strategy which pushes soft unionists, dismayed at the denial of democracy, to the other side. - Get Brexit doneBy default, we consider Brexit to push Scotland towards independence, but in fact a swt Brexit with a reasonable deal has a good chance of becoming a positive for unionism. I voted Remain, but despite this I expect the outcome of Brexit to be signicantly less damaging than doomsayers predict, and this, coated in the toxic prospect of a customs border between Scotland and England should an independent Scotland rejoin the EUrsquos Customs Union, may well flip the Brexit issue from the nationalist column to the unionist one. - Do moreFor a group of people who are so ostensibly passionate about keeping Scotland in the union, the UK Government is prone to leaving the field of play empty for the Scottish Government to roam free. Scottish Secretary Alister Jack and his team appear to understand the pitfalls of this better than their predecessors, but much of the damage has been done. Unionists should be bolder about planting their flag on Scottish turf, including in devolved competencies, especially when theyrsquove paid for the flagpole ndash a practice which is considered normal in federal countries. - Finally, itrsquos time for a New UnionUnionists are always chasing the curve reacting, panicking, misstepping. They need to make a calm, clinical analysis of where the people of the nations of the UK want to be in  years, and create a positive, proactive vision of a New Unionism which takes us all there. It is, in my view, highly likely to involve both more muscular unionismas well as an enhancement of devolved powers. They can call this federalism, or any other of the myriad terms people use for it ndash it is what it is. But whatever they call it, unionists should understand that New Unionism has a real chance of appealing to many of the soft centrists whom they have pushed towards nationalism.

And many unionists doubtless hope that putting it off for several years will, somehow, lead to a sea-change in opinion.But, in the end, a politics of constant campaigning has some real downsides, whichever side yoursquore on. For a start, it means a mostly very inward-looking and a very process-driven debate. Is the Union a great thing or on its last legs  Does the Scottish Government have a democratic mandate to hold another vote  How badly is devolution maling  Would any Plan B work  And so on.True, the SNP policy of independence in the EU means some attention is paid to European issues ndash mainly to the key independence questions of whether, under what conditions and how quickly an independent Scotland could join the EU. But how many times does the same ground need to be gone over . Circular debate on the same issues is the inevitable outcome of a permanent but unresolved constitutional ide.Meanwhile, bigger issues of the European green deal, the massive new Covid recovery fund and future EU budget deal, the EUrsquos failures on the refugees and migration front, its populist and rule of law challenges, are all rather far from most Scottish political and policy debate. Beyond the EU, the current state of global power politics was parlous and deeply troubling even before the Covid- crisis. Whether as part of the UK, or as an independent Scotland in the EU, these global challenges need serious debate.And,Scotland does choose independence, then the process of becoming a well-established, mature independent state will take time. Itrsquos not only a question of the transitions from the UK and into the EU but a question of active, long-term state-building.And , contrary to current polls, Scotland chose to stay in the UK, then political time could be used to push for a more positive transformation of the Union rather than the catalogue of destructive errors currently emanating out of London. Resolving the constitutional debate quickly would free up time for such vital issues.But, of course, democratic politics doesnrsquot work that way. Democracy takes time. The UK and Scottish governments will continue their stand-off over another referendum SNP infighting over tactics will doubtless continue and opposition parties will carry on inveighing against independence. And, while the constitutional issue is at the core of Scottish politics, then it will be a politics dominated by a rather inward-looking debate.:BBC Executive Complaints Unit issue ruling over Sarah Smith report on Nicola SturgeonBut the world is in a deeply unstable state and it would behove both sides of the independence ide to spend more time engaging with those wider challenges.Scotlandrsquos politics, given the constitutional ide, is inevitably stuck in a repetitive campaigning state.

Therersquos a general acceptance that, rather than sharing culpability with previous generations, we are the ones at whose door it can be laid. Obviously there is a lot of truth in that, as we continue to consume oceans of gas and oil, and despoil the seas with plastic. Yet the culprits for harming nature and tipping it out of kilter can be found in centuries past as well as in the international departure lounges of our airports. We should not shoulder all the blame.Irsquom thinking, as one example in my own backyard, of James V. For all his qualities as a leader he was never as impressive as his father James IV, or even his daughter Mary Queen of Scots. Quite apart from his military deficiencies at the Battle of Solway Moss, James V is the man who introduced , sheep into the Ettrick Valley, to raise money for his ambitious plans. In so doing, he destroyed the ancient Ettrick Forest, in which he and other royals had hunted and killed stags by the barrowload. The kingrsquos flocks arrived a some point after , and it did not take them long to strip the valley of its trees. By our own times, all that was left of this magnicent haven for wildle was a handful of thorn trees and birches. The rest is empty scrubland.I learned about this vandalous act in a newly published collection of essays called A Journey in Landscape Restoration: Carrran Wildwood and Beyond, edited by the biologists Philip and Myrtle Ashmole. Unlike most of the books I read this is not about the past, but about the future. There are almost as many photos as words, but the ones that most vividly illustrate the tale are those taken of the Carrran Valley, in the hills near Moffat.At the end of last century, this was a bleak expanse of severely depleted upland, grazed almost to extinction. A winter photo from  shows it as a dreary unrelieved desert: think of a chocolate brownie and yoursquod be close, though dusted with snow rather than icing sugar. Now, after  years of dedicated work by volunteers, it is growing lush once more. Swathes of native woodland clothe the hillsides, and its increasingly rich undergrowth is attracting an abundance of birds, insects, flowers, fungi and amphibians. The range of moths alone is heart-warming. As before and after images go, the dference could hardly be more striking.Previously you would have been lucky to hear much more than a grouse cackling, or watch a buzzard circling overhead now it is like the RSNO, as a sorts of birdle, from meadow pippits to willow warblers, wrens and winchats, strike up from the branches of native trees: birch, aspen, ash, oak, willow, rowan, hazel, Scots pine and juniper.In a series of pithy pieces,  of those who helped bring about this transformation describe how they went about it. Philip Ashmole originally had the idea to recreate an area of woodland in the Borders that replicated how it would have been before humans arrived. Out of this notion the Wildwood Group was established, which later formed itself into the Borders Forest Trust. On Millennium Day, the trust took ownership of the Carrran Valley, and set to work on creating a wildwood.In subsequent years, other ecological restoration schemes were also begun, at Corehead and Devilrsquos Beef Tub, and Talla and Gameshope. Together these groundbreaking ventures began to restore an area they have named The Wild Heart of Southern Scotland. Inspired by their example, others are now following their lead across the country.Living as I do in one of the great medieval sheep rearing districts of the Borders, in the vicinity of Melrose Abbey, itrsquos not hard to see the effect  and more years of grazing have had on the landscape. As one of the contributors to this book writes, sheep are engrained in our economy and culture, and they are the main reason, along with other herbivores such as voles, deer, goats and rabbits, why native woodland planting is rare: ldquoItrsquos no mystery: sheep eat trees. As flocks expanded, their predators ndash wolves and lynx ndash were killed, so that today other grazers, and especially deer, roam and breed without any natural check.The Borders Forest Trustrsquos vision was aided by bodies like the Forestry Commission and Scottish Natural Heritage, but its core remained a motivated army of volunteers. Many of these came with scientic credentials ndash geographers, botanists, ornithologists, ecologists and such like. Others were simply determined to help re-establish wilderness in barren terrain. One weekend last autumn,  members of the Glasgow branch of Extinction Rebellion arrived at Gameshope, and in two days helped plant , trees. In the words of Anna Craigen, the trustrsquos work would been impossible without volunteers: ldquoThey are our muscles, brains, eyes, dirty hands and the true heart of the Wild Heart.What is so uplting about this story is not just the determination and imagination of those who have made all this happen, but the tangible evidence of the regeneration they have promoted. Page after page of A Journey in Landscape Restoration is filled with photos of wildle now thriving in Carrran.Amid the bad news headlines about climate change, and images of bush fires, floods and landslides, it is good to be reminded of the things being done to turn the tide. Work such as that in Carrran Wildwood not only restores nature to its rightful state, but gives a terric boost to our own depleted sense of hope.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

The Scottish Greens proposed regular testing a month ago to offer them some reassurance. If footballers can be tested regularly, teachers deserve the right level of protection as well.A survey by the NASUWT teachers union Teachersrsquo Union published earlier this month revealed that nearly half of teachers who responded did not feel prepared toto their school or college in August and just % said they feel safe or very safe as a result of the provisions their employer was putting in place to mitigate the risks of Covid-.Ross Greer.The survey, which examined the experiences of over  teachers in Scotland during the lockdown and in preparing for wider reopening from the start of the new academic year in August, found concerns about a lack of PPE and adequate safety measures to protect staff and pupils in schools and colleges.Larry Flanagan, general secretary of Scotlands largest teaching union, the Educational Institute of Scotland , said: ldquoMany teachers will be concerned about their personal safetyschools reopen in August with a full pupil .

In those examples, we have seen clear evidence that the tracing system is working effectively to follow up contacts. That would be no dferent in an educational setting from what it would be in any other setting in our society.\"He said that on a daily basis, when information arises about positive cases, health protection teams around the country seek information about connections between those cases in order that they can identy possible clustering of activity.In response the Scottish Government produced a statement saying: ldquoGuidance agreed by the Education Recovery Group on the health mitigations and precautions that will be in place when schools re-open will be published [on Thursday]. Testing will be a vital part of those mitigations and, as always, we will be guided by the best and most up to date scientic evidence.The test-and-protect programme asks those with coronavirus symptoms to provide details of ldquoall recent close contacts to a team of NHS contact tracers.

I find it very satisfying when you can help a ward member with their problems, making the necessary connections to the services they require, or raising an issue that an isles community is facing.“I live on the mainland and I don’t feel this has been a disadvantage to me, as I have lived in the isles for many years previously. But I do feel that candidates should have some idea of what le in the isles is like.“For me, the only essential requirement is a genuine interest in the communities in the isles and a desire to help move them forward.“With eight dferent community councils within the ward, all on dferent islands, I can honestly say that the travel between these communities is an enjoyable part of the job # in the Summer months especially!”Nomination forms for prospective candidates are available by calling the Council’s Election Office on   or sending an email to electionoffice@orkney.gov.uk They will also be available online later this weekcopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

They are also being reminded that there is local support available to them should they find themselves to be the victims of the issue.NFU Scotland Orkney#s regional policy advisor Kerry Omand said: “If anyone finds themselves to be in this unfortunate position there are key steps that they need to take and responsibilities that livestock owners have. I believe that the public are very aware of their rights and responsibilities as dog owners, and our members need to have the same knowledge and confidence in dealing with these situations.”The legislation relating to this is the DogsAct  and #worrying# is defined as attacking livestock, chasing livestock in such a way as may reasonably be expected to cause injury or suffering to the livestock or abortion as well as being at large, not otherwise under close control or on a lead, in a field or enclosure where there are livestock.Kerry highlighted: “There is often an assumption that an attack or incident must be physical for it to be taken seriously, and that is simply not the case as signicant harm can be caused to animals without any direct contact occurring.”If farmers come across an incident of livestock worrying they should contact the police on the incident is ongoing, or dial  to report the incident, try to contain the dogpossible and gather their livestock for treatment and or retain any dead livestock as evidence. Finally, a dog must only be shot as a last resortthey cannot be contained and this should be reported to the police within  hours.Kerry added: “I completely empathise with members who find themselves in this situation, having been the victim of livestock worrying myself. This was a few years ago now, but from that experience I would encourage farmers to gather evidencethey can, in the form of photos or videos of the incident occurring. That may seem like an unnatural thing to do when you are wanting to put an end to the incident as quickly as possible, but it also crucial to have this evidence to hand.”Mark Evans, animal welfare officer with Orkney Islands Council wants to remind dog owners to ensure that their dogs are always under control and avoid going into fields where livestock are grazing.He said“If a dog worries livestock on any agricultural land then the owner and or the person in charge of the dog, is guilty of a criminal offence.”Mark reiterates “Farmers should make every effort to catch the dogit is worrying livestock and it is only as a last resort to shoot the dogit is not able to be caught. This needs to be reported to the Police and to the Councils Trading Standards Service.”Orkney preventions and interventions officer with Police Scotland, Constable Simon Hay said: “The worrying of livestock can have devastating consequences for farm animals and has an obvious financial and emotional impact on farmers and their businesses.“The advice to dog owners or anyone walking and exercising their dogs in the countryside is to ensure they are under control at all times and avoid going into fields where livestock is grazing. The Scottish Outdoor Access Code says dogs should not be taken into fields where there are lambs or other young farm animals.#Police Scotland will enforce the existing legislation robustly, ensuring all reported cases of sheep worrying are thoroughly investigated and offenders reported to the Procurator Fiscal. Farmers and those who use the countryside are urged to report all incidents of livestock worrying to police on  or  in an emergency.#copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

I#m absolutely gutted.#The  year-old added: #I was on the top floor where the fire had started. Just as I was approaching my bedroom door I could hear the night porter running up and down shouting to please evacuate.#Mr Arbuckle described watching a firefighter running down the stairs of the building following an initial inspection.#We were just watching them working and getting prepared, and we were thinking #this is real now.##As we looked up to the centre of the Moorfield, that#s when flames started bursting out of the roof. We saw big, blue flames.#He said staff were eventually taken by bus to to stay at Sella Ness # the very accommodation which has been at the centre of controversy over the Moorfield#s closure.As well as having lost his belongings inside the building, Mr Arbuckle also fears he may well have lost his car # parked, as it was, outside the back of the building.#We#ve not been allowed near it because of the thickness of the smoke,# he said. #I#m not holding out any hope.##Everything I own has gone. I#ve not got a job any more -all my documents, my flash drive, I#m having to restart everything. It#s bad, bad times.#Sous chef Steven Mcdonnell said staff initially hoped it would be something minor.#For the first few minutes we were thinking #maybe somebody#s burnt the toast#, the  year-old said.But he said it soon became clear the fire was much, much more serious.#We were seeing flames from a window in the second floor. Things were getting hotter and hotter.#He also said blue flames began to appear, a sign # he added # that gas cylinders were catching fire inside the building.#We were escorted to an ambulance area, and the locals came out and started giving us blankets. Two buses pulled up and we were sent to Sella Ness, which was a bit of a bitter pill.#Nearby resident Georgia Smith, who lives around  yards from the scene, said signs first emerged of something wrong when her house began losing water pressure.#My dad woke up and looked out the window,# she said. #I heard, #the hotel#s on fire#. I looked out and saw a giant ball of fire. The whole roof was ablaze.#There were a lot of people down there. We watched as the workers all came out and went on the coaches and got shipped to Sella Ness.#Like many residents, Ms Smith was left shocked by the incident # not least because it took place almost exactly a year after an explosion ripped through a house in the area, resulting in the death of Peggy Grfiths.Alison Smith lives in Ockragarth, where that incident took place.#It#s a year on Thursday since Peggy#s house exploded and the poor woman passed away,# the  year-old said.Friend Maria Wishart of Lingapund added: #We could hear the firefighters and the smoke was going right across the voe. We could hear the pops and the cracks.#Another resident, who did not wish to be named, added she first became aware something was up when she heard crackling voices coming over on the radios used by firefighters who had arrived at the scene.#I woke up to the sound of walkie-talkies,# she said.#It#s almost a year to the day since that house explosion and now the Moorfield has gone.

Both creations have been made by the hands of very talented local Cullybackey people.Shellinghill Park in Cullybackey has for some time been the focus of the ‘CCP In Bloom’ team. Colourful flower beds and neatly mown grass has been the focus of their attention - until now.  Following permission from the Mid and East Antrim Council, the park has just acquired a beautully sculpted horse made entirely from horse shoes. This is a unique piece of art which has given the village something to appreciate and be proud of. The creator of this horse is Bertie McNeilly, who is a leading member of the village Bloom team. He is a self taught sculptor who created this le size sculpture using nothing but recycled horseshoes. The shoes were supplied by a local farrier. This specially designed sculpture is something which has added another dimension to their in bloom activities and, being made from horse shoes, might even bring us good luck in any future competitions!Bertie said he had this challenging task in his mind for some time.“We, in the Cullybackey Community Partnership, are always looking for something which will enhance the village and will also appeal to our “In Bloom” judges. It was a big undertaking but I enjoyed the experience,”he said.  Cullybackey Community Partnership are very grateful to Bertie for his generosity in letting them have the benefit of his undoubted skills.They also thank Council for allowing them to use their ground to displaytheir latest acquisition.Knitted flowers displayMeanwhile, CCP have also been working on a knitted crocheted display of flowers in the last few weeks in honour of the NHS and to those who have supported them throughout this crisis. They are all made by people living in and around the Cullybackey area and each have their unique style.  This display can be seen in the Maine Business Centre window . The idea came from local lady Barbara Montgomery who assisted CCP Margaret Murphy to put together this amazing display.Margaret said as well as taking the opportunity to recognise the NHS and all support workers, she would like to thank the Cullybackey people who have taken time to knit or crochet hundreds of flowers to enable them to “put on this amazing display.”CCP have continued throughout this lockdown period to enhance the village with numerous floral displays which has resulted in the village looking amazing! The colour and vibrancy has helped to lighten the mood of everybody in the village and those travelling through it.When in the area look out for the horse and all the displays andyou want to learn more about the work of the Cullybackey Community Partnership, ring Joanne on .

His previous work has focused on tackling the educational underachievement of black and Caribbean heritage children in England.He said targeted intervention in schools was one effective way to close the gap between poverty and under-achievement.Peter Weir said the new  would pave the way for a properly resourced action plan allowing education to be a le-changer for all children.Cregagh Primary School principal David Heggarty hosted the meeting, and called on the  to work for a better partnership between schools, family and communities.It is my hope... as a primary school principal of six years and as a former pupil of this very same school, raised by single parent in a low income home and reliant on free school meals, that a very wide and very foundational view of tackling educational underachievement is needed.

Two, David Hilditch and Trevor Clarke, denied it represented a challenge to Mrs Foster but said they would make no further comment on their reasons for abstaining.Thomas Buchanan said he had no comment to make while the remaining eight abstaining MLAs - Alex Easton, Paula Bradley, Joanne Bunting, Jonathan Buckley, Paul Frew, William Humphrey, and former ministers Mervyn Storey and Michelle McIlveen - have yet to respond.The controversial bill gives ministers more inidual powers, and was eventually passed by  votes to , with  abstentions.The rebellion from DUP MLAs followed warnings from former First Minister Peter Robinson#s adviser Richard Bullick, who said it would effectively remove the DUP#s ability to veto decisions it disagreed with. He claimed the DUP was sleepwalking into making profound constitutional amendments and shedding gains negotiated in the  St Andrews Agreement.He said he was concerned about the danger of the DUP rebellion being interpreted as a challenge to Mrs Foster#s authority, but it turns on a few moving parts. These issues are more grey than some current arguments suggest, he said.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseThe DUP’s Thomas Buchanan FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappThe DUP’s Thomas BuchananRadio Ulster#s Nolan Show reported that senior DUP figures had urged Mrs Foster to pause the bill, including MPs Sammy Wilson and Jeffrey Donaldson as well as former MP Nigel Dodds.A DUP statement has since called the bill a very technical piece of legislation, which was the subject of considerable legal input from senior government lawyers.It added: Bills would not normally be accelerated but in recognition some members would have like more time to debate this bill we relaxed our whip on the matter.The new law was introduced following a court judgment two years ago, which overturned the Executive#s approval for a waste incinerator near Mallusk.Ulster Unionist leader Steve Aiken said he regretted that the Assembly had passed poor and badly thought-out legislation.The fact that the Junior Ministers admitted that no changes in planning, which this Bill was supposedly about, can be enacted until the revised ministerial code is brought before the Assembly in either the autumn or early winter, shows that not only was there ample time to give this bill proper consideration, but also that the flaws highlighted in this process re-emphasise that no lessons have been learnt since RHI, he said.While we did not manage to defeat the bill, the fact that some DUP MLAs chose to abstain in person shows the considerable disquiet that there is across much of the Assembly in this process. I fear that the flaws in this bill could haunt us for many years to come.Sinn Fein junior minister Declan Kearney denied the legislation would allow ministers to go on #solo runs# and said it was necessary to progress key planning decisions.

They say masks will make it impossible for the children to lip read what their teachers and friends are saying. Lissa, whose four-year-old Penny is due to start at Ballyclare Primary School in September, says she is concerned about her daughter#s future development. Penny lost her hearing when she was a year-and-a-half but we didn#t know until her speech failed to develop, Lissa explained. With her speech delayed, she had her implants fitted last year so she had already lost quite a lot of development time, and then her nursery was closed for months due to the lockdown. It will be challenging enough for Penny entering school in terms of communication on top of all of this uncertainty around the virus. I#m concerned but I still want her to thrive as best she can and she needs an educational setting to do that. While Penny has the implants she still doesn#t hear everything, so she relies on facial expressions and lip reading to piece together what#s being said just like a jigsaw puzzle.

She said: When Emmett started school he had hardly any speech or sign language and over the last four years he has really developed. He relies completely on lip reading and sign language to communicate. Obviously he has missed out on speech therapy, which he would have got in school over the past few months but for the lockdown. My main concern is getting Emmett back into school because he has missed out on so much and home schooling has been very hard over recent months due to his speech and developmental issues.He was in hospital recently and the staff had to wear face coverings, but at times he couldn#t understand what they were saying, as they cause mumbling. If this was the case in schools he and his friends who also have implants will have real problems communicatingthey can#t see each other properly.

But it#s not the same as seeing them in the flesh. However, I am determined to keep pressing ahead with my efforts to get Liz and her mum over here.Liz was born in Vietnam in November last year and I set about planning to bring her and her mum here.However, the global pandemic is playing havoc with his dream.He added: Not only were there the health concerns about coronavirus and travelling, but there#s now also a backlog everywhere you turn, whether it be for visas or passports.There#s a lot of red tape but the authorities in Dublin have assured me they are going to do everything they can.I was hoping my partner and my daughter could be here by Christmas.But, realistically, I don#t think it#s going to happen before .It#s really frustrating. I am watching Liz grow up on Skype but I know I#m missing out on seeing her getting bigger every day. It was in April  that Vance was evacuated as part of Operation Babylt from Saigon and he came to live in Northern Ireland, where he was adopted by Cyril and Liz McElhinney, who raised him along with their two other sons David and Stephen.In  they supported histo the country of his birth in a bid to find his biological parents and a BBC NI documentary team followed him. Although he discovered the orphanage where he had lived, he was unable to trace his family.However, after he came back he started to receive messages on social media from people who claimed they were his relations and knew his widowed mother.I was worried that it might all be a hoax, said Vance.But when he went back to Vietnam on a scheduled trip he was introduced to a woman called Le Thi Anh, who insisted she was his mother.I was gobsmacked, and DNA testing later established that I was indeed her son, he added.Around the same time he met and fell in love with a woman called Le Hang.He said: I met Le through a charity that I set up to help disabled and orphaned children in Vietnam. She came on a visit to see the work that we were doing for the youngsters and we hit it off quickly.Though I couldn#t speak Vietnamese we communicated through French and we also used a translation site on the internet.I#ve been back to Vietnam and we realised we wanted to be together. We got engaged in  and in November last year Le had our baby. We#re now planning to get married in Northern Ireland as soon as possible.Vance and his partner called the baby Liz after his adoptive mother, who was a well-known cleric in Lurgan and who died nearly three years ago from motor neurone disease.Vance is still coming to terms with another familial shock after he found out he has a half-sister in Australia who he knew nothing about. A few months ago I got a call from a woman Down Under who said she was my half-sister and DNA tests have borne out her claims. But it#s been a real surprise to cope with, though we#ve been in contact a few times, said resourceful Vance, who has recently been celebrating the success of an invention aimed at dog lovers.His dog dock, which allows pet owners to secure their animals safely outside shops, has been bought by around  businesses, particularly around Lurgan, where it can be found attached to exterior walls at service stations and cafes.He explained: I#ve been working on the dog dock for four years now. I always thought it was a hassle that I couldn#t find somewhere to tie up my late Staffordshire bull terrier Keltic when I went into shops and my brother David suggested that I should come up with a device to get round the problem.I drew up plans for a fairly crude first prototype and got it made up in a factory in Vietnam. Invest NI gave him a development grant of £, and a design engineer at a college in Portadown came up with a more sophisticated model for the dog dock, which was then manufactured in a local engineering factory.The first dog dock, which costs £, went up outside a supermarket in Waringstown. Although he#s happy that the feedback from businesses and even caravan owners has been positive, he says the pandemic has restricted his ability to market his invention properly.I#ve now applied to the TV show Dragons# Den to seeI can get a slot on the programme and find an investor there, Vance added.

Throughout the crisis we have continued to draw down mortgages and are currently lending up to % loan to value.As a responsible lender we consider a range of factors to assess the affordability of the mortgage in the long-term. At this time we are not accepting mortgage applications from customers who are on furlough but we will keep this under review.Nationwide Building Society said it will consider applications from people who have been furloughed but added those on furlough are not eligible for the society#s recently launched % loan to value first-time buyer mortgages.Bank of Ireland said: We are lending to customers who are furloughed. We#ll ask customers to provide some information about the terms of the furlough during the application process.Lender AIB said: All our lending is based on the customer#s ability to repay. This is to protect the customer from undue risk. Applications are dealt with on a case by case basis.Ulster Bank said it was “strongly committed to lending to all kinds of mortgage borrowers - this includes those on furlough and those ing from furlough”.“As always, they base lending decisions on affordability and ability to repay and they take each case on an inidual basis.”A spokeswoman for Progressive Building Society said it is “a responsible lender and reviews and assesses every case on an inidual basis including the income and expenditure of all applicants”.HSBC said it will not lend to furloughed workers whoseto work date is further than three months away or there is nodate at all.Mortgage broker and advisor London  Country said: “Mortgage lenders have sought to support those on furlough through the lockdown period and in the main have continued to accept furloughed income when considering how much they can offer to borrowers. “That would of course often mean a reduced income and consequent reduction in the size of borrowing available but at least most lenders would be able to consider lending.  “As we move closer to the unwinding of the jobs retention scheme borrowers should expect to see more questions aboutto work and some lenders are now stipulating that they will want some confirmation. “Getting employer confirmation may not be possible for all at this stage but on the upside those that can, may be able to use theirto work income for the affordability assessment.  “That approach will be consistent whether for first time buyers or next time buyers as lenders will need to be able to demonstrate that the mortgage is affordable and will remain sustainable. “However the market is still light on deals for those with small deposits which is often a bigger issue for first time buyers and some of the lenders that have ed to the % LTV market will potentially set a higher expectation when it comes to credit score.”Belfast Most ReadSacking of Dunnes manager #who ate food worth £ was justied#Sacking of Dunnes manager #who ate food worth £ was justied#Nora Quoirin#s parents to sue Dublin lawyer and Facebook over social media postsNora Quoirin#s parents to sue Dublin lawyer and Facebook over social media postsRevealed: The NI restaurants offering discounts under Covid- support schemeRevealed: The NI restaurants offering discounts under Covid- support schemeDUP#s Donaldson, Wilson and Dodds intervened before backbench rebellion over bill - reportDUP#s Donaldson, Wilson and Dodds intervened before backbench rebellion over bill - reportTributes paid after death of Holywood surgeon Kyle McDonaldTributes paid after death of Holywood surgeon Kyle McDonald,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The teenager#s body was discovered on August  beside a small stream about .km from the resort.Although her family believe there was a criminal element to what happened, police have said there was no sign the -year-old was abducted or raped.A preliminary post-mortem examination showed she succumbed to intestinal bleeding due to starvation and stress.An inquest into her death is due to begin on August  and last until September .Denis Barror, the Dublin-based solicitor acting for Meabh and her French father Sebastien, declined to comment on the proceedings.Ms Brennan denied defaming the couple and said she was surprised that they were taking a case. I will be defending myself. I don#t believe they have a cause of action against me, she said.Ms Brennan said that while she wrote very extreme things on the social media , she believed them to be true. Facebook declined to comment.Ms Brennan is a former partner in a Dublin law firm, and specialised in employment and equality law. She retired in  due to an illness.She confirmed her Facebook account was suspended for  days last September but was reinstated and remains active.The case is the second set of proceedings initiated by the Quoirin family since the tragedy occurred. They are also suing the owner of the resort for alleged negligence.Confirming details of that case last January, Sankara Nair, a lawyer for Nora#s parents, said the family strongly believed she was abducted as she had mental and physical disabilities and could not have wandered off on her own.The lawsuit alleges a cottage window was found ajar, with its latch broken, on the morning she disappeared.It is also claimed the resort gate was left open without any security and there was no surveillance camera except for the reception area.According to the claim, Nora had poor motor skills and needed help to walk. Although in her mid-teens, her mental age was about five or six years.Mr Sankara said the resort was not safe for Nora and that anybody could have come in and taken her. In an interview with RTE News last December, Meabh and Sebastian Quoirin said they were determined to get truth and justice.I think we will seek justice in so far as we can. We have to find peace in our own hearts, said Meabh Quoirin.We will carry Nora with us forever. She#s with us here every day. I talk to her every day. She holds my hand. We hear her. We see her in all that we do at home.

Lavey Parish pooled their energies to raise almost pound, to contribute to the recent work on St Mary’s Church of Our Lady of Mercy. Parish priest Fr Eamon Graham was delighted to see the community coming together. “Weve just come to end of a very extraordinary week in our parish and community,” he said. “Ive certainly been overwhelmed - I think we all have - by the level of generosity, but I think something even more important was that so many aspects of our community pulled together. googletag.cmd.push “You know, we enjoyed it, enjoyed it very much. At the end of the lockdown period I think we were all, kind of, looking for a lt of some kind and it certainly gave us all a great lt. “I want to say a sincere thanks to everybody who was involved - everybody who was at the organising end of it, and particularly to the groups that took part.” The fundraiser received huge community support, with local sports clubs in the area all taking on a specic challenge to help with the chapel’s restoration. Erin’s Own GAA’s underage footballers and hurlers ran km each, while their senior counterparts ran a collective km. googletag.cmd.push Termoneeny Hill Walking Club had originally pledged to walk a collective km, but upped their target to ,km during the course of their challenge. Termoneeny Cycling Club members each cycled km, while the Erin’s Own camogie players each clocked up at least km. -year-old Harry Boyle’s remarkable contribution saw him cycling around all the townlands in the parish, while Fr Graham and his parochial team got involved by running in their Lavey gear. The challenge was not just limited to Lavey, though, and their diaspora throughout the world got involved via social media, sharing photos of them completing their contribution. The club have raised almost pound, to date and donations can still be made via the Lavey Parish Just Giving page.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Conor McGintys latest single Home To The Heartland recently topped the iTunes World Music Chart and has won praise from some of the citys most famous sons and daughters. After being sent a preview of the song footballer James McClean described it as brilliant, while Sinn Fein MLA Martina Anderson said it was a soulful and heartfelt tribute to Derry.This is without doubt the proudest I have been about any song I have ever released or recorded and to make it even more special I wrote the song myself, said Conor.I penned this song as a modern day Derry anthem along with the exquisite musical skills of Eamonn Karran.It has a Celtic pop twist to it and people seem to really like it.“Home To The Heartland” is written from the perspective of a Derry emigrant ing home and mentions many local landmarks such as Shipquay Street and Ebrington.Conor had been due to marry his fiancee Aisling this year, but the wedding has now been cancelled twice due to lockdown.Writing this song is probably the only good thing to come out of lockdown for me, said Conor.Ashaving to cancel your wedding once wasn’t hard enough to take, having to do it for a second time two months later was even worse.I think this year will be remembered by so many as an absolute kick in the teeth for so many dferent reasons.Conor says entertainers are struggling to find work due to the current government restrictions. googletag.cmd.push Something needs to be done to prevent the arts and entertainment sector falling through itself in the next few months, he said.It provides work to so much more than just the singer or musician. We all have bills, we all need to find ways to make an income and there is only so much adaptation you can do. We are applying for jobs but when you have been a self employed musician for years it is hard to get your foot in the door anywhere that isn’t in the entertainment sector.Id like Stormount to please try and think outside the box - It has become desperate times for many. googletag.cmd.push We will look forward to our wedding next year in September but in the meantime it would be great to be able to go back to work and provide.Put a screen up in front of me while I sing for all I care!‘Home to the Heartland’ is currently available on iTunes, Spoty and Amazon.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Father La rises in the morning at around .am for early morning Mass. Less than an hour later, he is under an open sky as birds fly overhead undertaking the Stations in his bare feet leaving solitary footprints where before many soles left their imprint on the earth. Housemartins A station takes around an hour and ten minutes to do and Father La does so under the swooping wings of the Housemartins amidst a backdrop of blooming nature during these calm but drizzly mornings. googletag.cmd.push At am, the boatmen come onto the island. Each day Thomas Gallagher from Ballyshannon, Reece McGrath from Pettigo and Joe Sheeran from Mountcharles arrive on the island and undertake their own work. They leave at pm. “Really, I can hardly remember the last time in my le I was lonely. I am at ease with my own company,” he said. As they leave the island, Father La is well into his day. “I would be hard pushed to find a time when I have been busier. “People are afraid that I am bored but I’m not. The team are exceptionally busy, they have been putting so much work into alternative ways to keep in touch with pilgrims. We have set ourselves to be in outreach mode,” he said. googletag.cmd.push In the evening, Father La goes up to the Basilica for night prayer. “My thoughts are to honour the rhythm of the pilgrimage season,” he says. This year, those affiliated with the island are busy in new and alternate ways. Father La said that many people have been sending petitions to those on the island: “We get a lot of people who send us petitions asking for prayer for this or that,” Father La said. In his prayers, he remains faithful to those people and the heartfelt petitions that they have undertaken to write and to send to the island. Virtuous pilgrimage On the last weekend in June, Father La invited people to do the full pilgrimage with him from wherever they were. It was not a virtual pilgrimage, he said, but a virtuous one and people did fast and pray asthey were on the island. People signed up online to participate. Father La recalls that the pilgrimage was one where they were not blessed with favourable weather. “The rain was horizontal. It was driving rain and constant wind. “It was relentless during the night. On Saturday we got through reasonably well,” he said. Those who participated were bestowed with a certicate which carries the Lough Derg seal and are signed by the prior. All of the certicates had to be sent out by the team to those who participated. A pilgrimage season did not take place on the island in  as result of a dispute with boatmen. However, many more pilgrims came to the island the following year. Pilgrimage path There is now a newly refurbished path on the lake shore of Lough Derg. The path which was recently relaunched would have been used by pilgrims in the medieval times. In the s pilgrims from as far away as Spain, Italy and Hungary used part of this trail as they made their way to what medieval Europe knew of as St Patrick’s Purgatory. Work was being carried out on the path before the pandemic struck and six new boards were designed and ready to go when the lockdown came into effect. There are now six display boards which bring to le the story of the Pilgrim Path and those who walk the path can enjoy stopping to read the boards. Father La said that the ‘full walk’ is around k along the shore road and to Saints Island. “We went to the point where pilgrims used to cross to Saint’s Monastery where they were given hospitality before being brought to Station Island,” he said. People can also take a shorter loop and everyone can do the walk at their own pace. Some people like to do it in soft contemplation and reflection whilst other people like to absorb the surroundings. Many people enjoy taking photographs in the historic and picturesque surroundings. “I led two guided groups on Saturday and Sunday,” he said. Numbers were limited as a result of the Covid- church and State guidelines, those who took part enjoyed it. One-day retreat Father La said that it remains to be seen whether a one-day retreat will take place on the island this year. “It remains to be seen whether we can open for a one-day retreat at this time,” he said. However, a meeting for the matter to be discussed will take place before the end of the week. August  It is expected that Father La will remain on the island until August . Enjoying his own company, reflection and prayer, Father La seems content during this year’s traditional pilgrimage time. He has now become familiar with a goose who comes onto the island to graze in the grass. The goose can be found behind St Mary’s, at times, and when startled will take off honking at great speeds, at times. His presence is one that the reflective priest appreciates. “I am kind of glad for his company. “It is amazing the company that God sends you when you are on your own,” he fondly says.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Staff at the Central Library ed to work in early June to completely change the layout of the furniture and displays to allow for a one way system and social distancing. googletag.cmd.push Area Manager, Maura Craig, explained that a number of new measures had been put in place to keep staff and library users safe. We have had a steady stream of visitors at the Central Library since it reopened and people have told us they feel very safe due to all the measures we have introduced. Staff are there to greet people as they come in the door and we have provided hand sanitiser. There are also screens at the desks and lots of customer signage. Any books that are ed will be stored for  hours before they are put back on the shelves. Customers are being asked to keep a social distance and limit their time on the computers or browsing for books to half an hour. There are also self service machines for borrowing books. In addition, all surfaces in the library will be regularly cleaned. We are asking customers to help us keep the computer stations clean by providing sanitising wipes to wipe them down before and after they use them, said Mrs Craig. Staff will also be carrying out a high level of cleaning in the library. Mrs Craig said the opening hours have also been changed to allow the library to close for  hoursbefore reopening on a Tuesday morning for vulnerable people. We want people to feel safe and that means delivering our service in a new way, she said. Libraries NI have continued to offer an online service during lockdown, with , new members signing up across the North since March. Mrs Craig said the libraries would now like to welcome these new members in person. Over , e-items were downloaded during lockdown, she explained. Going forward we will offer a blended approach and continue with online services such as children’s Rhythm and Rhyme, Storytime and online Summer Reading Challenge, until such times it is safe to resume activities in a library setting. The other libraries in Derry, at Strathfoyle, Waterside, Creggan and Shantallow, remain closed at present, but they are offering a Book and Collect service. Customers can phone their local library during dedicated hours to request books and then arrange a suitable time for a contactless collection, explained Mrs Craig. A customer can view our online catalogue and checka particular book they are interested in is available in their local library, they will then phone and speak with a member of staff who will set it aside and arrange a day and time for them to come in and collect it.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Speaking to the County Derry Post, as part of the in-depth look at Ulster hurling, both referred to the competition being at its peak during the nineties when Down and Derry were challenging for titles. McCann, who expressed that Antrim would not have any aspirations of being part of the talked about Team Ulster concept, said the Saffrons would be mad keen for aof the Ulster senior hurling championship. The Creggan man is one of two or three to have ever played in the Ulster championship, but feels there would need to be a reward and spoke of how the automatic entry to the All-Ireland semi-finals now being a thing of the past. googletag.cmd.push “Id say we would be mad keen to get it back,” McCann said. “If there was some sort of reward for winning the Ulster championship, you would get a better buy-in from all the teams and when they removed that, it was a road to nowhere.” Down manager Sheehan had a dferent opinion on the need for qualication into the Liam McCarthy Cup to make the Ulster championshipviable. It would be a massive incentive, but felt that Derry and Down would not be at the level of Leinster or Munster and the Joe McDonagh Cup would be their level. googletag.cmd.push McCann felt that the new tiered championship has been really good for Antrim. Last years Joe McDonagh Cup threw up competitive games and their clash with Offaly was among the best games he has seen, but not enough were able to witness it.  Antrim senior hurling captain Conor McCann “It is a shame they are never on TV, the GAA never listen and never do anything about it. They show the odd game and I have no doubt the Christy Ring is the exact same. If the promotion was better, it would definitely help,” McCann stated. Sheehan said he would love to see aof the Ulster championship and its absence reflected poorly on the province. While he accepts Antrim would general win it, he points to Derry winning the last U final and beating Down in the final. “The reality is, an Ulster championship medal means something to people andAntrim felt they didnt want to partake in it, Derry, Down Armagh and the other teams would have an interest in playing in it...but clearly you want Antrim in it,” Sheehan said. The Newry Shamrocks man looked towards Derry or Down being in Division A next season and Antrims chance to be in Division , should they beat Kerry. “That a good for Ulster hurling. It is indicative of the fact there are good hurlers in the province and there are guys in the province who are passionate about it,” he added. Sheehan also mentioned the topic of dual counties trying to attract players to the hurling . “It is very hard to do that, when those lads can get provincial recognition playing in a provincial championship and get on the TV. Their chances of getting some kind of coverage is increased, yet we dont even have our own championship at any level – senior, minor or U. “I make no bones about this, I think the Ulster Council are reneging on their responsibilities by failing to have an Ulsterchampionship,” Sheehan adds. He also indicated how Derry and Down would love to get a crack at an Ulster title. References were made to the crowds at Slaughtneils recent games with Dunloy and Ballyhale. “We are being denied the opportunity to have a show-piece for Ulster hurling and I just think that is wrong. It is the very minimum the Ulster Council should be doing,” the Down boss pleaded. So when do you play it  “Fixtures is something you can always work your way around,” said Sheehan, who was the GPAs representative on the National Fixtures Committee setup by President John Horan last year. “Ideally, you would like to see it played in the summer. I dont know why, with the right kind of work, at the very least the first step could be taken where they could look to morph the McGurk Cup into the Ulster championship. “If we are playing in a pre-season competition, there is no reason why that cant be built up on. Either make it an Ulster championship or mirror it and give people summer hurling.” He doesnt buy into the scenario of clubs clashing with county in the summer. Sheehans solution is train with the county once a week. Give them back to their clubs but still play in the Ulster championship. “Nobody pays the players wages so no manager, club or county, should have exclusive rights to players,” Sheehan stressed. “Players want to be playing matches and managers shouldnt be stopping them from doing that.” Conor McCann agreed on a summer slot for the Ulster hurling championship, but it demanded more respect. “It should be having more of a stature, other things should be moving out of the way for it,” he stated. “We shouldnt be talking about squeezing the Ulster hurling championship in. You dont hear people talking about squeezing the Munster championship into the fixtures, do you ”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Taking a holiday in the United Kingdom offers people the chance to uncover some stunning scenery, wonderful attractions and superb accommodation without having to jump on a plane. Here, we take a look at the type of places you can stay, the rules you need to follow and how to enjoy a great staycation. Take a trip with confidence Northern Ireland’s colourful countryside, breathtaking beaches and glorious gardens are ready to welcome visitors this summer. Many locations are reopening, but have restricted visitor numbers and pre-booked time slots, so we recommend looking at the official websites for attractions and organisations before you travel, so that you’re in the know before you go. googletag.cmd.push The national tourist organisations of Northern Ireland, Scotland, Wales and England have launched a UK-wide industry standard and ‘We’re Good to Go’ mark. The mark means businesses can demonstrate that they are adhering to the respective government and public health guidance, ensuring they can welcome visitors back with confidence. Do remember that our four nations have dferent guidelines, advice and timescales for reopening tourism. Please respect government guidance on social distancing and also any regional lockdown measures that are provided by the respective nation. Summer is here and the United Kingdom is beginning to reopen, providing everyone with the opportunity to start dreaming about a holiday. And this year a staycation could give you some much-needed rest and recuperation, while also helping get the holiday industry back up and running. googletag.cmd.push Hotels, campsites, bed and breakfast accommodation and other places to stay are now openingthey can follow the guidelines relevant to their locality to ensure that their guests will be safe to stay and spend days wandering our award-winning coastlines, exploring our green spaces and getting inspired in our cities. Each accommodation provider is unique and those that have reopened have had to adapt depending on the nature of their business, including the size and type of accommodation. But these changes mean it is safe for visitors to come and enjoy a change of scenery. But even when we are away from home, we still need to follow the guidelines. Speaking earlier this month, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: “As lockdown eases, we should focus on supporting the livelihoods of business owners and their employees up and down the country – all of whom are opening their doors for the first time in more than three months. “They are our local restaurants, hairdressers, libraries, museums, cinemas, and yes, pubs. They are also hotels, BBs, indeed much of our tourism industry. “All these businesses and their workers have put in a heroic effort to prepare their venues for this reopening, to work out a way to trade in a way that keeps their customers safe. “But the success of these businesses, the livelihoods of those who rely on them, and ultimately the economic health of the whole country is dependent on every single one of us acting responsibly. We must not let them down.” Mr Johnson emphasised that evenwe are now allowed to spend nights away from our own homes, we must still follow social distancing rules. When out and about, we need to remember to look after ourselves, one another and the environment around us. To make sure we’re all doing our bit to travel responsibly, just follow a few simple steps. When planning your trip, check that important facilities like toilets and car parks are open before you travel. If you have an attraction in mind, check online to seeyou need to pre-book. Some places may be extremely popular, so get off the beaten track and discover a hidden gem. Stay socially distanced apart from anyone outside your household while walking, running, cycling, sitting and sunbathing. Wear your face covering at all times when on public transport. Make sure you have a bank card many outlets are currently only accepting cashless payments. Take hand sanitiser with you. Leave the car behind where possible and visit nearby attractions by walking, cycling or public transport.  LUXURY STAY: Beannchor Group managing director Bill Wolsey at the Merchant Hotel Relax in five-star luxury Social distancing measures aren’t the only change visitors are experiencing at Belfast’s five-star Merchant Hotel. The hotel has used lockdown time to complete its pound, investment of the Great Room Restaurant and Cocktail Bar. The management team is confident that customers will benefit from, but not be inconvenienced by, the Covid- compliant changes it has also made. The Great Room has been reimagined to create a standalone restaurant and the Cocktail Bar has also benefited from signicant refurbishment. Other venues within the Beannchor Group portfolio have also opened their doors. Beannchor Group managing director Bill Wolsey said: “We’re aware that customers and guests may be curious about the experience that awaits them and, while there are measures in place that follow the scientic guidelines and industry best practice to ensure the safety of our staff and customers at all times, we have striven to minimise the impact to the overall experience at all our venues.” Camping perfect for keeping distance Cool Camping is a curated website of small, independently-run camping and glamping sites across Wales and beyond. Marketing manager James Warner Smith said: “Having campfires, spreading yourself out, being able to chat with the owner of the business who’ll be able to recommend a local pub – they’re all big parts of the appeal of camping. “You’re much more likely to be pitching your tent among shrubs and long grass with a lot of space between you and your neighbours.” The company has been working closely with campsites in Wales to ensure safety guidelines are met. At the moment, only self-contained accommodation can open, so the website only allows those types of sites to be booked. They’ve introduced a new feature on the website where each business can indicate what new safety measures they’ve put in place. Among the most popular places among potential visitors is Pembrokeshire, with secluded spots outside of national parks all proving popular. middot Wales is open for camping from  July.  Courtesy of Cool Camping Extra measures in place so you can embark on a lakeside holiday Heidi and Stuart Cordner have reopened their self-catering property on the shores of Loch Lomond and their family-run passenger cruise business, Cruise Loch Lomond. The -person rental property is set in self-contained grounds on the shore of the lake, and the Cordners hope guests will contribute to the local economy while being respectful. They have implemented virus prevention measures in both the property and on the boats, including increased cleaning and social distancing procedures. They have also invested in additional cleaning equipment and training for cleaning staff. Passengers are asked to wear face coverings and book in advance, and capacity has been reduced to allow for social distancing. “We live in a small community but we’re fortunate that there’s a lot of space and our main business is an outdoor activity,” said Mr Cordner. “There are a lot of positive health implications of being outside and on the water.”  LOCH LOMOND: Heidi and Stuart Cordner have reopened self-catering properties and cruises For more information on staying safe, please go to www.discovernorthernireland. _CoronavirusPHutm_mediumdisplayutm_sourceMediaForceutm_contentxframingdclidCOvM_IeoCFQzwQodkcEARw\" target\"_blank\" rel\"noopener\" --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

One Big Field Party is being held this Sunday on a large green area beside Creggans Linsfort Drive. The event is free to attend, but donations will be collected for local musicians who have performed for free throughout lockdown to raise money for local charities and people in need. Local charity fundraisers Gavin Gallagher and Steven Gallagher have organised virtual gigs and street parties throughout lockdown with the help of local entertainers which have raised pound, for local good causes. googletag.cmd.push We always wanted to do something like this to say thank you to the local acts who have done so much during lockdown, but we had to wait until the rules had relaxed a bit, explained Gavin Gallagher. Some people have said to us that there have been a few reported cases of coronavirus recently andthat spike continues we will cancel the event. But at the minute we are taking every precaution to make sure everyone is safe, including using  security staff and a team of litter pickers, Mr Gallagher asked those attending the concert to observe social distancing rules. googletag.cmd.push We want people to come and to have a good time but we would ask that they abide by the rules. We are only here to entertain. If everyone does as the security people ask then everyone can have a good time. Lockdown has proved very challenging for Derrys entertainment community, with many losing all their income overnight. I would say about % of the musicians I know do it as their full time job and they lost everything, said Mr Gallagher. Many of those that were eligible for government support got so little that it was hardly worth their while. Despite this, they continued to gig online to keep peoples spirits up and raise money for charity. We hosted street parties across the city that made a really big dference to people in those areas. There was one wee woman of  who stood at her window crying and waving out because she was so happy and then she sent her son out with a donation of pound. Another time we heard about a woman who was turning  and we had singers up performing at her doorstep for an hour.One Big Field Party will take place on Sunday from pm to pm at Linsfort Drive.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

An Air Corps maritime patrol aircraft was dispatched and two Irish naval ships placed on standby after the skipper of the Killybegs-based fishing vessel, the Marliona, reported that a UK frigate ordered him to leave the area where he was fishing  miles off the Irish coast. It is understood that HMS Lancaster hailed the fishing vessel on Tuesday morning, informing the skipper they were commencing a joint operation with a submarine which would continue over the next three days. A maritime aircraft was sent to monitor the area where the UK warship was operating and two Irish naval vessels were redeployed. googletag.cmd.push The Marliona has since resumed fishing in the area which is west off Tory Island. Sinn Feacutein spokesperson on Foreign Affairs and Defence John Brady accused the British Navy of arrogance of the highest order and of once again endangering Irish fishing vessels. Deputy Brady said: “On one level, we have the outrageous scenario of a foreign power ordering an Irish vessel out of Irish waters. On the other, we have a situation where a British warship was engaged in a joint operation with a British submarine. The disregard for Irish sovereignty is arrogance of the highest order. But, alongside this we have the endangerment of Irish fishing vessels and their crews by a British submarine. googletag.cmd.push I thought that we had left this carry-on behind with the Cold War. For decades, British submarines have infringed on Irish sovereign waters, leading to tragedy and loss of le when submarines have got caught up in fishing nets and pulled trawlers under. It is staggering and unacceptable that this flagrant disregard for the safety of Irish fishing crews is continuing. This cannot be allowed to stand. I will ensure that this incident will not be allowed to be swept under the carpet.We need answers as to why this has been allowed to happen. I understand that the Department of Foreign Affairs has launched an investigation into the incident, and I will be in contact with the Minister to ensure that the governments response reflects the seriousness of the matter.  I also want to commend the response of the Irish Navy, which ordered Irish vessels to the area to ensure the safety of the fishing vessel in question.

The CPA is of the view that the GAA needs to use its time to re-calibrate the season. When Coronavirus ceases to be a threat, the fixtures problem of our own creation will still be with us and will not have gone away, the CPA maintains. In a statement the CPA claimed that the current tug of war between club and county in the abridged season of  only proves that the governance of rules around designated periods is not working and the lack of clarity and enforcement of the existing rules is bringing embarrassment to the Association. googletag.cmd.push It added: The GAA is currently in the middle of a very dangerous atmosphere which needs to be addressed immediately and certainly in advance of . If a satisfactory set of fixtures cannot be agreed then this totally unnecessary and poisonous atmosphere will further escalate and damage our Association even further. The statement contends that the simple and unpalatable reality is that the GAA is in crisis. This crisis is four-fold. It then lists a number of areas of concern, namely: .Fixtures. .Finance. .A lack of central governance. . A loss of it’s’ sense of identity as a community based Gaelic Games and Culture organization with the club at its core. googletag.cmd.push The rest of the statement reads as follows: All four of the above are inextricably linked. middotThe crises in fixtures is one of the primary causes of the financial dficulties because the cost of team management at both club and inter-county levels is unsustainable. middotThe predominance of inter county activity has led to an erosion of the Associations core values as a community based Gaelic Games and Culture organization and to a diminution of the club games program. It has also led to the unnecessary ongoing friction between club and county over the availability of our elite players. middotA lack of proper governance structures means that there is no central control over the management of the national games program. National and provincial competitions have developed in piecemeal fashion and there has never been a strategic games plan. Local competitions structures y widely, devised and implemented by a wide range of administrations across the Association. Team managers are appointed without proper control over appointment procedures, work practices and remuneration.Rules, where they exist, are not being enforced. middotRegrettably, the perception of the GAA at national and provincial levels has become that of a corporate elitist organization which has income generation and a focus on a small elite of its top players at the core of its activities. Thus % of the playing membership gets priority to the detriment of the remaining %. As a result, inter county activity gets priority over the needs of the vast majority of our playing members. middotThere is widespread concern right across the ranks of ordinary GAA members that, unless immediate remedial action is taken, the Associations alleged corporate and elitist policy priorities will lead it on a reckless path towards a semi -professional or professional structure that will destroy its community, cultural and amateur values. If left unchecked, this will remove our valued infrastructure of county and parish boundaries, together with control over the movement of players. In such circumstances pride of place will be replaced by price of place. The Club Players Association now respectfully calls on the Leadership of the GAA at national level to do whatever it takes to resolve these issues amicably before . It’s high time to end this impasse which is doing so much damage to our Association.We believe the only viable solution is as follows: OslashDraft a national games program by designating periods to club, inter county and third level. OslashOnce the designated periods are agreed, design competitions to fit within those time windows. OslashSuch structures should be set out in a manner that will ensure that there will be no conflict for players between the ious groups. OslashCreate a clear set of central control structures to include the enforcement of existing rules, creating new rules where needed and strictly applying appropriate sanctions for breaches. OslashPublish the proposed plan to all clubs so that they may decide on the outcome. OslashTo ensure a truly democratic result, authorize the holding of a national referendum of all clubs under which clubs will hold General Meetings to decide the outcome. There is a clear precedent in place for this process from , when, with the authority of Congress, such a referendum was held to consider the deletion or retention of the foreign games ban. OslashCall a Special Congress, remotenecessary, before the end of  so that any agreed change may be implemented in time for . We ask that Central Council should rule, as is its authority under rule . TO , that there is full representation. The very future of the GAA which we all love is at stake. We are pleading with the Associations leadership at national level to take whatever remedial steps are necessary and with the utmost of urgency. As elected leadersand or paid executives,our leaders have been given the responsibility to lead. Leadership in this instance means taking immediate and urgent steps that will Fix the Fixtures, give the Association back to its grassroots members and restore the GAA to being a community based Gaelic Games and culture organization with the club at its core. We are today calling on the leadership of the Association to give clarity to their members within the next two weeks on how they plan to resolve the crisis we have outlined above andthey are prepared to take on board our suggested solution. And finally we are here to assist the Association in any way, at any time, in any place and at our own expense.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Fortunately, a fire, believed to have spread to undergrowth after an attempt was made to set a speed restriction sign alight, did not develop into a large blaze.The volunteers who run the railway mdash who have launched an urgent appeal to raise pound, mdash are particularly concerned about an attempt to force open the main gates they discovered empty beer cans. First aid boxes at the station were also raided for bandages.Damage at the Loop  was discovered during a recent shunt to test rolling stock and carry out essential track maintenance, with the exercise taking place while visitors were banned from the railway due to lockdown restrictions.Railway officials have reported the incidents to police and have appealed to anyone who can assist officers with their enquiries to come forward.The recent incidents come after the coronavirus lockdown had a massive hit on the railwayrsquos finances.In an online post, officials appealed to young people to ldquoleavethem alone and stop trying to destroy the place, also asking parents do they know where their children are and what they are doing.The hard-working volunteers say they have enough on their plate without having to ldquosort out other peoplersquos mess, expressing concern about people walking along the railway lines which they are not allowed to do.Officials say the ldquostupidity of others is the reason why they hope the local community will support their fundraising appeal to help pay for better security as a bid for financial help from the Northern Ireland Executive proved unsuccessful.A recent bid for support from the Department of Communitiesrsquo Covid- Charities Fund to cover costs racked up to maintain the business which has been mothballed due to lockdown restrictions was unsuccessful.Officials fear that the railway will also miss out on securing a slice of a poundm fund for business start-ups and tourist attraction investment which was announced recently.Railway chairman Robert Gardiner recently wrote an open letter highlighting the railwayrsquos plight and its reluctance to ask for help in the current financial climate.He said coronavirus restrictions have had a ldquodevastating impact on the railwayrsquos operations and its restoration work.Mr Gardiner said the railway was likely to remain closed for the remainder of the year due to the restrictions around Covid-.He said that with no income for the rest of the year, the railway faced ldquomajor challenges.Mr Gardiner said given that the railwayrsquos final attempts at securing Covid- support funding from Stormont failed, it had reluctantly turned to its members and supporters to ask for help.He added: ldquoWe need to raise at least pound, this year just to keep the railway in a good condition and make some progress with essential projects.To date, the railwayrsquos appeal has raised pound,, with anyone interested in making a donation asked to visit www.facebook donate   or text RAIL plus the amount to  or visit www.downrail appeal.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd July 2020 Brexit ad.jpg","title":"Aarin’s lockdown farm project  ","story":"A DOWNPATRICK boy has been enjoying lsquoThe Good Lersquo during the Covid- lockdown.Twelve year-old Aarin Rea has spent the past four months developing a miniature farm, complete with chickens, ducks, doves and even peacocks, in the garden of his Knochnashinna home.Hersquos also growing fruit and vegetables in his allotment and specially built greenhouse, and hersquos also planted apple trees.His family and neighbours will soon be able to share in an abundance of potatoes, cabbages, lettuces, carrots, scallions, broad beans, tomatoes, strawberries and apples, as well as a supply of fresh eggs.Aarinrsquos mum, Karin, says the miniature farm has helped bring the community together during the isolation of lockdown and has lted everyonersquos spirits.ldquoItrsquos all everyone has been talking about lately, she said. ldquoThey are always enquiring as to how the farm is coming along and Aarin couldnrsquot be any prouder at whathe has achieved over the last few months.ldquoAarin has been eager to get out every day to his little farm while he has been off school. He spent the good weather tending and watering his fruit vegetables both in the allotment and in the greenhouse, which his father, Anthony, built for him.Aarin is the proud owner of peacock chicks, which were hatched thanks to a tip from his grandfather, Leslie Rea, who told him to put golf balls underneath the peacocks to encourage them to lay eggs.Aarin, has since given his poultry flock some pretty ingenious names, and he now considers his ducks, James Pond and Quacky Chan, among some of his best friends.Then there are his favourite hens, Henner Lopez, Princess Laya and Fluffy, who are very happy to the strutting around.The newest arrivals are two doves, Holy and Spirit, which are housed in a newly-built dovecote and a turkey chick.However, Aarinrsquos favourite animal is his beloved Jack Russell, Lottie.Aarinrsquos farming skills have come a long way since be began growing potatoes in tubs.ldquoI sell my duck eggs to elderly neighbours who adore their distinct flavour. Our next door neighbour, Tommy Armour, is always giving me little bits of advice to help bring the brood along. Recently, it seems to be turning out to more of a community effort to be honest, he said.ldquoAt the beginning of lockdown I missed all my friends, but the farm helped keep me busy.ldquoI wouldnrsquot be a great lover of completing schoolwork at home. I much prefer spending my time tending to my fruit and vegetables and caring for my new chicks.ldquoSometime my little sister, Grace, helps me. She is nine years old and is learning a lot more about farming than I ever thought she would.Aarin added: ldquoI thought the good weather during lockdown helped my vegetables grow.

That is absolutely essential.Campaigners added: ldquoThe historic underinvestment in the Ambulance Service has been widely known for years.

The winner then had to survive a stewardsrsquo enquiry.The duo followed up their success in the next race, the Randox Health Maiden Hurdle, when Soildels Hill put in a strong late run up the hill to win in smooth style over - shot Knot on Time and Memories Remain.With the duo not included in the following race, the third success of the day came in the second ide of theHandicap Hurdle.In this race Irsquom on Sap, owned and trained at Dromara by Neil McCluskey, set out to make the running under Eoin Walsh and still held the call at the final flight.But once Russell sent his mount Give Him Time into the lead, it was all over, the - shot beating the - favourite ldquoMiraculumand the long time leader, which stayed on for third.Despite these three wins, Elliottrsquos runner Curlew Hill, with top jockey Jamie Codd in the saddle, was an easy to back - favourite in the concluding Toals Dial-a-Bet bumper race.Always looking good, Curlew Hill won in good style over Patrick Mullins on ldquoRuaille Buaille with ldquoCrobally Boy back in third.Former champion flat jockey Joseph OrsquoBrien has been a great supporter of the local track since he set up as a trainer, and it was good to see him on the mark in the opening mares maiden hurdle when his charge, the - favourite, Etincelle Lioterie, ridden by his cousin JJ Slevin, won in good style from Rock me Robin, ridden by highly rated amateur Jordan Gainford, and Coosan Clover.There was a right old shock in the dayrsquos second race, the RandoxMaiden hurdle when the nine year-old Walkers Point emerged the winner.Always well placed under amateur Noel McParlan who sent his mount into pole position with two flights left to take the - shot, stayed on well to the post to beat the - favourite Ya Boy Yaand Felino De Bersy for the Elliott Russell combination.The winner is trained at Cabra by the jockeyrsquos father, Sean, and paid pound. on the tote. This is not the first big priced winner for the duo as they once won with a - shot across the water.This was not the only local winner of the day.

However, the claims have been firmly rejected by local people keen to see the controversial plan aborted.According to the tender documents, CIL wants to replace the existing beam with a more environmentally friendly LED light, maintaining that it can do this while retaining the traditional lens.And CIL says while mercury has been used to rotate large revolving Fresnel lenses since the s, with the system providing a near frictionless environment, it describes mercury as a ldquotoxic substance.While pointing to many years of reliable service, the organisation says there is increasing European and international legislation restricting the use, storage and transport of mercury.CIL maintains while it has no immediate statutory requirement to remove mercury from lighthouses, it has been its policy that where re-engineering capital projects are being carried out at lighthouses, ldquothe opportunity is taken to remove mercury.The organisation says with no other liquid medium available to replace mercury, alternative solutions are designed on a station by station basis to provide visual aid to navigation.CIL claims that trials on an alternative bearing at Tory Island lighthouse which started in  ensures the reliability of the bearing solution proposed for St Johnrsquos Point where it plans to retain the existing Fresnel lens which it recognises as important to the heritage of the station and local area.ldquoAs part of the engineering upgrade works, the mercury will be removed from existing optic installations and will be replaced by a mechanical bearing to provide an alternative rotation mechanism, states the tender documentation. ldquoOnly the liquid mercury will be removed and the remaining apparatus will be retained unchanged.ldquoIt is the intention to award the contracts for mercury removal at Rathlin East and Rathlin West lighthouses initially and appoint the successful tenderer for future removals.A spokeswoman for the Lecale Lightkeepers campaign group battling to retain the lighthouse in its current guise, suggested that local politicians will be ldquoperplexed that CIL has effectively ignored their wishes on the issue and the protection of the iconic sweeping beam.She said Newry, Mourne and Down Council unanimously decided to oppose any changes and was firmly standing alongside the local community on the issue.ldquoThe people and politicians are as one on this issue, the spokeswoman declared. ldquoSt Johnrsquos Point lighthouse is part of the arearsquos unique maritime history and heritage and must not be changed in any way.ldquoWhy is CIL issuing tender documentation when it has not told local politicians and indeed the people of Killough why it is proceeding without further discussion with them  Why is CIL ignoring the wishes of elected representatives She continued: ldquoWe have consistently asked for this beautul lighthouse to be simply left as it is. It is working perfectly andit isnrsquot broke, donrsquot fix it. We have consistently argued that the mercury issue is a red herring and nothing we have seen or heard has made us deviate from this position.ldquoSt Johnrsquos is one of the best ventilated lighthouses of its kind and we are opposed to any orce from the current Fresnel lens and its Burdel rotating mechanism.Campaigners say they hope that politicians will seek an urgent, virtual meeting with CIL to ask why their wishes have been ignored and why they were not formally told that the tendering process had begun.The campaign spokeswoman added: ldquoThe St Johnrsquos Point lighthouse boasts what is widely regarded as a rare bit of engineering excellence which we want retained and maintained. The iconic sweeping beam and rotation system must not be lost at the stroke of a pen and consigned to the pages of history.

Now things have changed signicantly and the hard work of many people, including local MPs, MLAs, councillors and roads officials have paid off, he said.ldquoThere have been many  dawns over the years but we are now at the stage that work could start within a year which is good news. It is a great pity that Vincent is not here to see this happening.For a number of years, Mr Casement and Mr Fullam were the sole flag-bearers for the bypass, ensuring that the project was firmly in the public eye.While the scheme was making slow progress, the regeneration officials refused to concede defeat and organised a number of meetings, inviting business representatives from across South Down. They recognised that the construction of the bypass was as crucially important for hauliers north of Ballynahinch as it was for those as far south as Kilkeel as their lorries were often caught up in traffic hold-ups on the main approaches to and from Ballynahinch.ldquoThe support for the bypass from all quarters was overwhelming, continued Mr Casement.ldquoI have lost count of the number of locally elected and direct rule ministers who came to Ballynahinch to learn more about the bypass. Confirmation that it is now tantalisingly close proves that you must never give up, just keep chipping away and stating your case.The former regeneration official also recalled a suggestion to construct the bypass and recoup the money spent on building it by charging drivers to use it.He said while there were some opposed to the idea, a number of leading hauliers were in favour as it would save them not only time, but fuel costs as lorries would not be sitting in traffic burning diesel.ldquoIt has been a long haul to get to this point and so many people have worked hard on this project. Successive isional roads managers were in favour of the bypass but there was never the money to work on its finer detail and move it to the shovel-ready stage, explained Mr Casement. ldquoThat position subsequently changed and the scheme has now reached a pivotal point.While the primary focus of the bypass is on easing traffic congestion, Mr Casement said the scheme brings with it a number of benefits.ldquoReducing tailbacks will help the environment and perhaps one of the most important aspects of the bypass is that will deter drivers from using a number of heavily populated housing areas as unofficial bypasses, including the Loughside, Carlisle Park and Langley Road areas, he continued.ldquoThe bypass can hopefully kick-start the economic regeneration of Ballynahinch town centre, encouraging new retailers and more shoppers. I believe that the current congestion can deter people who decide to shop where.Mr Casement said the proposed bypass can also benefit the wider South Down area as visitors from Belfast will be able to avoid Ballynahinch town centre.ldquoBallynahinch is regarded as the gateway to the Mournes and that position will be firmly cemented when the new link road opens. The scheme has never been this close in my letime and I hope that it wonrsquot be long before contractors are on the ground.ldquoBallynahinch residents and the townrsquos business community deserve this scheme. It is decades overdue and when it was confirmed recently that the project is well placed on the list of priority government schemes I was delighted.ldquoBut I was conscious that my good friend Vincent was not here to enjoy a moment that he had dedicated a large part of his le to achieving.With all eyes now on the Department for Infrastructure to confirm a bypass start date, Mr Casement hopes that it will be soon.ldquoIt has taken signicantly longer to reach this point than any of us ever imagined, but we have made it, added Mr Casement. ldquoThe icing on the cake will be confirmation of a start date and people are eagerly awaiting this announcement..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd July 2020 Brexit ad.jpg","title":"Newcastle Lions Club members celebrate 100 years’ service  ","story":"THREE members of Newcastle Lions Club have received longstanding service awards after clocking more than  years of service between them.Club president Marian McGreevy hosted a socially distanced event last Thursday to celebrate the hard-working lions.Some  years ago Michael Niblett and Peter May, along with a host of others in Newcastle, began the Newcastle Lions Club.

This particular facility could also be bulldozed as part of an ambitious redevelopment proposal.Newry, Mourne and Down Council is preparing to press head with investigative work at the prime Central Promenade location mdash including bore hole tests mdash to gather as much information as possible before it presses ahead with a multi-million pound investment.Council officials say that they recognise the need for modern leisure and community facilities at the site of the Newcastle Centre with several options on the table.They include a complete rebuild which include an extension to the existing centre, a complete refurbishment of the complex or partial rebuild and partial refurbishment.Retaining the Tropicana pool would restrict redevelopment proposals and the outdoor facility is most likely to be demolished, with enhanced car parking also set to be a key plank of any new proposal, in tandem with signicant disabled access improvements.A detailed feasibility study looked at a number of potential locations for a new leisure and community facility in the resort, with the Newcastle Centre site emerging as the firm favourite to house the new facility.Council officials say they are looking at a number of possibilities and that ldquoall options for the redevelopment of the town centre site are on the table.The existing Newcastle Centre forms part of the historic Annesley Buildings which enjoys protected status, but itrsquos believed that the cost of redeveloping the property and replacing the old extension at the rear would be signicant.It is also believed that an added problem facing the council is that the size of the existing centrersquos rooms are too small and unsuitable for modern needs. One possibility is that the facade of the current building would be retained, with a new-build at the rear.Council officials say that any plan to redevelop the Central Promenade site will not impact on any part of the promenade at the rear of the building.They insist that they are committed to the Newcastle project and recognise that it has a key role to play, meeting the needs of local people and visitors alike, particularly during inclement weather.It has also been confirmed that local people are to be asked for their views on redeveloping the site as part of a pre-planning application process, to come up with a favourable design.Senior council officials say that they recognise that as one of Northern Irelandrsquos premier tourist resorts, Newcastle does not have a modern indoor facility which has been its Achilles heel for some considerable time.Two sites were previously identied for a new leisure centre in the resort, with sports pitches at Donard Park the preferred option.However, councillors subsequently switched attention to the former St. Maryrsquos Girlsrsquo Primary School campus at Shanslieve Drive. Despite a number of attempts to secure the site and hopes that a deal could be agreed with local church officials, it was bought by supermarket giant Lidl.Politicians are keen for Newry, Mourne and Down Council to take the lead and ensure that a high class leisure community facility, which has been talked about in the resort for decades, is finally delivered.They insist that the provision of modern accommodation in the heart of Newcastle is long overdue and that the lsquoonce in a generationrsquo opportunity to deliver a modern, indoor facility must not be squandered.Some politicians say it is also critical to maximise every available square inch of space at the site to deliver a high quality centre..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/11432315.jpg","title":"news","story":"As a subscriber, you are shown % lessThose ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local servicesThese adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

I fully understand, and support the need for language ersity.”Complaints have been made about the post to the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards by Conradh na Gaeilge, an advocacy group for Irish language speakers, and a -year-old boy.Conradh na Gaeilge alleged the post is a breach of the House of Commons code of conduct, saying it was “offensive and insulting in nature to those who speak the Irish language”.In a complaint letter shared on Twitter, Adam Mac Giolla Easbuic, who attends an Irish Medium School in Dungiven – within Mr Campbell’s constituency – requested the commissioner investigates “racist undertones to both Germans and Irish speakers”.He wrote: “I find Mr Campbell’s comments extremely offensive and disrespectful.“It is clear that he learned nothing during the Acht na Gaeilge campaign for an Irish Language Act that me and all my friends took part in.“I don’t think his comments are suitable for an MP to make.“Thank you for taking the time to read my complaint.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityCross Common bridge in Dinas Powys was closed off to drivers in February , after a new access road was built and the safety of the old bridge was questioned.The council abandoned the bridge and put up red and white plastic barriers to stop traffic driving over it.In August last year, the council promised to begin the work to remove the bridge that October mdash after delays in finding a specialist contractor.Now, with the bridge still there a year later, Plaid Cymru community councillors are demanding the council act, and either remove the bridge or turn it into a footpath and clear the debris and plastic barriers.Cllr Chris Franks said: ldquoFor three years, the Vale has said this bridge has got to go. If theyrsquore going to do it, theyrsquove got to get on with it. These ugly barriers are so frustrating, and thousands of people see it.ldquoThey did some excavations and just left the spoil heap. Itrsquos a vast improvement now, but even cleaned up itrsquos still a mess.Jean Webber, who lives nearby on Llwyn Derwen, said she has witnessed a lot of fly-tippers dumping rubbish at the bridge, like fridges, freezers and buildersrsquo rubbish. She said: ldquoI think this end of Dinas has been forgotten. [The council] seems to concentrate on the other end.ldquoI walk past here every day. It wouldnrsquot be so badthey just walled it off. I never complain, but this is just appalling.The council has now promised work will begin to remove the bridge next month, and blamed coronavirus for the most recent delay. The new timetable is to finish the job by this October.A Vale of Glamorgan council spokesperson said: ldquoUnfortunately, the contractor originally appointed to remove the bridge withdrew from the project after agreement couldnrsquot be reached on a claim for additional costs due to the coronavirus pandemic.ldquoThat meant a new contractor had to be found, a process that added to the delay caused by the pandemic itself, which for a period prevented work of this type being carried out.ldquoThe council has now successfully appointed a new contractor and received an indication that work is expected to start in mid-August. It is anticipated the work will be completed by the end of October.But both Cllr Franks and Ms Webber raised doubts about the new timetable. Cllr Franks said: ldquoWe are always told it will start in six to eight weeks. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

With that in mind, it is in everyonersquos interests that the Esplanade remains a safe, family friendly place for everyone to enjoy.ldquoI will soon discuss with my Cabinet colleagues the possibility of introducing a Public Space Protection Order at the Esplanade making it illegal to consume alcohol in public areas.ldquoIn the meantime, Council officers will be carrying out regular checks around this location to make sure alcohol sales comply with the terms of inidual licences and are not contributing to poor behaviour. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a commentOrder byOldest firstNewest firstHighest scoredLowest scoredLoading comments...
