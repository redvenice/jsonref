This photograph was taken by Gijsbert Hanekroot, the Netherlands\u0027 premier rock photographer at the time, who said that Bowie was his favourite musician to work with. On one occasion in 1971, Hankeroot told of how he bumped into Bowie in a canteen while he was working on lyrics for Ziggy Stardust and asked his opinion on one of the lines          Bob Dylan photographed at Madison Square Garden in New York, 1974. Hankeroot managed to inset himself in the midst of a heady time in both music and culture, living the rockstar lifestyle by proxy as he flew all over the world to photograph its biggest stars. \u0027We saw The Eagles in London, Paul McCartney in south of France, Bob Dylan in New York and the Stones in Hamburg. We visited London every two months. It was the most natural thing in the world,\u0027 he said          John Lennon and Yoko Ono photographed in Selfridges on Oxford Street in 1971. Hankeroot was best-known for working in low-light settings, such as concert halls and music venues, so this is one of his rarer daylight shots. He used darkroom techniques that lent a grainy texture to the pictures he took, which is particularly visible on the faces of his subjects          Keith Richards, of the Rolling Stones, smoke a cigarette somewhere in Belgium, 1976. Hankeroot was recognised for his talent in his own time, working for Dutch magazine Oort, but he left the field of music photography in the 80s and his work has gone ingored. But he is now opening a new show in Hong Kong to display a retrospective of his works          Lou Reed lights a cigarette in Amsterdam, 1972. Hankeroot liked to spend as much time as possible with his subjects, staying the full length of their set if they were playing, or \u0027until the subject was bored of me\u0027, if they were in a studio. \u0027That\u0027s the moment that he or she would stop acting or posing, those often became the best pictures,\u0027 he said  Neil Young slumps on a sofa in his hotel  in Copenhagen, Denmark, in 1976 (left) while Patti Smith poses during a photo shoot in Amsterdam, exact date unknown (right). Hankeroot tried to embody the same spirit of reinvention and innovation that the musicians put into their songs in his photography, searching for new way to capture and define the seminal decade in art          Leonard Cohen, photographed on a cobbled street among pigeons, somewhere in Amsterdam in 1974.  Hankeroot was deeply embedded in the musical culture of the 1970s, by the time the following decade rolled around he decided to pursue \u0027other adventures\u0027, and now works mostly as a street photographer and documentary-maker          Frank Zappa photographed in Amsterdam in 1972. Though Hankeroot was born in Brussels, in neighbouring Belgium, he grew up in the Netherlands where he was given his first camera aged 13. At 16 he dropped out of school to pursue photography full-time and got an internship with Philip Mechanicus, where he learned to take portraits          Bryan Ferry at the Amstel Hotel in Amsterdam, 1976. At the time, Ferry had just released Let\u0027s Stick Together, his first solo album since Roxy Music disbanded for the first time earlier the same year. He would release In Your Mind the following year and The Bride Stripped Bare the year after that before Roxy Music reformed          Photographers crowd around Mick Jagger, who is behind the camera in the shot, as they try to get a picture of him in Hamburg, Germany, in 1970          Hankeroot began digitising his archives years ago which led to the publication of Abba...

Shepherd smiled for the camera today. Ignoring the jury\u0027s verdict that he was responsible for the safety of the boat and those on board, he said: \u0027It\u0027s very upsetting to read these lies in the newspaper\u0027Last night Charlotte Brown\u0027s family condemned her killer after he blamed her for the tragedy – and then accused her grieving father of waging a vendetta against him.Shepherd complained of feeling \u0027upset\u0027 at reading about himself in the Daily Mail and suggested it was his victim\u0027s own fault that she died because she was driving the speedboat.Ignoring the jury\u0027s verdict that he – as master of the defective boat – was responsible for its safety, Shepherd declared: \u0027It\u0027s very upsetting to read these lies in the newspaper.\u0027\u0027Unbelievable arrogance!\u0027: Sister\u0027s fury as smiling speed...PICTURE EXCLUSIVE: Swaggering in cuffs, the shameless...\u0027Yeah it made me cry\u0027: Charlotte Brown\u0027s emotional father...Share this articleLast night Miss Brown\u0027s father, Graham, 55, said: \u0027I\u0027ve always thought Jack Shepherd has acted in very crass, reckless manner – and seeing him on screen now has just confirmed it.\u0027He\u0027s a man who can\u0027t accept responsibility for anything. He certainly shows no remorse.\u0027Miss Brown\u0027s sister Katie told the BBC: \u0027I feel very surprised at how smug he looks to be honest. It just shows a very arrogant man.\u0027I don\u0027t understand how someone can go on the run for two crimes and be found guilty and still then just walk straight in with a very smug look on his face and claim innocence. It\u0027s unbelievable.\u0027Someone who\u0027s run away from this doesn\u0027t scream an innocent man\u0027s actions to me. Why did he run away if he\u0027s claiming innocence?\u0027Shepherd said he said he had chosen \u0027wonderful\u0027 Georgia to flee to because \u0027it was affordable, had generous visa regime and mountains, sea, and it was a country I\u0027d always wanted to visit and I think the culture is very wonderful\u0027.             Charlotte Brown, who died aged 24, on a date on a speedboat with Jack Shepherd on the Thames in 2015Revealing how closely he has been following the Mail\u0027s campaign, he said: \u0027The father met with the Home Secretary in the UK and this is testament to the fact he has some kind of leverage within the system.\u0027It\u0027s also why there has been so much press coverage in the UK. I\u0027ve only spoken to him once but he took the opportunity to tell me I would have a very bad time in prison.\u0027I said, \u0027I\u0027m so sorry Graham\u0027 but he didn\u0027t want to hear it and hung up. I feel at risk from him and his power in the prison system, and that\u0027s the reason I ran away. I blamed myself at the time and said I was very drunk and driving too fast, but an assessment of the facts shows we were actually going below the speed limit. I\u0027m very, very frightened about what might happen, but it seemed like this is the right thing to do. I hope justice will prevail and my appeal will be successful.\u0027At his home in Sidcup, Kent, Mr Brown thanked the Daily Mail for its help in offering a £25,000 reward to catch his daughter\u0027s killer. He said: \u0027It made me cry. That was my emotion. It\u0027s been a long journey. Relieved is a better word – it\u0027s difficult to say I\u0027m delighted when I\u0027ve lost a daughter.\u0027Hopefully Shepherd will come back voluntarily and won\u0027t put any legal obstacles in the way. If he does, more fool him.\u0027Shepherd is acting the victim – he certainly claims he\u0027s an innocent man. But the jury didn\u0027t find him so. If he was so sure of his innocence he should have stayed and faced his trial.\u0027 Mr Brown added: \u0027Not one member of his family has sent any condolences or any expression of remorse.\u0027Additional reporting: Neil SearsAuthorities seek \u0027swift\u0027 extradition of fugitive killer Jack Shepherd after surrender in Georgia - ITV News"},{"url":null,"title":"Sainsburys recalls vegan Freefrom garlic bread traces cheese food","story":"Deliciously Free From Garlic Pizza Bread is being removed from shelves at hundreds of Sainsbury\u0027s stores round Britain because it is too cheesy and could kill peopleThe supermarket have apologised for any inconvenience this may have caused.A spokesman for Sainsbury\u0027s said: \u0027Our supplier has robust processes in place to prevent incidents like this and we\u0027re urgently investigating what went wrong to prevent this from happening again\u0027 added the store.\u0027We are recalling Sainsbury\u0027s Deliciously Free From Garlic Pizza Bread with the use by date 27th January.

Did I sense any regret about the situation he’d left behind? Not really’ This picture has actually lost me a few jobs. Plus I think I might even have lost a flat because of it. I was looking at a property and was chatting to the estate agent and told them that I’d recently shot David Cameron. We put an offer in – for the asking price – but it was turned down. So yes, I do suspect people don’t like David Cameron.But when you shoot someone like Cameron, though, you have to remain neutral. If you turn up thinking too many things then you’ll inevitably forget something, or position the lighting wrong, and the subject will get irritated. You have to go in with clarity. Whether you’re a former prime minister or a bus driver, I’ll always have the same clarity of thought.The photograph came about as part of a project I was working on, aiming to capture interesting faces in the style of artists such as Holbein and Caravaggio. It took place in Cameron’s office, almost exactly one year after his resignation. My degree is in medieval history, and so shooting people who are part of our history like this gives me an excuse to touch history.He arrived in his gym clothing, which was rather funny, and he was worried he looked a bit pasty. I explained my ideas, and about how I wanted to capture this sort of meditative statesman feeling. I wanted a sense of looking backwards at the current political situation.I was worried that Cameron might be a difficult person to photograph, but as a sitter he proved to be a darling. He had a lot of patience. You have to separate politics from the person, and he was a charming chap.I knew the public would be wondering, what is he thinking? That’s why I wanted him in this pose, shot in profile. There are no other pictures of Cameron like this – the others normally capture the signature “call me Dave” look. But now he’s not in power he can afford to show more emotion and try different poses.I do think the contemplation was genuine. I’ve worked with a lot of actors in Los Angeles so I know what faking it looks like. I’ve also worked with many politicians, both Conservative and Labour, and when I ask for a certain look, some of them can turn around instantly with that expression. But David seemed to me a genuine guy, a family man, who had a real sense of the seriousness of office. Did I sense any regret about the situation he’d left behind? Not really.However, I never mentioned the B-word during the half hour we had for the sitting. I decided that wouldn’t have been a good idea. But he seemed very happy to talk about other things throughout his career. He told me that the most interesting place he’d visited was Libya after Gaddafi.I was inspired by Sir James Guthrie, the realist painter who depicted a lot of politicians straight after the first world war. They’d experienced all that horror and history, and he captured that moment. Backdrops are important for me. Guthrie painted in a muddy brown, suggestive of the trenches. I went with a fading blue backdrop. You can interpret that as the European flag fading away, or simply as the blue of Conservatism.I’m a realist photographer so I like to capture everything – the grey hairs, blotchy skin, all the details and lines. I want to say – this was the true image of David Cameron at this moment in history.He’s not the first leader I’ve photographed – I did John Major back in 2017 for another project. When I went to shoot him there was a sense of betrayal there. It was in his mouth, in his breath. But with David there was not that sense. He was energetic, almost raring to go. There was a restlessness I could really sense. I think he wants to return after this Brexit situation is resolved. I think he’ll be back.Born: Chester, 1982.Training: King’s College London.Influences: Caravaggio, Titian, Ribera, HolbeinHigh point: ‘Sir Patrick Stewart portrait sitting, New York.’Low point: ‘Not picking up a camera after I graduated.’Top tip: ‘Direction, direction, direction: break the ice with your subjects.’"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fef2be16a940717adb202348700087c0d14f9519/0_1087_2288_1372/master/2288.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b12d461e3b38a817335f85a62c5e3868","title":"john ruskin the power of seeing review critic social reformer two temple place","story":"Two Temple Place, London The influential critic, social reformer and troubled genius profoundly changed British culture. In his 200th anniversary year, can this exhibition help us see him clearly? Art critic, geologist, botanist, Alpinist, architectural theorist and social reformer – maybe even revolutionary – John Ruskin gazes with troubled intensity from a watercolour portrait that dates from when he was on the verge of losing his mind. Half his face is in shadow, the other in mountain sunlight. His blue-green eyes stare almost too intently. There’s something wrong behind them. The following year, over Christmas 1876 in his beloved Venice, Ruskin would start to hallucinate. Breakdowns would follow and he eventually withdrew from the world, cared for at home on a healthy inheritance from his wine merchant father, until his death in 1900.Ruskin’s manic portrait, attributed to Charles Fairfax Murray but quite possibly the critic’s own work, fits well into the late-Victorian interior of Two Temple Place, laden with rich wooden carvings, panelling and stained glass. Or does it? It’s safe to say its architect was influenced by Ruskin’s gothic vision of architecture. Yet it’s an equally safe guess that Ruskin would have loathed it, for this neo-Tudor fantasy was created for the American millionaire William Waldorf Astor. In his book The Stones of Venice, the bible of the gothic revival, Ruskin denounces the very opulence and selfishness this building represents. Medieval gothic, for him, is an art of communal togetherness, created by a morally superior age that respected honest work and condemned capitalist usury.And there, in a nutshell, is the reason for today’s Ruskin revival. In the late 20th century, Ruskin was considered a bit of a joke. Even now, his name for many people evokes a sexually repressed Victorian oddball. Even the curators of this loving homage can’t resist telling us how working-class audiences laughed at his “megaphone” lecturing voice and quirky bird imitations. Yet as the deepest crisis of capitalism since the 1930s drags on and Victorian critics of the cash nexus, from Karl Marx to William Morris, are taken seriously once more, Ruskin’s social radicalism looks urgent again. He was ahead of them all. In 1860, he horrified readers of the Cornhill magazine with a series of articles that denounced free-market economics. The myth of a grasping homo economicus, he argued, is a fundamental misconception of human nature. Marx’s Das Kapital would not appear until seven years later.At the heart of this celebration of Ruskin’s 200th anniversary – he was born in 1819, the same year as Queen Victoria – is a telling story of his generous, ardent spirit. In 1875, Ruskin created a museum for the people of Sheffield. The north remembers: this show has been created by Sheffield’s museums together with the Ruskinian Guild of St George. Art, Ruskin believed, was for everyone. And everyone needs it. The industrial working class deserved not just bread but beauty. The most beautiful thing in this exhibition, however, is not a work of art. It’s the collection of minerals Ruskin presented to his people’s museum. These gorgeous rocks set this exhibition alight with their strong colours and brilliant crystal facets: purple amethyst, snow-white quartz, bubbling haematite.He created his little museum in a former cottage in Walkley, between Sheffield and its surrounding countryside, to draw working folk out of the smoky town to explore nature. For Ruskin, the natural world was sacred. To be in it was to be enraptured, transformed, redeemed. His responses to the natural are on display in his drawings and watercolours of glaciers and mossy riverbanks, wildflowers and a bright blue peacock feather. His eye for nature can be enthralling, especially when he homes in on strange gothic patterns and textures. His Study of Moss, Fern and Wood-Sorrel, Upon a Rocky River Bank is a mesmerising portrayal of green life entwined in the ancient scars and turbulent strata of a steep rocky mass.Here is another way Ruskin suddenly looks contemporary again. There are new images of nature among the Victorian drawings, including a chilling digital analysis of the changing forms of Alpine glaciers by Dan Holdsworth. Ruskin knew nothing of global warming, but his passionate belief in the preciousness of nature comes through in his awestruck Turneresque watercolour of Vevey in the Alps, with its sapphire, immemorial mountains.What the show can’t fully reveal, because it is hidden by the precision of his drawings, is the tragedy of Ruskin’s passion for nature. Brought up as an evangelical Christian, shaped by the glories of art and nature he saw on childhood trips in Europe, his vocation as a young man was to teach his contemporaries to see the inely created beauty of the world. “I have to prove to them ... that the truth of nature is part of the truth of God,” he wrote. As those lovely rocks in this exhibition show, geology was at the heart of his theocratic scientific vision. Yet geology in the 19th century was the very science that was demolishing god, fossil by fossil. By 1851, he could hear the geologists’ hammers chipping away his faith: “…those dreadful Hammers! I hear the clink of them at the end of every cadence of the Bible verses.”Ruskin’s scientific honesty devastated his Christian belief and that may have helped to destroy his reason. His calm drawings disguise a turbulence that was tearing him apart. His socialism, too, emerged in the later part of his life. In the Victorian hymn All Things Bright and Beautiful, the social order is seen as inely appointed.

In her journal in 1832, Victoria mentions “my own little bed which travels always with me”.After decades in a private collection, it will return to a royal setting as a centrepiece of the exhibition Victoria: A Royal Childhood, to open at Kensington Palace on the 200th anniversary of Victoria’s birth on 24 May.HRP, which successfully bid £4,250 for the bed at Henry Aldridge \u0026amp Son auctioneers in Devizes, Wiltshire, said it was an important new acquisition. “We are delighted to have acquired Princess (later Queen) Victoria’s travelling bed, used by the young princess during childhood holidays.“It is a very important and unusual personal relic of the young Queen Victoria’s life, which illuminates her unique royal upbringing under the direction of her mother and Sir John Conroy, the domineering master of her household.”Auctioneer Andrew Aldridge described it as a “heavy and sturdy” item. “It wasn’t exactly travelling light to take this bed on her travels, but then, she wouldn’t have been the one who had to carry it, or put it together or take it apart,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5db7d3c5eab855f127b143508de873833b882b8f/0_0_2255_2550/master/2255.jpg?width=1010\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=741bb76ba1c6ab79279107a9f79cd0a6 2020w","title":"el james returns with passionate new romance the mister","story":"Fifty Shades of Grey author promises a Cinderella story for the 21st centuryEL James, whose controversial erotic bestseller Fifty Shades of Grey explored the disturbing relationship between a student and a businessman, has written her first novel looking beyond the desires of Christian Grey: the “thrilling and sensuous” The Mister.Out on 16 April, and moving between London, Cornwall and the Balkans, The Mister will delve into the attraction which forms between the “privileged and aristocratic” young Englishman Maxim Trevelyan, and the “mysterious, talented and beautiful” Alessia Demachi, a woman who has arrived in London “owning little more than a dangerous and troublesome past”, said publisher Arrow.James’ Fifty Shades series – three books from the perspective of Anastasia Steele, as she is inducted into businessman Christian Grey’s BDSM fantasies, and two from Grey’s – has sold 150m copies around the world, bringing erotica into the mainstream, sparking controversy and unleashing a host of imitations.Although the publisher would not confirm whether The Mister also classifies as erotic fiction, the description provided to booksellers called it “a rollercoaster ride of danger and desire that leaves the reader breathless to the very last page”, and the author herself described it as a “passionate new romance” and a “Cinderella story for the 21st century”.James said: “Maxim and Alessia have led me on a fascinating journey and I hope that my readers will be swept away by their thrilling and sensual tale, just as I was while writing, and that, like me, they fall in love with them.” Her editor Selina Walker, publisher at Arrow, called James an exceptional storyteller and said the new book was “a unique and very special novel - passionate, romantic and full of suspense”.James’s new hero Maxim inherits his family’s noble title after a tragedy. “It’s a role he’s not prepared for and one that he struggles to face,” said Arrow. “But his biggest challenge is fighting his desire for an unexpected, enigmatic young woman who’s recently arrived in England, possessing little more than a dangerous and troublesome past. Reticent, beautiful, and musically gifted, she’s an alluring mystery, and Maxim’s longing for her deepens into a passion that he’s never experienced and dares not name.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2ead1d6402c2c9a2f09172b58fdcb7e44dce780a/0_291_4368_2621/master/4368.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2310d79c97a4ee229f98f394324b22bd","title":"did you work for a uk high street chain that has closed","story":"For an upcoming project, we would like to hear from former workers of chain shops that shut about how it affected their livesWith thousands of high street shops closing over the last decade, communities have been rightly concerned about the decline and what the future holds.If you worked for a high street chain that shut down, we’d like to hear from you.

For participants it is a festival of networking. Getting an invitation is a sign you have made it – and\u0026nbspthe elaborate system of badges\u0026nbspreveals your place in the Davos hierarchy.For critics, “Davos man” is shorthand for the globe-trotting elite, disconnected from their home countries after spending too much time in the club-class lounge. Others just wonder if it is all\u0026nbspa big waste of time.Who is there?More than 2,500 people – business leaders, world leaders, diplomats and the odd celebrity, such as Matt Damon – will fly in for the 49th annual Davos meeting. Most delegates are men, and although the forum boasts delegates from more than 100 countries, most hail from western\u0026nbspEurope, followed by the US. Sir David Attenborough is one of the most notable attendees in 2019, while Donald Trump, Theresa May and Emmanuel Macron all pulled out at short notice to focus on more pressing issues at home.The chancellor is one of several senior members of Theresa May’s government who have become increasingly concerned about the risks of a no-deal Brexit.The business minister Richard Harrington said on Thursday that he was even prepared to be sacked, after welcoming comments from the Airbus chief executive criticising the government’s handling of Brexit.“I was delighted to read Airbus’s comments this morning because it is telling it like it is,” Harrington said, adding that a no-deal Brexit would be “a total disaster for the economy”.Meanwhile, the work and pensions secretary, Amber Rudd, renewed her demand for Conservative MPs to be given a free vote on Tuesday – when MPs will consider amendments to the government’s Brexit motion – so that she could back an extension to article 50.Rudd said that over the next few days she was “going to stick to trying to persuade the government to allow it to be a free vote. There is a lot taking place and there are a lot of new amendments. We’ll have to wait and see.”After last week’s crushing parliamentary defeat for May’s Brexit plan, Hammond and the business secretary, Greg Clark, had reassured business leaders that Britain would not leave the EU on 29 March with no deal.But the chancellor said businesses had to accept that free movement was coming to an end and urged companies to rethink business models based on cheap, low-skilled labour.The CBI and other employer organisations have expressed concern at some of the proposals contained in the government’s immigration white paper, particularly the idea of strict curbs on entry for people in jobs paying less than £30,000 a year.Hammond urged the business leaders to engage with the government’s consultation on the white paper, hinting that ministers were open to reducing the £30,000 cap. “Free movement is ending. The detail of what is to replace it has yet to be decided. Business has to seize the opportunity to engage with the process and come up with constructive, consistent and evidence-based solutions.”The chancellor said businesses had to come up with creative ways of ensuring they had access to people with intermediate skills but would also have to help change Britain’s economic model so it was less dependent on cheap labour.He said the economy was in good shape, pointing to record employment and growth forecasts that were “perfectly respectable” provided there was an EU deal.“The only credible and sustainable solution is to leave the EU, to honour the referendum decision, but to do so in a way that allows us to deliver the future prosperity voters were promised when they voted to leave the EU. The only way forward is a negotiated settlement,” he said.Asked about the comments of Harrington and the chancellor, May’s spokeswoman said the cabinet was “working very closely with the PM on delivering a deal which works for the British economy and for employees”.Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, told a separate Davos event that business was not ready for a no-deal Brexit. “There are a series of logistical issues that need to be solved and it’s quite transparent that in many cases they’re not,” he said.Border infrastructure was not ready for the possibility of “jumping from an absolutely seamless trading environment to one with frictions that aren’t just tariffs but are rules of origin on products, safety standards on products and other actions that need to be done”, he said.Referring to cross-border supply chains and the companies that rely on parts reaching them just in time for production, Carney stressed that “minutes matter in this world”.Business leaders meeting in Davos have said they were implementing no-deal Brexit plans, but Carney said: “There is a limited amount that many businesses can do to prepare if there are going to be substantial delays on the logistical side. These eventually will be worked out over time, but you can’t build up the inventories.”Meanwhile, union leaders who met with May were critical of her stance. The TUC general secretary, Frances O’Grady, said she had not received the guarantees she was seeking that there would not be a no-deal Brexit, and added: “I was looking for guarantees on workers’ rights now and into the future.“We have a prime minister on a temporary contract. She cannot bind the hands of a future prime minister.”Tim Roache, general secretary of the GMB union, said: “I’m afraid to say the prime minister failed to give us the guarantees we need over protecting jobs and rights at work.“As this crisis worsens, pretending nothing has changed is simply not good enough.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e05e8ee36fbee4166f1eb7d5734475ae3c35ef0e/0_142_4272_2563/master/4272.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9766ecdb959568ca654857e07b1ae9de","title":"zombie clunkers has your local bus been resurrected in guatemala","story":"Phased out vehicles often end up back in use in developing countries – a form of dumping with serious environmental consequencesIn a sparsely furnished office overlooking dozens of buses at the Zone 21 depot in Guatemala City, Jorge Castro flips through photographs on his mobile phone. He settles on one.“There’s the bus when I bought it in Maryland,” he says proudly. It is a blue and white bus emblazoned with the words “Ride On”, the name of Montgomery County’s public transit system.The same bus is now parked outside with a new paint job that reads “Transurbano”, the name of Guatemala City’s bus network. Castro’s job is to buy and refurbish used buses for the city’s bus lines. He bought the bus outside and seven others in 2017 last year from Maryland’s public fleet after they were phased out. He drove them to a New Jersey port and loaded them on a cargo ship bound for Guatemala. He also bought another dozen in Houston, Texas, which he drove south through Mexico, a three-day journey.In a little-known form of environmental dumping, your city’s used bus or your old car might have a new life in a developing country. It is a pattern that plays out all over the world. Many of the buses that crowd Guatemala City’s streets came from the US. Sri Lanka imports used cars from Japan. A 20-year-old German car might end up on Lagos’s crowded roads. In developing countries with no domestic vehicle manufacturing and only limited controls on emissions, vehicles can continue operating for years beyond what is considered their useful lifetime in their countries of origin.Trade in used vehicles is a challenge for both exporting and importing countries. There are no uniform emissions standards worldwide, so low-income countries end up bearing the brunt of air pollution from inefficient used vehicles. Of the 2bn vehicles operating worldwide, an estimated 40m reach end-of-life every year, according to a July report from the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) in New Delhi, and large numbers of these are traded to low-income countries.“The global community which has, time and again, expressed its deep concern about the deteriorating air quality in the southern world, cannot look away from this problem of dumping any more,” said Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director of research and advocacy at the CSE.The CSE report also found that exports of used vehicles to Africa and South Asia were contributing to dangerous air pollution, and points out that there are no uniform criteria to determine when a used vehicle becomes so unfit it should be barred from export.Zone 21 in Guatemala City is one of the city’s roughest areas, though inside the bus depot it is quiet, with only the occasional buzz of machinery. Transurbano is part of the city’s efforts to modernise its largely unregulated bus fleet. For years, residents have relied on “red buses”: old American school buses painted bright red that are privately owned and largely unregulated. Drivers of red buses collect cash fares onboard and change their routes at will. Gangs have targeted red buses for extortion payments in recent years because drivers carry large amounts of cash, sometimes even killing drivers who don’t pay up.As a result, their owners often struggle to break even buying new buses is out of the question.In contrast, private companies receive permits to operate Transurbano buses, and the new system includes prepaid fares, designated bus stations and established routes.In an effort to modernise Guatemala City’s buses, operators like Castro must “trade out” a red bus for every Transurbano bus they put into the system. But that doesn’t mean the Transurbano buses are new. Originally, the city planned to buy over 3,000 new buses manufactured in Brazil. However, ultimately only 445 Brazilian buses were purchased and authorities subsidised bus operators to purchase their own buses – such as those from Maryland – to fill out the fleet.Outside Guatemala City, antiquated buses are the only public transportation option. Known as “extra-urbans”, these former American school buses are painted bright colours and travel between cities like Quetzaltenango, Antigua, and Chimaltenango. The narrow streets of Ciudad Vieja, an hour outside Guatemala City, are lined with automotive workshops that specialise in refurbishing buses for intercity routes.The intercity buses may be ornamented with chrome and elaborate custom paint jobs, but under the surface they are clunkers. Antonio Estrada, a mechanic, says his workshop recently repainted a 1989 model bus that will go on to transport dozens of people on hazardous rural roads.Imported used vehicles are frequently modified, making safety features useless. In Guatemala, modifications to the engines, brakes and seating are a few potential safety hazards.“We change the motors because all the bus lines compete for passengers,” says Estrada. “Whoever has the fastest bus gets the riders.”Far from addressing the dangers of exporting clunkers, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) under the Trump administration hopes to freeze fuel efficiency standards at 2020 levels. Several states have said they will sue to block the measure.The EPA offers cash incentives to scrap diesel buses, but there is still a steady flow of vehicles heading south over the Mexico border, destined primarily for Central America.Jamie Cooke, the fleet manager for Montgomery County, Maryland, oversees 3,800 vehicles, including 380 Ride On buses. Montgomery is trying to make its working fleet more sustainable the county is in the process of transitioning its fleet from diesel to compressed natural gas (CGN) and electric vehicles (EV). Buses are phased out after 12 years, or 500,000 miles, per federal regulations. On average, the county phases out 31 buses a year, and according to Cooke, most are sold, not scrapped. “If there’s more value in selling, we’ll sell it. If there’s more value in scrapping it, we scrap it,” says Cooke. “It’s a business decision.” Vehicles are bought from the county by “GovDeals”, an auction site that sells former state and federal property – everything from buses to office supplies –\u0026nbspto eager bidders all over the world.The CSE report makes many recommendations for both importing and exporting countries, including harmonising emission standards and fuel quality at the minimum level of Euro IV – which stipulates a maximum of 50 ppm of sulphur in diesel fuel for most vehicles – as well as age-caps and increased taxes on used vehicles. But even with tighter restrictions on used vehicle imports, demand for personal vehicles is on the rise in the developing world. In Mozambique, officials introduced a law in 2007 to discourage importing clunkers, but it was abandoned after public protests.At the automotive shop in Ciudad Vieja, Pablo Ramos, who owns a bus line operating between Quetzaltenango and Guatemala City, is waiting for the mechanics to finish working on one of his buses.“Guatemalans don’t have good enough jobs to buy a nice car from a dealership,” he says. “There just isn’t the money.”In the meantime, these clunkers will have to do.This reporting was supported by the International Women’s Media Foundation as part of its Adelante Latin American Reporting InitiativeFollow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/25b57e8cd00fb02f63be6a3e0bec18ffb08bf82c/0_290_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=26cbd4d6e3fa3da6a4491c9f6e141944","title":"clooney and prendergast were not silent on sudan were going after the regimes loot","story":"We’ve learned that working behind the scenes achieves more than naming and shaming “Where are George Clooney and co now that Sudan needs them?” asked an Opinion article in the  this week. The oped assumed that a lack of public statements by us and others with a long association with Darfur, Sudan more broadly, and South Sudan meant that we were doing nothing in response to the Sudanese regime’s brutal crackdown of escalating protests throughout the country.This is indeed a critical moment in Sudan’s fraught history. The people of Sudan are rightly leading demands for change, and we believe our role is to support the cause of human rights for Sudanese people by using strategic and tactical advocacy in Europe, the US, and Africa focused on key points of leverage. As the demonstrations have unfolded this past month, our entire team has continuously engaged officials in governments around the world to take measures to hold the Bashir regime accountable. Much of this advocacy is not done in public.To support Sudanese efforts for change we have been working assiduously behind the scenes to suspend the US government’s process for removing President Omar al-Bashir’s regime from its state sponsors of terrorism list. Such a move would lift remaining sanctions and make the Sudanese government eligible for massive debt relief one of the few points of leverage the international community has over the Khartoum regime.We have been engaging the Trump administration and the US Congress to suspend the process of normalising relations with Bashir’s regime, whose human rights abuses go far beyond killing protesters. And we have dispatched staff to engage governments in Europe and to the headquarters of the African Union in Addis Ababa.Over more than a dozen years, we’ve invested millions of dollars into efforts to address Sudan’s – and South Sudan’s – crises. We launched the Satellite Sentinel Project to monitor the regime’s mass atrocities using satellite technology and teams of imagery analysts. We were able to uncover evidence of mass graves, Chinese-made rockets, hidden troop movements in violations of ceasefires, and many other destabilising actions of the Sudan regime.1956 Independence\u0026nbspSudan – including the area that will later become South Sudan - attains independence\u0026nbspafter being under Anglo-Egyptian rule since 1899.1962 First civil war\u0026nbspIn a pattern that will later re-establish itself, civil war breaks out\u0026nbspin 1962\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspwith a rebellion led by southern separatists, leading to limited autonomy being granted by Khartoum following a peace agreement signed in Addis Ababa in 1972.1983 Second civil war\u0026nbspWar between Khartoum and the south breaks out again when\u0026nbsp​President Jaafar Numeiri abolishes southern autonomy, leading to almost two decades of conflict.2005 Peace and autonomy for the south\u0026nbspThe Comprehensive Peace Agreement is signed between\u0026nbsp​John Garang​’s southern Sudanese People’s Liberation Movement and Khartoum which sees a new constitution and autonomy in the south whose administration is dominated by Garang’s former guerilla colleagues, foremost among them Salva Kiir.2011 South Sudan formed\u0026nbspAfter an uneasy period punctuated by\u0026nbspoutbreaks of\u0026nbspviolence, political leaders in the north and south agree to an independence referendum which sees the birth of the state of South Sudan2013 War in the south\u0026nbsp​Peace is short lived, however, with new conflict breaking out in 2013 when pPresident Salva Kiir​ dismisses his cabinet and vice-president Riek\u0026nbspMachar in a power struggle within the ruling Sudan People’s Liberation Movementleading to conflict with Uganda which supports Kiir’s government forces.An attempted mediation for which Machar returns to Juba in 2016 breaks down amid more fighting, including accusations from the UN against Kiir of ethnic cleansing. Famine is declared a year later. Despite peace talks the conflict and atrocities continue, creating the continent’s largest refugee crisis.But over time, we realised that naming and shaming the regime and exposing its complicity in mass atrocities were not having sufficient impact on the policies of governments in Europe, America and Africa, so we decided on a new approach.We assessed the most significant point of vulnerability of this unshamable regime to be all the money it has been stealing from its people and squirrelling out of the country into hidden accounts, real estate and shell companies, funnelling the rest of the funds into the machinery of state repression now responsible for killing and arresting protesters. So we decided to go after the regime’s massive corruption and illicit financial flows by creating an organisation called The Sentry, aimed at making it harder for them to loot the natural resources of the country to line their pockets and finance their repression.Our financial forensic investigative team is gathering evidence and we hope to have our first reports on Sudan in the coming year, just as we have already done in South Sudan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Central African Republic. The Sentry has also undertaken an assessment of Sudan’s anti-money laundering framework, and our report coming in the near future will show that the system is barely sufficient to meet international standards on paper, and far more concerning in practice. Bashir’s theft has taken longer to crack because his regime has been more sophisticated in obscuring its illicit money trails, including through manipulating and abusing their own flawed systems.It is our belief that exposing the Bashir regime’s massive theft of resources from its people, and the complicity of the international financial system in this effort, constitutes the most critical way in which we can support Sudanese activists on the ground as they lead the campaign for justice and human rights. Much of our work in this regard is not public. We provide evidence directly to global banks to help them guard against money laundering through the international financial system, and we provide dossiers to governments, including to the US Treasury recently to support sanctions under the new Global Magnitsky authorities.This work has gone hand-in-hand with our ongoing efforts in South Sudan. We’ve worked to expose the vast corruption in the Juba regime, and to successfully advocate for network sanctions and anti-money laundering measures imposed against key regime officials and financiers. The networks of looting are transnational, so many of the vultures feeding on South Sudan are also doing the same to Sudan. There is much money to be made in war, and the deliberate absence of the rule of law has supported the efforts of the thieves of state in Khartoum and Juba.We’ve also supported the restoration of coffee farming in areas of South Sudan to help create incomes for the hard-working people there. Unfortunately, the conflict has overwhelmed these efforts, but we will continue to look for opportunities.We certainly support the work of journalists to ask questions about the activities of those working to address the world’s problems. But the  and other publications with a history of important investigative journalism should be asking questions of the UK and other European governments, which continue to pursue favourable trade and investment opportunities with Sudan, and which are providing funds to the Sudan regime to contain migration, not fully understanding that those funds are going to the most violent paramilitary forces associated with the regime, ironically causing further out-migration from Sudan to Europe.And journalists should be asking the US government how it can consider normalising relations with a government that is killing protesters, looting the country’s natural resources, failing to combat money laundering through its own system, maintaining ties with extremists inside and outside Sudan, and undermining basic religious freedoms.This is a catalytic moment for the people of Sudan. We and our team – which includes Sudanese experts – are working in every way we can to support the aspirations of the people of Sudan for a peaceful transition from three decades of violent, kleptocratic dictatorship. • Actor George Clooney and activist John Prendergast are co-founders of The Sentry."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3ac6fee1c3b36a4f9922546d01d44ad5b3386b3d/0_24_4361_2616/master/4361.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3c8010bb7dcea6552a7ac1c212c44b15","title":"the guardian view on venezuela its people deserve better","story":"Mr Maduro and his allies have overseen this collapse, yet maintained a tight grip on power. When the opposition triumphed in elections for the national assembly in 2015, he stripped the body of its powers and set up the National Constituent Assembly instead through dubious elections. Last year he won an equally dodgy presidential vote boycotted by the opposition. Opposition leaders are jailed or have fled into exile protesters have been arbitrarily detained and tortured. While some still believe Mr Maduro continues the work of his charismatic predecessor, Hugo Chávez, even many Chavistas have turned against him. An unpopular president relies on control of the judiciary and military support.These desperate times have united the splintered opposition, for now at least, around Juan Guaidó, the youthful and barely known figure who heads the national assembly and has just declared himself acting president. He is backed by Donald Trump, usually so enamoured of authoritarian leaders and careless of human rights, who has taken an uncharacteristic stand in a country which happens to have the world’s largest proven oil reserves. Canada and most members of the Lima group regional bloc have also recognised Mr Guaidó, reflecting the broader risks posed by Venezuela’s unravelling, and the inability to find another way forward, as well as the rightward shift in the region. The EU has been somewhat cagier.Mr Trump’s move is risky as well as cynical. Latin America has plentiful experience of the cost of US-led interference and military “solutions” to crises. Russia, which sent two bombers to Venezuela last month in an unsubtle show of support for Mr Maduro, has warned that US actions could have “catastrophic consequences”. China, the country’s largest creditor, is standing by him so are Turkey and Mexico.The question is what comes next. Clearly the opposition’s aim is that the military, particularly lower down the chain of command, can be chipped away. The concomitant risk is of rival factions turning upon each other. The other issue is what happens to US diplomats if they ignore orders to leave the country. Some suspect a pretext for further action by Mr Trump, who reportedly mooted an invasion several times in 2017 and says “all options” are on the table if Mr Maduro cracks down on the opposition. Brazil’s new far right president Jair Bolsonaro has made his sympathies clear. The prospect of military intervention is terrifying, and could make the current catastrophe far worse.It is clear that Venezuela cannot recover while Mr Maduro is in charge. Research has suggested most Venezuelans want a negotiated settlement and fresh elections. Previous attempts at talks between Venezuela’s political players failed due largely to bad faith on the government’s side.

The report also said students were making slow progress in school, bullying incidents were too frequent and disadvantaged pupils and those with special educational needs were not making enough progress.The school will go into special measures and a multi-academy trust is being sought to take it over.The school’s governing body said it was concerned the inspection came after a letter sent from Hinds to the chief inspector of Ofsted, calling for additional scrutiny of all Steiner schools. The body believes the approach Ofsted has taken to Steiner schools has impacted the fairness and independence of the inspection process.Roy Douglas, a governor at Steiner Academy Bristol, said: “While we take the report very seriously and recognise that improvements need to be made, we do not consider that the decision to place us in special measures was fair. We have a number of concerns about the way the inspection process was conducted and the judgments made, and wanted to work with Ofsted to resolve these.”Douglas said the school was concerned about Ofsted’s approach and what it means for the future of state-funded Steiner education.“While we have decided we have no alternative but to issue a legal challenge regarding the inspection, we will continue to support the academy management committee, which has taken interim responsibility for managing the school in delivering sustained improvements,” he added.Deb Meachin, a parent with a child at the school, said: “I chose Steiner education because I didn’t want my children to be part of a system that puts more emphasis on testing, ticking boxes and results, with reduced time for creativity. It has encouraged my children’s inidualism and it has been the best choice we have made for our family.”The academy is one of a small number of publicly funded Steiner schools set up as a result of the government’s free school policy. Other Steiner schools in the UK are privately funded.An Ofsted spokesperson said: “Ofsted inspects without fear or favour. We considered and responded to all the points made by the governors of Bristol Steiner Academy while the report and evidence went through our rigorous quality assurance procedures. The result of the inspection is well founded and fair, and we stand by it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/031079c32ab0548656496a7cb65037c19723ab28/502_108_3158_1896/master/3158.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=349101966560281ca2411ef639af24d2","title":"black sheep guardian film nominated for best short documentary oscar","story":"Ed Perkins’ film about a young black boy’s response to a racist gang after he moves out of London is up for an Academy awardBlack Sheep, a film commissioned by the , has been nominated for best short documentary at the 2019 Oscars.Directed by Ed Perkins, Black Sheep tells the story of Cornelius Walker, a black 11-year-old from London who moves with his family to a housing estate in Essex after the murder of schoolboy Damilola Taylor in 2000.

Our critic calls it ‘truly terrible’ – but how does it compare to The Back-Up Plan?Could it have been anything else? Gigli wasn’t just a lead balloon it was the Hindenburg. It’s widely considered to be one of the worst films ever made. It made a 10th of its budget back. It derailed the careers of Lopez and Ben Affleck (who were engaged but split up shortly after it was made) and the director, Martin Brest, who never directed again. To quote one of the great poets, “gobble gobble”.How did Lopez bounce back from this historic flop? By making the second-worst film of her career, also with Affleck. A sludgy Kevin Smith melodrama, Lopez’s role was pruned for fear it would remind people of Gigli, which it did anyway. The best thing about it is that Lopez dies quite quickly.One of those films where every detail makes you question whether or not it even existed. It stars Robin Williams as a schoolboy who looks like a middle-aged man. The poster features the title written in crayon. Bill Cosby is in it. Francis Ford Coppola directed it, for crying out loud. Lopez isn’t bad in Jack – she has a relatively small, sweet part – but that shouldn’t detract from the fact that she’s in it.Booed at its Berlin premiere, Bordertown is a witless would-be thriller that obliterates every one of its good intentions with sheer turbo-powered boneheadedness. Lopez plays a hardbitten news reporter on investigating a spate of murders on the US-Mexico border in a film that contains a genuinely confusing musical number by the Colombian pop star Juanes for literally no reason at all.By far the worst J-Lo romcom of all time, The Back-Up Plan sees Lopez playing a woman who falls in love with an anonymous boy actor three seconds after being artificially inseminated with twins. Will they stay together? Will he raise her kids? Who decided this film was a good idea? Fun fact: Lopez vomits into a bin at the end.AKA what happens when Lopez takes a dumb swing at Oscar bait. There’s grief, there’s domestic abuse, there’s a car crash, there’s endless hokey small-town Americana, there’s a bear attack. Robert Redford is in this if it wasn’t for Lions for Lambs, this would be his worst film.Gigli and Jersey Girl taught Lopez important lessons about the dangers of working with your romantic partner. But she clearly never listened, because in 2006 she made this entirely generic vanity project of a music biopic with her new husband, Marc Anthony. It is just as miserable as you would expect.Last year, Viola Davis railed against her unfair treatment as a black woman in Hollywood. Looking at Lila \u0026amp Eve – a direct-to-VOD vigilante crime drama co-starring Lopez from 2015, in which she recites the Alcoholics Anonymous serenity prayer to avenge her son’s death – it’s hard to disagree.A mystical jazz musician-turned-hobo walks the streets of Chicago performing kind acts for strangers. One of these kind acts, inexplicably, involves stopping the world’s most beautiful cop from being shot in the head with a machine gun. Then they fall in love. I promise I am not making any of this up.In which Lopez’s teenage neighbour gives her a suspiciously new-looking first-edition copy of the Iliad, sleeps with her, then goes bananas and ultimately gets stabbed in the eye with an EpiPen. Not anywhere as fun as I’ve made it sound.A film that only exists by sheer dint of J-Lo’s effort. It borrows the hacky romcom premise of her other films (low-class woman is mistaken for high-class woman), gives itself a title that’s clearly meant to be seen as a future delineation point in Lopez’s filmography, then spaffs itself raw trying and failing to justify its own existence. You will watch this on a plane and then instantly forget about it.On paper, this should have been Lopez’s nadir – playing a supporting role in a Jason Statham film, for God’s sake – and yet it isn’t completely awful. It’s a little anonymous, and entirely forgettable, but she’s made much worse.True, sequels such as Anacondas: The Hunt for the Blood Orchid, Anaconda 3: Offspring, Anacondas: Trail of Blood and Lake Placid vs Anaconda might have taken the shine off the original a little. However, this is still fun and stupid, especially if you like watching Owen Wilson get swallowed by a snake.A film that Lopez could only have made at the height of her fame. It’s a sort of Karate Kid remake, but about a woman who learns krav maga in order to kill her abusive husband. It’s a drama (sort of), it’s issue-led (sort of) and it’s actually quite good (sort of).A dumb – extraordinarily dumb – mid-90s Tarantino-ish thriller from Oliver Stone that wants to be Chinatown but ends up hitting Doc Hollywood. Lopez is literally the only good thing about this.One of J-Lo’s best-known roles, playing a hotel chambermaid who gets mistaken for a millionaire socialite by a clot. It’s Pretty Woman without any sex work, and only really let down by Ralph Fiennes, who bungles his potential mainstream breakout by generally coming off like a witness protection serial killer.Maligned upon release, this romcom succeeds purely for one reason: Jane Fonda. Everyone else in this film plays it straight from the J-Lo romcom rulebook, but Fonda is coming from an entirely different universe. She hadn’t made a film for 15 years before Monster-in-Law, and attacks her role like an exploding volcano. Seriously, watch it just for her.Has Lopez ever made a more visually arresting film than this? No. The Cell is a work of art. Every frame of Tarsem Singh’s debut has clearly been agonised over. But has anyone who has ever watched The Cell figured out what it’s about? Again, probably no.The definitive J-Lo romcom in a field packed with them. In fact, probably the platonic ideal of what a romcom should be. Two beautiful leads (the other is Matthew McConaughey). A love story packed with obstacles. A demented belief in the undying sanctity of marriage. Judy Greer in a supporting role that she’s clearly overqualified for. This film has everything, and in the middle of it is Lopez.The film that put Lopez on the map, and the lighter flipside to El Cantante. It’s another musical biopic, but one that plays to all of Lopez’s early strengths. She’s radiant, restless and determined here. She’s so good, in fact, that Selena gives all of her subsequent films a slightly bitter aftertaste. What could she have achieved, you wonder, if she had stayed this loose and free instead of hardening into J-Lo?Lopez’s best film by a country mile. She, George Clooney and Steven Soderbergh have never been better than in this stylish, sexy, unquestionably cool Elmore Leonard adaptation. The whole thing is like taking off your shoes and wriggling your toes in a thick carpet, and it’s propelled by the crackling chemistry between the two leads. It did badly at the box office and Lopez never went near anything like this again. Which is an extraordinary shame."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e4bb90dc8b2d31d222f6f4d0595a432e4a4caba8/295_63_1349_809/master/1349.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b69b2d1d4f7c0f6051bc6497386fce44","title":"thierry henry suspended monaco manager 104 days","story":"Thierry Henry has been suspended by Monaco as their manager just over three months after his appointment.The club, who have won only two league games under Henry and are second from bottom of Ligue 1, said a final decision would be taken on the former striker’s future and that Franck Passi would train the first team on Friday.Henry has been in charge for 104 days and 20 matches.

It’s going to be a massive battle ... how we start the game is going to be so important. We need to be aggressive and try to dominate.”The manager says he has been encouraged by his players’ attitude in training in the last few days but wants them to produce in a proper match now: “We need to react on the pitch. I saw something interesting in the last two or three trainings but only on the pitch is it important. So I want to be see something good in this match.” He also says that he intended to play Christensen at centreback but the Dane had a groin problem in training so David Luiz starts instead. As for the inclusion of Giroud, he says: “I didn’t like how we attacked the opposing box in the last match so tonight we need a true nine.” “That sign in the photo says all you need to know about Sarri’s faith in his strikers’ ability to find the net,” chortles Justin Kavanagh. “No doubt they will respond with a No Smoking Please sign of their own in the dressing room.” It’ll most likely be a V-sign for Sarri after this game, one way or the other. It looks the like that clear-the-air meeting between Sarri and the players has led to the manaegr seeing the light! He’s made significant changes here: Emerson comes in at left-back in place of the under-performing Alonso Giroud starts as at centre-forward so that Hazard can frolic as he pleases an let’s see what role will be given to Ngolo Kanté - the one at which he’s a world leader, or the one at which he’s so-so?Meanwhile, some rare good news for Spurs on the injury front, as Sissoko returns. In the first instalment of this semi-final, Spurs beat Chelsea 1-0 thanks to a hotly-debated penalty by Harry Kane. But since then Kane and most of the rest of Spurs’ strike force been rendered unavailable, jeopardising the north Londoners’ hopes for the season at a critical point. Holding on to their first leg lead today, or even increasing it, would do them a power of good, even if the final, against Manchester City, would mean that a team that is being stretched close to breaking point would have another fixture to contend with.Chelsea also have problems. They failed to sign Gonzalo Higuain in time for this match so Maurizio Sarri will have to rely on strikers that he evidently does not believe to be adequate, or else deploy Eden Hazard in a role that the Belgian does not particularly enjoy. Chelsea have failed to score in three of their last five matches. With the manager’s tactics and personnel selections increasingly contested, Sarri increased the pressure on himself this week by publicly bemoaning his players’ attitudes. How will they respond today? One of these teams will feel much better about themselves after this clash, and one will feel worse. And one of these managers will leave Stamford Bridge today knowing that he’ll be taking his team to a cup final against Manchester City next month, and what a thrill that would be for Mauricio Pochettino, whose trophy cabinet is bare, or Sarri, whose career honours so far consist of an Employee of the Week rosette from the Banca Monte deli Paschi di Siena.

But not everyone seems to have got the messageOne of the many things we have learned from Netflix’s Fyre festival documentary is just how much money influencers can make from a single Instagram post. If you haven’t seen it – and you simply must, it’s a set text for a course in Men That Can’t Get Away With It, alongside that new Justin Timberlake autobiography that is just photos of him – it shows that a host of celebrity influencers were paid to post a single burnt orange tile on their Instagram with a link to the Fyre festival website, meaning a festival that didn’t exist immediately sold out.According to the film, Kendall Jenner was allegedly paid $250,000 (£190,000) for her post, but even smaller influencers were bunged tens of thousands of dollars. Overall, millions were spent on a supposedly “viral” campaign. Yet, this week, another unlikely brand managed to sign up an equally impressive list of influencers, all without spending a penny. I’m talking of the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), the grey government quango responsible for investigating business mergers. It managed to bag Ellie Goulding, Rita Ora, Zoella and Rosie Huntington-Whiteley for its new campaign, as well as a host of reality stars and vloggers. Darling, how have they managed it? By threatening them all with jail time, of course!In a press release on the Gov.uk website – and, really, who needs the sidebar of shame when you have civil service pdfs? – the CMA announced that it had gathered a group of 16 celebrities who had all promised to “clean up their act” on social media. We’d love to say that the celebrities have done this because they are all just nutty about strong regulatory frameworks in direct-to-consumer marketing. But one does detect in the CMA’s tone – similar to that of a Jed Mercurio copper breathing down the neck of a low-level criminal who might be holding back on some information – that they were left with little choice.“The enforcement action taken by the CMA has seen a number of social media stars pledge to be more transparent when posting online,” it said, adding that if the celebrities do not stick to the commitments they made, “we will not hesitate to take them to court”, where they could be “fined indefinitely” or “sent to prison for up to two years”. Two years? That’s, like, 60 detox juice cleanses.What could the government possibly be so upset about? Well, let’s take a scroll through the Instagram account of one of the “willing participants” in the CMA’s press push – Made in Chelsea’s Alexandra “Binky” Felstead.She also had a gym workout, where she just so happened to be “wearing @sweatybetty” and also just so happened to use their official hashtag “#youbetyourass”. None of these posts were apparently an ad.But her account is not all about her personal unpaid passion for saying thank you to brands, there is the odd clearly labelled paid partnership there too, such as the one for the pram chair Cybex Global. In it she acknowledges she has been paid to call it “light and compact”, but just a few weeks later, she posted about the pram again. This time, saying, “this is not an #ad … it really is just super easy \u0026amp amazing”. What are the chances?The CMA has also created explicit new guidelines about what counts as payment: a gift, loan or freebie, “whether you originally asked for it or got sent it out of the blue” – each now counts, meaning the nods and winks system is under attack.The reason regulators are clamping down is essential because they are worried about a repeat of the Fyre festival scenario – where influencers are paid a truckload of money to endorse a thing they know nothing about.In the Netflix documentary, you see Billy McFarland, a man whose permanent facial expression is of a 14-year-old boy who has just been told “there will be girls there”, pay 10 of the world’s top models to film a commercial on a remote island for a festival that didn’t exist. Once the festival sells out, he scrambles to try to deliver on his promises.Big Billy Bullshit is like nothing you’ve ever seen before – at no point in his downfall, even when he has been charged with a host of federal crimes, does he ever stop talking himself up. He makes Chris Moyles sound like he suffers from low self-esteem, Shane Smith look like Vince Cable – it’s a thing to behold.In perhaps the most shocking scene of the doc, Andy, one of the festival organisers, recounts how Billy told him that all their bottled Evian had been seized by Bahamian customs, that they were out of money, and the only way to get them back would be to go to the customs official and “suck his dick”. It’s a dramatic descent, from something that started with a few mislabelled Instagram posts.Clearly, the CMA is taking preventive measure to stop a disaster like that happening in Britain. But it’s not clear that those involved in Fyre festival have learned any lessons. Most of the models who flew to the island continue to post constantly about brands and experiences, labelling only some of their posts as advertisements. Ja Rule – the rapper who helped Billy pull the con off – claimed this week on Twitter that he too was “bamboozled, hood winked, lead astray”, even though he is seen in the doc appearing to repeatedly withold crucial, potentially life-saving information from attendees.The only surprising thing is that some social media manager at Evian hasn’t themselves tried to turn this into some kind of influencer campaign. Imagine a couple of makeup vloggers, a Jonas brother and that egg that has the most Instagram likes, all staring moodily into the camera clutching a bottle of the clear stuff with the hashtag #idsuckdickforevian. It would certainly be one way to steal the limelight back from the Fiji Water Girl.McFarland is now serving a six-year sentence in federal prison. The CMA says it is now sending letters to other influencers to warn them about their behaviour. And so balance can slowly be restored, because if you are flogging Bahamian islands to Boohoo bikinis, the only thing more influential than an influencer is a good lawyer.A quick check-in with Gemma Collins, who is currently starring as Stan Laurel in ITV’s Dancing on Ice. This week, Collins gave a lacklustre performance dressed as Marilyn Monroe, and was quick to draw ire from judge Jason Gardiner, who said she was more like Anna Nicole Smith. A somewhat tasteless comment, considering Smith was a world-renowned gold digger who died, tragically, of an overdose of sleeping pills. All Collins had done was put on a blond wig.Rather than take the criticism, Collins let rip: “Maybe if you didn’t sell stories on me I wouldn’t have been so upset this week.” When Gardiner continued, she bellowed back, “BORRRING, NEXT!”, with such force that even Phillip Schofield was briefly awoken from his 15-year power nap.Gardiner hadn’t exactly been ringing up the Sun’s anonymous tip line, but he did give an interview in the week leading up to the show where he called Collins “a disgrace to humanity”. Collins and her dance partner have claimed this interview was organised without the involvement of the Dancing on Ice PR team. So, like a mean girl printing off photos to stick in their burn book, Gardiner set up his own opportunities to slag Collins off in the papers. Gardiner has since said he will sue Collins, an empty threat we can only hope is taken apart with similar gusto this week."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dd478d91f63710edbc14e166f95afc0d256b850a/0_91_5500_3300/master/5500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6e57ad62edaaa91067366f7886da1790","title":"as huffpost and buzzfeed shed staff has the digital content bubble burst","story":"Fears are growing that current models of paying for online journalism are brokenIn 2005 a 29-year-old media studies graduate called Jonah Peretti helped to found an online news and comment website called the Huffington Post. A year later he started an experimental side project called BuzzFeed.The two sites would help create an online media boom, as investors rushed to buy stakes in the belief such outlets were more nimble and more in tune with the desires of readers who grew up on the internet rather than with traditional newspapers and broadcasters.On Wednesday, HuffPost’s parent company, Verizon Media Group, and BuzzFeed both announced plans to lay off hundreds of staff. The news signalled a collision between the dream of an online media boom and the accountants’ harsher reality: questions over the long-term profitability of digital media companies, and, as a result, concerns over the future of online journalism itself.“What if there is literally no profitable model for digital news? Or none that actually scales and endures without, say, the established readership base and brand of the New York Times?” asked the MSNBC presenter Chris Hayes, summarising a growing fear among media executives that the current model of paying for journalism on the internet is broken.The same news executives are coming to terms with the fact that, in the modern world of mobile consumption, most sites are just another form of distraction. Their competition is not just rival scoops – but a vast online ecosystem of entertaining, shareable and social content.“It’s clear that we have a digital content bubble,” said Rasmus Kleis Nielsen, the director of the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism at Oxford University. “There’s no question we’re going to see more cuts, both in legacy media and digital-born ones.”He said part of the issue was the investors who backed online media startups thought they were investing in fast-growing tech businesses, rather than something resembling a traditional news outlet.“In some ways, for journalism to succeed as a business it needs patient investors who are content with incremental growth and modest returns on investment.”This attitude fed into the financial culture of the companies, which often hired staff at breakneck speed. Online site Mic rented glitzy offices in the World Trade Center in New York, shortly before the company collapsed after last year’s changes to Facebook’s algorithm, which hit many online publishers’ traffic hard.BuzzFeed placed an emphasis on retaining employees by providing generous working conditions such as free lunches, featuring sushi and rock oysters. Vice was famed for the decadence of its parties under its former chief executive Shane Smith, who was in charge when the company was hit with accusations of sexual harassment and misconduct. Major online media companies, which are often referred to as startups – despite, in many cases, being more than a decade old – are now having to control costs. At the same time, they are being asked questions by investors who are wondering about the true value of their stake.BuzzFeed’s email announcing layoffs made it clear the company would not be seeking to raise any more funds, and the business appears to have abandoned its once-proposed plan to float on the stock exchange.This is despite the fact the company is hoping to record income of $300m in 2018 following doubt-digit revenue growth, while its UK edition is close to profitability – a performance that would delight many traditional outlets but is not enough for investors.Even as online media companies have fought off a slew of low-rent competitors mimicking their distribution methods, they have also had to contend with more established outlets learning from their skills in experimentation.In BuzzFeed’s early days, the company mastered the art of gaming Facebook’s algorithm by building lists and posts based around identity and entertainment issues, which would appeal to readers and encourage them to share. Suddenly, an established online brand could be matched by the use of an organic distribution network: readers themselves.The result was a run of posts which would reach millions of views, aided by carefully-studied insights – such as the fact that adding the word “actually” to a quiz headline could supercharge its traffic.Those insights helped to maximise viral reach, with an attention to detail and deep analysis of what prompted humans to share that sometimes belied their apparently frivolous content and headlines.Gradually, ongoing changes to Facebook’s algorithm eroded some of the competitive advantage in the field. BuzzFeed looked to develop its presence on other platforms and invest in the serious news journalism which saw it publish the Trump dossier and be shortlisted for a Pulitzer prize.At BuzzFeed, Peretti constantly suggested Facebook would be forced to pay for content, an outcome that has yet to materialise, before seeking to create TV-style programming for other companies. Last year he floated the eye-catching idea of a mega-merger of online media companies to take on Facebook and Google but sources at the company have played down the importance of this.He told staff on Wednesday they would look to ersify income away from the main website and hoped to be “clear winner in the market as the economics of digital media continue to improve”.Instead, there has been an unexpected swing back to big traditional outlets, with the likes of the New York Times seeing enormous demand for its subscriptions, at a time when newspapers are closing across the rest of the US. Some outlets are relying on contributions from readers, a model which has helped the ’s parent company edge towards breaking even after years of heavy financial losses.Others prefer to rely on wealthy iniduals: the Atlantic is benefiting from an investment by Laurene Powell Jobs, the widow of Apple’s founder, Steve Jobs, while MEL Magazine has won plaudits for its coverage of online culture, despite being the corporate branding project of a razor manufacturer.“The challenges that the establishment players and new players face are very similar,” said Nielsen, who urged competitors not to gloat at the pain experienced by new rivals, with many journalists set to lose their jobs.“We live in a world with intense competition for attention, for advertising, and for people’s money.

Virgin staff said my daughter should have known because the information was on its website.The family had no alternative but to go home to fetch the birth certificates and, as Virgin was unable or unwilling to rebook their flight, had to book with another airline for the next day, which cost £3,000. They later discovered that as they were marked as a “no-show” for their outward bound flight, their return tickets had been voided and they would have to rebook that, too, at a cost of more than £2,000.

It was in June 2015 that South Africa introduced the most stringent immigration rules in the world, requiring all under-18s to present an unabridged birth certificate at the departure gate. This was intended to reduce child trafficking. But it was taking such a toll on tourism that the rules were relaxed. However, passengers are still urged to carry the documents as immigration officers may request them and, since airlines face fines if they carry inadequately documented passengers, some gate staff may still insist on them.Virgin told the Observer that there was a link to South African entry requirements on the e-tickets it sends to customers, but as you booked through Lastminute the format was different and the link not included.

Yet fans continue to root for the rapper – because she’s the opposite of safe Last week, in the most high-profile celebrity aviation incident since Kate Moss popularised the term “basic bitch” in a row with easyJet staff about sandwiches, the American rapper Azealia Banks removed herself from an Aer Lingus flight after calling a flight attendant an “ugly Irish bitch”.According to a tearful video she posted on Instagram, Banks said a flight attendant asked her questions she couldn’t answer without checking her passport, which she had stored in the overhead locker. As she looked for her passport, the situation escalated. A fellow passenger told Mail Online they felt the crew were heavy-handed.After disembarking the flight voluntarily, Banks called the Aer Lingus staff “ugly Irish women”, threatening to throw geese into the engine of the plane. When the incident sparked a semi-serious tabloid row about the beauty or lack thereof of Irish women, Banks apologised to her Irish fans, calling herself the “Queen of Ireland” and asking that they throw baked potatoes at her if they were offended by her comments.Is there a tougher gig than being Banks’s publicist? You wonder if they get strapped into the same spinning chair they use to stress-test astronauts. Since breaking out in 2011 with 212, her fast-flowing celebration of cunnilingus, Banks’ gift for controversy would challenge even the most battle-hardened PR professional.In 2017, she accepted a plea deal after an incident in which she bit a New York City bouncer on the breast and spat on her. In 2016, she claimed that the actor Russell Crowe assaulted her during a party in a Beverly Hills hotel room. Prosecutors dropped the case after other partygoers told police that they had witnessed Banks threaten to attack a woman with broken glass. In 2015, she was removed from a Delta flight after calling an attendant a “fucking faggot”. A year later, she called Zayn Malik a “curry-scented bitch”, and asked for Sarah Palin to be gangbanged.In spite of all of her bigoted and bullying behaviour, some people continue to root for her. “I can’t wait to see her, I love her music so much,” one fan told the  after Banks, belatedly, made it to Ireland for her gig. “She is a dickhead though.” Banks is after all, superbly talented, from her blistering debut mixtape Fantasea to the sensual 2018 single Treasure Island: a fact that is often forgotten amidst gleeful media coverage of her public spats.Last year, Banks became involved in 2018’s most bizarre celebrity feud, after a recording session with electronic artist Grimes at her then-boyfriend Elon Musk’s house devolved into chaos. Banks made her text exchange with Grimes public, in which she called her a “brittleboned methhead” who smelled “like a roll of nickels”.In an age when labels pressure-hose iniduality out of their artists like crime scene cleaners, and a star such as Ellie Goulding talks about female empowerment at awards ceremonies because a shampoo brand asked her to, Banks’s refusal to engage in nonsensical publicity guff is an icy blast to the face in today’s temperature-controlled PR climate. She posts cheery videos about cleaning blood out of the closet where she ritually sacrifices chickens, calls Rita Ora “Rihanna’s understudy”, and describes the VMAs a “contest of the basics”.In an industry that celebrates a certain type of positivist, girl-squad femininity, Banks is not “good”. Being a Banks fan involves a certain amount of cognitive dissonance, because she embodies so many contradictory qualities at once. She is a pugnacious troll who once encouraged Iggy Azalea to commit suicide, but she is also someone whose irrepressibility has paved a way into the industry for underground female rappers such as Cupcakke and her former labelmate Rico Nasty. And she is a victim too: although she has spoken publicly about her struggles with mental illness, she doesn’t get the same understanding someone like Kanye West receives, a double standard she acknowledged in a 2016 Broadly interview.Mostly, Banks rubs people up the wrong way because she refuses to be anything other than herself, even when it affects her public image by allowing the press to paint her according to the racist stereotype of the “angry black woman”. Banks acknowledges the media coverage that constantly swirls around her: after disembarking the Aer Lingus flight, she posted on Instagram criticising the people who are “addicted to Azealia Banks trauma porn”. She also told an Irish Instagram user: “Don’t you have a famine to go die in?”Her Dublin gig ended up being a riotous success, and she will now embark on a tour of medium-sized UK venues. Why isn’t an artist of Banks’s calibre playing bigger stages? Perhaps it’s because while weare addicted to the trauma, she seems to be too. The music can’t be heard through the noise."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/25f1fcae29f154dcc45e782b33d8e5b307460ff9/0_17_4961_2976/master/4961.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4e44bc411807422415f6b6ad07fa6bda","title":"endless hunt for the perfect influenza vaccine flu jab","story":"We’ve seen off smallpox, polio and measles – so why does a truly reliable flu jab still elude us? By  Jeremy BrownVaccination, the process of infecting a healthy person with a microbe to prevent disease, dates back at least a thousand years. But the start of vaccination as we think of it today is generally credited to the work of Edward Jenner, a British physician born in 1749. Jenner was a keen observer with a deep interest in the natural world, and found time for both serious study and artistic play. He investigated everything from hydrogen balloons to the life cycle of the cuckoo, wrote poetry and played the violin, but smallpox – or rather, the eradication of it – is his legacy. Because of Jenner, this virus is not on our list of worries today.These women then became immune to the deadlier human smallpox virus. There was something in the cowpox that protected against smallpox, and in 1796 Edward Jenner famously took material from the fresh pustules on a milkmaid’s hand and inserted it under the skin of a young boy named James Phipps. After a brief and mild illness, Phipps recovered completely. Jenner then infected him with scrapings from a smallpox lesion, again and again, but the boy never got sick. Jenner named this process “vaccination” after variolae vaccinae, a Latin term for cowpox. His technique quickly spread through 19th-century England and beyond, saving countless people, inspiring modifications to the technique and changing the course of history.Jenner’s smallpox vaccine was improved and modified over the next several decades, and was soon joined by others. Louis Pasteur developed vaccines for animal diseases such as chicken cholera and anthrax, but of these he is best remembered for his rabies vaccine. Rabies was a common and uniformly fatal disease in the 19th century. Once a victim is bitten by a rabid animal, the virus multiplies slowly and infects the brain and nervous system. Pasteur did not know of the viral cause, but this didn’t really matter. He dissected and dried out the spinal cords of infected animals and then injected the remains into test animals, which then showed immunity to rabies. What Pasteur was doing was, in fact, weakening the virus, making it a Goldilocks version. It was not strong enough to kill, and it was not weak enough to be ignored by our immune system.One hundred years ago, during the 1918 flu pandemic, there were no flu vaccines. We didn’t know precisely what was causing the disease, so we couldn’t manufacture a vaccine to protect us. But this didn’t stop scientists and doctors from doing something, anything, to combat the outbreak. In 1919 Edward Rosenow from the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, isolated several bacteria from the sputum and lungs of flu patients in Rochester, formulated a vaccine that contained five different kinds of bacteria, and doled it out to 100,000 people. At Tufts College Medical School in Boston, Timothy Leary (whose nephew and namesake would also become a doctor and experiment with psychedelics) produced his own blended vaccine using strains from the Chelsea Naval hospital, a nurse’s nose at Carney hospital and the infected wards of Camp Devens. Leary mixed these samples together, grew them on plates of agar and then sterilised the mixture. His vaccine was sent to San Francisco, where at least 18,000 people were inoculated with it.These and other efforts gave hope to a ravaged nation. One health official at the time wrote that the greatest value of a flu vaccine was that it reduced “fluphobia”. Worry and fear were as quick to spread as the disease itself, and any vaccine that provided at least mental relief was welcome. There was no evidence, of course, that any of these vaccines actually worked. Today, physicians go to great lengths to be sure that vaccine trials adhere to stringent standards, but a century ago these did not exist. Many of the vaccine trials were conducted on survivors of the flu, after the initial epidemic had passed, meaning that the pool was tainted with a degree of immunity.In 1933 the flu virus was identified, and scientists could then confront the culprit rather than the mess in its wake. Russians led the field, weakening the virus by transplanting it between chicken eggs. Around one billion people in the USSR were vaccinated using the live but weakened flu virus, and it was still in use at the end of the 20th century. Although it appeared to be successful, the live-flu vaccine was never tested in a rigorous way, and it remained a constant danger. Since it used a live virus, it could cross with other strains and morph into a more virulent version.Vaccine researchers therefore turned their attention to creating a vaccine containing what they called “inactive” strains. The virus was still grown in chick embryos, but this time it was rendered inactive by dunking it in a bath of formalin disinfectant. Although a higher dose of the inactive vaccine was needed to produce an immune response, there was no concern about the virus replicating.For the first several years the influenza vaccine contained only one strain, the influenza A virus, because, as far as anyone knew, that was the only kind of influenza out there. In 1940 influenza B was identified, which kicked off the perpetual task of calibrating vaccines to deal with multiple evolving strains. By the 1950s we had a vaccine that was effective against both A and B, but the virus, as always, was outpacing us. By the late 1970s we had to make a vaccine to hit three strains. For the 2016-7 flu season, most of the vaccine doses manufactured in the US targeted four different strains. The past 100 years have been a ceaseless arms race against an enemy with whom we cannot negotiate.The key to a good flu vaccine is matching it to the strains that are in circulation during a given season. The challenge is that it takes about six months to produce the vaccine, and so the manufacturers have to base their ingredients on some clever detective work led by the World Health Organization.There are about 110 WHO flu centres in 80 countries that receive swabs from the noses and throats of patients with influenza-like illnesses. These centres identify the flu strains that are circulating, and occasionally they will find a new one. When this happens, they send it to one of five collaborating centres, in London, Atlanta, Melbourne, Tokyo and Beijing, for a more detailed molecular analysis. Twice a year (in February for the northern hemisphere, and September for the southern) the WHO convenes a meeting to collate all the information and recommend a vaccine recipe for the upcoming season. In the US, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta provide additional domestic data, and the Food and Drug Administration makes a final decision on what goes into the vaccine. The manufacturers then have about six months to get the recommended flu vaccine to market.Even if the vaccine hits the bullseye, different demographics have different reactions to it. Children have a very good response to the vaccine. The situation is more complicated with elderly patients, who have weaker immune systems overall but also have a lifetime buildup of natural immunity. After withstanding many flu seasons, their immune systems are wiser, you might say, than those of the young.If flu vaccines are indeed mankind’s greatest weapon against the flu, why are they used in wildly different capacities?When my colleagues gave one another the influenza vaccine at the George Washington University hospital, we were following the advice of the CDC. When patients with influenza started to roll into the emergency room a few months later, I would ask if they had received a flu shot. Many had, and yet here they were in the hospital. I knew how they felt. My only visit to the emergency department as a patient – the year I got a nasty case of the flu – was after I had been given the flu vaccine.Despite the regular failure of the vaccine, Americans are bombarded every year with reminders and opportunities to get a flu shot. By the end of August, pharmacies are posting signs and doctors’ offices are gearing up. The vaccine is offered at many workplaces and houses of worship, and hospitals require all their health care providers to be vaccinated.Behind this effort is the CDC, which recommends the flu vaccine for everyone over the age of six months. One CDC poster that caught my attention asked: “Who needs a flu vaccine? a) You, b) You, c) You, d) All of the above”. (In case you were wondering, the correct answer is d.) The poster reminded us that “even healthy people can get the flu, and it can be serious”. The message then got more explicit: “Everyone 6 months and older should get a flu vaccine. This means you.”Recommendations about the use of vaccines in the US are made by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (Acip), a group of more than a dozen experts with backgrounds in vaccination research, public health and health policy. It meets three times a year to review any new evidence and provide advice and guidance to the director of the CDC about the use of vaccines. As recently as 2006, the committee recommended the flu vaccine only for those at high-risk for complications of influenza and adults over the age of 50. But a couple of years later it expanded its recommendations to include everyone over the age of six months. And that recommendation has remained in place ever since.The public health campaign by the CDC to vaccinate everyone is not shared by other countries. Europe and Australia recommend the vaccine only for the very young, the elderly and those with underlying illnesses. Healthy adults are simply not targeted. It’s very difficult to compare death rates from influenza across different countries because the definition of an influenza case varies, as does the way in wahich a country collects its own statistics. Often, deaths from viral influenza and bacterial pneumonia are listed together. It is challenging, therefore, to compare the data we have from the US and the UK. However, in the UK, the death rate from influenza in 2014 was 0.2 per 100,000 people. And in the US, it was 1.4 per 100,000. That is seven times higher than in the UK, a country that vaccinates far less of its population. These numbers must be interpreted with caution, but they do at least suggest that the approach in the UK is reasonable.How can we properly determine whether a “vaccination for all” programme, such as the one in the US, saves more lives and protects more people than the English “vaccination for some”? Perhaps for one flu season we could encourage everyone to get vaccinated, and for the next we would encourage only those at increased risk. We could compare the influenza death rates between the two groups and get our answer. Of course, it’s more complicated than that. Because the mortality rate from influenza is so low, we would need to enroll hundreds of thousands of patients in order to see if the vaccine made a difference. However, an experiment like this might be undermined by the strains of influenza that were circulating in each year. If one year’s strain was more contagious or deadlier than the next, our experiment would tell us nothing.We could instead collect evidence from small trials and look for trends. This method was used by the Cochrane collaboration, an international group of 37,000 medical contributors, in 2014, when they reviewed all the studies that evaluated the effects of the flu vaccine in healthy US adults. It was a large undertaking there were 90 studies that compared giving the vaccine to withholding it, and a total of 8 million patients were involved.It comes down to language. The CDC describes the flu like this in a poster intended for use in doctors’ offices: “The flu may make people cough and have a sore throat and fever. They may also have a runny or stuffy nose, feel tired, have body aches, or show other signs they are not well. The flu happens every year and is more common in the fall and winter in the US. People of all ages can get the flu, from babies and young adults, to the elderly.”Not so bad. But then this is on the homepage of the CDC’s flu site: “It can cause mild to severe illness. Serious outcomes of flu infection can result in hospitalization or death. Some people, such as older people, young children, and people with certain health conditions, are at high risk of serious flu complications. The best way to prevent the flu is by getting vaccinated each year.”At most, according to the British, influenza can be a bit of a nuisance: “Most people will make a full recovery and won’t experience any further problems, but elderly people and people with certain long-term medical conditions are more likely to have a bad case of flu or develop a serious complication, such as a chest infection.” There’s no mention of death as a complication. It’s all very “keep calm and carry on” – just like it was during the 1918 pandemic.Is the flu a killer or an irritant? We know with certainty that each year it kills many people in both the US and Britain. And we know with equal certainty that for almost all healthy people the flu is nothing but a minor annoyance. Both are correct. That’s the nature of influenza. It’s tricky and mysterious, causing discomfort in some of its victims and death in others. It’s just that the US and the UK quantify them in different ways.The British version of the CDC’s vaccine advisory committee is called the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI). It meets three times a year, reviews the scientific evidence and makes recommen-dations to the secretary of state for health if there is a need to change the vaccination policy. Andrew Pollard, the head of the JCVI, trained as a paediatrician and is now professor of paediatric infection and immunity at the University of Oxford. Pollard is extremely cognisant of the numerous effects of the flu, but for the JCVI, the biggest measure is cost-effectiveness.It may seem cold or callous to fixate on costs when lives are at stake, but money and resources are limited, and reckless or misdirected spending can lead to poor medical practices or greater harm. For example, spending $1m on medications for those who have had a heart attack might save 1,000 lives each year. That same $1m might have been spent instead on screenings for cervical cancer, which would save the lives of 60,000 women each year. What’s more important: saving 1,000 lives or 60,000 lives? It often comes down to who is asking (and which disease it is that you have).Andrew Pollard and his team at the JCVI looked at studies that measured the cost-effectiveness of the influenza vaccine. They concluded that given the vanishingly small number of young, healthy adults who become severely ill or die from the flu, it is not cost-effective to vaccinate this section of the population.Pollard’s committee measures the cost to the health system itself: how much the vaccine costs and how much it decreases the number of days that patients spend in hospital or in intensive care. They also estimate the vaccine’s effect on the number of flu-related visits to doctors’ offices. What they don’t measure is the wider cost to society, which includes lost labour, lost wages or the time a parent must spend taking care of a child. These, too, are burdens on society, but they do not enter into the deliberations of the JCVI. The vaccine is cost-effective to the healthcare system when it is given to children, older people, those with medical conditions and pregnant women. It is not cost-effective when given to young, healthy adults.In the US, the cost-effectiveness of the vaccine is less important. What is more important is whether or not it works. This approach has resulted in another difference in vaccination policy between the US and the UK, this time over the vaccine for chickenpox. The varicella vaccine can prevent both chickenpox and shingles, a later complication of the disease. In the US, the varicella vaccine is recommended for all children the first dose is given at 12 months of age, and a booster shot four years later. In the UK, varicella is not on the list of vaccines for children. In the US, if a vaccine has been shown to work safely, the CDC generally recommends it.At the beginning of the 1976 flu outbreak, President Gerald Ford had to choose between two perfectly sound recommendations. One was to quickly vaccinate as many people as possible, while the other was to stockpile the vaccine and wait to see whether things got worse. Ford rejected the wait-and-see approach. “We cannot afford to take a chance with the health of our nation,” he said. “Better to err on the side of overreaction than underreaction.”This is the overriding approach to healthcare in the US. They are always ready to do more, to try the latest medications or surgical procedures, because, well, why take a chance? Compared with other western countries, the US does more invasive studies of the heart for patients with chest pain, without actually improving their outcomes. We in the US put more of our patients into the intensive care unit, even though they are, on average, less sick than their counterparts abroad. We give more chemotherapy to cancer patients near the ends of their disease, even though it improves neither the quality nor the length of their lives. We do these things because we can, because to do otherwise would be considered giving up – even if doing less would be an extremely sensible and kind decision.Influenza is not cancer, and it is not heart disease. But the US approach to it is emblematic of the way it treats most diseases: doing more is better. If there is an unexhausted option, exhaust it. And because many vaccines have had spectacular success in preventing and eradicating some ghastly infectious diseases, the expectation is that the influenza vaccine will do the same. It’s another hi-tech solution. To most people, the word “vaccine” is tantamount to a guarantee that a disease will leave you alone.It’s hard to make a catchy public service announcement that reflects the subtleties therein. “Vaccinate everyone over six months old” is the current message. It is easy to understand and easy to remember. A more accurate message is much clumsier: “Vaccinate school-aged children and pregnant women and probably elderly people (but the evidence is mixed) and those with chronic conditions, but no need to vaccinate young, healthy adults.” That wouldn’t really fit on a billboard. In this case, nuance may invite danger.The quest for a better influenza vaccine continues. The holy grail would be a vaccine that covers all possible strains of influenza (so there would be no problem of mismatched vaccination) and that needs to be given only once, not every year as is now the case. Dozens of research labs across the world have worked to create this so-called universal vaccine, but so far without success. The influenza virus is just too adept at changing its disguise, remaining one step ahead of our efforts to neutralise it with a one-shot-fits-all vaccine. Although influenza is a common illness, finding an effective vaccine to prevent it remains an exceptionally challenging endeavour.Adapted from Influenza: The Quest to Cure the Deadliest Disease in History by Jeremy Brown, published by Text on 31 January at £12.99.

The first two iterations of Brexit secretary hadn’t gone well. David Davis had been too lazy and too dim to do anything very much, while Dominic Raab had been under the impression that he was in control of the process and de facto prime minister. In Stephen Barclay, Theresa May had finally found a square peg for a square hole. A man with the perfect CV. One that was almost entirely blank.Barclay is no fool. Far from it. It takes a man of above average intelligence to recognise that his primary role is to understand as little as possible about Brexit. A job he performs with the utmost diligence by going to extraordinary lengths to remain uninformed. His ignorance is a conscious act. Every day is a battle to ward off civil servants tempting him with briefing notes, and to make sure he knows a little less than he did before. Give him time and he’ll barely be able to remember he’s a government minister. Much like everyone else.All this intensive training to know nothing pays idends when he’s called upon to make an appearance in the House of Commons. Because you can’t be accused of deliberately giving MPs the wrong information if you genuinely have no idea what it is you are meant to be talking about. And a measure of his success is that now almost no one bothers to turn up to hear him any more – a win-win situation for everyone.Barclay’s reputation precedes him. With just 64 days until Brexit day, and the government clueless about what to do next, you might have expected a packed house for Brexit departmental questions. Far from it. Just a dozen Tory backbenchers and less than 30 opposition MPs bothered to make the effort. If you’re looking for answers to Brexit questions, then the Brexit secretary is the last person to whom you would turn.Even so, a few brave and persistent souls did try to elicit some information. Presumably, they had nothing better to do. The Scottish National party’s Philippa Whitford got things under way by asking about medicine stockpiling in Scotland. Barclay appeared generally bewildered. He’d never heard of Scotland. Labour’s Jo Stevens tried a different tack with a question about the boss of Airbus having said the government’s Brexit planning had been a disgrace.Hmm, let me think, said Barclay. Airbus, Airbus. The name rang a vague bell. Though hopefully his mind would be a total blank by the evening. His Random Word Generator cranked into action. Of course he took the warnings very seriously but he wanted to stress there was a lot of positivity with Airbus and that’s why the company was backing the prime minister. It was an unusual take that seemed to take even his colleagues by surprise.Tory Glyn Davies hastily changed the subject, as it had belatedly come to his attention that the sheep farmers in his Wales constituency could be financially screwed after Brexit. Barclay’s reply was another masterclass. He was sure the Welsh sheep farmers would be just fine, so long as they had Davies as their MP to ask questions about why they were going out of business. The Brexit minister could talk for hours without ever actually saying anything meaningful.Other questions came and went without Barclay or his junior ministers – a crack team of highly trained nonentities who have fully taken on board the mission to know nothing – letting slip any information. The closest we got to news was that all sheep would continue to be sheep after Brexit, but some cows may no longer identify as cows.The shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, committed a classic category error by assuming Barclay was involved in the formation of government policy. Time was running out and the prime minister was still being vague about what changes she was hoping to make to her plan that had been resoundingly defeated last week. Would the minister care to enlighten the house?He wouldn’t. That kind of knowledge was so restricted that not even Theresa May had access to it. But everyone should chill out a bit. There was still 64 days to go. That was loads of time, when you came to think about it. Yes, the government might have had a teeny weeny bit of a setback with its 230-vote defeat, but it was now actively engaged in the process of not listening to people. So things were looking up. Perhaps everyone would like to join in a sing-song: “Always look on the bright side of life…”A deadly lethargy descended on the Commons. Bodies felt heavy and minds became confused. Barclay smiled. Mission accomplished."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1453972616579252c1150ddd959af093d18ede77/1593_825_1880_1128/master/1880.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=804e207c4a08dff1bae58b355484ec43","title":"how ukip embraced the far right podcast","story":"With Brexit talks stalled and some of its supporters pushing a betrayal narrative, the ’s Peter Walker charts how Ukip has begun rising in the polls again.

Number 10 has signalled this will not happen. But in an interview for Newsnight, being broadcast tonight, she said:At the moment there is a lot of change going on. I have called for a free vote for the amendments on Tuesday, and we’ll see what position the government takes.She also refused to rule out resigning if ordered to vote against the Yvette Cooper amendment intended to allow MPs to block a no-deal Brexit. (See 1.05pm.) Asked if she would be willing to quit the government to vote for the amendment, she replied:I’m going to stick to trying to persuade the government to allow it to be a free vote. There is a lot taking place and there are a lot of new amendments. We’ll have to wait and see.In a speech in Davos Philip Hammond, the chancellor, said a no-deal Brexit would amount to a “betrayal”. He said:In the 2016 referendum a promise was made to the majority who voted for Brexit – that they were voting for a more prosperous future.Not leaving would be seen as a betrayal of that referendum decision.But leaving without a deal would undermine our future prosperity, and would equally represent a betrayal of the promises that were made.And that is why I, having campaigned vigorously to remain, in the referendum have come to believe that the only credible and sustainable solution is for us to leave the European Union.To honour the referendum decision but to do so in a way that protects our economy in order to allow us to deliver that future prosperity that those voters were promised when they voted to leave the EU.The only sustainable solution is a negotiated settlement with the EU.John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, says, given Theresa May’s refusal to rule out a no-deal Brexit, Hammond should resign. In a statement he said:The chancellor must now surely consider his position in the government. Philip Hammond’s comments today demonstrate he has acknowledged the damage a no-deal Brexit would do to our economy, jobs and living standards.If the prime minister fails to listen to his warnings and continues to refuse to take no deal off the table there is no other option, he must resign.May, like Hammond, has repeatedly said she does not want a no-deal Brexit, but she has refused to explicitly rule it out. She is worried that, if she were to do that, MPs would no longer feel under pressure to back her deal.Here is the question all Westminster, and half the EU, would like answered. It is from Spartakboro BTL.\u0027Referring to her Brexit discussions with Theresa May yesterday afternoon, Sturgeon said that the prime minister “refused to really listen to any of the concerns we brought”, and reiterated her call for May to pause article 50 and hold a second referendum on EU membership.\u0027Barnier is saying nothing can stop the UK Brexit. May won\u0027t budge from my deal or no deal, Corbyn ain\u0027t budging from GE and full CU membership and SNP can only shout at windmills in the twilight.In your considered opinion, at this stage, is there anyway a no deal can be stopped?Yes, it can - but I think you are right to put the question in these terms. A lot of Westminster commentary is framed around the proposition that a no-deal Brexit would be so unthinkable that it is unthinkable - or at least, very unlikely. There is an assumption that rational actors will always act rationally. But (leaving aside the issue of whether all players in the Brexit drama do qualify as rational actors), history shows us that that is not always the case. World War One would be a classic example, Vietnam another. (That prompted a wonderful book about how some of the cleverest people ever to run a US administration could end up responsible for one of the biggest foreign policy disasters of all time.) That’s why I agree with Sir Ivan Rogers, the most astute of all the Brexit commentators, who said in a lecture (pdf) on Tuesday that “we have reached an impasse and ... the risks are appreciably higher than either the markets or the commentariat believe.”You’ve got a good summary of the various intractables that make it hard to see how a no-deal Brexit can be avoided before 29 March. So how can it be stopped? In one sense it is quite simple some of those involved who have put down red lines will have to abandon them. That happens all the time, and it explains why journalists are always on the alert for the slightest hint that a “line” is changing.But what makes this problematic is that several compromises might be necessary, and some of them are at the outer boundaries of probability.Here are various things that could happen that would led to a no-deal Brexit on 29 March being stopped, roughly in order of how likely they seem. (Some of them might occur in combination.)1) May and the EU agree to extend article 50 just to buy more time. Both sides would be reluctant to do this, especially if there were no guarantee that delaying would help resolve the deadlock. But stopping the clock may seem preferable to going over the cliff. However, this does not necessarily avoid no deal. It might just postpone it.2) Parliament forces May to apply for extra time. This is a variant of 1), but perhaps less likely because, even though MPs will probably vote for the Yvette Cooper amendment next week, it is a bit harder to see that leading to a bill successfully getting through both Houses of Parliament.3) Mainstream Tories who voted against May’s Brexit deal earlier this month swallow their doubts and support her - panicked by the prospect of a no deal, and perhaps encouraged by some modest concessions from the EU. But there aren’t enough of them so you would also need ...4) Some Labour MPs start to line up behind May, also horrified by the prospect of what a no-deal Brexit might mean for their constituents.5) The EU blinks, and agrees to the key Tory Brexiter demand to abandon the backstop - or at least largely abandon it, perhaps in the form of subjecting it to a time limit.(By now we’re into the highly improbable. From here, it gets even more fanciful.)6) A fundamental Conservative party split leads to May losing a vote of confidence, and a general election being called. (May could also decide to trigger one herself, although given that many of her candidates would refuse to commit to voting for her deal, it is very, very hard to see why she would.) But this would not necessarily avoid no deal forever, because it could just take us back to a hung parliament.7) A government - perhaps May’s, or perhaps one that emerges from a confidence vote - agrees to pass legislation for a second referendum, as a means of resolving the impasse. (The chances of MPs voting for a second referendum are a bit higher, but without a government committed to implementing legislation - which would be complicated - a vote alone would count for little.)8) May strikes a deal with Labour MPs (perhaps Jeremy Corbyn, perhaps leading backbenchers), and comes up with a plan for a softish Brexit acceptable to at least 326 centrist Tory and Labour MPs. A deal with Corbyn would be taking us into government of national unity territory.So, in short, a no-deal Brexit can be stopped. But it is far from inevitable that it will be ...Earlier Richard Harrington, the business minister, seemed to challenge Theresa May to sack him, by saying that he would continue to speak out against a no-deal Brexit even if it led to him losing his job. (See 12.12pm.) Well, Theresa May has not taken the bait. At the afternoon lobby briefing, asked if May still had full confidence in Harrington, the prime minister’s spokeswoman said: “Yes.” The prime minister expects ministers to be focused on getting the government’s deal through.And Leo Varadkar, the Irish prime minister, has also been at Davos. As RTE’s Tony Connelly reports, Varadkar said, in the event of a no-deal Brexit, Northern Ireland would have to remain in full regulatory and customs alignment with the EU anyway, to comply with the terms of the Good Friday agreement.In response, Nigel Dodds, the DUP deputy leader, has accused Varadkar of being wrong and unhelpful. In a statement Dodds said:We want the 2016 referendum result to be honoured and leave the European Union through a sensible deal which works for every part of the United Kingdom and also our neighbours in the Republic of Ireland. I reject Leo Varadkar’s analysis. It is not a constructive contribution when we are focused on trying to reach a consensus. In any case, the Taoiseach’s comments about the Belfast agreement actually ride a coach and horses through that agreement. Mr Varadkar is evidently and understandably concerned about the impact of a ‘no deal’ on the Republic of Ireland but this is a time to tone down the rhetoric and keep cool heads.Darren McCaffrey from Euronews has been monitoring what EU leaders at Davos have been saying about Brexit.Sebastian Kurz, the Austrian president, said the EU would agree to a short extension of article 50.But the Lithuanian president, Dalia Grybauskaitė, said a no-deal Brexit would be better than a lengthy extension of article 50.The Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable has renewed his call for an extension of article 50. In a statement he said:The warning from Airbus is a stark reminder that the livelihoods of thousands of British workers are at risk from the UK leaving the EU with no deal.The longer the prime minister runs down the clock and fails to give businesses certainty to plan, the greater the risk to jobs. An extension of article 50 is now the only responsible course and the government should back a people’s vote and give the public the final say with an option to remain in the EU.Tim Roache, the GMB general secretary, was the fourth union leader to meet Theresa May to discuss Brexit. He saw her earlier this afternoon, and as he came out he issued this statement. He said:I’m afraid to say the prime minister today failed to give us the guarantees we need over protecting jobs and rights at work.The concerns from members and their employers are mounting by the day as the clock runs down, and yet the prime minister is still refusing to take her threat of no deal off the table.We can’t carry on like this. As this crisis worsens, pretending nothing has changed is simply not good enough.The current deal doesn’t cut it. It pleases no one. We need a permanent customs union, legally binding commitments to workers’ rights that can’t be ignored or ripped up by a future Tory government and a policy agenda that tackles the reasons people voted to leave in the first place.I asked for an extension to article 50 but sadly the prime minister did not agree."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ebb573281467845123c913d9421c2a30fed36dbb/0_0_6016_3611/master/6016.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=02c7b6e3c51370d323220fac24c7a5cd","title":"young people how do you feel about your future","story":"With 18-year-olds watching the outcome of Brexit unravel in front of them, we want to hear what you thinkFor years, it has been assumed that young people do not vote, do not take part in politics, and do not care.

Researchers at the University of Cambridge have discovered that they have a genetic advantage over their overweight friends who live and eat in the same way that they do.Prof Sadaf Farooqi at the Wellcome-MRC Institute of Metabolic Science recruited 2,000 healthy but thin iniduals for a study called Stilts (Study Into Lean and Thin Subjects) to find out whether there was something particular about their lives or their genes. All had a BMI of less than 18, which is technically underweight, but they were healthy and did not have an eating disorder. The identification and recruitment of this cohort was supported by the National Institute for Health Research.The study, which was published in the journal Plos Genetics, examined the DNA of nearly 1,600 members of the thin cohort and 2,000 people who were severely obese, comparing both with a further 10,400 people of normal weight.The team found several common genetic variants already identified as playing a role in obesity. In addition, they found new genetic regions involved in severe obesity and some involved in healthy thinness. They calculated a genetic risk score from their findings.“As anticipated, we found that obese people had a higher genetic risk score than normal-weight people, which contributes to their risk of being overweight. The genetic dice are loaded against them,” said Dr Inês Barroso, whose team at the Wellcome Sanger Institute carried the genetic analysis.The thin people, on the other hand, had a much lower genetic risk score. Three out of four of them came from families whose members also had a tendency to be thin and healthy.“This research shows for the first time that healthy thin people are generally thin because they have a lower burden of genes that increase a person’s chances of being overweight and not because they are morally superior, as some people like to suggest,” said Farooqi. “It’s easy to rush to judgment and criticise people for their weight, but the science shows that things are far more complex. We have far less control over our weight than we might wish to think.”Other scientists pointed out that genes were not the only answer. Tom Sanders, emeritus professor of nutrition and dietetics at King’s College London, said: “This is an important and well-conducted study confirming that precocious severe obesity is often genetically determined and showing convincingly that those who are very thin are genetically different from the general population.“However, most obesity is acquired in adult life and is linked to the obesogenic environment we live in (a sedentary lifestyle and abundance access to calorie-dense foods). Furthermore, genetic differences are unable to explain the large rise in the prevalence of obesity in children under six years old, which may have its origin in pregnancy and early infancy when appetite is programmed in the offspring.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6b377d765f8fd7c884ff15907b0c59ee1e517df8/0_170_4198_2519/master/4198.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=503a4c68715980d75967dbd1e26a8b22","title":"australian open 2019 naomi osaka power sets up final against petra kvitova","story":"If Naomi Osaka goes on to add the Australian Open title to the debut slam title she won in Flushing Meadows four months ago, she might spare a passing nod of gratitude for the player she beat there in extraordinary circumstances, Serena Williams.There were moments in her semi-final win over Karolina Pliskova on day 11 of this tournament when she was in danger of surrendering dominance to the Czech (who had come back from 1-5 in the third to beat Williams two days earlier, snuffing out an Osaka-Williams rematch), but, as in New York, it was apparent that Osaka was again sound under pressure.In the US Open final, she had the meltdown of Williams to deal with, and she handled that with the ice-cool aplomb, emerging from the unedifying episode as a dignified young champion on all fronts. This examination was more physical than mental.On a blistering hot Thursday afternoon, she turned back the cooler, more orthodox challenge of Pliskova, an elegant and dangerous foe in tight corners, who was rattled by Osaka’s astonishing onslaught in the first set and, after mounting a fightback to level, could not crack her defence in the third.Pliskova was effusive later in her praise of Osaka: “She played an unbelievable match – to be honest, maybe the best in her life. I don’t think she can repeat a match like this. I don’t think I actually did much wrong. I had some chances, of course I had. But the chances, they were not in my hands at all. There was not much I could do.”Naomi Osaka revealed sponsor Nissin has apologised to her over a cartoon depiction that sparked accusations of whitewashing. An anime-style drawing of the 21-year-old US Open champion, who has a Japanese mother and Haitian father, with pale skin and brown hair was used in an advert for the noodle company that has since been pulled.Osaka said: “I’ve talked to them. They’ve apologised. For me, it’s obvious, I’m tan. I don’t think they did it on purpose to be whitewashing or anything. But ..\u0026nbsp the next time they try to portray me or something, I feel like they should talk to me about it.” PAOsaka, never less than candid, smiled and responded: “I don’t necessarily think I played the best I’ve ever played. What I take away from this is that I never gave up. That’s something that I’m really proud of.”If Osaka holds her resolve in the final against two-time Wimbledon champion Petra Kvitova on Saturday, she will make a statement that would lift her from precocious and interesting newcomer to recognised elite champion.When it became obvious early in their semi-final that Pliskova could not do to Osaka what she had done to Williams, the final, the tournament and the game in general took on a different complexion. Osaka is not just a lovable cross-culture kid with a vigorous, high-level game and nice line in post-match quotes. She has matured into a threat to everyone in women’s tennis, here and across the Tour.In the earlier semi-final, the first reality check of the day kicked in. Danielle Collins had served an acceptable 11 double-faults in her first five matches, but added two in the space of four games, the nerves of a big occasion strangling her best work. Kvitova, bringing bigger weapons in all departments, attacked her second serve relentlessly, but Collins found a way to stay on level terms after four games.They exchanged breaks in-mid-set, but in the clink and shift of gears that control the roof above, an outdoor tournament went indoors at four-all. The beating sun had pushed the thermometer to 35C (it would continue on to near 40C) and into the tournament’s danger zone – but there was still plenty of heat coming off both rackets.It will be hotter on Saturday, Much hotter. But the debate about use of the roof is not as simple as some would suggest. Of course, the health of the players is paramount, as is that of the officials and ballkids – although the latter live in this heat. It is not as novel to them as it might be to visitors from the northern hemisphere. If the roof is to be used, it should be to the guidelines already set, not the emotional whim of concerned onlookers.Kvitova grew up in the Czech Republic and, as they progressed in the protective enclosure created by the roof switch, she looked increasingly more comfortable against the Floridian, who is used to the sunny conditions.Collins was perfectly within her rights to insist later: “It is what it is. That’s what they do, no matter what the situation is. If it’s really hot, they need to start the match the way it’s going to finish. It certainly changed a little bit of the rhythm in the match. Honestly, I like playing in the heat. Don’t get me wrong, it certainly has its challenges. I grew up in Florida and am used to it being really hot all the time. So I embrace that very well. Indoor tennis is a different game.”Collins, who does not hide her emotions, gave the chair umpire Carlos Ramos grief over a legitimate ruling on Kvitova’s serve, but should have trained her frustration at Kvitova, who now punished her short balls to take the first set.Collins’s discipline slipped again at the start of the second, arguing an unwinnable point with Ramos, then changing rackets for no apparent reason with two break points against her. She saved the first but dumped a backhand, and Kvitova started to ease clear.Kvitova brought all her pedigree and experience to bear now on her rattled opponent, racing to then serving out the match."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/65eea1e3ee449ac43d567b81587f1385bb4bde76/155_417_2415_1450/master/2415.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6391e61736c99bf64a4f6b1e8769915f","title":"rafael nadal dismantles stefanos tsitsipas to reach australian open final","story":"John McEnroe does not get a lot wrong. However, when he suggested a few days ago that Stefanos Tsitispas’s victory over Roger Federer might represent a changing of the guard, he momentarily forgot the championship heart and pedigree of Rafael Nadal, who will play in his fifth Australian Open final on Sunday after slaying the young Greek on a warm Melbourne evening.Nadal, the 2009 champion, could well win his second title here, drawing him to within two majors of Federer’s 20 slams, and inviting speculation that, if he were to go on to prevail at Roland Garros (one of the safest bets in tennis), he would arrive at Wimbledon staring history in the face again. The guard is not for changing just yet.The 32-year-old Spaniard – who retired injured in the quarter-finals last year – has arrived back in the harsh southern limelight by beating a couple of Australian underdogs in James Duckworth and Matthew Ebden, then set about their fledgling compatriot Alex de Minaur, before trouncing his old foe Tomas Berdych and, to get to Thursday’s semi-final, the ebullient ball of American energy Frances Tiafoe.All of that occupied Nadal less than 10 and a half hours and 15 sets. He spent only an hour and 46 minutes accounting for the tired but willing challenge of Tsitsipas, the player hailed, by McEnroe and many others, as the leader of the new wave.Nadal won 6-2, 6-4, 6-0 and has not looked as dominant at this stage of a slam since Roland Garros last year even on his favourite surface there, he lost a set, to Diego Schwartzman. This is his first run to a slam final without dropping a set since the 2017 French Open.Yet there were reasons to wonder. Three weeks ago, he pulled out of the Brisbane International to rest a thigh strain, a sorry continuation of his wretched run of injuries in 2018, when he played in only nine tournaments as fault lines in his hip, knee, abdomen and ankle threatened to bring his career to a painful close.Yet here he is again, winning a semi-final on a hard court – and persuading McEnroe, in his role as courtside jester, to now praise him as the nemesis of the Next Gen pretenders.“They don’t need any message,” Nadal said. “They are good, improving every month. It is always a big challenge to play against them. There is a new and very good generation coming. They are here now.”He said of Tsitsipas, who has had a remarkable tournament: “He’s brave, goes to the net often. He has everything to be a multi-grand slam champion. I hope to play him again in the next couple of years.”He added: “A few weeks ago in Brisbane, talking to the tournament director there, I had to take a very tough decision. It was difficult to imagine then that I would be where I am now. I feel really, really well.”Tsitsipas, who had taken 15 hours and 31 minutes to reach his first slam semi-final, signalled his intentions early, serve-volleying with brio. But Nadal struck first when he forced an uncontrolled backhand from Tsitsipas that lobbed in the tramlines. He broke again then ground out the points to take the set in half an hour.Tsitsipas, having taken care of business brilliantly against Federer, was discovering that backing up against the player who may go on to secure as many slams as the Swiss genius, was no straightforward exercise.The 20-year-old Greek tennis classicist with the flowing locks and the single-handed backhand was shattered but philosophical later.“I have no idea what I can take from that match,” he said. “It’s not that I was even close to getting to something. I only got six games. I feel very strange. I feel happy with my performance in this tournament but, at the same time, I feel disappointed. It’s a very weird feeling. It’s annoying that I didn’t get close to breaking him. He’s very aggressive from the baseline.“It felt like a different dimension of tennis. He gives you no rhythm. He plays just a different game style than the rest of the players. He has this talent that no other player has. I’ve never seen a player have this. He makes you play bad.”Awaiting Nadal will be either Novak Djokovic, whom he has beaten 25 times in 52 matches, or Lucas Pouille, who has won one of their three encounters. Djokovic and Pouille meet in the second semi-final on Friday.Djokovic, the world No 1 still unless Nadal wins on Sunday, knows better than most that this first major of the season can change careers. He said after Kei Nishikori quit injured in their quarter-final: “This was my first grand slam trophy back when I was 20 years old, and that opened a lot of doors for me. That was a huge confidence boost, a springboard for the rest of my career.”He said of Pouille: “It’s his first semi-final at a slam but he has won against Nadal in New York some years ago, and he’s made a couple of advances at the big tournaments. He’s not afraid to play his best at the biggest stage in sports. I expect him to come out, be very confident – as he always is.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d6fc7ee11bbaf1819e2f30daea9e939746109735/0_68_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=98abcec6be661a0521ab320ec5d4ffe0","title":"talking horses dounikos can land valuable thyestes chase gowran presenting percy horse racing tips","story":"A little more than 300 days after his victory in the 2018 RSA Chase at Cheltenham, Presenting Percy returned to action here on Thursday and immediately dispelled any doubts about his wellbeing with a comfortable one-and-a-quarter length success in the Galmoy Hurdle.

Presenting Percy took the same race last year, having already made a promising start to his chasing career, then took in the Red Mills Chase here in February on the way to a polished success in the RSA.

However, Philip Reynolds, the eight-year-old’s owner, is much more comfortable in front of a microphone and confirmed after Thursday’s success that it has only been the unusually fast ground that has kept Presenting Percy off the track. “It’s not that he doesn’t like good ground, as a matter of fact, I could argue that he could be better on it and we haven’t really seen him on it yet. We haven’t run him because we didn’t want to start him off on that sort of ground, and this is real soft ground here. It was every bit as testing today as it was last year, and it looked a similar sort of a race and pace, and he finished in a similar way.” Presenting Percy has progressed rapidly throughout his career, both as a hurdler and after switching to fences last season, and has shown his aptitude for Cheltenham with a win at the Festival meeting in each of the last two seasons. Bookmakers were quick to trim his odds further after Thursday’s win, and he is now a general 3-1 chance for the Gold Cup with Native River, on 11-2, the only other contender at a single-figure price. His relative inexperience over fences remains the primary concern, both for punters and his connections, though Presenting Percy’s backers could point out that it did not stop Coneygree winning the Gold Cup on only his fourth chase start in 2015.It’s just as well the Thyestes is on because we’ve lost our two jumps cards in Britain, at Wetherby and Fakenham, both frozen. At Southwell, I like 9-2 Handsome Bob (1.15) in the opener, Keith Dalgleish’s charge having produced a career best on his first start here last month. Later, 11-4 is fine about Temur Khan (2.55), who also benefited for the switch to Fibresand when landing a maiden here three weeks ago. The four-year-old looks nicely treated on that evidence as he makes his second start in a handicap.Colwood (7.25) is the sensible pick at Chelmsford tonight, this ex-French 4-1 shot having got off the mark on his second start for Robert Eddery before Christmas. The slightly mad pick, in the opening hands and heels race, is Mystical Moon (4.25) at 50-1. She hasn’t achieved much but she led to the furlong pole in a Wolves novice last time and hasn’t had many chances in handicaps. She comes from an in-form yard, will be ridden by a jockey with a fair strike-rate and could outrun her odds."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a430250ba6c0bcde7ba5c22baf40e72487e007b1/0_0_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e997d2d2a8435cc547a284f0ff410055","title":"five things every aspiring vegan should have in their kitchen","story":"From flax seeds to coconut oil, these ingredients will make your Veganuary easy and deliciousIt’s a common misconception that being vegan is both tricky and dull. The truth is, there are simple food switches we can make to eat fewer animal products, and with the likes of Ben \u0026amp Jerry’s introducing non-dairy versions of some of its most popular flavours, being vegan is now easier than ever.Here are five simple store cupboard updates that will help you be a little more vegan …Flax seedsThe sheer number of things you can use flax seeds for is, quite frankly, mind-boggling.First off, flax eggs. One tablespoon of ground flax seeds mixed with 2-3 tablespoons of warm water becomes a mixture that has the same texture and volume as egg white. You can use these flax eggs in place of chicken’s eggs when binding bakes or adding body to things such as pancakes.Ground flax seeds are also a powerful thickening agent for everything from porridge oats to pasta sauces. Adding a subtle nutty taste and a slightly crunchy texture, they work best with deep flavours such as curries.What makes flax seeds even more essential for vegans is that they contain omega-3, the same kind of good fats you get from oily fish. These oils are essential for optimal brain function, blood flow and can even help reduce the risk of heart disease, so if you’re not getting enough flax seeds in your diet, now’s a great time to start.Keep them whole, boil them with some water and you can even make your own glue or hair gel with them – check out the videos online if you don’t believe us.A word of warning: once ground, flax seeds start to lose their beneficial properties over time, so if you buy them whole, grind them up in a smoothie maker and store them in the fridge. That way, you’ll get the most from these mighty, mini seeds.ChickpeasWhen we say chickpeas, you probably think hummus, and rightly so. Hummus has become a firm favourite in the UK over the past decade, enhancing mealtimes as a condiment and serving up a time-saving savoury snack when combined with veggies or pitta bread.If you have a blender and have never made hummus, you’re missing a trick. It’s a whizz – just blitz a can of chickpeas with a tablespoon or two of tahini, olive oil, lemon juice and salt, then add a teaspoon of water at a time until it all turns into that wonderfully familiar, rich, pale, hummusy-textured gloop.Chickpeas aren’t just tasty, though – they’re an excellent source of complex carbs and fibre.And whatever you do with your can of chickpeas, don’t throw away the water. Known as aquafaba, this juice is rich in starch and is a great egg replacement for making meringues or macarons.Pasta sauceWe’re all busy people, and having a staple, cost-effective “meal in minutes” recipe can be the difference between success and failure when embarking on a new diet. What’s handy is that vegan quick fixes can be pretty similar to non-vegan ones, with a piping hot, saucy bowl of pasta being up there with the best of them.Other than puttanesca, which contains anchovies, most jars of tomato-based pasta sauces are free of animal product.Nutritional yeastThe name might make you think of baking and bread, but unlike traditional yeast, nutritional yeast is deactivated, so it doesn’t rise when warmed and wet. It has a distinctly nutty, cheesy taste and looks a lot like fish food flakes.An insider vegan secret for a long time, these tart, deep and earthy-tasting flakes can be sprinkled over pasta as a parmesan replacement, combined with probiotics, ground cashews and agar-agar – a vegan gelatine substitute – to make vegan cheese. They’re also excellent in a crumb coating when whizzed up with some flax seeds.Coconut oilIn a world with no dairy, coconut oil reigns supreme as the most indulgent alternative around. Combined with almond butter and some agave, it’s a sweet, satisfying snack. Melted and ready to get sizzly, it’s the base flavour for the richest stir-fries and curries. And if you’re using cold-pressed coconut oil in baking, it adds a creamy, subtly tropical aroma and taste to everything from brownies to cookies.Melting at around 24C (76F), it tends to stay solid at room temperature in most climates, and in a similar way to cocoa butter, becomes liquid when melted in our hands or mouth.In addition, cold-pressed oil – the pricier variety – can raise levels of good cholesterol. Meanwhile, the cheaper, standard coconut oil carries no coconut flavour, so is an excellent, versatile fat for cooking coconut flavour-free dishes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/80e5a1c12521a64d3cea857c1fac9bf31f03c908/0_0_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=700\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=max\u0026s=11d5f2a567295cadb85321cfe3f9b4cb","title":"from ice cream to nice cream the inside scoop on the ice cream revolutionaries","story":" In 1978, Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield set out to make ice-cream with a difference. Here’s how Ben \u0026amp Jerry’s is still pushing boundaries and fighting for change 40 years laterWhen Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield first set up shop in an old petrol station in Burlington, Vermont, in 1978, selling scoops of homemade ice-cream, they wanted to build a company that cared as much about people as profits.Since then, their tiny ice-cream business has become a global brand whose famous flavours, including Cookie Dough and Cherry Garcia, are sold in 35 countries. Yet, Ben \u0026amp Jerry’s ethos remains the same: to “make great ice-cream in the nicest possible way”.It’s a belief that is central to everything the brand does, from its social activism to constant experimentation with new flavours. The ethos inspired Ben \u0026amp Jerry’s line of non-dairy ice-creams that was launched in the UK in 2017 to a rapturous reception from vegans. The flavours – Chunky Monkey, Chocolate Fudge Brownie and Peanut Butter \u0026amp Cookies and the new flavour Coconutterly Caramel’d – are just as inventively delicious as the brand’s dairy creations.For Ben \u0026amp Jerry’s employees, honouring the goals of its co-founders – who remain advisers to the company since being bought by Unilever in the year 2000 – is vital. “Right from the start, Cohen and Greenfield wanted the business to be a force for good,” says Rebecca Baron, the brand’s social mission manager. “Four decades on, we’re still guided by their values.”Ben \u0026amp Jerry’s three-pronged approach – making excellent ice-cream achieving financial success and using the brand to make the world a better place – stems back to ideas developed by Cohen and Greenfield in the company’s early days.The company works with social enterprises, such as Greyston Bakery in New York, which supplies the brownies that make the Chocolate Fudge Brownie flavour so enticing. “They employ people with criminal records, homeless people, recovering addicts and vulnerable women – people who are finding it hard to get a job,” says Baron. “They offer subsidised housing and healthcare to their workers.”Once Ben \u0026amp Jerry’s popularity began to grow, it quickly realised that it could use its platform to campaign on social issues. It was a discovery born of a David and Goliath tussle with its rival, Häagen-Dazs.“Greenfield had the idea to pack the ice-cream into pint-sized containers and sell it in convenience stores, but Pillsbury, who owned Häagen-Dazs, didn’t like this at all,” says Baron. “They threatened all their stores with exclusivity clauses, saying they could stock one, but not both. Ben \u0026amp Jerry’s didn’t have the resources to fight it in the courts, so Greenfield created a one-man picket outside the Pillsbury headquarters. Pictures of him were everywhere. They managed to mobilise hundreds of thousands of people to put pressure on Pillsbury to back down, which they eventually did.”The same principle is applied to its latest campaigns on issues including climate change, marriage equality, racism and refugees. The brand is currently running a company-wide campaign, lobbying the UK government to allow asylum seekers the right to work. “At the moment, they’re banned, which means people can be living in poverty for years,” says Baron. “We’re using every tool we have as a business to mobilise our fans to help us create systemic change.”One area the brand is pouring a lot of effort into is reducing its carbon footprint. Its caring dairy programme has more than 300 participating farms in the US and Europe. “The idea is that the farms that Ben \u0026amp Jerry’s offers support to have to meet high environmental standards,” says Baron. “The company is always working to move into increasingly sustainable farming practices and improve its emissions.”The launch of its almond milk-based non-dairy range – with more flavours set to arrive in Britain in 2019 – is a way to offer a lower-emission alternative to the increasing numbers of people who aren’t necessarily vegan, but want to make more ethical food choices. “So many people want to reduce their personal carbon footprint, so it’s great to give people that flexibility,” she says.And for those who are vegan, or lactose intolerant, the range aims to prove that it needn’t mean missing out. One of Ben \u0026amp Jerry’s key principles is inclusion, which its non-dairy range fits into perfectly. “We wanted to offer people who can’t – or have chosen not to – eat dairy ice-cream, an alternative that is just as good as the dairy version,” she says. “We wanted to make sure they get some love, too.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e8bc71bface7ef6903bde9854f48c8988b922630/0_0_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f948dcdbaf8026e4e43892e7df17b71a","title":"theres never been a better time to be vegan","story":"With restaurants, chefs and well-known brands introducing more vegan options than ever, sticking to a plant-based diet is now both simple and indulgent, says Club Mexicana’s Meriel Armitage A decade ago, when I decided to go vegan for ethical reasons, the word “decadent” was one you’d never have used to describe the food available. More often than not, it fitted the joyless stereotype of lentils, quinoa and tofu, with the occasional Linda McCartney vegan sausage to liven things up. Now, though, ask a vegan what they ate last night and they’re likely to say anything from pizza topped with gooey melted “cheese” to crispy fried “chicken” or pulled jackfruit burritos. The vegan scene has truly exploded, introducing food that’s exciting, colourful and indulgent, whether you’re vegan or not.When I launched my pop-up, Club Mexicana, in 2012 I wanted to challenge the boringly virtuous chickpea and chia seed perception of veganism. Inspired by my travels in the US, where vegan food is innovative and delicious, I wanted to prove that being vegan doesn’t mean missing out.I realised the joy of Mexican food doesn’t stem from the meat, but the bold, punchy flavours created by salsas and pickles – the meat is just a carrier for those flavours. We try to be as creative as possible with our dishes, which include tacos with baja “tofish” – tofu fish – and roasted cornbread with pecan mole, smoked soya yoghurt, pickled pear and smoked tomato. When we first started holding supper clubs, a lot of people didn’t even notice the food was vegan, which is what I wanted.Over the past few years, vegan ingredients have evolved rapidly, which has helped vegan cooking to become as exciting as it is. Vegan cheese used to be terrible, but now you can buy everything from vegan blue cheese and camembert to cheddar and ricotta – all tasting as piquant and decadently creamy as the real thing. At Club Mexicana, we serve deep-fried “mozzarella” sticks made with coconut oil, which are crispy on the outside and oozingly melty in the middle.People also often wrongly assume that going vegan will mean depriving themselves of indulgent desserts and treats, but that’s no longer the case either. The naughtiest dish we offer is deep-fried ice-cream doused in chocolate sauce – it really doesn’t get more indulgent than that.More and more restaurants are offering innovative vegan menus. Supermarkets now stock an amazing range of vegan food that’s expanding all the time. Brands, such as Ben \u0026amp Jerry’s, are constantly bringing out new vegan products that are causing a buzz outside, as well as inside, the vegan world.There’s never been a better time to be vegan, or just to introduce more plant-based alternatives into your everyday diet. With so many amazing colours, textures and flavours on offer, you never need to feel you’re depriving yourself of the food you love."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/da22c2d97abb78fa84079c25154eb6dd387da884/193_105_1194_716/master/1194.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=86c498a7c0126c8f5b84185440829a69","title":"can i buy a monitor for photo editing that shows colour like print","story":"Pa wants the screen image to be true to the print image, but his budget is only £300I read your answer about the best computer monitor for under £200. I’m looking for a monitor for serious photo editing. I want to get as true to what the print will be like (when printing via online printers). My budget is about £300. PaSad to say, prints can never look like screen images. Screens are bright and display colours using combinations of red, green and blue pixels (RGB). Prints don’t light up so they can’t have the same brightness or contrast range, and they’re printed using cyan, yellow, magenta and black inks (CMYK).Colours are also affected by the light under which you view things, which is why smart buyers take clothes and materials to shop doorways to see what the colours look like in daylight. Do you do the same thing when viewing prints? A print viewed under warm room lighting should not look the same as it does on a monitor set to the standard daylight colour temperature of 6500K, even though your brain will automatically try to compensate for the difference.Nonetheless, photographers can learn from experience of how colours are going to be reproduced, as long as the process is consistent. I was obliged to do this in the days before personal computing, when I edited photography magazines. Today’s DSLR cameras produce images that are much like the colour slides we used to view on lightboxes, so happily this skill has transferred. However, the more variables you can eliminate, the better your guesses should be. This is where colour gamuts, screen calibration, printer profiles and, yes, standard light sources can help.I’ve never actually tried this, but I imagine the monitor display would be disappointing. You’d have reduced the brightness and contrast range, and most people like bright, contrasty screens.I’m also not sure how well this would work when using an online printer rather than your own ink-jet. If they do their own colour profiling, their software might try to compensate for yours. You could certainly ask if their printer will respect your colour management profiles (there are “preserve embedded profiles” settings for RGB and CMYK in Adobe Photoshop), but affordable colour printing is based on a high level of automation.If your monitor produces accurate colour and the printer produces accurate colour, then the results ought to be predictable, even though the images are not identical. This is the device-independent solution that underlies the traditional answer, which is to buy a monitor with an accurate colour profile. The main ones are standard sRGB and Adobe RGB. Of course, for this to work, the whole reproduction chain must follow the same standard.The argument for using Adobe RGB is that it’s wider and includes most of the colours that a CMYK printer can print. That should be better. The argument for using 8-bit sRGB is that practically every device supports it well, and some devices don’t support anything else.If you’re producing images for internet distribution and on-screen viewing, I think you are better off sticking to sRGB. If you’re producing images for some form of printing, there’s an argument for using Adobe RGB, as long as you can be sure it will be printed that way. You’d have to check this with your online printing service. The websites I looked at all requested sRGB.Another advantage of using sRGB is that it sets a lower standard that cheap monitors can meet, though better Adobe RGB scores generally indicate a better quality monitor.It’s well over budget, but you could spend several hours a day looking at it for the next five years, or more. The price difference is only £30 a year.DisplayMate Technologies is an industry leader in the business of evaluating, calibrating and optimising displays, and Raymond Soneira – founder, president and CEO – benchmarks some flagship products for colour accuracy. His tests show that the Apple iPhone X and XS Max, Google’s Pixel 3 XL and Samsung’s Galaxy S9 and Note 9 smartphones “all provide close to textbook perfect calibration accuracy and performance that is visually indistinguishable from perfect”. They’re almost certainly better than any TV or monitor you own.Colour-accurate tablets include the Samsung Galaxy Tab S and the Apple iPad Pro 9.7 (2016). The Microsoft Surface Pro 4 also impressed: it was the best ever tablet display when tested, though since surpassed.Today, the simplest way to check a photo’s colour rendering is to view it on one of DisplayMate’s top-rated smartphones or tablets, preferably on an OLED or AMOLED screen.

At the same time it was funded by the British foreign office, the thinktank received substantial funding from three multinational tobacco companies.The conduct of the high commission raises questions about whether diplomats went against guidelines to “limit interactions” with the tobacco industry, following previous criticism of diplomatic support for the tobacco industry abroad. British and American diplomatic missions funded the thinktank, the Kuala Lumpur-based Institute for Democracy and Economic Affairs (Ideas), while it argued against tobacco taxes and plain packaging. The UK enacted plain packaging in 2014. The news follows a  analysis of free-market thinktanks around the world that have taken positions aligned with the tobacco industry. Many thinktanks argued that they recognize the risks of smoking, were independent and opposed ineffective regulation rather than all tobacco regulation. The analysis revealed at least 106 free-market thinktanks around the world took positions aligned with the tobacco industry in the past decade, accepted donations from the tobacco industry or both. Reporting by the Observer last year has also shown how how the Foreign Office championed British American Tobacco’s interests abroad.A spokesperson for Britain’s Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) told the : “The British high commission in Malaysia has not and does not co-finance or partner in any way with tobacco companies, or support projects which promote tobacco use.“All FCO-led programmes follow the standards set out by HM Treasury. They receive robust scrutiny to ensure that all spend represents value for money for UK taxpayers and advances the UN’s sustainable development goals and our foreign policy objectives.”Mary Assunta, a senior policy adviser at the Southeast Asia Tobacco Control Alliance (Seatca), said: “Ideas jumped into tobacco control only recently and was making policy statements that echoed the tobacco industry’s position.“When a group or a consultant uses certain familiar buzz words and pushes anti-health proposals, look deeper, and you will find the link to the tobacco industry.”In response to questions from the , Ideas said it followed “a strict policy of editorial independence”, and “thus no donations influence our research and analytical outputs”.In 2016, Ideas started commenting on tobacco control in Malaysia. In one example, the group’s then executive director, Wan Saiful Wan Jan, wrote a column in the national newspaper the Star criticizing the Malaysian health department’s push for plain packaging.“I don’t smoke and I get annoyed if people smoke near me,” he wrote. “But notwithstanding my attitude towards smoking, paternalistic government behaviour is more dangerous and must be rejected when we see it.”Plain packaging laws remove advertising from cigarette packs to encourage smokers to quit and deter young people from starting. The laws are part of a broader movement to control tobacco use.\u0026nbspAustralia first enacted plain packaging in 2012\u0026nbspand immediately found itself in the crosshairs of the tobacco industry, which argued plain packaging violated international trade agreements, infringed on commercial speech and is\u0026nbspineffective at reducing smoking. This analysis shows tobacco companies also funded free-market thinktanks, many of which opposed plain packaging.Tobacco taxes increase the price of cigarettes, meant to encourage smokers to quit and make cigarettes unaffordable to young people. Taxes are the most effective, yet least utilized, tobacco control tool. The biggest hurdle to enacting taxes, experts say, is the industry’s well-funded opposition.Cigarette makers argue taxes fuel black market smuggling and counterfeit production. In turn, cigarette companies and their allies say increased taxes cause violence, revenue loss and lead to more harmful cigarettes. Tobacco control experts have found companies exaggerate smuggling evidence, and groups such as the Fraser Institute often echo those concerns.In one study, an International Agency for Research in Cancer expert panel found tax avoidance does not wipe out the public health benefits of increased tobacco taxes. Researchers from the International Union Against Cancer also suggested “tobacco manufacturers are the chief beneficiaries of smuggling.Clean indoor air laws ban smoking inside, because secondhand smoke can cause smoking-related illnesses. Tobacco companies oppose these laws on the grounds they negatively impact businesses, infringe on inidual rights and are based on junk science. Although bars, restaurants and workplaces ban smoking indoors in the US and Europe, many developing countries have not.  found several thinktanks used these arguments to oppose clean indoor air laws in places such as Ghana and Hong Kong.\u0026nbspIn June 2016, Seatca warned the British high commission in Malaysia that Ideas was “mouthing the same arguments used by the tobacco industry in the UK”. Nevertheless, the high commission increased funding in 2017. The British government’s contribution grew from £46,552 ($60,299) in 2016 to £72,820 ($94,324) in 2017. That nearly made the British high commission the group’s largest funder, second only to the philanthropic arm of the Malaysian transportation conglomerate Sime Darby.At the same time, Ideas received donations from Philip Morris Singapore, Philip Morris Malaysia and Japan Tobacco International. Between 2016 and 2017, the three tobacco companies donated £42,411. British American Tobacco also said it “supports” Ideas.The British high commission provided funding to Ideas just a few years after British diplomats were criticized for aiding BAT in Pakistan and Panama, according to the Financial Times.As a result, rules established in 2013 forbade diplomats from lobbying “against any local administration’s policies that are aimed at improving public health, or engage with foreign governments on behalf of the tobacco industry”.The new rules stated diplomats “should limit interactions with the tobacco industry, including any person or organization that is likely to be working to further the interests of the tobacco industry”.Ideas received donations from the US National Endowment for Democracy (Ned) and the International Republican Institute (IRI), both groups which receive most of their funding from the American government.Ned, which gave Ideas $80,000, said it was “unaware of the funding from tobacco groups” or Ideas’s “comments on tobacco related policy in local Malaysian media”. Ned no longer funds Ideas. Ned said it provided funding to a number of other free-market focused thinktanks as recently as this year. At least four opposed plain packaging of cigarettes, including the Policy Research Institute of Market Economy in Pakistan, the Samriddhi Foundation of Nepal, the Libertarian Club Libek in Serbia and the Free Market Foundation of South Africa. Ned and IRI said its donations were not related to tobacco policy.In the US, foreign donations to American thinktanks have come under scrutiny as a form of potential lobbying.﻿While Ideas disclosed its donors, many free-market thinktanks do not, including some which received funding from western diplomats. For example, the influential Ghanaian thinktank Imani Centre for Policy and Education argued so vociferously against tobacco control that the nation’s health department quoted local activists as saying Imani was an organization which “fronts for the tobacco industry” in an official report to the WHO.Imani told the  the last tobacco industry donation it received was roughly four years ago.In one 2012 editorial, Imani’s leader argued the link between lung cancer and smoking has “yet to be empirically established”. Imani told the  it no longer denies smoking causes lung cancer. Nevertheless, the Danish embassy made Imani a key partner in an effort to modernize the Ghana Revenue Authority, providing it with more than £656,000 ($849,716).The authority of thinktanks, Barrington said, “lies in, ‘You can believe me, because I have independent research here.’ If that is compromised, people stop listening to you. You might as well go straight to the tobacco company.”In large part, tobacco companies told the  they supported like-minded organizations, like many other businesses.A spokesperson for Philip Morris International said: “We have worked, and will continue to work, with carefully selected organizations around the world who share our desire to promote policies that produce meaningful public health improvements. It is absolutely ridiculous to imply that supporting an organization would result in a group taking action they otherwise would fundamentally oppose.”Sam Cleverly, group head of corporate affairs at BAT, said: “Like many other companies, we support like-minded organizations on issues that are important to our business and our consumers.“We believe publicly elected officials should be allowed to hear all sides of any debate when formulating policy and should be trusted to make informed decisions once they have heard and considered all the arguments.”Jonathan Duce, head of external affairs for Japan Tobacco, said: “It is clear to everyone that there are health risks associated with smoking – we are fully transparent about this.” He continued: “We are not alone in our thinking and various groups across the world share our view that any regulation, tobacco-related or not, if untested and unproven, could have seriously negative knock-on effects.”﻿"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7438e63d5299a0e7c8acf2b68cd559286d7f9d27/0_67_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a9300984925e9cd03cf51aab83105254","title":"military buildup in arctic as melting ice reopens northern borders","story":"As ice melts and shipping lanes open up, geopolitical tensions are growing and old cold war bases are being reopenedThe climate crisis is intensifying a new military buildup in the Arctic, diplomats and analysts said this week, as regional powers attempt to secure northern borders that were until recently reinforced by a continental-sized ision of ice.That so-called unpaid sentry is now literally melting away, opening up shipping lanes and geo-security challenges, said delegates at the Arctic Frontiers conference, the polar circle’s biggest talking shop, who debated a series of recent escalations.Russia is reopening and strengthening cold war bases on the Kola peninsula in the far north-west of the country. Norway is beefing up its military presence in the high Arctic.Last October, Nato staged Trident Juncture with 40,000 troops, its biggest military exercise in Norway in more than a decade. A month earlier Britain announced a new “Defence Arctic Strategy” and promised a 10-year deployment of 800 commandos to Norway and four RAF Typhoons to patrol Icelandic skies. The US is also sending hundreds more marines to the region on long-term rotations and has threatened to send naval vessels through Arctic shipping lanes for the first time.While these strategic moves have echoes of the cold war, the modest buildup falls far short of that era, and there remains a strong spirit of cooperation in many areas. The current tensions are a result of a world warmed by industrial emissions. The Arctic is heating up twice as fast as the rest of the planet, shrinking sea ice and exposing more water and territory to exploitation and access.“Right now, the reasons we are seeing more military activity is that countries are worried by the spectre of open water,” one of the speakers, Klaus Dodds, a professor of geopolitics at Royal Holloway, University of London, told the . “The unique Arctic security architecture has shape and form that come from natural extremities. If the Arctic becomes just another ocean, this breaks down. It’s elemental.”The Arctic’s unique characteristics are under attack from all sides. Below, the once-frozen ocean is now mixed with warmer, more saline Atlantic waters. In the skies above, the polar vortex above is weakening, allowing intrusions of balmy air currents from the south.Sea ice is being lost at a rate of more than 10,000 tonnes per second, according to Tore Furevik, a professor at the Geophysical Institute at the University of Bergen. “We’re heading for a new and uncertain Arctic with ramifications for nature and politics,” he said. “We should strive to be less suspicious, less hostile and more open-minded if we are to deal with a problem that we have so recklessly created.”By 2035, the Arctic is forecast to be free of ice during summer, which will allow ships to sail across the north pole.Business interest is growing. For the first time, last summer, a Maersk container ship navigated the northern sea route from Asia to Europe carrying fish and electronic goods. Energy companies are exploring new oil and gas fields.Once remote regions are becoming geopolitical hotspots. Tromsø, in Norway, which hosted the conference, was once a tiny trading post. Today, it’s a tourism hub and a gateway to the mineral-rich north. “Now we have a historically strange situation with political and economic activity in the Arctic. So many people are knocking on our door, including business and state representatives from China, Pakistan, Singapore and Morocco,” the mayor, Kristin Røymo, told the . “There is also a very obvious increased naval presence.”This concerns many conference participants, who highlight the peaceful history of cross-border cooperation in the far north. Even during the cold war, there were agreements on fishing, scientific research and reindeer herding that continue today.Norwegian politicians were at pains to downplay the significance of the current military buildup. “There is no direct link between climate change and conflict,” the former defence minister Espen Barth Eide said. “It’s not because there is an immediate threat, it’s that, as an area becomes more important, it’s natural to have a heightened military presence.”He compared the situation to the South China Sea, where China, the US and other nations compete, not by firing weapons, but by demonstrating capacity and presence. “To some extent that is happening now in the Arctic,” he said, although he stressed there were no territorial disputes to inflame passions.The build-up is portrayed almost as a form of climate adaptation – strengthening the military presence along with infrastructure affected by melting permafrost.However, there are tensions. In a keynote speech, the Norwegian foreign minister, Ine Marie Eriksen Søreide, complained about communications interference by Russia in the far north. She plans to arrange a meeting with the Russian deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, to discuss the allegation. “Most important is to open political dialogue and talk not just about what we agree on but what we do not agree on,” she said.Norway is also contributing to the climate problem and the strategic tensions. It has just approved a raft of new oil exploration licenses in the Barents Sea and one of its citizens has been caught spying in Russia.Russia is uneasy about recent Nato exercises that have pushed deep into the north, according to Teimuraz Ramishvili, the ambassador to Norway. He told the  the military modernisation on the Russian side was overdue after 20 years of neglect and its significance should not be overstated.“In Europe, you have military installations that are used for peaceful purposes. Why it that OK in Europe, but not in Russia?” he asked. He said Moscow put a high priority on the northern region, where the potential was so great that some talk enthusiastically of an “Arctic age”.“For us, this is a matter of sustainable development of Russian territory. This is not open water, it is Russian territory,” said Ramishvili. “The Arctic isn’t a nature resort. It’s a place where Russians have lived for a long time.”Currently, cargo companies that use the northern shipping lanes need to pay Russia. But this will change as the sea ice recedes and Arctic routes open up in international waters. China, which has declared itself a “near-Arctic nation”, is among the countries exploring this area. Last year, it launched a second Snow Dragon ice breaker and released an Arctic white paper that explored the potential for infrastructure investments in a Polar Silk Road.The US, by comparison, is lagging behind. Although its nuclear submarines have operated under the ice for decades, its surface navy is ill-equipped for the Arctic. “Everyone’s up there but us,” the navy secretary, Richard Spencer, complained last month.“The threat is back on. This is an area … we need to focus on,” he said. Spencer has called for a strategic Arctic port in Alaska and US naval vessels to conduct navigation operations later this year in northern shipping lanes so they have the capacity to conduct emergency operations if necessary. “Can you imagine a Carnival line cruise ship having a problem, and the Russians do the search and do the extraction?” he said.The prospect of a US warship sailing near Russia’s vast northern border would certainly amplify unease, as well as highlighting the geopolitical challenges caused by global heating.Lisa Murkowski, a US senator for Alaska, did not expect the US navy to enter Russian waters, but, considering everything else that is going on, she said any freedom of navigation mission in the region would raise sensitivity.“It’s important for the US to project military strength, but there should be no intention to be unduly provocative,” she told the conference. The problem, she said, was that the White House had not updated its strategy to deal with a fast-changing region. “Under this administration, we are not assigning a significant priority to our role as an Arctic nation. There is a void,” she said.Environmentalists at the conference highlighted the dual role of oil in worsening the tension: both as a driver of climate change and of the push for more resource extraction from the still largely pristine Arctic. Norway came under fire for approving 83 new exploration licenses last week, more than a dozen of which were in the Barents Sea.“The false narrative of this conference is that Arctic countries are doing sustainable development,” said Martin Sommerkorn, head of conservation of the WWF Arctic Programme. “You can’t say that just days after you grant 83 new licenses. That’s completely wrong.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fef2eff24f487bde31a733cb2aa260ed0b4014f4/57_0_2400_1440/master/2400.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=efed841b8efc959af15b8bc000793de0","title":"racism parents teach children","story":"As images of teens seemingly mocking protesters and giving apparent Nazi salutes go viral, parents can help ensure children understand sensitive issuesIt’s now common to come across a headline about videos or photos of teens that goes viral and strikes a nerve. Teenagers posing with Nazi salutes, painting on blackface and, most recently with the students from Covington Catholic high school, seemingly mocking Native American protesters. What may initially be seen as a joke between friends suddenly delivers hurt, frustration and backlash from thousands on social media.Many come to the teens’ defense, saying that kids will be kids as adolescents, they have and will always do some stupid things. “Until 10 minutes ago, it was broadly agreed in our culture that kids are allowed to do some dumb things because they’re kids,” said Kyle Smith for the National Review in response to the backlash against the students from Covington Catholic high school.But experts in youth and teenage behavior say this behavior isn’t inevitable. There are ways parents and teachers can help ensure a child has the maturity and understanding to think about sensitive issues such as race before they behave inappropriately.“We could raise a future of anti-racist youth if we wanted to,” said Jennifer Harvey, author of Raising White Kids: Bringing Up Children in a Racially Unjust America and professor of philosophy and religion at Drake University. “That’s the work we have to be doing in a very proactive, every single day kind of way to reduce the incidents that are happening in the first place.”Parents, specifically white parents, can develop tools needed to raise children who are sensitive to race, Harvey said. For example, teaching children that race doesn’t matter can be counterproductive to achieving equality.“If you’re living in a society where people are not being treated equally … that position ends up enabling racism to thrive,” Harvey said.For example, if a five-year-old child never sees an African American doctor, they will assume African Americans can’t be doctors unless their parents have discussed structural racism with them, Harvey said. “That’s just how kids’ brains work.”Evan Apfelbaum, an associate professor at Boston University’s Questrom School of Business focused on social psychology and ersity, agreed that it’s good to start teaching children about race when they’re young.“Having these tough, uncomfortable conversation at home in advance, in a structured setting, is one way to help prepare kids for facing these types of complex things in the real world,” he said.Parents can use such viral videos that demonstrate inappropriate behavior as an opportunity to have a conversation with their children about racism, Apfelbaum added.Salome Thomas-El, head of school at Thomas Edison charter school in Wilmington, Delaware, agrees that parents and teachers can use viral videos as learning tools, but they should be wary of the other things their children may come across on social media. Something he and many educators struggle with is limiting the negative influences that can come from online, he said.“We have to be aware of what’s going on in the online community and how it impacts what will happen in school,” Thomas-El said. “Prevention is much more powerful than intervention.”Students at his own school go through internet safety training, Thomas-El said, where they learn the full consequence of a viral video. “Children need to understand once you post a video, and it goes viral, you can’t take it back,” he said.It’s also important for teachers, parents and teenagers themselves to understand how a teenager’s developing brain can shape their behavior, said Dan Siegel, clinical professor of psychology at the University of California Los Angeles medical school.The “remodeling” of the teenage brain into an adult brain entails four core changes: emotional sparks, social engagement, novelty-seeking and creative exploration — what Siegel calls “Essence”. The four changes represent an uptick in passion, drive to be a part of a group and a desire for new experiences that is normal for teenagers. These changes can be positive or negative, depending on how they’re fostered, Siegel said.The development also heightens what psychologists call “in-group, out-group distinction”, or the tendency to lump oneself in social groups, he added. When a person feels like their “in-group” is threatened by an “out-group” – people part of a group they don’t identify with – there’s a chance they will dehumanize the out-group.“Adolescents are equally prone to having this in-group-out-group distinction” as adults are, Siegel said. “Essence” exacerbates the distinction, and that’s what can be seen in the viral videos, he added.In these videos, there’s evidence of “emotion they don’t know how to control, collaboration where they give up morality to gain membership, novelty-seeking which drives them to do things that are really dangerous … and following ideals as they push against things that have them not think logically”, Siegel said.Helping teenagers learn about things like in-group, out-group phenomena and how their changing brains affect it will give them the ability to be mindful of their behavior.“When you let an adolescent know they’re in charge of how their brain is going to develop in these important dozen years of life, that’s totally different from saying: ‘Adolescents, this is what’s going on with you and do this,’” Siegel said. “It’s kind of empowering from the inside out.”If a child ends up behaving badly, experts agree that it could be a moment of self-reflection, but parents and teachers need to hold themselves accountable for the behavior as well.“Kids respond to positive reinforcement and modeling behavior,” Apfelbaum said. “Parents should focus on showing kids the right way to respond and how to show respect and tolerance of differences.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/72390f7c69ea6d0e67a22ae5476597afd3ea29b7/0_169_4828_2898/master/4828.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d83bf961819c071abd7e17ba65c8ee1a","title":"venezuela news latest what happened after day drama","story":"Constitutional crisis takes a back seat to half-empty schools, sparsely stocked shops and grinding commutes across CaracasThursday morning in Caracas dawned much like any other day in the slow decline of Venezuela’s Bolivarian revolution: sparsely stocked shops were open, commuters boarded decaying metro trains and clapped-out buses to get to work.Schools were half-empty, buses were harder to find, but apart from that, the capital was mostly calm, and there was little indication of the previous day’s extraordinary events – or that two men now claim to be the country’s rightful ruler.To roars of approval from thousands of supporters – and the enthusiastic support of the Trump administration – Juan Guaidó, the former head of the national assembly, declared himself interim president on Wednesday.It was the most brazen challenge so far to the government of Nicolás Maduro who immediately dismissed the move as a coup attempt orchestrated by an alliance of the “fascist right” and “the coup-mongering, interventionist gringo empire”.Overnight, security forces clashed with protesters in the working-class neighborhood of Petare in eastern Caracas, and isolated incidents of looting occurred.Guaidó’s bold gamble set the scene for a political standoff: neither side seems willing to budge, and each leader can count on international support.What that means for Venezuelans remains far from clear, said Alejandro Rondón a 24-year-old management student who joined a pro-Maduro rally on Wednesday.“What Mr Guaidó did seems irresponsible to me: he is deceiving people – and he’s leading us into a constitutional labyrinth it will be hard for us to get out of.”Rondón allowed that there were frustrations with the government but he was confident that the people would stick with Maduro – if only out of loyalty to his late mentor and predecessor. “In moments like this we close ranks because of our respect for Hugo Chávez.”And despite growing uncertainty over the country’s future, life continued more or less as normal for Venezuelans on both sides of the political ide.“I almost didn’t get to work,” said Simara Romero a 35-year-old waitress, who crosses Caracas twice a day for her job at a coffee shop in the east of the city. “It took me an hour to find a bus that would bring me to work. And now that I’m here, we’ve only had two clients.”Venezuela has seen two previous attempts to unseat Maduro through mass street protests – both of which failed, prompting government crackdowns which left scores dead on both sides, and thousands jailed. So for many Caraqueños the latest unrest had an air of deja vu.“I can’t keep grinding my life to a halt every time there is trouble – it’s endless here. And besides, you kind of know the drill,” said Cristina Fernández, a graphics designer, as she carried her shopping to her car .“I didn’t take my kids to school, but other than that life must go on. It’s not like me stopping is going to bring down the government,” she said. “And I need to work because I need the money.”“My president is Juan Guaidó – not because the US says so, but because I want him: I want a change. The country can’t go on as it is,” said Caty Aguilar, 54, as she headed out from home in Petare. She works three jobs as a house cleaner, and sells phone cards and inidual cigarettes – but even that is barely enough to get by.Aguilar’s daughter is one of the 3 million Venezuelans who has fled the country, and occasionally sends remittances back home from Peru, but Aguilar also relies on the occasional box of subsidized food handed out by the government. She said a local official had warned her she would lose the subsidy if she attended anti-government protests, but she shrugged off the threat.“I just don’t care any more. I don’t think the government has the money to keep buying them much longer anyway,” she said.Across the country, Venezuelans turned to the strategies they have relied on in previous outbreaks of political drama.Fernández said that many Venezuelan families have come up with methods to get through periods of turmoil: “You stock up on food a couple of days when you see it coming. You keep kids home. You obsessively check Twitter and WhatsApp – but you no longer forward every post because most videos of burning cities or wounded people are fake or from Nicaragua,” she said.But this week’s developments have added a new element of uncertainty to familiar rituals: since Guaidó took his oath of office, neither he nor Maduro have made any significant public appearance or official indication of their plans.Internationally, supporters of the two men have lined up on familiar geopolitical lines: Russia, China, Cuba, Turkey and Nicaragua have backed Maduro the US, the UK and most of Venezuela’s Latin American neighbours have backed Guaidó.But how that support plays out on the ground remains unclear. When Donald Trump official recognized Guaidó as president, Maduro responded quickly by giving all US diplomatic staff 72 hours to leave the country.However, Mike Pompeo, the US secretary of State, said that US diplomats would remain in Venezuela because Maduro – who he described as an “ex-president” – lacks the legal authority to break off diplomatic relations”.An email sent by the US embassy to its citizens in Venezuela emphasised they “are keeping regular hours” and on Thursday morning the street outside the embassy was quiet, with no sign that Venezuelan security forces were preparing to enforce Maduro’s deadline.Additional reporting by Mariana Zúñiga"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3769790.1548357466!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"ul students may have got wrong exam results pac hears","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tUniversity of Limerick president  Prof Desmond Fitzgerald:  “I want to assure families and students that the information is accurate – and we will continue to improve the system.” Photograph: Alan PlaceThe president of University of Limerick (UL) has played down concerns that hundreds of students may have received incorrect exam results over a period of many years.The Dáil’s Public Accounts Committee (PAC) on Thursday heard of serious concerns over the reliability of UL’s student records system.The system determines the class of a degree a student receives by calculating average grades received between second year and the final year of a student’s course.The Public Accounts Committee heard that an unpublished report which the university commissioned from Deloitte in 2015 outlined concerns over potentially serious weaknesses in a system in place for almost two decades.A whistleblower at the university raised concerns over the system in a private session of the committee earlier this week.He is said to have made efforts to raise concerns about the stability of the student records system and the potential for a large number of students being given incorrect degree results.The whistleblower also claimed that an audit of student records was halted and never resumed.Sinn Féin TD David Cullinane said: “Potentially, people have been given results that weren’t the results they achieved. It’s a very serious allegation.”UL president Prof Desmond Fitzgerald confirmed that concerns had been raised in a report by Deloitte.However, he said an independent firm has been commissioned to conduct a trawl of records to identify any anomalies in students’ results as far back as the 1980s.“We found one student who was given a 2:2, and should have got a 21, and that student was informed,” he said.When asked if there was a need for a more detailed independent audit of students’ records, Prof Fitzgerald said he did not think so given that students’ grades are subject to external validation.“I want to assure families and students that the information is accurate – and we will continue to improve the system,” he said.“We’re facing a huge growth in the number of students over the coming years. We have to make changes to our systems to accommodate that. It is a priority for me and the institute to make sure those systems are accurate and robust.”The university was also questioned over a series of controversies including the provision of misleading information to the committee over severance packages for two staff members who were rehired as highly paid consultants.In addition, UL was criticised for inappropriate top-up pensions totalling €1.2 million to two senior staff members.Mr Cullinane said it was clear the university in its previous dealings with the committee – prior to Prof Fitzgerald taking over as president – had “lied” to the committee.The Comptroller and Auditor General Séamus McCarthy agreed that in his dealings with the university there had been a deliberate attempt to mislead him with false documentation.“If I were managing a private audit practice, we would have walked away from this, but that option wasn’t available to me . . . I do accept Prof Fitzgerald’s representations that this will not happen again.”In the case of senior staff who provided misleading information, Prof Fitzgerald said two iniduals had stepped down from their positions.He confirmed they were employed elsewhere in the university on the same salary scale.Independent TD Catherine Connolly also said whistleblowers have been “heroes” and paid a heavy price in losing out on pensions and career advancement.Prof Fitzgerald, however, said extensive efforts have been made to engage and agree settlements with whistleblowers and to thank them for their work in ensuring its systems are more robust in future."},{"url":null,"title":"the history of the irish border from plantation to brexit","story":"1606-1630: King James I orders the plantation of Ulster, at that time the least populated and most gaelic of Ireland’s four provinces. The plantations follow the defeat of northern Gaelic chieftains and the Flight of the Earls in 1603. The King grants land in six counties west of the Bann Derry, Donegal, Fermanagh, Tyrone, Cavan and Armagh to Scottish and English settlers. Substantial private plantations were also underway involving Scottish settlers in Antrim and Down with large swathes of the two counties were given to loyal Scottish noblemen. Some four million acres are transferred from Gaelic Irish to planters.1641: Ulster explodes in open warfare between English and Scottish settlers and the native Irish. Dispossessed Catholics take their revenge on settlers, slaughtering thousands of them. In 1642 Scottish Covenanters, a Presbyterian militia, invade the North and took their revenge on many of the Catholic inhabitants. Tit-for-tat killings continue for the next decade. “On both sides there is nothing but burning, robbing in cold blood and cruelties such as are not usual even among the Moors or Arabs,” the Irish nobleman Owen Roe O’Neill observed. The massacre of Protestant settlers would have a profound impact on the psyche of those who had settled in Ulster.1690: William of Orange defeats exiled King James II at the Battle of the Boyne. The battle is seen as decisive as consolidating Protestant domination in Ireland.1782-1800: Grattan’s short-lived parliament gave legislative independence within the Crown to an Irish parliament, albeit one consisting exclusively of members of the Protestant Ascendancy.1800: The 1798 rebellion put paid to Grattan’s parliament. The parliament is abolished in 1800 under the Act of Union. Henceforth, Irish MPs will only sit in Westminster. For the whole of the 19th century, Irish nationalists campaign for an end to the Act of Union.1870: Isaac Butt forms the Home Rule Association which campaigns for self-government for Ireland within the United Kingdom.1882: The Irish Parliamentary Party is formed to elect MPs to the Westminster parliament with the goal of achieving home rule for Ireland. The party will dominate Irish electoral politics until 1918.1886: The first Home Rule bill is introduced into the House of Commons by British Prime Minister William Gladstone. The first stirrings of fierce Ulster opposition to home rule are apparent as sectarian riots hit Belfast in June after the bill is defeated. Dozens are killed. Unionist opposition coalesces to oppose Home Rule with the phrase “Ulster will fight and Ulster will be right”.1892: A Second Home Rule bill is passed in the House of Commons, but defeated in the House of Lords.April 1912: The Irish Parliamentary Party again holds the balance of power in Westminster. A third Home Rule bill is introduced into the parliament. This time the power of the House of Lords to defeat it is curbed. It is due to become law in 1914.September 28th 1912: Edward Carson organises the Ulster Covenant. More than 450,000 sign a pledge to resist home rule.January 1913: The Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF), an armed militia opposed to home rule, is founded.November 1913: The Irish Volunteers is founded by nationalists to ensure the introduction of home rule in Ireland and as a counter-militia to the UVF.March 1914: The Curragh incident occurs. More than 50 British army officers based in Ireland indicate that they will resign their commissions rather than move against Ulster. The proposed mutiny convinces many Irish nationalists that the British cannot be trusted to implement home rule.March 1914: John Redmond concedes the “hateful expedient” of partition with the expectation that Ulster will be excluded from the initial home rule settlement though the number of counties involved has yet to be decided. He insists on it being time-limited to six years but Unionist leader Edward Carson dismisses the time limits as a “stay of execution”.April 1914: The UVF smuggle 20,000 German rifles with three million rounds of ammunition into the port of Larne.July 1914: The Buckingham Palace conference takes place between nationalist and unionist leaders over the implementation of home rule. At the same time the British cabinet pores over maps of border counties examining nationalist areas that might be included in a home rule parliament.“We sat again for an hour and a half discussing maps and figures and always getting back to that most damnable creation of the perverted ingenuity of man - the County of Tyrone,” the British Prime Minister Herbert Asquith declares.“I have rarely felt more hopeless in any practical affair: an impasse with unspeakable consequences upon a matter which to English eyes seems inconceivably small and to Irish eyes immeasurably big. Isn’t it a real tragedy?”\u0026nbspNo agreement can be reached about what parts of Ulster can be excluded from home rule. The First World War breaks out a week later.September 1914: The Home Rule Act becomes law, but is suspended for the duration of the war.April 1916: The Easter Rising occurs in Dublin. Rebels who take up arms against the British reject home rule, which would have given Ireland self-government within the United Kingdom. They want an independent Irish republic.July 1917-April 1918: The Irish Convention is called. Nationalists and unionists meet to try and decide an agreed future for Ireland, but the assembly is boycotted by Sinn Féin. The issue of customs dominates many of the early proceedings with nationalists insisting that a home rule parliament should have control of customs revenue - at that time the chief way in which governments raised taxation. This is vehemently opposed by unionists who fear tariffs and customs will cut Northern industry off from its most important market in Great Britain.The final report is passed by 66 votes to 34. It envisaged a home rule parliament for the whole country with safeguards for Ulster, but its implementation is bound up with the introduction of conscription in Ireland in April 1918 and is rejected. Nationalists and unionists would not meet again to discuss the future of Ireland until the Sunningdale conference of 1973.April 1918: After the death of the Irish Parliamentary Party leader John Redmond in March, his successor John Dillon leads the party out of the House of Commons in protest at the imposition of conscription in Ireland.January 1919: Sinn Féin, which wins a landslide victory in the 1918 British general election, convenes the first Dáil. On the same day the War of Independence begins with the goal of securing an independent Ireland. The first Dáil and the War of Independence both envisage a united independent Ireland.September 1919: The British Government struggles to enact the Home Rule Act which is now opposed by both nationalists and unionists. A committee headed by the colonial secretary and arch-unionist Walter Long is set up to examine this option. Somewhat surprisingly the committee proposes a two home rule-parliament solution, one for Ulster and the other for the rest of Ireland. This is a volte-face for unionism as they had been adamant that they wanted to remain an integral part of the United Kingdom. The committee concludes: “The sacrifice which Ulster will be called upon to make in assuming control of its own local affairs is one which the Imperial Government and parliament is clearly entitled to ask its people to make”.Unionist leader James Craig says he will not oppose a parliament for Ulster provided it consists of six counties with a Unionist majority rather than the nine counties of the historic province. This is to ensure a built-in unionist majority into perpetuity. Unionists reason that including the Catholic-majority provinces of Donegal, Cavan and Monaghan will imperil the long-term future of Northern Ireland.Many unionists are also convinced that they cannot trust successive British governments to safeguard the separation of Ulster from the rest of Ireland and believe only a home rule parliament for Northern Ireland will suffice.December 22nd, 1919: David Lloyd George introduces the committee findings into the House of Commons. He supports the idea of two home rule parliaments for Ireland and says that if the Irish want unity, the British will not stand in their way. He also warns that the British will fight any attempts by the Irish to separate in the same way the Union fought the Confederates in the American Civil War.December 23th, 1920: The Government of Ireland Act 1920 becomes law almost exactly a year after the bill is introduced into the House of Commons. It creates two home rule parliaments and ides Ireland on a 26 countysix county basis. Northern Ireland is created. The act is rejected by Sinn Féin which is demanding full independence, but Ulster Unionists accept it.June 1921: Northern Ireland is created with the opening of its parliament by King George VI. The King makes a conciliatory speech. He says: “I appeal to all Irishmen to pause, to stretch out the hand of forbearance and conciliation, to forgive and to forget, and to join in making for the land which they love a new era of peace, contentment, and goodwill.”July 11th 1921: A truce is called between crown forces and republicans to allow for talks about the future of Ireland.December 1921: The Anglo-Irish Treaty is signed setting up the Irish Free State and copper fastening partition. The Irish Free State is created and it will have Dominion status within the Empire - effectively independence. Nationalists believe partition will be a temporary issue as clause 12 of the Treaty provides for a Border Commission. Many nationalists are confident that the commission will make Northern Ireland so small as to render it unviable.January 1922: The Treaty is ratified narrowly by the Dáil. A general election in June 1922 is won mostly by pro-Treaty politicians, but it is not enough to prevent the Civil War breaking out.December 1922: The Irish Free State comes into being, making the Border an international frontier.April 1923: The Irish Free State introduces customs controls which will exist until 1993 and the creation of the Single Market. These customs posts are manned with varying degrees of efficiency and smuggling becomes a way of life for many in border areas.November 1925: The Boundary Commission report is leaked to the Morning Post. Far from proposing the wholesale changes nationalists wanted, it only envisaged a modest transfer of land from Northern Ireland to the Free State. The Free State representative Eoin Mac Neill resigns. The Free State Government is panicked by the news and seeks concessions from both the British and Unionist governments. None are forthcoming, with both governments reminding their Irish counterparts that the commission was doing what it set out to do which was to look for possible territorial swaps on both sides of the Border. Eventually the impoverished Free State agrees to drop its demand for the inclusion of nationalist areas in the North in return for a debt write-off. The British agreed to cancel Ireland’s imperial debt obligation and the status quo remains.1932-1936: The Economic War between Britain and Ireland had a detrimental impact on border commerce. Farmers and food producers in border regions are required to pay import duties on agricultural produce goods could only be transferred across the border at 16 customs posts. The impact is severe with cross-border trade declining by two thirds.1956-1962: The IRA’s border campaign sees the closure of many minor roads and increased security in border areas.1969-1995: The Troubles again see the closure of several minor roads and regular British army checkpoints become a feature of life particularly in south Armagh.August 1970: The border road at Crossmaglen is closed after two RUC men are shot dead.August 1972: A bomb planted by the Provisional IRA blows up a customs post in Newry killing nine people, including the three IRA members who planted the bomb.1993: All customs posts on the island for Ireland are abolished as the EU Single Market comes into force.2006: The last British watchtower is dismantled. This effectively ends the Border as a visible entity.June 2016: The United Kingdom votes to leave the European Union.January 2017: British prime minister Theresa May says Brexit means being out of both the single market and the customs union. This means that the integrity of the single market can only be maintained if there is a customs frontier between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. This would most likely mean customs checks i.e a hard border.December 2017: The UK and the EU agree a deal with creates the “backstop”.

In the past, it took four to six weeks for a smear test result, but currently results are taking an average of 22 weeks or longer.It emerged on Thursday that up to 6,000 women will have to retake HPV tests, as the samples were tested outside of recommended time frames, health officials said.Since 2015 if a smear test showed low-grade abnormalities a woman was referred for a HPV test. The approximately 6,000 cases related to tests returned as negative. However, the Health Service Executive is to write to these women by the end of next week, advising them to retake a HPV test.The national screening programme was informed late last November by Quest Laboratories that the delays in delivering test results had “been carried out outside of the manufacturer’s recommended time frame,” a HSE spokeswoman said.The laboratory had dated samples from the day they had been received, not when the samples had been taken. However, health officials stressed the repeat tests were precautionary, and the new samples would be prioritised for testing.At the height of the CervicalCheck scandal last spring the Government guaranteed that all affected women could avail of a free repeat smear test.Last June, Dr Colin Goldschmidt, chief executive of Sonic Healthcare, warned Mr Harris that the resulting pressure on labs was putting the future of the screening system “in jeopardy”.Sonic Healthcare is the Australian parent company of Dublin-based MedLab Pathology (MLP), contracted to process close to half of the total smear tests.The free smear guarantee “led directly to a significant increase in the volume of smear test samples” being sent to MedLab, Dr Goldschmidt said.“Prior to the recent crisis, approximately 4,000 samples would be within acceptable limits of MLP’s maximum screening capacity,” he said. In June the lab was dealing with 20,000 test slides, he said.The correspondence was released to The  under the Freedom of Information Act. “Women must be prioritised and an urgent solution must be put in place,” Dr Goldschmidt told Mr Harris, before offering to fly to Dublin to meet the Minister.Mr Harris did not meet Dr Goldschmidt at the time, and doing so would have been “wholly inappropriate” while Dr Gabriel Scally’s report into the CervicalCheck controversy was ongoing, a spokeswoman for Mr Harris said.On December 14th, MedLab officials sent another letter to the Minister seeking a meeting, which also did not take place. The letter related to concerns MedLab had in relation to a review of 1,800 past CervicalCheck smear tests, to be carried out by RCOG.In relation to the December meeting request, a spokeswoman for Mr Harris said the Minister’s position was that laboratory officials should be referred to the “appropriate decision-makers” overseeing the screening programme in the HSE."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3769487.1548349176!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coveney insists no attempt to hide information on cervicalcheck","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTánaiste Simon Coveney said: “This is about full transparency and it is about correcting a mistake that shouldn’t have happened.” File photograph: Clodagh KilcoyneReutersTánaiste Simon Coveney has insisted the Government is not hiding problems in the cervical cancer screening programme controversy.He said details about the number of women who might require another smear test were not given to Minister for Health Simon Harris when he was informed there was an issue with one of the laboratories involved in testing.Mr Coveney said Mr Harris was currently on paternity leave and would not attend the Dáil next week, but would be available to address the House the following week and to answer questions.“When the Minister was informed that there was an issue he was not given the details about the numbers or who those patients were, and therefore couldn’t share it,” Mr Coveney said.“But the issue was discussed with the CervicalCheck steering committee and the Minister for a detailed report so that he would be fully informed.”Opposition TDs complained Taoiseach Leo Varadkar could not tell the Dáil on Wednesday how many women were affected, but the HSE was able to provide details hours later that 6,000 women would be written to and asked to attend for re-testing.Fianna Fáil deputy leader Dara Calleary, Sinn Féin deputy leader Pearse Doherty and Labour leader Brendan Howlin also questioned Mr Coveney about when the Minister had been informed that there was a problem, after it emerged that the offer of free retesting had put huge pressure on the system.Mr Calleary said the Government had not put the resources in place to deal with demand and this had undermined CervicalCheck, which had saved many lives.He said the information only came out after his party leader Micheál Martin raised the issue in the Dáil. GPs, who were first responders, heard that 6,000 women would need retests for the first time on RTÉ.Insisting that there was no attempt to hide information, Mr Coveney said there was an issue with capacity not resources.A new issue, separate from the retesting delay, had emerged with one laboratory, Quest, which had informed CervicalCheck about a problem with HPV testing because the checks happened outside the recommended timeframe, but they were still reliable.Mr Coveney said Mr Calleary was implying that the Government was trying to hide something and that “isn’t true”.Mr Doherty said the health system was chaotic and issues such as this one rocked confidence in the CervicalCheck system. He asked when in December the Minister was informed about the issue.Mr Coveney said the test for HPV to check for low-grade changes should be carried out within 30 days of a sample being given by a woman.He said: “This is about full transparency and it is about correcting a mistake that shouldn’t have happened”.He said they wanted to reassure women and not add to uncertainty and fears."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3769200.1548357758!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"maduro wins backing of venezuelan senior military figures","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tRiot police clash with opposition demonstrators during a protest against the government of President Nicolás Maduro on Wednesday. Photograph: Yuri CortezAFPGetty ImagesSenior figures in the Venezuelan military came out in support of President Nicolás Maduro on Thursday, a day after the US said it no longer recognised him as the country’s leader and backed the opposition’s Juan Guaidó instead.“Yesterday we saw a reprehensible event: a man proclaiming himself president,” Mr Padrino López said, referring to Wednesday’s huge street protests in Caracas, during which Mr Guaidó took a self-administered oath as Venezuela’s interim leader. “That’s a very serious matter.”“We are here to avoid ... a conflict between Venezuelans,” he said. “It is not a civil war that will solve Venezuela’s problems. It is dialogue.”In a video posted on social media and broadcast on state TV, other senior military figures also backed Mr Maduro, who has led the country since 2013 but has come under intense pressure to resign since he started his second term as president this month after an election victory widely dismissed as a fraud.Backed by dozens of soldiers in olive green fatigues, other generals stepped forward and added their expressions of support for Mr Maduro.The declarations came after a day of high drama in which, one by one, many countries across the Americas turned their backs on Mr Maduro and embraced Mr Guaidó, the head of the National Assembly, or Congress – regarded widely as the last bastion of democracy in the country.US president Donald Trump hailed Mr Guaidó as the nation’s leader, and other countries – including Brazil, Argentina and Colombia – followed suit in what appeared to be a carefully synchronised move to undermine Mr Maduro.The battle for power of the Venezuelan executive has split the world, however. Russia, China, Turkey and Mexico still regard Mr Maduro as president. Vladimir Putin, Russia’s president, expressed support for Mr Maduro in a phone call on Thursday, the Kremlin said, as well as his backing for a “peaceful dialogue”.The EU stopped short of explicitly supporting Mr Guaidó but called for elections in Venezuela and backed the national assembly that he heads as the “elected institution whose powers need to be restored and respected”.\u0026nbspFederica Mogherini, EU foreign policy chief, said: “On January 23rd, the people of Venezuela have massively called for democracy and the possibility to freely determine their own destiny. The EU strongly calls for the start of an immediate political process leading to free and credible elections, in conformity with the constitutional order.”\u0026nbspFrench president Emmanuel Macron wrote in a Twitter post: “After Nicolás Maduro’s illegitimate election in May 2018, Europe supports the restoration of democracy. Acclaim the bravery of hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans who march for their freedom.”The UK said Mr Maduro was “not the legitimate leader of Venezuela” and joined Washington in backing his rival. “The United Kingdom believes Juan Guaidó is the right person to take Venezuela forward,” said Jeremy Hunt, UK foreign secretary. “We are supporting the US, Canada, Brazil and Argentina to make that happen.”Venezuela has become increasingly militarised since Mr Maduro’s predecessor, Hugo Chávez, a former paratrooper, came to power 20 years ago, and the military’s support could tip the balance of power between the two rival presidents.While the top brass of the military appears to be steadfast in its support for Mr Maduro, there are increasing signs of discontent among the lower ranks, where soldiers suffer the same deprivations as ordinary citizens. Earlier this week, the government quashed a rebellion by 27 members of the Bolivarian national guard – the military police force.“It took the military several hours to express their support for Maduro after Guaidó designated himself president but they eventually came out with clear, if not exactly effusive, support,” said David Smilde, an expert on Venezuela at Tulane University in the US. “I think those hours after Guaidó’s self-proclamation were the key test and Maduro got past that hump. However, his support from the military is clearly not airtight and that will be the key in the days and weeks ahead.”The Maduro government has warned the US of repercussions, saying that “things could happen” at its embassy in Caracas. Mr Maduro has given staff there 72 hours to leave the country, accusing the US of trying to foment a coup.Mike Pompeo, the US secretary of state, said Washington no longer recognised the Maduro regime and would not withdraw its staff. “The United States will take appropriate actions to hold accountable anyone who endangers the safety and security of our mission and its personnel,” he said.In remarks on Thursday to the Organisation of American States, a diplomatic body comprising nearly all the countries in the Americas, Mr Pompeo again denounced Mr Maduro: “His regime is morally bankrupt, it is economically incompetent, and it is profoundly corrupt. It is undemocratic to the core.”Foro Penal (Penal Forum), a Venezuelan non-governmental organisation, said seven people have died this week in clashes between anti-government protesters and the security forces, and more than 200 were injured. Local media put the death toll as high as 16.After Wednesday’s drama, the streets of Caracas were relatively calm on Thursday, and Mr Guaidó kept a low profile.“We’ll have to wait and see what happens. A lot of people are confused, and some are saying he’s already gone into hiding,” said 42-year-old Victor Oropeza in the Caracas neighbourhood of La Yaguara.On Wednesday, prices for Venezuela’s bonds jumped to their highest levels in seven months on hope that regime change might be near in the country, which under Mr Maduro has suffered one of the biggest economic collapses in Latin American history.The economy has halved in size in five years and gross domestic product dropped 18 per cent in 2018 alone, as oil output slumped to its lowest level since the 1940s. The International Monetary Fund expects inflation to hit 10m per cent this year.Some three million people have fled the country in recent years, many of them suffering from hunger. The UN expects thousands more to follow this year. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2019"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2017/10/12/TELEMMGLPICT000140439032_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfy2dmClwgbjjulYfPTELibA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"parliament accused conflict interest rejects nda debate","story":"John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, refused to allow Maria Miller to ask an urgent question on the use of gagging clauses by the wealthy and powerfulHouse of CommonsMaria Miller, the Tory MP, last night accused Parliament of a conflict of interest over Britain\u0027s MeToo scandal after it emerged she had been blocked from questioning the Government over it.The Daily  can reveal John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, yesterday refused to allow Ms Miller, who chairs the women \u0026amp equalities Commons select committee, to ask an urgent question on the use of gagging clauses by the wealthy and powerful, including the Topshop tycoon Sir Philip Green.Helen Jones, chairman of the petitions select committee, also rejected calls to allow a parliamentary debate on non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) after two separate petitions demanding a change to the law between them secured 250,000 signatures. It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination. A fashion insider said: His brand is about female empowerment. That\u0027s his ethos. He couldn\u0027t go ahead with this, it wouldn\u0027t be a good look. It would be awkward. I can\u0027t imagine celebrities would want to be associated with Philip Green. He\u0027s in a tricky situation.

He has just started school in rural Oxfordshire and is eagerly learning to read. “He’s taken to school like a duck to water. He loves it. He’s very sociable and good at making friends,” says his mother, Lydia. In other words, he is a very normal, happy little boy.Yet there is something remarkable about Isaac. His early progress through life has helped to set the standard for other children across the world. Isaac is one of more than 1,300 children in five countries – Brazil, India, Italy, Kenya and the UK – whose growth and neurodevelopment has been tracked and compared from the earliest days in the womb until the age of two.Led by a team at the University of Oxford, the INTERGROWTH-21st Project is set to have a profound impact on the way we view, feed and educate our children. It has shown for the first time that children are born physically and intellectually equal, regardless of their race or ethnicity. Given good living conditions, good food and education, babies thrive, wherever they live and whatever the colour of their skin.Such is the power of the data gathered, the researchers hope it will be used alongside the World Health Organisation’s growth charts worldwide, including its Red Book in the UK. It should finally put to bed outdated notions of racial or class-based superiority.The research tracks both physical and intellectual development to age two. A child’s first 1,000 days of life (from conception to 24 months) is the most crucial because that is when the brain grows fastest, accounting for roughly two-thirds of its adult weight.Isaac\u0026#39s mother, Lydia, says her son took to school like a duck to water. To her left is her 7-year-old son, Ethan.“At every single stage we’ve shown that healthy mothers have healthy babies, and that healthy babies all grow at exactly the same rate,” says Prof Stephen Kennedy, the co-director of the Oxford Maternal and Perinatal Health Institute and co-leader of the INTERGROWTH-21st Project (with José Villar, a professor of perinatal medicine). “It doesn’t matter where you are living, it doesn’t matter what the colour of your skin is, it doesn’t matter what your race and ethnicity is, receiving decent medical care and nutrition is the key.”The assertion that healthy mothers have healthy babies – regardless of where they come from – sounds obvious but demonstrating it in terms of growth and developmental milestones is a first.Until now, it was a commonly held view that some babies were naturally smaller than others due to genetic predisposition: a healthy baby born to a Kenyan mother, say, would be smaller than a counterpart born to a British mother. America’s National Institutes for Health even produced differing foetal growth charts for babies of white, black, and Asian origin.Assumptions have also – though more controversially – been made about the intellectual ability of different races. Only last week the Cold Spring Harbour Laboratory in the US cut its ties with James Watson, the Nobel Prize-winning geneticist who, with Maurice Wilkins and Francis Crick, first proposed the double helix structure of DNA, citing his “unsubstantiated and reckless” remarks about race and intelligence. Watson, the laboratory’s former chancellor, has repeatedly suggested that genes cause a disparity in average scores in IQ tests between blacks and whites.Geneticist James Watson in 1962, accepting the Nobel prize he would later be stripped of.“There’s still a substantial body of opinion out there in both the scientific and lay communities who genuinely believe that intelligence is predominantly determined by genes and the environment that you’re living in and that your parents and grandparents were living in and their nutritional and health status are not relevant,” says Prof Kennedy. “Well, that’s clearly not the case.”The Oxford study took seven years to complete and involved nearly 60,000 mothers and babies in two stages of research, first tracking growth in the womb, before following more than 1,300 of those babies to age two. Its results show that not only physical growth but behaviour and neurodevelopmental milestones occur at the same rate among babies of differing ethnic origin. The findings echo the assertion by Craig Venter, the scientist who led the first draft of the sequencing of the human genome, that “there is no basis in scientific fact or in the human genetic code or the notion that skin colour will be a predictive of intelligence”.Previous research into gestational growth has taken ethnic origin but not living conditions into account. Where mothers of a similar social, economic and health status are compared, the Oxford team has shown, healthy Indian and African babies will grow at the same rate as healthy, well-nourished Britons. The women enrolled into the second part of the INTERGROWTH-21st Project – whether in Brazil, India, Italy, Kenya or Oxford in the UK – were carefully selected to achieve a like-for-like comparison: urban women of similar age with a healthy BMI who were non-smokers and living in a clean environment. “It is important to say these were not superwomen, they were simply well-educated and well-nourished,” says Kennedy. “In the centres we selected, one-third of the women met our criteria for being healthy. So this wasn’t a tiny slice of the population.”Babies were weighed and measured (including head circumference) at birth, then at one and two years of age. The team tracked fundamental motor milestones according to WHO norms, such as the age at which the child first stood or walked alone, but also developed its own, culturally neutral set of tests  for cognition, language, behaviour and motor development.At the age of two, the children were given a series of play-related tasks. “You might build a tower using five blocks, then knock it down,” says Dr Michelle Fernandes, the Oxford researcher who devised the tests. “Will the child respond by building another tower, completely or partially, or make no effort to do so? If you place a number of objects in front of the child – a cup, spoon, sock, shoe and cube – and ask them to put the spoon in the cup, without giving them a visual cue, are they able to do so?”Michelle Fernandes, an Oxford researcher who developed tests to measure a baby\u0026#39s visual acuity, attention  and language development.Cognitive development was also assessed by placing an attractive object under one cloth, then another, then asking the child to find it. If the child immediately lifted the second cloth, it showed they had been able to follow the sequence of moves. “There are no zero scores,” says Dr Fernandes, “because the child is always able to do something, whether it is building a tower, but with only three blocks, or searching for the beads under the first cloth.”Additional information on the children’s behavioural progress, including lavatory training, was obtained by questioning the mothers.In 1995, the WHO decided that human growth and development should be assessed and monitored using international standards. The resulting standards, published in 2006, form the basis of the Red Book familiar to families in Britain whose babies’ growth is assessed in centiles in relation to the graph.The WHO standard applied to children aged 0-5 (born at full-term) but did not study the foetus. The Oxford study fills in the gap, charting children’s progress from the earliest weeks of life. “By assessing not only growth but neurodevelopment at two years of age we have done something the WHO didn’t,” says Prof Kennedy.“Our standards for establishing gestational age, monitoring the growth of the foetus, assessing the newborn size and post-natal growth on preterm babies... all of those overlap and complement the WHO standards. Taken together, they provide a gold standard which should be used by every country in the world.”The INTERGROWTH-21st standards are likely to focus doctors’ – and hopefully parents’ – attention on the quality of food pregnant women and young infants consume. While the study shows all children should grow up equally able, it is a lack of good nutrition in the first thousand days that is likely to make the biggest difference to a child’s future.Across the world, there are estimated to be more than 150 million children (22 per cent) who have become physically and mentally “stunted” because of poor nutrition in their early years. Although largely an overseas problem, recent international data showed that 10 per cent of UK children live in conditions of “severe food insecurity”.Just as problematic, worrying numbers of babies are born overweight, putting them at risk of health problems including diabetes later in life. A report from the Royal College of Paediatricians and Child Health this week flags up concern over child poverty in the UK – a contributory factor in childhood obesity and poor mental health – and the UK’s poor rate of breastfeeding, believed to be among the lowest in the world. The UK infant feeding survey, usually carried out every five years, was cancelled in 2015.The Oxford team is now launching a new study, INTERPRACTICE-21st, to examine the growth and development of preterm babies. It has been normal practice to monitor those babies born below 32 weeks of gestation, but it is assumed those born between 33 and 37 weeks, though early, will “catch up”. It may be that any baby born early is at risk of developmental delay.The INTERGROWTH-21st Project has come to an end but its findings convey a powerful message about what can be achieved worldwide if mothers and babies have access to good food, education and a decent environment. In such circumstances, the attainment of neurodevelopmental milestones and associated behaviours “are likely innate and universal” the researchers say: and that commonality must be good news for us all.Protect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health SecurityNewsletter promotion - global health security - end of articleUniversity of OxfordDoomsday Clock remains at two minutes to midnight as fake news replaces threat of North Korea warThin people should not act \u0026#39morally superior\u0026#39 - they just have lucky genes, major study findsTaliban agree Isil and Al-Qaeda will be barred from Afghanistan in major concession during talks with USHolidaymaker sues Thomas Cook after she was crushed by obese woman on hotel pool water slideBritain\u0026#39s oldest protester wins court battle to have name removed from \u0026#34extremist\u0026#34 police databaseDonald Trump delays State of the Union Address after Nancy Pelosi bars him from House chamberVenezuela crisis: What would it really take to bring down Nicolas Maduro?Hunt barred from town\u0026#39s Feast Day for first time in 200 years as local council says tradition is \u0026#39outdated and inhumane\u0026#39Fifty Shades writer returns with 21st century \u0026#39erotic love story\u0026#39 about an English aristocrat China clones monkeys and deliberately edits genes to make them mentally illBrexit latest news: Philip Hammond sparks new row as he says no deal would be a \u0026#39betrayal\u0026#39 of referendumWhat is Theresa May\u0026#39s Brexit Plan B and when will Parliament vote on it?Goggle-wearing memorial vandal left scene covered in white paint, police say as it appeals for witnessesComment: Why are elites branding brutal dictatorships like Venezuela and Zimbabwe as victims of \u0026#39populism\u0026#39?Berlin police accused of \u0026#39stalking\u0026#39 over \u0026#39creepy\u0026#39 social media postGruesome Laos deaths of Thai activists sends chill through dissident community in exileJudges told they must consider Facebook defamation in \u0026#39the real world\u0026#39 Alex Salmond charged with two counts of attempted rape as he faces  14 offencesWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/01/24/TELEMMGLPICT000186476484_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfy2dmClwgbjjulYfPTELibA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"holidaymaker sues thomas cook crushed obese woman hotel pool","story":"Jemma Joslyn, 32, paid £2,700 for an all-inclusive two-week holiday at the five star Liberty Lykia in Turkey last September with her two childrenA holidaymaker plans to sue Thomas Cook after she was crushed by an obese woman on a hotel pool water slide.  Jemma Joslyn, 32, paid £2,700 for an all-inclusive two-week holiday at the five star Liberty Lykia in Turkey last September with her two children and two family friends. They had been at the venue for 14 hours when they decided to use the facility’s water park.There was no staff to direct anyone on the slides but I\u0027d told my two young children to wait 10 seconds between each other so they could get out of the way,” she said.My daughter was supposed to follow me down afterwards but instead a overweight woman came down the slide just moments after me.”She said she had reached the bottom of the slide but could not move in time, resulting in her being “thrown backwards in the water, and my eyes were rolling back into my head”.I was coming in and out of conscious as the pain was so severe,” she said.Ms Joslyn, a health care assistant from Seaford, East Sussex, required emergency surgery at  Esnaf Hospital in Fethiye, Turkey, to treat a split liver, internal bleeding and severe kidney damage.She is now taking legal action against Thomas Cook after claiming that there were no safety precautions in place at the hotel to monitor who was coming down the slide and that her aftercare was “appalling”.Thomas Cook weren\u0027t helpful at all - they didn\u0027t bother to find out where I was, where my kids were and I was left to sort out my own care,” she said.Jemma claims she was then told her insurance didn\u0027t cover the hospital care as she had been taken to a private hospital, which her friend paid for.She added: No extra support was offered and my mum, 59 had to plead with Thomas Cook to get both herself and my dad, 76, to Turkey.”A spokesman for Thomas Cook said: Both our UK-based welfare team and our in-resort team have been in touch with Ms Joslyn on several occasions following this accident.We also arranged for her parents to fly to Turkey to be with their daughter.Solicitor Magdalena Knez, from Slater and Gordon, who is representing Ms Joslyn’s legal case, said: We are waiting on a further response and are hopeful we will have a successful outcome for Jemma who has been through a very traumatic experience.Doomsday Clock remains at two minutes to midnight as fake news replaces threat of North Korea warThin people should not act \u0026#39morally superior\u0026#39 -

This evening St Ives Town Council voted to end the \u0027tradition\u0027 of inviting the Western Hunt to participate in the annual Feast Day celebrations.

I sent it to his dad who thought it was really funny.I didn\u0027t have a nervous breakdown like William said. He\u0027s exaggerating about that. I also don\u0027t hate anyone but I was shouting at the television when Nigel Farage was on.I think he\u0027s listened to the news while we\u0027re on the school run which is where he\u0027s picked up terms like \u0027re-moaner\u0027.

The group has opened two pubs and sold six since the beginning of the financial year, with plans to open between five and 10 this year. Wetherspoons warns of price rises as boss repeats call for hard BrexitWetherspoons bans dogs from all their UK pubs as of todayWill Wetherspoons really only sell British booze post-Brexit?Wetherspoon to replace champagne with British sparkling winesEd Monk, associate director at Fidelity Personal Investing, said: “There was more Brexit bluster from J D Wetherspoon chairman Tim Martin in the company’s trading update today, but investors will be more focused on the warning that pre-tax profit will be lower in the first half of the trading year. “The margins at ’Spoons are tight so the challenge has been to grow overall sales in order to keep growing profits. Any hint of higher costs, including staff wages, is bad news so the news of another £30m in labour costs since November will hurt. With unemployment low, thanks in part to lower flows of workers from the EU, labour costs will continue to be a focus at Wetherspoon.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The chancellor has also announced a £100m investment in UK technology, with the money going towards 1,000 new PhD places to promote research into artificial intelligence. Mr Hammond will speak at a CBI event in Davos later today.

Anger over poor social conditions grew so intense that it provoked a riot in the late 1990s. A local social activist who objected to youths smashing bottles on the road and handed a bin bag full of broken glass to the mother of one of those responsible\u0026nbspsays\u0026nbsphe had bricks thrown at his house and firecrackers pushed through the letterbox.Outside Westminster, people are becoming numb to the Brexit crisisWhat turned Thanington round was substantial aid from the European Union.Paul Todd, a former resident who works on housing and homelessness issues, says:\u0026nbsp“About 20 years ago it was regenerated when it got a large dose of money out of the European regeneration budget.” The funding was used to make extensive renovations such as putting new roofs on the council houses and renewing bathrooms and bedrooms so the homes of council tenants looked better than those privately owned. In addition, the\u0026nbspregeneration money funded a community centre, known locally as the Resource Centre, which provides space for sports and recreation, as well as accommodation for children doing homework which they could not do at home.Paula Spencer, who has managed the centre since it was built, adds that the EU “spent £2.5m in doing up the estate and getting rid of the rat-runs. It used to be that they would nick your video machine and disappear down an alleyway.” Crime and antisocial behaviour dropped by 50 per cent as the regeneration measures took effect. As a newly arrived council tenant, Heggie says that she had been worried by the crossbow bolt incident but “apart from one broken car window on my driveway I have had no trouble since”.Created with Sketch.

The 2,794 people who live there work mostly in low-wage jobs, often as cleaners or in supermarkets in and around Canterbury, or they are on benefits. Educational standards are low, illiteracy is high, and many single-parent families are headed by women. Nevertheless, residents and outside observers agree that Thanington retains a strong sense of communal solidarity.“It’s largely retained its village identity,” says Todd, whose relatives still live there and who has great affection for its people. “Everyone knows everyone else’s business.”\u0026nbspOver the past summer, we had a lot of guys coming down from London and selling drugs. They’d move into a house, take it over and intimidate the tenant. Then there was the shootingThe only state institution to help preserve this small and vulnerable community was the EU, so it is worth asking why so many of those living in Thanington voted Leave\u0026nbspin the 2016 referendum. At first glance, their actions, repeated in many deprived areas receiving EU funds in England and Wales, appear to be an inexplicable example of social and economic self-harm. Nevertheless, it was probably the high Leave\u0026nbspvotes in deprived white housing estates which tipped the balance towards Britain voting for Brexit. So it is important to discover why people from such places voted as they did in such overwhelming numbers. Was it a vote very much determined by opposition to immigration, or was it a more general protest by the “left-behinds”\u0026nbspand the “left-outs”? \u0026nbsp\u0026nbspMost people in Thanington voted for Britain to leave the EU, and they did so because they are poor and feel neglected, according to Todd, who has known the area for 30 years. He says that there is an “assumption there that immigration has affected their prospects. I don’t think people are aware of how much Thanington did benefit from the EU. The European regeneration money certainly made a huge impact on the quality of the housing stock up there. It probably gave some of the houses another chance, otherwise they might have been knocked down. Some people want immigration cut and others think that talk of another referendum is an indicator that their concerns haven’t been taken seriously.”Bellas did not mention and may not have known about the EU regeneration effort which happened before he started living on the estate after years of homelessness and holding insecure jobs. In any case, the impact of that funding is running out and there are signs of growing decrepitude and insecurity.\u0026nbsp“It’s quite a deprived area,” he says. “There’s a lot of people with drug problems and\u0026nbspalcohol issues, and they seem to be moving families in who have already been evicted from homes because of antisocial behaviour. Everyone’s got a right to live anywhere but it doesn’t do great things for the estate.“Over the past summer, we had a lot of guys coming down from London and selling drugs. They’d move into a house, take it over and intimidate the tenant – ‘you’re going to sell this for us’\u0026nbsp–\u0026nbspa lot of guys in Mercedes,\u0026nbspreal high-end saloons,\u0026nbspwho don’t fit on the estate. Then there was the shooting in the summer, which was a direct result of these guys coming down from London and that happened just around the corner from us.”Created with Sketch.

Only the sleeping bag is left as a sign of what might have been“It’s a lack of funding and a lack of police. You only ever see police when these things happen and it’s after the fact. Our kids don’t play out on the street. I know all my neighbours and I know all their kids, but it’s really difficult because there are people from off the estate come to sell their drugs that I don’t know. We had a heroin dealer set up in the house next door to us and for about six weeks, we had people knocking on our door coming to pick up their drugs up and it took 50 phone calls to the police to get them to sort it out.”The shooting Bellas refers to took place on 19 July last year when\u0026nbsptwo men in balaclavas shot and seriously wounded Danny Mobey in Thanington’s Godwin Road.Bellas voted Leave in the referendum, denying that this had anything to do with immigration and saying that his decision was more to do with democracy and resistance to power being devolved to a centralised European government and unelected officials making decisions on his behalf. He says: “I just feel that there is something quite sinister and secret about a federal government.”About the economic consequences of departure from the EU, he is optimistic, arguing that the Germans, French and Spanish will want to go on selling goods to Britain. He says that a lot of people he knows had voted Leave influenced by “the Brexiteers’ promise that there would be £350m\u0026nbspextra for the NHS”.\u0026nbspHis two biggest concerns are the lack of policing and the decline of the NHS, where his wife works as a nurse, and which he fears the government wants to privatise.Even in a place as small as Thanington, perceptions of violence vary markedly from street to street and person to person. Di Hutchinson agrees that things are getting worse: “I was ill last Christmas and I saw a drug deal going down and I was shocked because it was the first time I’d ever seen it.” Overall, however, residents and outside observers say that Thanington is no worse than other housing estates and other areas of deprivation anywhere in UK. (There are more affluent parts of the district away from the estate.)People came to me and said that there were rats in their kitchens, rats in their children’s bedrooms, running over kids’ feet, and under bathrooms so there was raw sewage seeping everywhereFinancial aid from the EU and other advantages stemming from membership had little effect on poor Leave voters in 2016. Either the EU’s achievements were under-publicised, or – and this is probably the crucial factor – whatever the EU did was not enough to counterbalance a pervasive sense among millions of voters that their lives are getting more pressured and insecure. This was as true in east Kent as it was in Cornwall, an example of ingratitude for EU largesse often cited. That county has a population of 530,000 and received €654m\u0026nbsp(£574m) from the EU between 2007 and 2013. It was due to receive another €600m before 2020, yet 54.5 per cent voted Leave.Fear of immigration was probably the most important factor in the way people voted, but so too was the privatisation and outsourcing of utitlities and services, job insecurity, decline in real wages, high rents, deindustrialisation and a lack of cheap transport. The EU and its supporters can justly complain that Brussels is being unfairly scapegoated for failings that it has\u0026nbspnothing to do with, and which\u0026nbspshould be blamed rather on globalisation, privatisation and the austerity policies pursued by Conservative governments.Yet, even if the EU is not responsible, this does not mean that the deep discontent\u0026nbsprevealed by the referendum result is\u0026nbspnot real. Simply put, Brexit is a symptom as well as a cause of the crisis which has enveloped Britain and envenomed its politics. The ill-considered Remain slogan of 2016 – “Better Together” –\u0026nbspwas never going to resonate with those whose standard of living had stagnated or deteriorated over the past decade despite Britain being in the EU. \u0026nbsp\u0026nbspAusterity may have driven homelessness rise, minister admitsTransport is already scarce: according to Spencer, it takes two bus trips to get to the nearest doctor, while there is only one bus every two hours in the evening. A planned new exit from the A2, which is being contested by local residents, will make Thanington even more isolated from the rest of Canterbury than it is at present. And as houses become more expensive and cost far more than the present population on their low-paying jobs can afford, the traditional community will break up as parents find that their children have to move off the estate if they want find anywhere cheap enough to live.Even more seriously, the insecure low-paid work done by many in Thanington does not provide enough to pay rent and food. The result is reliance on food banks and free school meals. Caroline Heggie says that people are becoming more and more indebted “because now you’ve got companies giving out credit cards to people with low credit ratings”.A telling sign of the growing deprivation in Thanington – and the sort of event which may explain why people there failed to endorse the status quo in 2016 – is a recent plague of rats.“People came to me and said that there were rats in their kitchens, rats in their children’s bedrooms, running over kids’ feet, and under bathrooms so there was raw sewage seeping everywhere,” says Spencer. The origin of the rat infestation is unclear: it may be that rats were disturbed by the new housing construction in nearby fields, or that the council no longer deals with rubbish that has been left to pile up. Cuts in public services of all kinds have hit Thanington hard, and services dropped include pest control.A rat catcher charges £60, which tenants must now pay themselves though there may be 10 or 12 rats to be disposed of, necessitating more than one visit.\u0026nbspHeggie says: “You used to have council ‘rat people’, but because of austerity, you don’t have them anymore.”\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

After he kills them, he is crowned by the cultists.The set-up: Leonard (Guy Pearce) is tracking down the man who raped and murdered his wife. However, his search is stunted by his short-term memory loss. Throughout the film, he tells the story of Sammy Jankis, a man who accidentally killed his diabetic wife she kept requesting more insulin as she didn\u0027t believe he had memory loss.The twist: The man responsible only raped his wife and Leonard killed him years ago – he just can\u0027t remember it.

Sammy Jankis.The set-up: A grizzled boxing trainer seeks atonement by helping Hilary Swank\u0027s underdog amateur boxer, Maggie, achieve her dream of becoming a professional.The twist: Mid-way through the film, Maggie breaks her neck after being sucker punched during a fight.

The set-up: Nicole Kidman stars as Grace, a mother who tries to protect her two children from supernatural forces in their Victorian mansion.The twist: In a spin on the ghost story, it turns out it\u0027s Grace and her children who are the ghosts: she killed them – before turning the gun on herself – in despair over the presumed death of her husband in World War II.The set-up: The film tracks the rivalry of two magicians, Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) and Rupert Angier (Hugh Jackman), who go to extreme lengths to outsmart one another, each pulling off tricks the other considers impossible.The twist: It emerges that Fallon, the bearded carer of Borden’s children, is actually his twin (he’s also played by Bale) while Angier’s technique is far more disturbing: each night, using Tesla’s technology, he sends his clone plummeting into a water tank.2437 Planet of the Apes (1968)The set-up: Three scientists wake up hundreds of years after being launched into space to discover they’ve landed on a planet where primates rule over humans, who are their prisoners.The twist: As Charlton Heston’s character escapes his cell, he eventually finds the Statue of Liberty protruding from sand.

Cue a corpse in the middle of the room rising to reveal himself as the real Jigsaw killer. He was there the whole time.The set-up: David Mills (Brad Pitt) and retired PI William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) have closed in on serial killer, John Doe (Kevin Spacey), who has been using the seven deadly sins as inspiration for his murders.The twist: He has one final murder left to commit – only he’s already committed it.

He got killed during a robbery that we see in the film’s opening scene.The set-up: The introverted Angela (Felissa Rose) becomes terrified when a murderer wreaks destruction at the same campsite where her brother Peter was killed eight years before.The twist: Angela is the killer.

It emerges that these imposters are mental home patients who murdered the couple, and have now taken up residence in their house.

While experiencing visions of her daughter, who we learn died from cancer in her teens, Louise attempts to communicate with the race in a bid to discern the purpose of their visit.The twist: Louise deciphers the language, which gives her the ability to see into the future.

Annie Hall offers the New York based comedian’s familiar angst and also has a superlative performance from Diane Keaton as the free spirited, preppy heroine he falls in love with.210 9. The Best Years of our LivesWilliam Wyler’s film about three veterans coming home at the end of the war still has a huge emotional kick. They’re from different classes and backgrounds but struggle terribly to readjust to civilian life. Some accuse the film of being pious and self-righteous but it deals frankly and very movingly with both the soldiers’ problems and those of their families and friends in understanding them. It won its best picture Oscar in the year in which It’s a Wonderful Life was also nominated.310 8. An American in ParisThe best MGM musicals showed extraordinary artistry. This is one of the greatest. It’s not just the choreography or Gene Kelly’s wildly energetic performance as the aspiring artist in postwar Paris but the use of colour and sound. The ballet sequence at the end of the film stands alongside that in Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger’s The Red Shoes as a perfect example of filmmaking in which every element balances perfectly.Producer Hal Wallis at Warner Bros had a knack for overseeing films that were both mainstream and had a social conscience. Not only did Casablanca have Humphrey Bogart, Ingrid Bergman and Claude Rains, but it also dealt with refugees, betrayal and wartime politics. The script by Julius and Philip G Epstein provided lines of dialogue about gin joints, rounding up the usual suspects and playing “As Time Goes By” that are still quoted today. Few other best picture winners are as engrained in the public consciousness as Casablanca.510 6. On the WaterfrontElia Kazan’s On the Waterfront can be read as the director’s attempt at justifying his own craven behaviour, naming names in front of the House Committee on UnAmerican Activities, during the communist witch hunts. Its politics are complicated and contradictory. It is also magnificently acted. Marlon Brando gives arguably his greatest performance of all as Terry Molloy, the dockworker and pigeon fancier who could have been a contender in life and in the boxing ring if only his brother had stood by him when he needed him most.610 5. Lawrence of ArabiaEasy to dismiss as a jingoistic widescreen epic, David Lean’s film about TE Lawrence makes astonishing viewing seen in 70mm. It also offers a probing and subtle portrayal of Lawrence (Peter O’Toole), the masochist who is both the quintessential English hero and the quintessential English outsider.Joseph L Mankiewicz’s drama about a young actress on the make and the established star whose career she wants to usurp boasts some of the most caustic dialogue in any Hollywood best picture winner. The brilliance of Bette Davis as the star and of Anne Baxter as the seemingly ingenuous but utterly ruthless young pretender is matched by George Sanders’ wonderfully acidic performance as the theatre critic, Addison DeWitt.Still the greatest sequel in Hollywood history, this film emulated its predecessor The Godfather, in winning the best picture Oscar and out-stripped it in the brilliance of its craftsmanship and performances. Everything here, from Gordon Willis’s cinematography to the parallel stories of Al Pacino’s Michael Corleone as the crime family boss in the late Fifties and Robert De Niro as his father Vito many years before, works near perfectly. The rival Best Picture nominees in 1974 included Lenny, Chinatown and The Conversation (also directed by Francis Ford Coppola). All would have been worthy winners in other years.The western was considered an anachronism and so was Clint Eastwood himself when Eastwood made his blood soaked masterpiece. Eastwood played Will Munny, first encountered as a farmer and family man. Gradually, we learn about his past as a gunman.  “I\u0027ve killed women and children. I\u0027ve killed just about everything that walks or crawled at one time or another, and I\u0027m here to kill you, Little Bill,” he tells old rival Gene Hackman. This brutal and elegiac film was always a shoo-in for its Oscar.Only Billy Wilder could have made a romantic comedy based around infidelity, drudgery and office politics and turned it into a film as delightful as this. Academy voters are sometimes accused of self-righteousness and prudery, but thankfully that didn’t stop them giving the best picture Oscar to The Apartment.These days, it sometimes seems heretical to admit to an admiration for Woody Allen but his best films stand up as well as ever.

But is this true? Ben Chu\u0026nbspinvestigatesClick to followThe IndependentSome see WTO rules as a simple landing place post BrexitMany Brexiteers have claimed that one of the reasons we shouldn’t fear a no-deal departure\u0026nbspis that lots of\u0026nbspother countries in the\u0026nbspworld already trade\u0026nbspwith each other on basic World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules – the framework the UK would drop into if we left the EU on 29 March with no withdrawal agreement and no transition period.But is this claim actually true?Anand Menon, the director of the UK in a Changing Europe think tank, pointed out in an article for The Independent last month that it’s actually misleading.First it’s important to understand what the WTO is and what its rules are.There are 164 WTO member states around the world. The central rule of the club is that no country can impose tariffs on another country’s imports that are higher than those imposed on imports\u0026nbspfrom any other country\u0026nbsp– unless it has established a broad free trade agreement with that country. So if country X gives country Y a reduced tariff,\u0026nbspthat same favour must be granted to all other WTO members.Created with Sketch.Brexit deal vote: Opposing groups of protesters gather by Parliament Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.An anti-Brexit protester adjusts her pro-EU wig A message to Jeremy Corbyn in support of a people\u0027s voteA mock Titanic captained by Theresa May heads towards an iceberg in a stunt by campaigning group AvaazProtesters of opposing sides are in close contact outside of ParliamentPaintings of Theresa May and Jeremy CorbynFormer UKIP leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside ParliamentA pro-Brexit protester in Parliament SquareOpposing protesters share the space outside ParliamentAnti-Brexit protesters stand on Westminster Bridge ahead of today\u0027s vote Former UKIP leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outiside ParliamentAnti-Brexit protesters demonstrate outside the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit protester sets up outside ParliamentAn anti-Brexit protester waves an EU flag on Westminster Bridge ahead of today\u0027s vote Protesters of opposing sides demonstrate outside ParliamentProtesters of opposing sides stand near ParliamentAn anti-Brexit protester adjusts her pro-EU wig A message to Jeremy Corbyn in support of a people\u0027s voteA mock Titanic captained by Theresa May heads towards an iceberg in a stunt by campaigning group AvaazProtesters of opposing sides are in close contact outside of ParliamentPaintings of Theresa May and Jeremy CorbynFormer UKIP leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside ParliamentA pro-Brexit protester in Parliament SquareOpposing protesters share the space outside ParliamentAnti-Brexit protesters stand on Westminster Bridge ahead of today\u0027s vote Former UKIP leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outiside ParliamentAnti-Brexit protesters demonstrate outside the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit protester sets up outside ParliamentAn anti-Brexit protester waves an EU flag on Westminster Bridge ahead of today\u0027s vote Protesters of opposing sides demonstrate outside ParliamentProtesters of opposing sides stand near ParliamentThis is the “most favoured nation” principle. Its purpose is to prevent ad hoc discrimination on tariffs by countries and the risk of tit-for-tat trade battles.But that does not mean that, in the absence of a free trade agreement, trade between two states can be assumed to be governed only by WTO rules.Take the EU’s trade with the US.How badly could Brexit disrupt farming exports from Northern Ireland?“All 164 of them have negotiated better access to at least one market through some kind of bilateral agreement in addition to their WTO relationship.”So if the UK suddenly left the EU its trade with the US, at least initially, would still be disrupted because we would lose the coverage over those 100 sector agreements too.The point is that WTO rules are not some kind of tried and tested landing place for a country crashing out of a trade bloc.Got an unanswered question about Brexit?

They are likely to back alternative motions that simply call for a public vote.\u0026nbspJeremy Corbyn has so far refused to agree to\u0026nbspMPs\u0027 and party members\u0027 demands that he\u0026nbspback a Final Say vote, but said the option should be considered by MPs.\u0026nbspHe said:\u0026nbspThe prime minister is both refusing to change her red lines or take the threat of a no deal exit off the table. MPs must now act to break the deadlock.Our amendment will allow MPs to vote on options to end this Brexit deadlock and prevent the chaos of a no deal.It is time for Labour\u0027s alternative plan to take centre stage, while keeping all options on the table, including the option of a public vote.Labour supporters of a fresh referendum welcomed the party\u0027s motion. Ben Bradshaw called it important progress and David Lammy tweeted: This is a big step foward. I hope this amendment can be the beginning of the end of years of argument over Berxit in this country.But while more than 70 Labour MPs have publicly called for another referendum, dozens of\u0026nbspothers are strongly opposed, including shadow ministers who would likely resign in order to vote against any proposal for going back to the public.Created with Sketch.Brexit deal vote: Opposing groups of protesters gather by Parliament Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.An anti-Brexit protester adjusts her pro-EU wig A message to Jeremy Corbyn in support of a people\u0027s voteA mock Titanic captained by Theresa May heads towards an iceberg in a stunt by campaigning group AvaazProtesters of opposing sides are in close contact outside of ParliamentPaintings of Theresa May and Jeremy CorbynFormer UKIP leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside ParliamentA pro-Brexit protester in Parliament SquareOpposing protesters share the space outside ParliamentAnti-Brexit protesters stand on Westminster Bridge ahead of today\u0027s vote Former UKIP leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outiside ParliamentAnti-Brexit protesters demonstrate outside the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit protester sets up outside ParliamentAn anti-Brexit protester waves an EU flag on Westminster Bridge ahead of today\u0027s vote Protesters of opposing sides demonstrate outside ParliamentProtesters of opposing sides stand near ParliamentAn anti-Brexit protester adjusts her pro-EU wig A message to Jeremy Corbyn in support of a people\u0027s voteA mock Titanic captained by Theresa May heads towards an iceberg in a stunt by campaigning group AvaazProtesters of opposing sides are in close contact outside of ParliamentPaintings of Theresa May and Jeremy CorbynFormer UKIP leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside ParliamentA pro-Brexit protester in Parliament SquareOpposing protesters share the space outside ParliamentAnti-Brexit protesters stand on Westminster Bridge ahead of today\u0027s vote Former UKIP leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outiside ParliamentAnti-Brexit protesters demonstrate outside the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit protester sets up outside ParliamentAn anti-Brexit protester waves an EU flag on Westminster Bridge ahead of today\u0027s vote Protesters of opposing sides demonstrate outside ParliamentProtesters of opposing sides stand near ParliamentSoon after the party\u0027s motion was tabled, shadow housing minister Melanie Onn announced that should would step down if she is ordered to vote for another referendum.In a letter to constituents, she wrote: I am not in favour of a People\u0027s Vote and will not vote for it. If it comes before parliament as it is expected to in the next few daysweeks, I will instead vote for a better \u0027Labour\u0027 deal.This may mean that I am required to step down from my frontbench housing role if it is a whipped vote. I would be very disappointed if this were the case, as I am very proud of the work I have been doing alongside John Healey and Sarah Jones, but recognise that I cannot vote against the frontbench and remain a part of it.Rebecca Long-Bailey, Labour\u0027s\u0026nbspshadow business secretary, said the amendment would simply\u0026nbspwiden the debate and put all options on the table to avoid a no-deal scenario but that the party\u0027s priority remained securning\u0026nbspa different Brexit deal, including a customs union with the EU and a closer relationship with the\u0026nbspsingle market.\u0026nbspAsked if\u0026nbspLabour\u0027s motion\u0026nbspmakes a second referendum\u0026nbspmore likely,\u0026nbspshe told Sky News: Well, no. In line with our conference policy...our priority is to secure a deal\u0026nbspbut obviously all options need to remain on the table and that includes a public vote.She added: There\u0027s no\u0026nbspguarantee that it will pass even if our amendment passed\u0026nbspand certainly right across the Conservative Party\u0026nbspand in the Labour Party there\u0027s ided opinion as to whether a second referendum should be a preferred option at this stage.Ms Long-Bailey\u0026nbspsuggested that, even if its amendment passes, Labour would not necessarily instruct its MPs to vote for another referendum, saying: That\u0027s something that the party would need to decide at the time.\u0026nbspWith parliament still deadlocked over Brexit, former Conservative leader William Hague said a fresh public vote was now quite likely.Writing in the Daily , he said: It will probably produce only a narrow victory for either side despite a long struggle, and leave a wounded country to limp on afterwards.But it\u0027s coming, unless some extraordinary turn of events prevents it. It\u0027s coming by a process of elimination, not because it\u0027s a good idea in itself.MPs will vote on 29 January on amendments to Ms May\u0027s proposed plan.Commons home affairs committee chair Yvette Cooper has tabled a motion that would delay Brexit until the end of the year if no deal is in place by the end of February. With significant cross-party support, the motion is likely to pass if Labour agrees to support it.Hilary Benn, chair of the Brexit commitee, has put down a separate amendment calling for MPs to hold a series of indicative votes on various Brexit outcomes.And Dominic Grieve, the former attorney general, is expected to propose giving parliament to right to seize\u0026nbspcontrol of Brexit if the government cannot pass its deal.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

They are wrong.”Airbus employs 14,000 people in Britain, including 6,000 jobs at its main wings factory at Broughton, in North Wales, and 3,000 at Filton, near Bristol, where wings are designed and supported.With around 110,000 more jobs in connected supply chains, the aerospace group\u0026nbspis among the UK’s key employers – and among the most vulnerable to the loss of ‘just-in-time’ manufacturing across the EU.Mr Enders said Britain’s multibillion-pound aerospace sector, a world-leader for a century, is “standing at a precipice”, with only nine weeks until the intended departure date from the EU.“In a global economy, the UK no longer has the capability to go it alone. Major aerospace projects are multinational affairs,” Mr Enders said in a video message.He added: “Brexit is threatening to destroy a century of development based on education, research and human capital.“If there’s a no-deal Brexit, we at Airbus will have to make potentially very harmful decisions for the UK.”Jacob Rees-Mogg tells PM to suspend parliament if MPs block no-dealBrexit: Sony to move European HQ out of UK to avoid customs issuesEU will never accept Theresa May’s Brexit ‘plan-B’, Barnier saysIf you want a Final Say on Brexit, hold your nerveOwen Smith, a Labour supporter of the anti-Brexit Best for Britain group, said of the warning: “The damage caused by Brexit won’t fly with big businesses like Airbus, and certainly won’t fly with the British people. Jobs and livelihoods are at risk.“If companies like Airbus, or GE Aviation in my own patch, disinvest in Britain as a consequence of our leaving the EU, the Brexiteers in Parliament should never be forgiven.”The warning comes after the Netherlands revealed that more than 250 companies are in contact about moving to the country because of Brexit.The trade and investment arm of the Dutch government has been soliciting moves from companies worried about access to the EU market, with Britain set to leave the single market and customs union.A number of high-profile companies have already announced a decision to cross the North Sea, including Japanese electronics giants Sony and Panasonic.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

There is a lot taking place and there are a lot of new amendments. We\u0027ll have to wait and see.Ms Rudd also told the programme she is committed to making sure we avoid no-deal, which she described as the worst possible outcome”.This liveblog has now closed, but you can scroll down to view the day\u0027s eventsThis is from the Press Association on the DUPDemocratic Unionist deputy leader Nigel\u0026nbspDodds has warned the Irish Premier to tone down his rhetoric over Brexit.Mr Dodds was speaking after Leo Varadkar told the World Economic Forum in Davos that the United Kingdom will find it very difficult to agree trade deals after it leaves the European Union if it has not resolved the Irish border issue.The Taoiseach said if no deal is agreed between the UK and EU, the UK would have to accept full regulatory and customs alignment in Northern Ireland.Prime Minister Theresa May is currently consulting on a new departure deal with the European Union, after MPs voted down her Withdrawal Agreement.This is from BBC\u0027s Newsnight\u0027s political producer Liz Rawlings. She says the pro-Remain cabinet minister Amber Rudd has refused to rule out resigning three times, if the government does not allow a free vote on amendments next week in the Commons.\u0026nbspAsked if Theresa May had full confidence in business minister Richard Harrington, a Downing Street spokeswoman said: Yes.She added: The prime minister expects ministers to be focused on getting the government\u0027s deal through.In the wake of the decision by People\u0027s Vote-backing MPs to\u0026nbsppull a bid for a second referendum, the Liberal Democrats have tabled their own\u0026nbspamendment calling on the government to prepare for a final say vote.\u0026nbspThe amendment, supported by all Liberal Democrat MPs, also calls on the government “to take all necessary steps to rule out a No-Deal scenario.Lib\u0026nbspDem Brexit spokesperson Tom Brake said:\u0026nbsp“We know people are increasingly concerned about the national embarrassment Brexit has become, which is why we have tabled an amendment that would give people the final say on Brexit.\u0026nbsp“There is still time to act in the national interest. Jeremy Corbyn and the Labour leadership must stop dreaming up more and more creative excuses for refusing to support a people’s vote, which their members and supporters want.\u0026nbsp“No matter who delivers Brexit it will be bad for jobs, the NHS and reduce our standing in the world.Len\u0026nbspMcCluskey, general secretary of Unite, said he hoped his first ever meeting with Theresa May was not a PR stunt.He stressed that a no-deal Brexit would be disastrous and urged the Prime Minister to extend Article 50 beyond March 29 for three months.Mr\u0026nbspMcCluskey\u0026nbspsaid Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn was right to refuse to meet the Prime Minister unless she ruled out a no-deal Brexit.The Unite leader said companies were now putting investment decisions on hold because of the ongoing uncertainty.He added: I cannot conceive any prime minister taking us out of Europe with a no deal - it would be catastrophic.Labour will not make a final decision on whether to back a backbench amendment designed to delay Brexit until shortly before it comes to a vote next week, Jeremy Corbyn has suggested.Speaking\u0026nbspduring a visit to Wolverton, near Milton Keynes, he said that Labour was not calling for the Article 50 period to be extended but that MPs might take matters into their own hands.He said he had met with Yvette Cooper, who has tabled an amendment designed to give the UK more time to negotiate with Brussels, on Wednesday.Asked whether Labour - which has tabled its own amendment - would give official backing to the amendment tabled by Ms Cooper and Tory Nick Boles, he added: We will decide at the time whether we fully support it or not.I had a very good meeting, a very useful meeting, with Yvette Cooper yesterday. I understand what she is saying, there is a lot of merit in it. We, as a party, will make a decision.Mr Corbyn reiterated his call for Mrs May to remove the threat of a no-deal Brexit, adding: We are not calling for an extension of Article 50 but quite clearly if Theresa May runs the clock all the way down MPs are going to recognise the dangers of leaving with no deal.Mr Corbyn said that his priority was the Labour amendment he had tabled. Asked if he would whip his MPs to support the Cooper amendment, he said: We haven\u0027t decided what exactly we are going to whip on yet.We clearly will be whipping in support of the amendment that I have tabled, which is one that has broad support, not just among Labour MPs but amongst the wider MPs in Parliament on this. That is our priority.Asked how long an extension to the Article 50 process should be, he said: It has to be, obviously, limited.But we are not calling for that, what we are calling for is the Government to take no deal off the table, negotiate seriously with other parties and with the European Union in order to move in the direction of an agreement which gives us the customs union, the market access and protection of rights.Theresa May has echoed Donald Trump by throwing the UK’s weight behind Venezuela’s opposition leader – rather than its controversial president.Juan Guaidó, the head of the national assembly, declared himself president during mass protests against rule by Nicolás Maduro, which has plunged the country into economic freefall.The US president has recognised Mr Guaidó as interim leader and urged the military to intervene against the elected president, the protégé of firebrand socialist Hugo Chávez.Asked about the crisis, the prime minister’s spokesman said: “The 2018 presidential election in Venezuela was neither free nor fair, so the regime’s basis for power is deeply flawed.“We fully support the democratically-elected national assembly with Juan Guaidó as its president.”However, Downing Street stopped short of the US move of recognising Mr Guaidó as president, saying: “The UK position is to recognise states rather than governments.”The spokesman also criticised Caracas for expelling US diplomats, saying: “In relation to the United States, we think it’s totally unacceptable for Venezuela to cut off diplomatic ties.“The solution to this crisis lies in working to find a peaceful and diplomatic solution not in expulsions.”And, backing Mr Guaidó, he added: “The Venezuela government needs to respect the authority of the national assembly.”Dave Prentis, general secretary of Unison, has also been into No 10. He said the PM she should delay the Brexit leaving date until at least July to allow further talks.It is in everyone\u0027s interest to extend Article 50 until at least the summer, he said outside Downing Street.We want Theresa May to move away from appeasing the right wing of the Tory party.Mr Prentis said the UK should remain within a customs union because it would be a nonsense to leave.The PM was very pleasant during the talks, according to Mr Prentis, who said he hoped Ms May was listening.He warned against the brinkmanship of a no-deal Brexit, adding that March 29 was a real barrier.Leadsom\u0026nbspsaid the House will\u0026nbsprise on Thursday 14 February and return on Monday 24 February - this “is and does remain the position” -\u0026nbspamid speculation it could be cancelled to give MPs more time to pass Brexit legislation.But this would have to be confirmed by a Commons vote, she said. Nervous MPs may be less than reassured about their holiday plans.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Before Christmas work and pensions secretary Amber Rudd called on the government to build a “coalition” in parliament to pass the deal.It has been reported that 18 ministers, including Mr Hammond and Ms Rudd, have been meeting once a fortnight to organise to block a no-deal Brexit.Defence minister Tobias Ellwood, who also attends the meetings, has described a no deal as a “historic act of self-harm, with profound economic, security and repetitional consequences for the UK”.Business minister Richard Harrington, who has said he will resign if there is a no deal, has said: “My clear objective is to stop the nonsense of a hard Brexit.Created with Sketch.Brexit deal vote: Opposing groups of protesters gather by Parliament Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.An anti-Brexit protester adjusts her pro-EU wig A message to Jeremy Corbyn in support of a people\u0027s voteA mock Titanic captained by Theresa May heads towards an iceberg in a stunt by campaigning group AvaazProtesters of opposing sides are in close contact outside of ParliamentPaintings of Theresa May and Jeremy CorbynFormer UKIP leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside ParliamentA pro-Brexit protester in Parliament SquareOpposing protesters share the space outside ParliamentAnti-Brexit protesters stand on Westminster Bridge ahead of today\u0027s vote Former UKIP leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outiside ParliamentAnti-Brexit protesters demonstrate outside the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit protester sets up outside ParliamentAn anti-Brexit protester waves an EU flag on Westminster Bridge ahead of today\u0027s vote Protesters of opposing sides demonstrate outside ParliamentProtesters of opposing sides stand near ParliamentAn anti-Brexit protester adjusts her pro-EU wig A message to Jeremy Corbyn in support of a people\u0027s voteA mock Titanic captained by Theresa May heads towards an iceberg in a stunt by campaigning group AvaazProtesters of opposing sides are in close contact outside of ParliamentPaintings of Theresa May and Jeremy CorbynFormer UKIP leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside ParliamentA pro-Brexit protester in Parliament SquareOpposing protesters share the space outside ParliamentAnti-Brexit protesters stand on Westminster Bridge ahead of today\u0027s vote Former UKIP leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outiside ParliamentAnti-Brexit protesters demonstrate outside the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit protester sets up outside ParliamentAn anti-Brexit protester waves an EU flag on Westminster Bridge ahead of today\u0027s vote Protesters of opposing sides demonstrate outside ParliamentProtesters of opposing sides stand near Parliament“It may be the way to do that is supporting CooperBoles, it may be that someone can suggest a better way of doing it or ideally a way I can do it in cooperation with the government.”Labour looks set to back a backbench amendement, dubbed “CooperBoles” after its originators, Labour’s Yvette Cooper and Conservative\u0026nbspNick Boles, with cross-party support to avoid a no-deal Brexit by instructing the government to extend Article 50.

They say it is a breach of sovereignty and are voting down the entire Brexit deal in opposition to it.The policy is set to automatically trigger in 2021 if there is no trade deal between the UK and EU negotiated by then – or if the trade deal does not allow for frictionless trade.Created with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Demonstrators hold a huge banner reading \u0027Madrid\u0027s taxi demands that the law has to be enforced\u0027 as drivers protest outside IFEMA Convention and Congress Center, against the regulation of ride-hailing and car-sharing services such as Uber and CabifyFrench President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel shake hands after signing a French-German friendship treaty in the town hall of Aachen, western Germany.

The company reported like-for-like sales growth of 7.2 per cent for the first 12 weeks of the second quarter, while like-for-like sales in the year to date have risen 6.3 per cent. However, costs in the first half have been “considerably higher” than the previous year, particularly for labour, which is up by around £30m.

The group has opened two pubs and sold six since the beginning of the financial year, with plans to open between five and 10 this year. Wetherspoons warns of price rises as boss repeats call for hard BrexitWetherspoons bans dogs from all their UK pubs as of todayWill Wetherspoons really only sell British booze post-Brexit?Wetherspoon to replace champagne with British sparkling winesEd Monk, associate director at Fidelity Personal Investing, said: “There was more Brexit bluster from J D Wetherspoon chairman Tim Martin in the company’s trading update today, but investors will be more focused on the warning that pre-tax profit will be lower in the first half of the trading year. “The margins at ’Spoons are tight so the challenge has been to grow overall sales in order to keep growing profits. Any hint of higher costs, including staff wages, is bad news so the news of another £30m in labour costs since November will hurt.

Seen by satellite and on foot around the city, officials warn that what they call land subsidence poses a grave danger to a country where protests over water scarcity have already seen violence.Land subsidence is a destructive phenomenon, said Siavash Arabi, a measurement expert at Iran\u0027s cartography department. Its impact may not be immediately felt like an earthquake, but as you can see, it can gradually cause destructive changes over time.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialHe said he can identify destruction of farmland, the cracks of the earth\u0027s surface, damage to civilian areas in cities, wastewater lines, cracks in roads and damages to water and natural gas pipes.Tehran, which sits 1,200 meters (3,900 feet) above sea level against the Alborz Mountains on a plateau, has rapidly grown over the last 100 years to a sprawling city of 13 million people in its metropolitan area.Man-made drought threatens to ravage IraqAll those people have put incredible pressure on water resources on a semi-arid plateau in a country that saw only 171 millimeters (6.7 inches) of rain last year. Over-reliance on ground aquifers has seen increasingly salty water pumped from below ground.Surface soil contains water and air. When you pump water from under the ground surface, you cause some empty space to be formed in the soil, Mr Arabi told Associated Press. Gradually, the pressure from above causes the soil particles to stick together and this leads to sinking of the ground and formation of cracks.Rain and snow to recharge the underground aquifers have been in short supply. Over the past decade, Iran has seen the most prolonged and severe drought in more than 30 years, according to the United Nations\u0027 Food and Agriculture Organisation. An estimated 97 per cent of the country has faced some level of drought, Iran\u0027s Meteorological Organisation says.That has caused the sinkholes and fissures now seen around Tehran.Iranian authorities say they have measured up to 22 centimetres (8.6 inches) of annual subsidence near the capital, while the normal range would be only as high as 3 centimetres (1.1 inches) per year.Even higher numbers have been measured in other parts of the country. Some sinkholes formed in western Iran are as deep as 60 metres (196 feet).Those figures are close to those found in a study by scientists at the GFZ German Research Centre for Geosciences in Potsdam previously discussed by the journal Nature and accepted by the journal Remote Sensing of Environment. Using satellite images between 2003 and 2017, the scientists estimate the western Tehran plain is sinking by 25 centimetres (9.8 inches) a year.Either way, the numbers are alarming to experts.In European countries, even 4 millimetres (0.15 inches) of yearly subsidence is considered a crisis, Iranian environmental activist Mohammad Darvish said.Created with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Demonstrators hold a huge banner reading \u0027Madrid\u0027s taxi demands that the law has to be enforced\u0027 as drivers protest outside IFEMA Convention and Congress Center, against the regulation of ride-hailing and car-sharing services such as Uber and CabifyFrench President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel shake hands after signing a French-German friendship treaty in the town hall of Aachen, western Germany.

Cracks run down walls and below windows, and water pipes have ruptured. Residents fear poorly built buildings may collapse.The sinking also threatens vital infrastructure, like Tehran\u0027s Imam Khomeini International Airport. German scientists estimate that land under the airport is sinking by 5 centimetres (1.9 inches) a year.Tehran\u0027s oil refinery, a key highway, automobile manufacturing plants and railroads also all sit on sinking ground, said Ali Beitollahi, a Ministry of Roads and Transportation official. Some 2 million people live in the area, he said.Masoud Shafiee, head of Iran\u0027s cartography department, also acknowledged the danger.Rates (for subsidence) are very high and in many instances it\u0027s happening in densely populated areas, Mr Shafiee told AP. It\u0027s happening near sensitive infrastructures like airports, which we consider a top priority.Geopolitics play a role in Iran\u0027s water crisis. Since the country\u0027s 1979 Islamic Revolution, Iran has sought to become self-sufficient across industries to thwart international sanctions. That has included agriculture and food production.The problem, however, comes in inefficient water use on farms, which represents more than 90 per cent of the country\u0027s water usage, experts say.Already, the drought and water crisis has fed into the sporadic unrest Iran has faced over the last year. In July, protests around Khorramshahr, some 650 kilometres (400 miles) southwest of Tehran, saw violence as residents of the predominantly Arab city near the border with Iraq complained of salty, muddy water coming out of their taps amid the years-long drought.The unrest there only compounds the wider unease felt across Iran as it faces an economic crisis sparked by President Donald Trump\u0027s decision to withdraw America from Tehran\u0027s nuclear deal with world powers.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has long opposed Iran\u0027s theocratic government, even released an online video in June offering his country\u0027s water technology in a jab at Iran\u0027s leaders.The Iranian regime shouts: \u0027Death to Israel,’” Mr Netanyahu said. In response, Israel shouts: \u0027Life to the Iranian people.’”Iranian officials shrugged off the offer. But solutions to the water crisis will be difficult to find.Iran impatient to go to war with Israel, says head of air forceWill America’s sanctions against Iran actually sink the regime?US plan to host Iran conference in Poland angers authorities in TehranUS struggles to find footing on Yemen, as Iran increases influenceThe crisis stems from decades of sanctions and compounding political mismanagement that is likely to make it very difficult to alleviate the emerging crisis before it wreaks lasting damage upon the country, wrote Gabriel Collins, a fellow at Rice University\u0027s Baker Institute.\u0026nbspIranian authorities have begun to crack down on illegal water wells. They are also exploring using desalinisation plants along the Persian Gulf as well, though they require tremendous energy. Farming practices also need to change as well, experts say.We need to shift our development model so that it relies less on water and soil, Mr Darvish, the activist, said. If we don\u0027t act quickly to stop the subsidence, it can spread to other areas.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

He also co-owns a house in Surrey.Mishcon de Reya first hired him in  as a part-time consultant for its business crime unit.He quit client work for the firm in April , but was reappointed as a consultant to its in-house academy in June this year.The MP stood down from that role after being appointed to the shadow cabinet last month.Starmer is the third key figure from the lacklustre £.m Operation Elveden witchhunt of Sun reporters to be employed by Mishcon de Reya.His former principal legal adviser at the Crown Prosecution Service Alison Levitt and former politan police assistant commissioner Sue Akers – who headed the bungled investigation – have also done work for the firm.This week Starmer refused to apologise after reporter Anthony France had his conviction overturned - meaning not one of  Sun journalists arrested were convicted.A spokeswoman for the law firm said: “Keir Starmer was a consultant to the Mishcon Academy, our in-house centre for learning and development.“The role did not involve client advice on any issue. Keir resigned as a consultant to the academy when he was appointed to the Shadow Cabinet.”A spokesman for Starmer’s office said: “MPs are required to register and declare fees received since the May  election even where those fees were earned before the election.“The register makes it very clear that in the case of Keir Starmer, the vast majority of his declared earnings represent payment for work undertaken by him as a lawyer before he became MP.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It is a bid for power without a mandate.Shty Dominic Grieve fancies himself as a Remain superhero, outwitting the Government to rob .million voters.He doesn’t give a damn about the little people, of course, being a grand QC and former Attorney General.But Grieve is doing catastrophic harm to his party, to Parliament and our democracy. History won’t be kind to him.The Government he is destabilising is the only prayer Leavers have.Their betrayal by Labour is close, and inevitable.Labour’s Brexit chief Keir Starmer now admits that he aims to secure a second referendum — then campaign, and vote, for Remain.If that’s not Corbyn’s policy, why isn’t Starmer fired All the chaos brings Theresa May ever closer to an election.One in which every Tory Remainer plotting to kill Brexit must be deselected and replaced.With candidates who stay loyal to voters and make promises they intend to keep.SADIQ Khan’s “poll tax” on drivers looks like the biggest disaster of his inglorious tenure as London Mayor.We know he is a lightweight who prefers virtue-signalling to fixing the city’s problems.

I’m voluntarily withdrawing from their process.DANCING On Ice viewers can’t say they weren’t warned.“After the break,” said host Phillip Schofield, “Gemma Collins is Marilyn Monroe. Don’t go away.”A big ask. But then so’s stling a fit of the giggles when Richard Blackwood describes himself as “the king of cool”, and trying to look at Ryan Side-bottom’s Beauty and the Beast make-up without thinking of Terry Waite chained to a radiator in the Lebanon.The Gemmasaurus, though, performed at least three television miracles at Sunday’s Musicals-themed night.The first was being hoisted into the DOI rafters, on  board a giant ring, within  seconds, by the same team who got the London Eye upright.The second involved claiming the moral high ground, from Jason Gardiner, during a spectacular toddler tantrum at the end of her Diamonds Are A Girl’s Best Friend routine.And the third, but biggest of all, was somehow getting voted through to next week’s show despite re-writing the entire history of musicals. Gentlemen, it transpires, no longer prefer blondes.They can’t  stand them, in fact.QUIZ show doughballs of the week. The Chase, Bradley Walsh: “The Burger And The King is a documentary about which singer’s eating habits ”Gianluca: “Billie Jean King.”The Time It Takes, Joe Lycett: “If I meow, what animal am I ”Poppy: “A goat.”Celebrity Mastermind, John Humphrys: “In an  poem, what season of the year does Keats describe as ‘the season of mists and mellow fruitfulness’ ”Monty Panesar: “Oliver Twist.”Joe Lycett: “The fictional Champion the Wonder Horse is actually a what ”Ben: “A zebra.”. THIS Morning handover of the week. Holly Willoughby: “Love against the odds is the subject of the phone-in today. Vanessa Feltz, what kind of calls are you hoping for today ”“We’re looking for calls from people who think their love is against the odds.”And that’s why it’s about to win a National Television Award for the ninth year in a row. ANOTHER week brings another incompatible pair of reality TV gimps, with an E title that also sounds suspiciously like their viewing figures.Spencer, Vogue and Baby Too, a fly-on-the-wall documentary, about Matthews and Williams of that ilk, which is based  on the classic misapprehension of every first-time parent: The world is simply full of people who give the slightest toss about their newborn.It’s not. Nor is anyone listening when they bang on about the “tiredness, sleepless nights and blah blah blah”.The only reason I kept watching this one, in fact, was to try to establish exactly how Spencer and Vogue earn a living, as they’re one of those independently wealthy couples who give very little clue as to why they’re always so “busy, busy, busy”.It took a couple of episodes, but eventually Vogue muttered some- thing about her own fake tan range and Spencer said something even less convincing about cooking, before adding: “We bring dferent things to the table.” The urge Spencer really wants to milk, it turns out though, is a creative one. So, at the climax of episode two he’s striding into London’s Soho Theatre for an audition, with the defiant announcement: “I’m going to open or shut the door on my childhood dream of becoming an actor.”And how’s that going Make sure it bangs your a*** on the way out, Spencer.TV GOLD: The Paras: Men Of War, on ITV. BBC’s Revolution In Ruins: The Hugo Chavez Story detailing exactly how socialism, with Jeremy Corbyn’s connivance, destroyed Venezuela, the most oil-rich country in South America.Sky Atlantic repeating series one of The Sopranos.

Ah, oui, Dominique. Not as British as you might think, Grieve.Which may explain why he  is now doing such terrible damage to our national interest and to the future of our parliamentary system by trying to block Brexit. Over the two decades since he became an MP in , this pukka, posh-suited, punctilious figure has been a pedantic regular in House of Commons debates.He would crook one of his little fingers at an angle, give his neck muscles a creaky tweak and insist, with a shot of the cuffs and a shuffle of minimal notes, that ministers and officials must always comply with statute and precedent and time-honoured procedure.When giving these lectures — they were seldom short — he would touch the rim of his glasses, give a little mallard-style cough and allow a patronising smile to inhabit his broadening bill.He would explain that raw political instinct and passion, of the sort voiced by the Nigel Farages and Jeremy Corbyns of this world,  were not by themselves good enough in politics. He looked down on such things.Politicians whose demagogic brio reflected the public’s molten anger  Puh-lease, how vulgar. They did not accord with Grieve’s gods of logic.“With respect,” he would say — and it is one of the older truths of Westminster that when people say “with respect” they mean the sneery opposite — “with respect, we have to do things according to the rules, for that is the way this Parliament works and those are the sort of people we are.”I paraphrase him but that was very much Grieve’s position. He was a creature of propriety.He could cite legal sub-section and addendum and annex and codicil that proved, we were told, the unarguable merits of his position.With Monsieur half-French Grieve, the ancient principles of English law were our majesty. Our mainstay!Plenty of us clocked that Grieve was a bit of a prune, an oddball, the fogeyish son of privilege. His dad Percy, wouldn’t you know it, had also been a Tory MP of the gusset-and-sock-suspenders old school.Percy once worked as a liaison officer for French wartime hero Charles de Gaulle, who hated the British . It was said that Old Man Grieve agreed with de Gaulle.“The trouble with Percy  is that he likes foreigners  a great deal better than his own people,” concluded an acquaintance.Dominic, in childhood, worshipped his father and once won a school oratory contest by making an admiring speech about de Gaulle.Does “Dominique”, too, like continentals better than his fellow countrymen  It sure looks that way. In June , in one of the greatest thumpings our elite was ever given by the people, we voted to leave the EU. Dominic Grieve, newly decorated with France’s Legion d’honneur for his political work, was horried.Indignant. You could even say he was ag-Grieved. And so he touched the rims of his glasses, did some ducky quacking and set to work to block Brexit.The trouble, as has often been pointed out to him, was that the democratic vote had gone against him.At first he said, through gritted teeth , that he would respect the result of the referendum.In  he was re-elected as MP for prosperous Beaconsfield, Bucks,  on a Tory manesto which said exactly that.Every Tory MP promised to get us out of the customs union and single market.Labour MPs also promised to honour the referendum result. What lying bastards these people are. When the new Government started to get into political dficulties, the once-principled Grieve saw his chance. He stopped saying he would respect the referendum result. He wanted us to stay in the customs union. He wanted a second referendum.Most startling of all, he plotted to bypass all those rules and time-honoured procedures he used to say were so vital for our political safety.After a secret meeting with the appallingly biased John Bercow, Grieve got that anti-Brexit Commons Speaker to chuck out centuries of accepted debating rules.Propriety was smashed like plates at a Greek wedding. Legal advice was ignored.This former Attorney General’s campaign against Brexit, which will next week see him and a minority of MPs attempt to remove law-making from the elected Government, took on a wild, crazed aspect.The possible upshots for our democratic system are terrying. When MPs stop even bothering to pretend they will honour their election promises, why should anyone vote Why not just seize power by force  It’s a recipe for anarchy on the streets.At the moment, Corbyn’s Labour Party is going along with Grieve and Bercow but Corbyn will surely eventually realise that warping parliamentary rules to stop an elected Government from governing will do him no favourshe himself becomes Prime Minister.  It always takes time for the penny to drop with dozy Corbyn.Meanwhile, we are left  with the bizarre spectacle of one-time legal details nerd Dominic Grieve going back  on everything he ever stood for, overturning ancient parliamentary conventions.All along, it seems, his loyalties were not to a rules-based system but to the blue flag of a European Union that is now, increasingly, our rival and our deadly threat.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Every time rent control has been tried, in every place, it has had disastrous consequences.Rent control will make London’s housing crisis worse by decreasing the availability and quality of housing.Its not backed by a single competent economist and Londons mayor shows hes not serious by suggesting such an economically illiterate policy.Polls show that most renters back the policy and believe it would help ease the housing crisis."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/NINTCHDBPICT000463793125.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"brexit mess political party rod liddle opinion","story":"So I tell you what — let’s have a party.Thing is, I don’t mean a shindig where we all get copiously rat-a***d.I mean a political party. A new political party, which represents what a lot of us want.Because you’ve got to say — the parties in Westminster aren’t doing that, are they Whatever happens at the end of this awful Brexit mess, one thing is clear, our politics have to change.The isions between our current parties no longer reflect the isions in the country. If Brexit has told us anything, it’s told us that.And there is a growing anger out there that the views of millions and millions of people are simply not represented in Parliament.That’s obvious from Brexit — more than a third of Labour voters wanted us to leave. Including a majority in some northern constituencies. Almost two thirds of Tory voters wanted us to leave.Nigel Farage, the former leader of Ukip, has already said he fancies creating a new party. A Brexit Party.Good luck to the man — I might even join it, because I have the horrible feeling our Parliament is going to betray the people, and we’ll end up staying in. That would be a travesty of democracy.The very reasons which convinced more than million of us to vote for Brexit were the same as those which are causing isions across Europe. And as a result we’ve seen the huge rise of populist parties. In Italy, Hungary, Poland, Slovakia, Greece, France and even Germany. Oh — and, of course — the USA.These parties are sometimes right wing, sometimes left wing. In Italy there is an alliance between the two.What they are all, though, is dferent to the politics we have now. They are parties which listen to the people. Populist is just another way of saying popular, really.Most agree on a whole bunch of issues. We need to control immigration, number one. Especially immigration from Islamic countries.We need a bit more respect for the nation state: People feel proud of the countries in which they live. Yes, even some Belgians.A lot are socially conservative. By which I mean they do not have much time for gender neutral toilets, LGBTQI protests, political correctness and so on.Instead, they have a respect for traditional values. For the family, for the Christian faith, on which our countries were founded. For our histories. And they are sceptical of the European Union.But they also recognise that there are deep economic isions within our countries which need to be addressed. In our own country a terrible chasm between the affluence and influence of London, versus the rest of the country. Between rich and poor.We have no political party right now which covers those bases.But that is where the real ide in society lies. So, as January drags on — how about a party  One that represents US Labour MP Diane Abbott thinks that the BBC Question Time programme discriminated against her because she is:a blackAbbott got a rough ride and the audience spent most of the time laughing at her or booing.Diane, listen. It’s not your skin colour. It’s not your gender.It’s something  altogether.We are used to politicians speaking down to us.And we are used to politicians being thick.But when both occur at the same time, that’s when the rest of us decide we’ve had enough.Stuff the BBC won’t tell you.Number One – The International Monetary Fund has admitted it got its projections wrong.The UK economy is not stagnating. Economic growth for the next year will be every bit as strong as in France and Germany.And meanwhile all the other indicators – investment, employment, growth in wages – are MUCH better than those in the European Union.Someone tell Huw Edwards.Yet again I’ve accepted a Facebook friend request from a woman without checkingshe’s a proper woman, rather than a porno sock-puppet.Sure enough, within the minute, I was invited to view intimate photographs of the lady.And she ended her invitation with the words: “Slap my frog, cowboy!”Why would I want to slap her frog  I hope her frog has a long and happy le. And why am I a cowboyTheres nothing funnier than slebs making idiots of themselves while politically grandstanding.Gary Lineker, for example, does it every week. His intellect is about as radiant as a candle flame in an aircraft hangar. But he still gives it large, ranting about Brexit. And praising Europe’s worst leader, France’s Emmanuel Macron.The latest slebs to fall foul are the Spice Girls. They posed for photos in “edgy”T-shirts reading: Gender Justice. Now it’s been revealed those shirts were made in a workshop by women who are paid p per hour.There’s gender justice for you.The memorial to Bomber Command in London’s Hyde Park has been defaced by scumbags.They threw paint over the sculpture – and also vandalised statues of Winston Churchill and US President Franklin D. Roosevelt.Our pilots in World War Two won a battle against all the odds to protect this country from fascism. More than , of them died doing so.The filth who vandalised the memorial know nothing of that.

I would say she was easily travelling at around  miles per hour.“But as soon as I stood up and turned around, I just saw this woman come hurtling towards me.“The impact sent me flying backwards into the water and I instantly started panicking that she had come down after my daughter and crushed her at the bottom.“The pain was excruciating and my eyes were just rolling back in my head.”The mum from Seaford, East Sussex, was rushed to the nearest hospital after slipping in and out of consciousness.Jemma claims she was then told her insurance didnt cover the hospital care as she had been taken to a private hospital.She later found out thatshe was taken to the nearest state hospital, which was two hours away, she would have died.Jemma, who still hasn’t been able toto work, said she felt like she was in an episode of Casualty with all of her injuries.She alleged: “If it was left up to Thomas Cook I would be dead and my children would be in the Turkish care system somewhere.”Recalling the nightmare visit, she said: “As soon as I got there, they gave me an emergency CT scan and it showed I had internal bleeding and my liver had a cm laceration.“It also showed that my kidney had been damaged.

They only have interests, guts and the ambition to take Venezuelas oil, gas and gold.Guaido issued a rival statement urging foreign embassies to ignore Maduro’s threats and keep their diplomats in the country.A few hours later, Pompeo confirmed the US would ignore Maduro’s threats to withdraw their embassy staff.The Secretary of State warned the “the Venezuelan military and security forces” against attempting to force US diplomats to leave the country.He warned America would take “appropriate action”US nationals were “endangered.”Pompeo said: “The United States will take appropriate actions to hold accountable anyone who endangers the safety and security of our mission and its personnel.”Trump branded Maduro’s government “illegitimate” and said that America stands with Venezuela.Maduro destroyed the oil-rich South American nation’s economy sparking rampant inflation which wrecked its health system and left his people starving.Charismatic Guaidó - a -year-old lawmaker scarred by rubber bullets in street demos - has boosted stalled efforts to finally oust limpet-like Maduro, .He has also won the crucial support of neighbouring nations Brazil and Colombia and Donald Trump’s US.The march and further unrest in the capital, Caracas followed two nights of violent protests in working-class neighbourhoods of Caracas where Maduro support was once firm.Other protests were planned across the country and outside embassies around the world.Guaidó warned notoriously brutal Maduro: “The world’s eyes are on our homeland today.”Guaidó - head of the countrys National Assembly - earlier described the president as a “usurper” and declared himself ready to assume the presidency until fair elections.He went on to bravely call on armed forces keeping Maduro in power to disobey the government.Venezuela - whose hard-left regime was saluted by Jeremy Corbyn in  - sits on the biggest oil reserves on earth.But its rulers have presided over rampant hyperinflation rendering the Boli currency worthless and sparked food and medicine shortages while crime rocketed.Street unrest boiled over amid spiralling economic turmoil after three million Venezuelans fled triggering a refugee crisis across the continent."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/NINTCHDBPICT000463981748.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"malaysia king sultan abdullah pahang","story":"He had spent a few days back on his royal duties, as he had been away for two months on medical leave.In a statement, the palace said the king was grateful for the opportunity given to him by the Council of Rulers and thanked the prime minister and government.A statement from the palace said: His Highness has worked towards fulfilling his responsibilities entrusted to him as the head of state, serving as a pillar of stability, source of justice, the core of unity ... for the people.But while the official reason is not known, the -year-old King had just married Oksana Voevodina, , who converted to Islam last April just so she could wed him  last November.Rumours had linked the so-called secret marriage to the abdication.It is not known how the pair met and it is unclear whether she has been married before.The palace did not respond to requests for comment on the photos or reports of a marriage.But previous newspaper reports shown Oksana on a reality TV show taking part in a steamy scene in a swimming pool.Pro-Kremlin newspaper Komosomolskaya Pravda reported the royal we clutched a Champagne glass as she surprised the participants of a reality show by having sex on her first date."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/NINTCHDBPICT000464026315.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"british lip king jordan james parke reveals he can hardly breathe after fourth nose job in 130k transformation to look like kim kardashian","story":"Surgery-obsessed Jordan James Parke, , has branded himself Britains Lip King after going under the kne a staggering  times for costly cosmetic procedures.As well as the nose jobs, Jordan has had upper eyelid surgery, a lip lt, a chin implant and several rounds of liposuction.But the expensive surgery has cost Jordan more than cash as he now claims to have respiratory issues.The Kim K wannabe this week appeared on the US reality TV show Botched to beg cosmetic surgeons to let him have even more work done to fix his breathing.Jordan, from Birmingham, said: Hopefully they can help me with my nose, make my nose a tiny bit smaller and help my breathing a bit more.He also asked them to fix his lumpy lipo, referencing a botched liposuction procedure that left his abdomen in worse shape than before.But to his horror, doctors Paul Nass and Terry Dubrow refused to operate again.They advised that further liposuction would make his stomach looser, while more surgery on his nose would involve removing a rib.One of the docs said: Surgery would involve taking a piece of rib and inserting it to open up your nose and make your nose fatter.In , ahead of his third nose job, Jordan revealed he had spent more than £, on surgery over six years.He said: Plastic surgery is like sex.

It is hard-nosed realism.Signicantly, it bears the ­signature of Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, Angela Merkel’s chosen successor as Germany’s next Chancellor.Her appeal can be seen as a rebuke to Mrs Merkel, who rejected David Cameron’s plea for help to curb immigration, tipping ­Britain towards Brexit.Brits might have chosen dferentlyshe had responded to voters’ dismay not just in Britain but across the EU.She later signed her own political death warrant by flinging open Europe’s borders to a million Syrian migrants.But voters’ resentment towards arrogant EU leaders — recorded by their own Eurostat polling system — long predates immigration.Embattled French President Emmanuel Macron recently admitted he had dared not offer his voters a “Frexit”  ­referendum — because they would leave in a flash.Weeks later, his fears were confirmed as “yellow-vest” anarchists set Paris ablaze.French observers believe the gilets jaunes riots have their origins in another referendum crisis.In , France voted overwhelmingly against the European Constitution — only to see it renamed the Lisbon Treaty and slyly introduced against their express wishes.The European Constitution, like the disastrous euro, was a crucial but unpopular step towards a federal European superstate.Ireland and ­Denmark have also voted down EU moves to ever-closer union.They were told to vote again until they said Yes.Brussels’ arrogant contempt for ordinary voters — dismissed by one French president as “scum” — is what politicians blithely describe as the “democratic deficit”.It sowed the seeds for Brexit. Immigration simply brought it to a head.Germany’s letter to The Times reads like a plea from a deserted lover.“Without your great nation, this continent would not be what it is today — a community defined by freedom and ­prosperity,” writes Germany’s next Chancellor.“Should Britain wish to leave the European Union for good, it will always have friends in Germany and Europe.”This is precisely what British voters hoped for as they ­teetered on the brink of Remain but opted to Leave.They wanted a civilised orce between economic and diplomatic allies.This is still possiblethe border issue can be resolved.If we can persuade the IRA to decommission deadly weapons, surely we can decommission a backstop that nobody wants Theresa May’s rejected deal is not a total failure. Without this problem it could still fly.Germany holds the key.If Mrs Kramp-Karrenbauer means what she said about friendship, now is the time to prove it.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Askedthe Government had put the firm up to issue warnings about the consequences of leaving the EU without an agreement, Ms Bennett told Sky News: No, the Government didnt. The Government have been talking to us and other industry representatives all the time, of course, and weve given them lots of information about the potential impacts.   But they did say could you make sure that you make clear the potential impact of a no deal , and we are happy to do that because no deal is potentially going to be catastrophic for us. Chief executive Tom Enders issued a naked threat to leave the UK by warning it was madness to assume the firm will stay. He said: If theres a no-deal Brexit, we at Airbus will have to make potentially very harmful decisions for the UK. Business Minister Richard Harrington welcomed the companys threat in a frank admission. He said: This is a disaster for business. I am very happy to be public about it and very happythe prime minister decides I am not the right person [to be business minister as a result.]  Mr Enders video message in the latest business blow to Britain Britain as the March  date to leave ticks closer. In recent days Dyson has announced its head office will move to Singapore and PO Ferries re-flagged its whole fleet to Cyprus. Airbus employs more than , people in the UK with around , more jobs connected in supply chains.   In a global economy the UK no longer has the capability to go it alone. Major aerospace projects are multinational affairs, Mr Enders said in his video message. It is a disgrace that, more than two years after the result of the  referendum, businesses are still unable to plan properly for the future. We, along with many of our peers, have repeatedly called for clarity, but we still have no idea what is really going on here.It is not the first time Airbus has threatened to pull out of the UK over Brexit. Last year the firm said it would reconsider its investments in the UK, and its long-term footprint in the countrythere is no deal.Theresa May has repeatedly refused calls to take the threat of a No Deal Brexit off the table.But MPs are set to approve a move next week that could delay Brexit and stop a No Deal being triggered on March .No is against the amendment by Labour MP Yvette Cooper but Remain-backing ministers secretly hope it will pass.Chancellor Philip Hammond will the World Economic Forum in Davos that post-Brexit Britain will still be a great place to do business. However, Mr Enders said Britains multibillion-pound aerospace sector, a world-leader for a century, is standing at a precipice. Brexit is threatening to destroy a century of development based on education, research and human capital, he said. If theres a no-deal Brexit, we at Airbus will have to make potentially very harmful decisions for the UK.  Airbuss UK operations generate around pound billion of turnover annually, making it the countrys largest aerospace company. At its  sites it builds components for a broad spectrum of products from planes to helicopters and satellites. Please dont listen to the Brexiteers madness which asserts that because we have huge plants here we will not move and we will always be here. They are wrong, Mr Enders said.   Of course it is not possible to pick up and move our large UK factories to other parts of the world immediately. However, aerospace is a long-term business and we could be forced to redirect future investments in the event of a no-deal Brexit. And, make no mistake, there are plenty of countries out there who would love to build the wings for Airbus aircraft. Theresa Mays spokesman insisted the “UK is an excellent place to do business”. He said: Airbus said in their statement that the delivery of a pragmatic withdrawal agreement that allows for an orderly Brexit is best for Britain. That is exactly why the Prime Minister has been working so hard to deliver a deal that gives businesses certainty, with an implementation period and an orderly exit. He added: “There is no question that leaving a deal is in the best interests of the UK. “Thats why the PM is working hard to achieve that.” "},{"url":null,"title":"brexit whsmith stockpiles six months","story":"NewsBrexit: WHSmith stockpiles six months of pens and notebooksThe stationers, who source most of their products from Asia, normally hold between three and four months worth of pens and notepadsShareCommentsByNicola BartlettPolitical Correspondent:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN NewsWHSmith want to avoid disruptions to the supply of stationery \"Get politics updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email WHSmith have said they are stockpiling six months worth of pens to guard against chaos at the border caused by Brexit .The stationers, who source most of their products from Asia, normally hold between three and four months worth of pens, diaries and notepads.

The government has revealed a little-known loophole that could bar families from holiday hotspots like France and Spain this summer. Since last year, Brits have been warned to have at least six months left on their passportthey want to travel to the EU in a No-Deal. But now officials admit some people will need to renew much earlier than that. Its because between  and September , some UK passports were issued with more than  years lespan. Yet those extra months - awarded when people carried over time from their old passport - wont countyou are entering the EU.  Soyou have a passport that is valid for longer than  years, you should not just count six months back from the expiry date to find out when it wont be valid. Instead you should count  years and six months forward from the date it was issued to find out when itll no longer be valid in the EU. Before the scheme ended in , Brits were able to get up to nine months added to the usual -year lespan of their passport.That means, as a maximum, some people will have to renew their passports  months early - nine months that dont count in the EU, plus another six months before the expiry date. Government guidance explains: Since , some adult British passports were issued with a validity longer than  years.If you renewed your passport before it expired, you were allowed to have the time left on your old passport added to your new passport.The maximum validity period possible was  years and  months.  This means you can’t use the expiry date to checkyour adult passport will be valid under the new rules. These rules will only applyBritain leaves the EU on March  without a Brexit deal. That is looking less likely as MPs plot to delay the date of Brexit. But the fact remains that, with just  days to go, the UK has still not agreed any final Brexit deal with the EU.

Shaun Smiths Essex flat is covered in pictures of the ex-Girls Aloud singer after a pound, makeover. He shelled out the cash on pictures, canvases, ceiling decorations and even a lesize cardboard cut-out of the celeb - best known as Cheryl Cole. Shaun, , told Essex Live: I have a big cardboard cut-out of her and its on my cupboard door as I dont have enough space because I have so much stuff in my front room. I have Cheryl Cole carpet which I had made, I have got three rugs and I even have a dog bed.  I spend so much - I love her. I watched a video on YouTube from Girls Aloudand I was told one of the members was Cheryl Cole and I didnt believe them. But I got the video of Fight For This Love up and I realised it was her, explained the fanatic.   She is a lovely person, shes caring, shes good and has a good voice and personality. She is not rude and appreciates what people do. Also, it doesnt bother her what people say and that is what I like about her. Shaun began his collection seven months ago in the summer of , and has decorated his home top to bottom.  When he looks at his ornaments and custom designs it makes him happy. He said: I feel happy that she is here and I feel content in my le. I feel I have got someone. She is someone I could look up to as a role model. He also claims that the star liked a photo of his collection when she was tagged on Twitter. The superfan has only become fixated on the star, when another actor and character he liked fell off his radar. Shaun previously spent years collecting photos and items with the face of Eastenders Ben Mitchell, played by Harry Reid, between  and .  He had hundreds of pictures of the star in his home, including clothing and cushion covers made to decorate his home. He spent around pound, to cover his flat in his favourite character that he says helped him come out proudly about his sexuality. I have more stuff of Cheryl than I ever had of Harry and Im really happy with having Cheryl, I have picture frames, photos and Im made up and really happy. Shaun fell out of love of the actor and character and admitted he stopped watching the soap. However, he did manage to see one of the last episodes Harry Reid played hardman Phil Mitchells son, in the scene where he flees on a boat.  It has since been announced that the character will be making a comeback to the show with another face and the sixth actor to attempt the role, Max Bowden. Shaun revealed what he thought about the new Ben: I will be very intrigued what the new Ben will be like and how the new guy will play him - I still like the character of Ben Mitchell. But what happened to all of his collectibles  I sold some of my Ben Mitchell stuff and the rest I gave to charity shops, he said.  I have still got my two cardboard cutouts in plastic bags in the shed, as the charity shop said they couldnt take them as they were too big. One of my friends also bought a lot of things from me, such as a laptop case and a lighter. Shaun also became a local star when his Ben Mitchell collection was featured in the press, but he also received unwanted and hurtful comments about his clothing and collection back in . The -year-old was also the victim of theft at kne-point after someone stole pound cash, a mobile phone and a hard drive. The shocking incident occurred on March ,  and left the Basildon nativedevastated as the hard drive held irreplaceable photos of his late mother. Online trolls hit out at Shaun and left hurtful comments about him on social media.  After Shaun became famous locally, people even stopped him to ask for his autograph. Now his attentions are focused on Cheryl, and he says she is here to stay. Thinking about how others react to his obsession, Shaun carries on confidently. Some people said I have gone over the top on Cheryl, he explained, But it has nothing to do with them - its up to me.

Researchers who polled , gym-goers identied the foods which cause us to stray from our healthy lestyles – including chips, doughnuts and burgers. We’re also tempted to put the dumbbells to one side when faced with the likes of cake, bread and Chinese takeaways. Commissioned by supermarket Iceland, stockists of low-calorie ice cream, Halo Top, the research also found two thirds consider going without their favourite foods to be one of the hardest things about being healthy.   A spokesman for Iceland said: “As the research shows, being fit and healthy doesn’t mean the hankerings for bad foods go away. “So it’s completely understandable we will waiver from time to time. “And it’s typical the foods we most long for tend to be high calorie - however there are foods available which are low calorie and can fill that void.” It also emerged Saturday is the day gym-goers find it hardest to stick to a sensible diet - and they’ll typically succumb to temptation at precisely .pm.   But Tuesday is the day willpower is at its strongest and when those polled are most likely to resist indulgent foods. Wine, beer and fizzy drinks also commonly cause those polled to fall off the healthy wagon - along with crisps, biscuits and sweets. So in order to work off their food sins gym-goers believe they need to exercise a minimum of six times a month. After indulging,  per cent will go out for a long walk, a fth will go swimming and a quarter will go for a run in order to burn off the excess calories.   But four in  revealed the urge for ice cream and other treats is so strong they exercise just so they can eat whatever they want without fear for their waistlines. However, the Iceland research carried out through OnePoll also found half would rather eat the frozen dessert than do a set of squats, lt weights or use a running machine. The spokesman for Iceland added: “Halo Top is the best ice cream on the market right now, there is no compromise on taste or quality so it really is a dessert you can feel good about.”  Top  foods we miss most when working out.

Stephen Waterson is accused of deliberately ramming his electric seat onto the three-year-old after he was placed in the back footwell of an Audi A convertible by his mum, Adrian Hoare. Alfie died three days later after suffering a cardiac arrest at home in Croydon, south London. Both Waterson, , and Hoare, , deny charges of manslaughter at the Old Bailey. Jurors have been shown the Audi A after it was brought to a court car park as evidence. They were instructed to remain silent as they inspected the car and made notes, while an officer carried out a brief demonstration.  Mr Justice Kerr, presiding over the case, told the  jurors: The purpose of the exercise is for you to see the car. It is not a reconstruction of any kind of what happened. The jurors then took turns peering into the car, inspecting the passenger sear and back footwell. Prosecutor Duncan Atkinson QC claimed the reclined seat was a deliberate action by Waterson, who was angered by the noise and fuss that a three-and-a-half-year-old was making during the journey.Emilie Williams, , was sitting next to Alfies mum Hoare in the back of the car during the ill-fated trip back from shopping in Sutton, south London, on February  last year.  In a videoed police interview, Miss Williams said they all went together, with Marcus Lamb, , driving.She said she was forced to put a second youngster in the rear footwell next to Alfie because she was not allowed to take the childrens car seat. Miss Williams said Alfie was crying so much it sounded like he was choking, but that his mother said he was OK. Marcuss chair was right forward and Stephens chair was right back, she said. Alfie was kicking the chair, asking him to move it forward.  Waterson said no because he said he had to stretch his legs right out, Miss Williams said. Prosecuting, Mr Atkinson said: Until he got into that vehicle with his mother and those others, CCTV showed that Alfie had been fit and well. It follows that during that car journey something happened to Alfie to compress his chest and abdomen so that he went from an active toddler, to a very seriously ill and brain damaged one.

The Duchess of Sussex closed down all her social media accounts in January  after getting engaged to Prince Harry . It was an expected move and a signal of her subscribing to the royal way of le by surrendering her public image to Kensington Palace. But at some stage last year, according a royal insider quoted in The Sun , Meghan set up a secret account so she could keep in touch with friends. But apparently the pregnant former Suits star was so upset by the negative backlash she closed her account at Christmas to protect her mental health.   Since late last year the -year-old has been the subject of critical reports, including that royal staff dubbed her “Duchess Dficult and that she had made Kate Middleton cry in the run up to theroyal wedding in May. A pal is quotes as saying: “She was working on all her projects in private, but couldn’t say anything publicly as her patronages hadn’t been announced. “Since she shut down her public Instagram , she’d had a fake account to follow her friends. “There was some really vile stuff written by social media trolls and obviously she also saw the headlines about her.   The source says the abuse got to her to such an extent she shut the account down before Christmas. The suits actress was very active in Instagram before meeting Harry, regularly posting pictures of her swanky Toronto house. But working royals are banned from having social media accounts. Princesses Eugenie and Beatrice are the most senior royals to have Instagram accounts. Meanwhile the Duke and Duchess of Sussex are expected to move our of their pound.m country house in the Cotswolds within weeks.

Kenneth Murphy, , has to bravely inch out his front door before struggling down two concrete steps and getting in his chair. His mum Angela released heartbreaking footage of his daily struggle at the home in South Lanarkshire, Scotland, in a desperate plea for help. She said: “I posted the video as I had simply had enough of the situation and hoped that the video would show the true reality of what Kenneth faces on a day-to-day basis. “He is also partially sighted, so this makes it all the worse for him.   She added: “What makes this harder is that I believe that there is a suitable adapted house available in Larkhall lying empty, yet Kenneth has to live like this. “I have been offered alternatives but they don’t meet his needs.” Angela had been living in an adapted home in Hamilton, but following a family bereavement, moved back to Larkhall. She wanted to be close to her family but the move meant that she was forced to rent. Since then, she said there has been no suitable alternative accommodation for herself and -year-old Kenneth. Angela is reluctant to enter into a long-term tenancy as she hopes to be offered something more practical. But Angela says that the council won’t fit a ramp which would help Kenneth get in and out of the house.   Angela, who posted the clip last Friday, said she has been amazed and touched at the level of interest and support it has gathered. She added: I have been completely overwhelmed by the support that I have received from everyone who has shared and viewed it. I was not expecting anything like this and I am so grateful for everyone’s support.” Larkhall Councillor Richard Nelson claimed he was stunned by the clip. He said: “I was shocked at the footage and immediately contacted Angela to discuss further her situation. “I come from a nursing background and was immediately shocked as I have never seen anything like this before. “I was taken aback with the limited input they have received from both social work and housing. “This is a joint partnership and they are not meeting the needs of Kenny. “No-one in this day and age should have to live like this, in my opinion. “I have now written to both the heads of social work and housing and the chief executive and they have acknowledged that I have written to them all and I am currently awaiting an update.”   Lanark and Hamilton East MP Angela Crawley was also shocked and got involved in Kenneth’s case. She said: “The situation is clearly unacceptable and the council must do more to support Kenneth. “I have written to the local authority and asked them to provide urgent assistance to the family.” A South Lanarkshire Council spokesman said: “All service users are assessed based on their inidual needs and, while it would not be appropriate to go into the details of inidual cases, South Lanarkshire Health and Social Care Partnership is committed to supporting this inidual and we are in ongoing discussions with him and his family with regards to his long-term needs. “The council is aware of Mr Murphy’s current housing application and provided advice to the family in December regarding progressing a re-assessment of their current medical priority points to improve their housing prospects.

Twice she crouched right down, first to pick up a dog. Look how far she leans. The she bends down with her coat open, you can see how squished her tummy is.

Kelley Robinson, , put on eight stone - weighing st at a size  - after giving birth to her son Kylo. She began to feel her knees buckling under the pressure of her enormous frame and even started taking diet pills. But she found that combined with working out, she could actually control her calorie intake much more effectively with the microwave meals. She now weighs a healthy st for her ft frame and is a comfy dress size , Cornwall Live reports.  Her chest and cup size also slimmed down - from a F to a more proportionate E. Kelley said: The ready meals made it so easy for me to keep track of exactly what I was consuming calorie wise. They were quick and easy too. It may not sound healthy but I chose low cal ones and it really helped me get started on my weight loss journey. It has got to the point now where people dont actually recognise me on the street. An old friend of mine did a double take the other day when I said hi as she didnt notice it was me at all. My whole outlook on le is dferent. Before all I did was sit about on the sofa and order takeaways whereas now Im super active and have tonnes of energy all the time.  Kelleywas a size  before having Kylo, now three, but after he was born she developed unhealthy eating habits. She typically had white toast for breakfast, followed by sandwich and crisps for lunch, a takeaway for dinner, while snacking on more crisps, fizzy drinks and chocolate. She piled on eight stone, but soon got fed up, and when she got desperate she tried diet pills. They were dreadful, I had no energy and couldnt stop pooing the whole time, she admitted. It was around this time that her fitness fanatic fianceacute, Ryan Lake, stepped in to help. She said: Ryan was amazing, he could see how depressed I was and just gently took control but by coaxing me to the gym. Id never have had the confidence to do it without him. At first I found it so hard, I wanted to give up, I really hated it but I kept at it and with the changes in my diet too I found that I was actually losing weight! She also started eating ready meals, which were typically between  and  calories a meal. Her favourites were Morrison’s Chicken Tikka Masala, Beef Hot Pots or Macaroni, and she started eating Weetabix and fruit for breakfast, with wraps for lunch. The new mum stopped snacking between meals and started swapping sweet drinks for water.  In the first three months of her new regime she lost a whopping three stone. Kelleysaid: It was after that when I got really strict with myself because I realised that I actually I could do it. I cut out carbs, dairy and even quit the ready meals eventually. In a year Kelley had lost NINE stone. She admitted: Im such a gym bunny now its unreal I go whenever I have a second and absolutely love it. I even get up super early before the kids wake up to go and workout for an hour. I go at least six times a week and make sure to do a mix of cardio and weights. Doing the weights have meant that the saggy skin has really toned up, which is one thing I was worried about losing quite so much. Dedicated Kelley, who is also mother to -year-old Tamzin, has noticed far more than just weight loss benefits from her new regime. Her knees are no longer a problem and her down days are well behind her. The mum-of-two said: I was quite low before as I felt so under-confident but these days I really do feel like a new person. One thing I know is that I couldnt have done it without the support of my amazing family, especially Ryan, who loved me whatever size I was but always wanted the best for me.

Terried mum-of-two Laura Bonney, , was injured after a long-running feud turned violent outside her home. Tony Lloyd, , admitted carrying out the broad daylight attack. The court heard she needed four stitches and will suffer permanent scarring as a result being punched and spat at by the defendant. Relations between Lloyd, Laura and her husband Daniel Bonney boiled over on June  last year, a judge was told.   Prosecuting, Philip Lee said there had been a background of bad feeling between the parties and the violence was sparked by comments said to have been made by Lloyd to the Bonneys young son. Mr Lee said: The argument escalated and the defendant approached Laura Bonney shouting abuse. They came close and the defendant was calling Laura Bonney trying to goad Mr Bonney. The defendant told police that Laura Bonney kicked him in the groin causing him to stumble back.   The defendant then struck Laura Bonney with a hard punch to the side of the face and as a result she fell to the ground. A neighbour, Emma Matthews, describes Laura Bonney stumbling back and slumping down the side of a car like a cartoon character. It is possible she was knocked unconscious. The two men continued fighting on the floor, the defendant telling police he got a kicking, while Laura Bonney was bleeding from the face.

Mr Lee added how the defendant then approached the Bonneys car and kicked the car door against them, also spitting at them while the two young children sat in the vehicle. Mr Lee said: The defendant was arrested at his mothers house and told police he went out to confront the Bonneys about the abuse when Laura Bonney kicked him in the b******. He said that he then hit her without thinking but was kicked in the head by Daniel Bonney while on the ground. In an interview outside court Laura said she suffered physical pain and anxiety as a result of the attack and claims she was forced to move out of the area of St Columb Major, Cornwall, where she had been brought up not long after the fracas. Sentencing Lloyd, Judge Robert Linford said: Neighbourly disputes can become most acrimonious.  Ive got no idea what lay behind this and the truth probably lies between what the prosecution say and what you told the police. Lloyd, who pleaded guilty to affray, was made subject of an -month community order, consisting of  rehabilitation activity requirement days to address his anger problems and  hours of unpaid work. He was also ordered to pay Laura Bonney pound compensation as well as being made subject of a three-year restraining order preventing him from contacting the Bonneys, who have since separated. Speaking outside court Laura said she had suffered a lot of trauma over the incident. She said: Its been going on for a while. Initially we got on well but when I got back together with my partner things changed. Its been absolute hell. Laura said she was getting the children in the car in preparation for visiting her mother when she was attacked. She added: My son wandered off into an alleyway and I heard him shouting at my son calling him a f****** rat. He was absolutely petried. He goaded me, calling me a slag and a whore so I rushed the kids into the car then he started on me. I put my arms and legs out to try and keep him away and thats when he punched me in the face. There was blood everywhere and then he started kicking the door while my children were getting into the car. Of course they were absolutely terried.

Coastguard Kerry Jury said: “The owner only shyrealised [what had happened] when he heard a splash in the water. “Dinky was in the water for a little while before a leboat, which was nearby on training duty, recovered him. “The owner was very relieved and the dog was freezing, so it was then taken to the vet’s.”   It is believed the surface of the water broke Dinky’s fall, allowing him to paddle to a nearby beach. He was then picked up by leboat crew and wrapped in a blanket before being reunited with his relieved owner. The man in his s, who did not wish to be named, took his pet for a check-up before going home to Yeovil in Somerset.

Becky Mack, of Swanage Leboat Station, said: “He was incredibly lucky to survive the fall in the first place and avoid hitting any rocks on the way down. “But he was then at risk of the advancing tide. “Luckily we got to him in time. By the time we reached him, the dog was out of the water but still very cold. We put him in a blanket but he seemed visibly okay.” Mr Jury added: “We would advise walkers to keep their dogs on a lead.” "},{"url":null,"title":"royal family dont always wear","story":"NewsWhy Royal Family dont always wear seatbelts, according to former bodyguardSimon Morgan, of Trojan Consultancy, stressed that it was also considered on a case by case basisShareCommentsByZoe ForseyActing Audience Editor:,  JAN News \"Get Royal Family updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email Prince Philip made headlines when he was photographed driving while not wearing his seatbeat just days after he was involved in a horric car crash .People were outraged after the photos emerged, but according to the Royal Familys former bodyguard there might sometimes be a very good reason why members of the Firm decide against it. Simon Morgan, of Trojan Consultancy, stressed that it is also considered on a case by case basis. He claims that sometimes the royals dont buckle up as they might need to be ready to make a quick escape in an emergency.

He also claims that sometimes the decision is made based on the royals appearance. He said: Also, what is signicant about this event or situation  Is an iniduals look and appearance important  And also an iniduals choice.   Protection is a very unique area of policing and there are a lot grey areas, but you are always judging each situation to weigh up the risks and threats with the outcomes you are trying to achieve.

Speaking to the Sunday Mirror, she said: Im lucky to be alive and he hasnt even said sorry. It has been such a traumatic and painful time and I would have expected more of the Royal Family.

But the industry has been constantly betrayed by Tory governments. Ministers are responsible for spending millions on major infrastructure and defence. But less than half of the steel bought by the Government comes from UK firms. At this time of Brexit uncertainty you would think it is more important than ever to buy British. So why do departments ignore the Government’s own guidance by handing out lucrative contracts to overseas’ firms  They put jobs at risk in a sector already struggling because of high energy costs and unfair foreign competition. The Government should use its purchasing power to support our manufacturers. By using our steel they could protect jobs and promote prosperity while reminding other nations of Britain’s role as a global builder.

Nathan Sutherland, , used the stage name SLS or Sleeplessouljaz when he performed for churchgoers in the US city of Phoenix, Arizona, his former pastor says. Footage has emerged showing the adopted siblings performing and describing their upbringing in an interview that was awkward at times. Dad-of-two Sutherland allegedly raped the -year-old quadriplegic woman at Hacienda HealthCare, a long-term care facility where he had worked since , but his lawyer claims there is no proof he committed the act. His second we filed for orce shortly before the woman gave birth.   Hacienda staff had no idea the woman was pregnant until she suddenly went into labour and gave birth just days after Christmas on December . Sutherland has been charged with sexual assault and vulnerable adult abuse in a case that has shocked veteran police officers. The nurse and his sister were a Christian rap duo years ago, and he performed under the name SLS or Sleeplessouljaz, said Marie Mosley, his former pastor.  Ms Mosley, of the Faith Center West Family Church in the Phoenix suburb of Mesa, told NBC News: “That was back in the early days, him and his sister had a rap act. “I haven’t seen him since . He’s been in a lot of churches since then.” A video posted on YouTube by Dog Entertainment Ministries in July  shows Sutherland and his sister, who used the stage name D#G, performing their songs.  In the video, Sutherland says he and his sister were born in Haiti and moved to Arizona after being adopted when he was seven and she was four. He says: My parents, they split up in Haiti, my mum couldnt take care of us so she brought us to an orphanage. One meal a day was a blessing. Thats, basically, how we got adopted, through the orphanage.  He adds: We grew up really, really strict. There was no hip-hop music, not evenit was gospel, but you cant stop what you were made to do. Later, when hes asked to give a positive message to youth, Sutherland says: Its up to you to decide which way you want to go. Try not to make excuses for the way youre behaving. Just keep it real, man. You know you can do it. Sutherlands second we filed for orce on December , about three weeks before the incapacitated woman gave birth, the Arizona Republic reported. They got married in , shortly after he and his first we orced.  Sutherland has two children from his first marriage. Phoenix police arrested and charged Sutherland after a court order allowed detecties to obtain DNA samples from male staff members. The force said Sutherlands DNA sample was a match. His lawyer, David Gregan, told NBC News: “There’s no direct evidence that Mr Sutherland has committed these acts. I know at this point there’s DNA. But he will have a right to his own DNA expert.” Mr Gregan said Sutherland has lived in Arizona since  and does not have a criminal record. Sutherland and his sister have been living in the US since  and he became a naturalised citizen in , according to reports. Hacienda said it performed an extensive background check on Sutherland before he was hired. Sutherland, who was sacked after he was arrested, was released on bail after appearing in court on Wednesday.

The figure, which they believe is the ghost of a former monk, is standing just metres behind them. The couple, who live in Birmingham, are keen ghost hunters and were on a haunted walk at the time but didnt spot the monk when they were there. Helen said: We were the first couple to walk up the steps so there was no one in front of us.   It was a quick memory snap and we werent expecting it to happen so early on in the tour. The tour guide told us that monks from the nearby priory would have walked up the steps towards the castle for prayers and lessons and the shape look similar to a habit. We were very freaked out. The couple didnt look at the photo straight away, but were very excited when they spotted the figure.   Helen said: We had just started the tour, on a car park close to the steps, and only took it as a quick photo, we never even looked at it till a few days later.

She wanted to buried next to her child, but her wish was never granted and so she haunts the castle grounds. Helen said: My parents bought me and John the tickets for the tour as a Christmas present as we had done a few before and got the bug for it.

An international team of conservators spent  years bringing the ,-year-old, decaying tomb - once said to be cursed - back to its former glory. Over the last decade, experts stabilised wall paintings that decorate the boy-kings chamber, installed barriers and set up a ventilation system to reduce damage to the site. They also spent time investigating mysterious brown spots that were growing on wall paintings inside the tomb where the pharaohs mummied body was discovered by British Egyptologist Howard Carter in  - and it is now known what they are.   The restoration work, carried out by the US-based Getty Conservation Instituteand Egyptian Ministry of Antiquities, was unveiled on Wednesday as the tomb reopened to tourists. The brown spots were feared to be growing like a fungus, but conservators confirmed that the spots were microbes that were long dead, Live Science reported. The microbes had not spread since Carter opened the tomb almost  years ago, and they had already grown into the paint layer and could not be removed because doing so would damage the intricate artwork.  The dark spots - once thought to be caused by human interference from visitors bringing bacteria and dust into the tomb - remain on the walls. The nearly intact tomb in the Valley of the Kings in Luxor has fascinated the public - sparking mysteries and theories about a curse against those who enter it - since it was discovered by Carter. The opening of the tomb gave rise to speculation of the “pharaoh’s curse” - a myth fuelled by the death of Lord Carnarvon, who had bankrolled Carters work.  He died of blood poisoning in  after he cut himself shaving. After the discovery, Carters team removed artefacts and the site became a huge draw for tourists. Last year, researchers at Italy’s Turin Polytechnic University found no evidence that hidden chambers exist behind the tombs walls. King Tut died in about  BC at around , having reigned since he was just nine years old. The cause of the boy-kings death is disputed. Theories range from an assassination to an accidental or natural death. Zahi Hawass, Egyptologist and former minister of State for Antiquities in Egypt, said of the -year restoration: Conservation and preservation is important for the future and for this heritage and this great civilization to live forever. The tomb stayed open to tourists through much of the conservation.

Controversial strongman Rodrigo Duterte has sparked outrage by pushing for the age of criminal responsibility to be lowered from  to nine.The Philippines leader - who last month admitted sexually assaulting a maid when he was a schoolboy - has come under fire over the plans.He claims drugs gangs are using young children because they cannot be thrown in jail. But activists claim the policy - which still needs Senate approval - would target youngsters from poor backgrounds.   Eule Rico Bonganay, secretary general of Salinlahi Alliance for Children’s Concerns, said: Children are in a situation where they have to commit crime for survival. Because even government data shows that the profile of children in conflict with the law are mostly … from poor families, they obtained a low level of education and they live in a community where there is a high rate of crime. The law change would see children who commit drug offences - as well as serious crimes including murder - facing mandatory confinement.   Senator Antonio Trillanes, one of Dutertes biggest critics, said: It is anti-family, anti-poor and simply unjust. Moreover, it will promote a heartless and ruthless society that has no regard for its own people. Groups including UNICEF and Save The Children have hit out at the plans, saying children should be protected from criminals, not punished for things they are forced to do. Since July , when Duterte took power, authorities claim , lives have been lost during the presidents war on drugs. But activists claim the real number is far higher, with Duterte accused of turning a blind eye to extrajudicial killings. After his election, Duterte said he would happily exterminate three million drug users. Noting that Hitler had murdered millions of Jews, Duterte said, “There are  million drug addicts .

Chinese scientists say the advance, reported online by the journal National Science Review, shows that a population of customised gene-edited macaque monkeys with unorm genetic background will soon be available for biomedical research.   They said the cloned quintet showed signs of a wide-range of circadian disorder characteristics - including reduced sleep time, elevated night-time locomotive activities, dampened circadian cycling of blood hormones, increased anxiety and depression, as well as schizophrenia-like behaviour. Study senior author and investigator Dr Hung-Chun Chang said: Disorder of circadian rhythm could lead to many human diseases, including sleep disorders, diabetic mellitus, cancer, and neurodegenerative diseases.  Our monkeys thus could be used to study the disease pathogenesis as well as therapeutic treatments. To create the monkey clones, Chinese researchers removed the nucleus from a monkey egg cell and replaced it with another nucleus from a fibroblast, a dferentiated somaticcell. The reconstructed egg then developed into an embryo that carries the genes of the replacement nucleus.   The embryo was then transferred to the womb of a surrogate female monkey that later gave birth to the cloned monkey. Previously, Zhong Zhong and Hua Hua were generated by using cells from an aborted fetus. The five clones were created using cells from a young adult gene-edited donor monkey. Dr Qiang Sun, director of IONs Non-human Primate Research Facility, said: Our approach is to perform gene-editing in fertilised embryos to first generate a group of gene-edited monkeys, and then select one monkey that exhibits correct gene editing and most severe disease phenotypes as the donor monkey for cloning. We believe that this approach of cloning gene-edited monkeys could be used to generate a iety of monkey models for gene-based diseases, including many brain diseases, as well as immune and metabolic disorders and cancer.   The researchers plan to continue improving the technique to increase the efficiency of cloning. They are expecting more macaque clones carrying disease-causing gene mutations to be generated in the coming years. But they said the Institute of Neuroscience follows strict international guidelines for animal research. Co-author Professor Mu-ming Poo, who directs the Institute of Neuroscience and helped to supervise the project, said: This work required coordinated efforts of many laboratories, and serves as a clear example of the efficient team work that is highly emphasised by CAS.  This line of research will help to reduce the amount of macaque monkeys currently used in biomedical research around the world. He added: Without the interference of genetic background, a much smaller number of cloned monkeys carrying disease phenotypes may be sufficient for pre-clinical tests of the efficacy of therapeutics. Since Dolly was cloned in Scotland back in , more than  species of mammals have been cloned around the world - including cattle, cats, dogs, horses and rats.

We didn’t start the game well,” said Jim.“These cup games are always dficult. Just look at the results around the other clubs and there’s been a few shocks.“I’m just glad that we’re still in the cup and we have another chance to recty that performance. We all know it was short of what we’re looking for.”If he was unhappy with his team’s work, the manager did stress the quality Queens showed did not surprise him.“You’ve got to credit Queen of the South. Give them a bit of credit, they played well.“You know what it’s like when a Championship or lower team comes to a Premiership club. You know they are going to be right up for the game and you know you are going to be in a fight.“They beat Ross County - last week which was a fabulous result against a team who’ve just knocked Motherwell out.”On top of getting another chance, Jim was pleased with the debuts he handed to Dieng, Craig Curran and second-half subs Andy Dales and Andrew Nelson.“The positives for me were the introduction of the newer players who all contributed and there will be better days ahead for us.”"},{"url":null,"title":"laurie ellis to leave dundee united","story":"Laurie Ellis will be leaving the Dundee United, the Tele understands.He arrived as assistant manager to Ray McKinnon in  and continued in that role under Csaba Laszlo.When Robbie Neilson arrived in October there was speculation the ex-Raith Rovers stalwart, whose contract is up in the summer, would be replaced by Dunfermline’s Stevie Crawford.While that didn’t happen, Gordon Forrest did become the new No  earlier this month and yesterday saw confirmation of ex-Rangers man Lee McCulloch as striker coach until the end of the season, at least."},{"url":null,"title":"man acting suspiciously at least four times in dundee do you know him","story":"Police Scotland are appealing for information regarding a man seen acting suspiciously in Dundee.He has been seen in and around the Ormiston Crescent area of Whitfield on a number of occasions in the past few days.The man, who is described as in his s, about ft in height and slim build, with light brown hair in a side-swept fringe and with a distinctively shaped nose, has been seen on at least four occasions between Thursday January  and Tuesday January .He has always been seen wearing a tracksuit which is either grey or black in colour, and while he has not been approaching members of the public, he has been behaving in a manner that has caused some alarm.A police statement said: #While a number of witnesses have provided us with relevant information, we still need to identy this person in order to trace him.#If you have any information that could assist our enquiries, please call  or speak to any police officer.#Also, information can be given anonymously through Crime Stoppers on   .

For him, the bottom line is Dundee should have been better than this.“It was very frustrating on Saturday. I think our performance first half, we should be thankful we are still in the cup really,” he said.“It wasn’t good enough. They’ve got the goal to go ahead and then Jesse has done brilliantly just before half-time to get it back and have us level.“It was a good time for us to score and then we did definitely play better in the second half. On the whole, though, it was not good enough.“I suppose it does happen in the cup, we saw that with some of the other results, and the big thing is we are still in there and have a replay where we can make it into the next round.“So we maybe shouldn’t be too hard on ourselves over it but we’re still not happy with the performance.”Like most players after a bad game, now the -year-old just wants to get out on a pitch again and try to put things right.That’s why he breathed a sigh of relief on Sunday when Hearts’ televised clash with Livingston produced a result.Had the Jambos not edged past the Lions, a replay would have been tonight and Dundee’s Premiership visit to Tynecastle would have been postponed.“We have another game right away and that’s good. The one thing we didn’t want was no game this week because Hearts had drawn their cup-tie.“The thing you want to do after the winter break is get back into playing regularly again right away and you don’t want to be missing games because of things like that. You want to get points on the board as soon as possible.”Turning to the subject of the new arrivals, Ralph believes they will signicantly boost the chances of top-flight survival.So far, he’s been impressed by what he’s seen.He added: “I thought the new lads looked sharp and direct. They definitely want to get on the ball, create and make things happen.“I think them coming in this month will be good for the squad and they are going to help us going forward.”"},{"url":null,"title":"one in and one out for dundee united as goalkeeper signs from hibs","story":"Dundee United have signed goalkeeper Ross Laidlaw on loan from Hibs as Matej Rakovan departs the club.The Tangerines have sealed a loan deal until the end of the season for the -year-old after releasing Slovakian goalie Rakovan with  months remaining on his contract.Laidlaw has played  times for the Hibees, winning the Championship in  in the process, and will challenge with Benjamin Siegrist for the gloves at Tannadice.Manager Robbie Neilson said: “Ross joins us to compete for the first-team goalkeeping position.#He brings important experience having won this championship with Hibs and most importantly is an excellent goalkeeper.#I have been looking to improve the competition within the goalkeeping set-up, and I am happy to see Ross here.“Rakovan played  times for the Tangerines, keeping one clean sheet."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/01/5c4852446f53b2.11606850.jpg ","title":"plans to serve dundee angus and perthshire pupils frozen school dinners instead of fresh meals","story":"Tayside schoolchildren could soon be eating frozen school dinners instead of fresh meals prepared in city schools.The council is proposing to change its school meal provision from cooking on site to cooking them at a central hub and distributing them to schools.Dundee, Angus and Perth and Kinross councils are considering the proposals, with the cuisine centre in Dundee set to undergo a multi-million-pound transformationplans are approved.Dundee City Council would contribute £, towards the refurbished centre, while Tayside Contracts would be approved to borrow up to £. million from the council’s prudential loans fund to fund the work.If agreed, the move would result in the loss of  posts across the city’s schools, although it is anticipated the centralised facility would create a total of  jobs.Tayside Contracts, which handles the distribution of school meals in the region, said it would not enforce compulsory redundancies.Stuart Fairweather of Unite the Union, which represents some affected workers, said: “There will be concern among staff that any redundancies relating to the changes are not voluntary.“More broadly there will be thoughts on the implications of the changes to the service.“We want well-supported staff with the resources to provide quality meals. Any staff with concerns should contact their trade union representatives.”A report by Dundee council officials said: “We plan to change and modernise the way primary schools, early learning and childcareand community meals are delivered across Tayside.“The proposal is to provide school and community meals through a Tayside Meal Centre.“This will signicantly improve the cost-effectiveness of the community meals service.”The report acknowledges there is a risk of “signicant reduction in school meal uptake” due to a “misperception” frozen food is inferior to fresh food.The report argues that nutritional quality and standards will be easier to maintain and calls the current method of meal preparation in schools “outdated”.Tayside Contracts currently provides about . million school meals to  primary schools throughout Tayside. The meals are made in  production kitchens and transported to  schools.Children and families committee convener Stewart Hunter said: “If it is delivered effectively then the evidence from other areas where this system is used is that just as many pupils and service users take the meals as before the change.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/01/DD4-postcode.jpg ","title":"scottish water issues advice discoloured water service restored dundee homes","story":"Scottish Water has issued advice on how to deal with #discoloured water# after service was restored to Dundee homes.Supplies were disrupted in the DD area this morning, leaving folk without water or suffering low pressure at the taps.Scottish Water probes loss of supply and #discoloured water# for Dundee residents\" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp scottish-water-probes-loss-of-supply-and-discoloured-water-for-dundee-residents embed # secretCvDSmNj\" data-secret\"CvDSmNj\" width\"\" \"\" title\"#Scottish Water probes loss of supply and #discoloured water# for Dundee residents# # Evening \" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"A Scottish Water statement said: #Following the work on our network, you may experience some discoloured water.#This discolouration is quite common after there has been some kind of a disruption to the water main in which this natural sediment lies in.#We appreciate that this doesn#t always look nice and can be concerning for customers.#We advise letting your cold water tap run at half pressure until your water runs clear again.#We apologise again for the inconvenience this has caused and thank you.#"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/01/5c46e69d052713.02246838.jpg ","title":"tom duthie time has come for dundee united to finally show their true title credentials","story":"From the low of a shock end-of-year defeat at Alloa leading to fears the goal for the rest of the regular season would be to secure a play-off spot, things are suddenly looking up for Dundee United.The arrival in person of new owner Mark Ogren came with a pledge to give manager Robbie Neilson the funds he needs to get promotion.And perhaps, just as importantly, the promise this is a long-term project andit doesn’t happen this term, money will be ploughed in to make sure it does next. It gave everyone with a liking for the Tangerines a lt.So, too, did a dramatic shrinking of the seven-point gap at the top of the Championship courtesy of Neilson’s team taking four points from consecutive home games, while top two Ross County and Ayr United each lost two in a row.That means, for a few hours at least, United can join leaders County on the -point markthey win the second tier’s game of the weekend at Ayr on Friday night.They would, of course, still trail the Staggies, who have a vastly superior goal dference, but just being up there would be another boost.A win would also cancel out the game in hand Ayr hold over United, though they too have a better goal dference. And whatever happens at Somerset Park, Ian McCall’s team will be above themthey beat Inverness next midweek.Perhaps, though, the biggest benefit to United this weekend can be the type of performance that, whatever the points, makes a statement that they’re the ones to beat. That, unfortunately, is something they’ve largely failed to do in three seasons down in the Championship.Past glories, some of them recent, mean United start every campaign as favourites for promotion.And any team walking into Tannadice on a Saturday sees a club geared for football in the Premiership.Too often, however, any edge that’s given United has disappeared because of performances.Even when they’ve lost, in the last two-and-a-half years sides have come out of games against them feeling reputation and expectation have not matched the sum of the parts of the team they’ve faced.Results like two defeats away to Dumbarton the season before last, a - loss at Falkirk last term and two five-goal home losses in this campaign, have led to opposition throughout the ision believing they always have a chance when facing United.In truth, even the draw with Partick Thistle this month and the win over Dunfermline that closed the gap at the top to those three points, were not as convincing as was expected.That’s repeatedly been the case during the two failed attempts to get up. In the big games, too often United have come up short.They did beat Hibs at Tannadice near the end of  but lost heavily to them soon after and quickly dropped off the pace at the top.Andthey won twice at Tannadice against last season’s table toppers St Mirren, the first time came before the Buddies were regarded as their main rivals and the second after Jack Ross’s team were out of sight at the top.This time round, the best so far came up in Dingwall in November when County were beaten -.Without taking anything away from that success, after Paul Watson’s early goal put them ahead, the three points were secured via a gritty rearguard action.Yes, it was the kind of performance that is needed at times in a successful league campaign.So, too, do emphatic victories that tell the rest of the league you are a team to be feared.

Invited to join Cameron up at the Cruachan dam for the second of his two recent programmes, I was delighted to tramp the mighty mountain with Scotland’s Number one authority on outdoor pursuits.As an author and broadcaster, Cameron always has an eye on a good story, and so as well as asking me about the lack of health and safety regulations at the time the hydro project was being built, he also wanted to knowthere really was a murder during the construction. There was, as I told him, a body – but the body wasn’t identied, no arrests were made, no court case took place.It would be a shamethat construction period went down in history as an invasion of , workmen – #Tunnel Tigers# as they were dubbed – into one of Argyll#s most beautul settings and a possible murder.My book was intended to give the story of the local people whose lives were punctuated by this ambitious construction project. Quite rightly, those Tunnel Tigers had been lauded in a number of publications. The work that was done hollowing out Argyll’s highest mountain to provide electricity for the nation was amazing.The plan for Cruachan – as for the other major hydro projects of the post World War II era – was conceived by Tom Johnston, to whom I dedicated my book. Johnston was a politician who remained true to his ideals of bringing rural Scotland into the modern world. There was no power in the Highlands, and without power there could be no industry and no prosperity. The engineering genius was Sir Edward MacColl, whose biographer Norrie Fraser called him #a maker of modern Scotland#.Cruachan was the first reversible pumped-storage system in the world. During its years of construction from  to , eminent international engineers visited the project to see how the water was pumped between two reservoirs through reversible turbine generators. At off-peak hours, the water was – is # pumped back up to the reservoir you see high up in the corrie above Loch Awe, held back by a dam that is now so much a part of our landscape. The loch itself is the lower reservoir.I had imagined that the scale of such a project – using Scotland’s top engineering companies who shipped in workers from other parts of the UK and Europe – would have been a cause for resentment and protest by local people.That, of course, failed to take account of the vision of the folk of Dalmally, Lochawe, and Taynuilt. Although it took men with engineering experience to blast the  miles of tunnels, hollow out the mountain itself, and construct the dam, there was also a need for a support army. There were clerks and porters, joiners and caterers, folk willing to let out a room, a caravan, a house, serve in a pub where just occasionally it was necessary to keep a baseball bat behind the bar to maintain bonhomie. The project kick started careers, fortunes and marriages, and gave the area good roads and a tourist industry.If you haven’t visited the hollow mountain or walked Cruachan’s slopes, make  the year you do.[In bold please] Cruachan: The Hollow Mountain is available from the Argyll Book Centre in Lochgilphead and all good book shops, along with Marian Pallister#s other books of local interest.PICS:The Pass of Brander before work started. no_aCruachanLe before the project # the Loch Awe Hotel with steamers. no_aCruachanThe Queen opening the project in October . no_aCruachanWorking on the  miles of tunnels. no_aCruachanWorking on the road to the dam, overlooking Loch Awe. no_aCruachan"},{"url":null,"title":"sports club lotteries 9","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowDrawn on Monday January , Kilmory Camanachd Club#s lottery numbers were ,  and .

It was written for Count Friedrich Wilhelm, supposedly simplied for amateurs to play. However, Jamal and Jâms being master musicians showed the power of this often disregarded piece, to be immense. One of the first works to make piano and cello equal musical partners, it is full of ingenious dialogue between the instruments. The structure is unusual, but with such expert performers it delighted the audience who were moved by every turn and twist of this deeply emotional work.Jâms, from North Wales, after remarking on the three ferry crossings required to get to Ardrishaig via Bute, introduced the next piece, Ernest Bloch’s work ‘From Jewish Le’. In a style close to Jamal’s heart and heritage, having been born in Baku Azerbaijan, its three elements, ‘Prayer’, ‘Supplication’ and ‘Jewish Song’, are full of the pathos and sorrow felt by the Jewish nation and also full of the signature augmented intervals and minor key tonality of much of middle eastern musics. How beautully these pieces demonstrated the lyrical qualities of the cello. Jamal’s bow searched for all possible nuances of tone and dynamic as his instrument sang from its lowest notes to a seductive soprano register.The concert continued after the interval with a second Beethoven work. The audience may have noticed a minor kerfuffle at the piano as many pages were rapidly turned before starting. Would it be the ‘Seven Variations’ for cello and piano or the ‘Twelve’, both based on themes from Mozart’s Magic Flute  The ‘Seven Variations’ won, being on the theme from the ‘Pamina’ and ‘Papageno’ duet entitled ‘In men, who know the feeling of love’. This work exhibits Beethoven’s practised ingenuity in the iation form and brought a lighter mood to the programme.Jâms Coleman introduced the final work, Frank Bridge’s Cello Sonata. He told of the four years of torment for the composer as he struggled to express his feelings about the First World War, finally finishing the composition in . The adagio in the piece caused the composer the most dficulty as he struggled with ambivalence about his own pacist views. Jâms and Jamal dealt with the challenges of this complex work which tracks huge changes in the world of music composition that were under way at that time. Again, the lyrical powers of the cello came to the fore as did the virtuosic requirements heaped on the pianist. Despite its undoubted innovations, this piece generously reaches out to its audience. Bridge uses the new musical freedoms only when justied, being happy toto more traditional tonal stability in the lyrical sections.Fulfilled, but not overburdened by the weightiness of the final piece, the audience applauded Jamal and Jâms back to the concert room to perform the ‘Swan’ from Saint-Saens ‘Carnival of the Animals’ as encore. This piece so beautully confirmed the excellence of Jamal’s playing and the superb quality of his quite special instrument.PIC:Jamal Aliyev and Jâms Coleman. no_aJamalandJam"},{"url":null,"title":"inveraray carpet bowling club festive pairs competition","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe Inveraray Carpet Bowling Club held its annual festive pairs competition.The first prize of turkeys was won by George Morrison and Alan Cameron.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as .

And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"caravan caught alight sparks major","story":"NewsCaravan which caught alight sparks major fire operationThe derelict property on Kilmarnock Road in Monkton went up in flames last Thursday night as the caravan attached to it caught fire.ShareByAbi Smillie:,  JAN NewsThe fire spread to the adjacent property \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA caravan which caught alight sparked a large scale fire operation as it set ablaze to a neighbouring house.

Georgies was the first confirmed case in the Borders.Lynsay said: \"The only way that you can be sure it is Alabama rot is to have a post mortem so Georgie was then taken to the Dick Vet in Edinburgh where it was confirmed that she had had Alabama rot. My other dog was tested for it but thankfully the results were clear.\"The Kennel Club is warning dog owners to be extra vigilant at this time of year as the peak season for the disease is between November and May.Caroline Kisko, Kennel Club Secretary said: ldquoAlthough the disease is very rare, affecting an extremely low percentage of dogs in the UK, the condition is very serious and potentially le-threatening. It is therefore vital that owners understand and recognise the warning signs, especially as time plays a signicant part in successfully treating the disease.ldquoWe are asking owners to look out for any signs of Alabama rot during the winter months and to remember to take action right away. Any dogs with unexplained or concerning skin lesions which typically look like sores, ulcers, or red, swollen, bruised areas, commonly with an infected appearance should be taken to their vet as soon as possible. These skin changes are usually found on their paws or lower legs, but may also appear on their head, face or lower body. Dogs who have contracted the disease may also become tired, disinterested in food, or present other signs of illness like vomiting or diarrhoea.ldquoAlthough these signs may not necessarily mean your dog has Alabama rot, acting quickly and speaking to a vet to determine what is wrong is the best course of action to protect your petrsquos health.While large amounts of research have been carried out over the last six years, the cause of the disease remains unknown. As yet, no evidence has been found to suggest that CRGV is caused by bacteria, viruses, fungi, toxins, or radiation. There is speculation that it is related to mud or water, due to the higher prevalence in winter and spring, and relatively low case numbers seen in the summer.Caroline continued: ldquoTo lower any risk of your dog contracting Alabama rot, itrsquos also advisable to keep your dog away from very muddy areas, wash wet or muddy dogs straight after a walk and regularly check your dogrsquos body for anything thatrsquos dferent.,params: .pushldquoWhile a distinct seasonal pattern is suggested, we must continue to research this deadly disease and ensure all dog owners are aware of the signs and symptoms so they are able to seek veterinary advice immediately.Despite what happened, Lynsay still s to walk Taffy along the river in Gattonside.

And so I think I shall.A story from your head is a term I use to describe a story either made up on the spot or a remembered story that was made up at an earlier time. So essentially itrsquos a story that isnrsquot written down anywhere or got from a book.Of course, reading to, and with, children is really important. But making stories together with a child is a really bonding experience and a fantastic way to encourage the child to explore and develop her or his creative imagination.This dadrsquos child is quite young but the process Irsquom about to describe can be used for any age group, and indeed yourself.Firstly, I want you to think of a mountain. You are standing at its base on one side and you want to get to the other side. In order to do so you will need to climb to the summit first. This mountain in your imagination is going to initially help you make a story, because itrsquos called a story mountain.So now you are standing at the base of the story mountain. You need a few things before you begin your journey to the summit, and the first thing is a character or characters.This is the first question to ask your child: who is in the story  Let them decide, and it can be anyone or anything: a dragon, a princess, a footballer, Spiderman, a Minion, a witch, a boy or girl, or even your child themselves.Next question is to find which place the story begins, that is what the setting is for the beginning of the tale. So you can ask where the character is.It can be an imaginary setting or a real one, perhaps even local, itrsquos up to the child for example, answers might include ldquothe dragon is hiding in a school or ldquothe princess lives in a cave.Once you have a character or characters and some kind of setting you have the beginning of the story. ldquoOnce upon a time, a dragon was hiding in a schoolhellip ldquoThere was once a princess who lived in a cavehellipYou can now help the child to add a few detailsyou wish by asking simple questions about the characters and or the settings. For example: ldquoWhy is the dragon hiding in the school  Or: ldquoWhat does the cave look like Questions like these can help direct the story towards what is going to happen, and that is the next part of your journey up the slope to the summit of your story mountain.So the child may say: ldquoThe dragon is hiding in the school because itrsquos scared of a bigger dragon. Or: ldquoThe cave is cold.Now we have the characters and setting, itrsquos time to make the climb to the summit of the story mountain. This climb represents the issue within the story: a problem, a task or quest, a desire or dream to be sought, a need for change or something to be found and so on. In other words, itrsquos the beginning of the adventure.Itrsquos at this point that beginning the process of visualisation is useful. Visualisation is a technique used by storytellers to help them remember a tale and tell it in their own words. It involves actually imagining yourself in the story, asyou are there.So before you set off on the story, imagine the dragon in the school, enter into the image in your head. Is it your old school, what does the dragon look like, where in the school is it hiding, what are its emotions Likewise with the princess, can you see her in the cave  Enter it in your imagination and look around. Is it large or small, cosy or scary  Where does she sleep and can you see the princess shivering in the cold  What is she feeling and thinking This is what story is all about, entering the world of imagination. Itrsquos not the words you need to remember but the images in your mind. Itrsquos like they become a memory which you can later describe.Your child will have his or her own visualisations, but you can help develop that by asking questions and allowing the child to describe what he or she sees.Painting vivid moving pictures in your mindrsquos eye is the key to not only remembering but developing the story.So now we may have a terried small dragon hiding in the dinner hall of your childrsquos school, and a shivering princess sitting by a small campfire in a huge cave, feeling hungry.The next step is to find out what is going to happen. This begins us on the journey to the summit of the story mountain. To give the child ownership of the story, ask him or her questions like: ldquoSo does the big dragon find the one hiding in the school  Or: ldquoWhat does the princess do to make the cave warmer and get something to eat Now we have the issue that takes us up the hill to the summit. The summit represents the transformative moment in the story, the thing or person or happening that alters the course of events. In any story, this is an important ingredient.So perhaps we will end up with: ldquoThe big dragon flies into the playground and all the children run. But the teacher comes out and is really strict and makes it go away so the children are safe, and so is the wee dragon. Or: ldquoThe princess goes fishing. And she sees a pirate ship while shersquos fishing and decides she wants to be a pirate instead.So the headteacher and the pirate ship are the transformative factors in these examples. They change the course of the story, and in doing so the journey back down the other side of the mountain can now take place, for this represents the conclusion or ending of the tale.Is it a happy, sad, funny ending  So questions like ldquowhat happens to the wee dragon  and ldquodoes the princess enjoy being a pirate and living on the pirate ship  may lead to answers that the wee dragon loves the school and becomes a part of the P class and learns to read, and that the princess becomes the pirate captain.So now the base of the other side of the mountain has been reached, with the storyrsquos ending. Now you can take away the structure of the mountain and lay down the bones of the story you have made along the journey.Here are the bones: wee dragon hides in a school from a bigger dragon, teacher chases bigger dragon away, wee dragon decides he likes the school and stays and joins P princess is in cave cold and hungry, she goes fishing by the sea and sees a pirate ship, she joins the pirate crew and becomes the captain.The visualisation technique can now be used to put flesh on the bones, giving it more detail. You can revisit the tale and develop it later, or leave it as it is.In telling the story, donrsquot think of words, think of the images created in your head, then the words will come naturally as you describe what you see.This way you will remember the story. You may tell it slightly dferently each time, but thatrsquos fine. Your child may remind you of how it was told before, as he or she will have their own visualisation of the tale.Or your child may ask you for a dferent story, in which case you are back at the base of another story mountain ready to climb it!Happy storytelling!"},{"url":null,"title":"plans-for-250-more-homes-in-dunbar-to-be-revealed","story":"Members of the public have the chance to view the

My own wish would be for MPs to seize the moment and vote to revoke Article  altogether. MPs have the power to stop the clock for good, thanks to the good works of legally-minded MPs like the SNPrsquos Joanna Cherry.Staying in the EU is the only sure way to stop the endless arguments about Canada plus, Norway plus, customs union, Irish backstop, regulatory alignment, maximum facilitation and all the rest of the gubbins thatrsquos been occupying our addled brains for the last two-and-a-half years. However, this isnrsquot going to happen.And Irsquod have to agree that it would be undemocratic for MPs to simply reverse the result of the  referendum by revoking A. It may be that Parliament has the power and the constitutional right to do so: referendums are only advisory. But it would leave so much unpleasantness that British politics would be soured for decades. There would have to be a referendum.This is where my unease turns to genuine anxiety. I have a horrible feeling that Labourrsquos Diane Abbott was right on Question Time this week when she said: ldquoBe careful what you wish for. She agrees with Nigel Farage that a repeat referendum is likely to endorse no-deal Brexit, perhaps by an even greater margin than in .Evenit left us with a mirror-image result, with say % Remain against % Leave, that would itself be a disaster because it would have no legitimacy. Yes, some opinion polls say Remain would win a comfortable majority, but they said that last time.The Brexiteers are already field-testing their slogans on social media. The frontrunner is ldquoTell Them Again, which may not be as resonant as ldquoTake Back Control but is still pretty hot. It surfs on the very widespread disgust and alienation that many ordinary people feel about the political elite. It appeals to democratic injustice: how dare the globalists ignore the result of , which David Cameron promised would be for keeps What would Remainrsquos slogan be  Itrsquos likely to be a repeat of the Project Fear line which failed dismally in . ldquoDonrsquot put your childrenrsquos prosperity at risk, perhaps, or ldquoThink Twice Think Jobs. But what many pro-Europeans fail to grasp ndash and this applied to the Unionists in the Scottish independence referendum ndash is that it ISNrsquoT the economy, stupid. Brexit voters donrsquot just make their decisions on the basis of economic rationality, as seen from the CBI and corporate Britain.People are always motivated more by emotion than numbers ndash on what they believe to be morally right. The sense that working-class people have lost control is a very potent mobiliser.As in war ndash and it is remarkable how much Brexit mythology harks back to World War Two ndash people are quite willing to sacrice some comfort for what they believe in.I may think they are mistaken. As with the people who supported Donald Trump because he promised to Make America Great Again, and bring back the jobs, I think Brexit voters have been sold a  prospectus by politicians who do not have the best interests of working people at their hearts.But that isnrsquot really the point. I can well understand the sense of injustice felt by people who have been left behind by global capitalism. They want to kick the system, and the referendum gave them a chance to do it. They need a very strong reason not to kick the metropolitans again. Only Labour can provide that reason, and Jeremy Corbyn has been singularly reluctant to do so.His refusal even to meet Theresa May was irresponsible in this climate. It may have allowed him to avoid coming off the fence, but it looked petty and weak. Corbyn should have gone in guns blazing, demanded that she drop the red lines, and then mobilised Labour for either rejoining the single market or for a referendum.Single market membership has always been the logic of Labourrsquos position, even though Corbyn usually refers to a ldquopermanent customs union. Only by joining the European Economic Area could Labour deliver friction-free trade, and protect environmental standards and workers rights. People say that Norway has blocked the UKrsquos entry to the European Economic Area, but this is not true. The Norwegian PM, Erna Solberg, has repeatedly made clear that Norway would have severe reservations ndashwho wouldnrsquot  ndash but would not block UK membership.This is because the EEA is essentially a Brussels creation. It was set up as a halfway house to membership of the EU back in  when a number of countries were uneasy about joining the political institutions of Europe. The EEA is just the European Single Market under another name.Brussels endorses British membership of the EEA, and this economic arrangement has a number of advantages over Mayrsquos deal. Therersquos no need for an Irish backstop no membership of the CAP and the Common Fisheries Policy no direct jurisdiction of the European Court and it costs less than EU membership. Of course, it does not bring the full benefits of EU membership. Britain would become a ldquorule taker on trade. But the EEA does not preclude future membership of the European Union. Norway, or any other member of the EEA, can opt for full membership at any time. And unlike the backstop, countries can leave the EEA after one year.Membership of the single market also means accepting freedom of movement, which is why it may well be rejected by Parliament. But it is the only option that has a snowballrsquos chance of getting a majority,Labour were to seriously support it. ldquoNorway plus, as itrsquos called, has more support than a repeat referendum. Fewer than  Labour MPs have called for a Peoples Vote, and only  Conservatives. The SNP has decided to throw its lot in with a repeat referendum, despite having argued convincingly for the single market for the last two years. But that isnrsquot enough.To repeat. Were it left to me, I would revoke Article  tomorrow. I just want this madness to stop. But given the metrics in Parliament, we have to look at the least worst options, as the Labour-supporting commentator Owen Jones put it last week. Mayrsquos deal is dead. MPs owe it to the country, and to themselves, to find some compromise that works. Perhaps that can only be achieved with a referendum. ButMPs fail this week, they risk destroying respect for parliamentary democracy, and opening the way for a more authoritarian form of political leadership."},{"url":null,"title":"herald-diary-laurel-and-hard-up","story":"GLASGOW audiences, continued.

But what of the right to change onersquos mind  Consider Theresa May herself. First, she supported Remain, but now doggedly supports Leave. Secondly, the law decreed a parliamentary election result was for five years, before people could change their minds. Mrs May, however, after two years, ignored that and called a snap election, hoping that voters would have changed their minds and give her a bigger majority. Now she insists that two years is far too soon to allow the electorate to change their minds. Perhaps goose and gander are relevant here.Anent ldquothe will of the people, a phrase that infuriates me every time I hear it, Irsquod like to ask ldquowhich people  Surely in a democracy, on a matter of such critical importance, ldquothe people are all adults who reside here, contribute to the economy by working, pay their taxes to fund services and will live with the result of the vote for the rest of their lives  That may be the normal electorate, but in the EU referendum several million EU spouses, family and long-term resident workers were deliberately removed from the eligible roll. A huge number have given years to this country, in some cases  to  years, and may live with the consequences of the vote for as long again. But they were not allowed to vote in the referendum, and now must register for permission to be second-class citizens.Furthermore, the Leave vote represented only . per cent of the electorate. The margin by which Leave won was very slightly less than that for devolution in , a margin which was considered too small to represent the will of the people.

Let us remember ldquono taxation without representation and kill these lies stone dead.L McGregor,Gartcows Road, Falkirk.THE catastrophic handling of Brexit highlights to what extent our political process is now mired in the mud.Theresa May has suffered no fewer than  Commons defeats,  of them in connection with Brexit. In no previous era of British politics could such a calamitous prime minister have survived such a weight of defeats, including the humiliating historic loss she recently suffered over the Withdrawal Agreement.In the past, losing a vote of confidence on a key piece of legislation was considered sufficient to stand down. For example, having split his party over the Corn Laws in , Sir Robert Peel resigned as prime minister after the defeat of his Irish Coercion Bill. Gladstone was also forced to resign in , again after a defeat on the Irish issue.In terms of the modern era, four prime ministers resigned and four stepped down on alleged grounds of ill-health. Indeed, two quit office even after winning key votes because their margins of victory made them seem moral defeats. Neville Chamberlain resigned in May , despite having won the ision on the disastrous Norway campaign, and Margaret Thatcher famously resigned despite her victory over Michael Heseltine in the first round of a Tory leadership contest.Realising the game was up, even David Cameron resigned after losing the Brexit referendum.It is a damning indictment of Mrs May and her party that she can even contemplate staying in office. The French philosopher and diplomat, Joseph de Maistre famously said: ldquoIn a democracy people get the leaders they deserve. I disagree, we deserve so much better than this humiliating shambles.Alex Orr,Flat ,  Marchmont Road, Edinburgh.THOUGH Northern Ireland Secretary, Karen Bradley, is adamant that there is no link between the recent unrest in Derry and the Brexit process, she is guilty of underplaying the threat this poses to the short and long term security of the country she represents at Westminster .Our current Brexit impasse continues to distress many iniduals and communities throughout the UK and nowhere more so than Northern Ireland. The uncertainty that permeates our economic and political system at present, allied to the fact that the people of Northern Ireland have been without a devolved assembly at Stormont for more than two years, provides an opportune climate that dissident factions, such as the New IRA, will exploit for their own ends.Transport and postal services have been suspended to some Republican areas of Derry as fears of terrorist violence and disruption continue to grow. Mark Hamilton, Assistant Chief Constable of the Police Service of Northern Ireland , views the current terrorist attacks as \"the most signicant in recent years\". Yet Ms Bradley would have us believe that the present political climate in the UK, with the possibility of a no- deal Brexit and therefore a hard border in Ireland, does not influence the recklessness of terrorists and their ability to drag Northern Ireland back to sectarian violence and chaos.A recent Amorach poll in the Irish republic found that  percent of people asked would fear ato violence in Ireland following Brexit. It is now more than  years since the Good Friday Agreement brought comparative stability to Northern Ireland, in which time there has been undoubted economic progress and changes in social,not political attitudes. The Troubles witnessed more than , deaths in Northern Ireland yet the passage of time seems to blind many politicians and parties of the appalling price in human lives that could be paidthere is no orderly and transparently clear plan for Britain exiting the EU.Neither the British nor the Irish Governments appear, even at this perilously late stage in proceedings, to possess a contingency plan in the event of a no-deal Brexit, a somewhat disconcerting,not downright alarming, state of affairs.I cannot help wondering how politicians and the press would view a similar situationtransplanted to the British mainland.Owen Kelly, Dunvegan Drive, Stirling.I ACKNOWLEDGE that passions run high over Brexit and that it is wise to have contingency plans in place, but are the dire predictions of widespread civil unrest and a breakdown of law and order in the event of a No-deal or a second referendum by senior politicians of dferent factions deliberately overstated and alarmist, and could they be counter-productive  R Russell Smith, Milton Road, Kilbirnie.Read more: Irish border backstop would constrain UK negotiating position"},{"url":null,"title":"television-shouldnt-take-cold-feet-when-it-comes-to-older-characters","story":"What  How can this be  More than one writer went on to suggest that its ftysomething characters no longer appeal because they are ageing, that viewers are tired of seeing them continue to face problems and puzzles that as thirtysomething were fun ndash but no longer.This suggests the lives of the -plus generation arenrsquot worthy of translation onto the screen.

One argument will be that her measure sets a dangerous precedent whereby Government is no longer in control of parliamentary business, which could hobble this administration and future ones.Mr Murrisonrsquos amendment to time-limit the Irish backstop is expected to be backed by the Government. If passed, it would enable the Prime Minister to go back to Brussels to demand changes as the only way of getting a deal through Parliament, thus avoiding a no-deal outcome.Of course, it is up to John Bercow, the Speaker, to decide which amendments he will allow to be debated and voted on.

This idea was championed by Gordon Brown, the former PM, last week.*Indicative votes.Tabled by Labourrsquos Hilary Benn, who chairs the Commons Brexit Committee, this would require a series of votes in Parliament on dferent options for Brexit to test support among MPs.*Article  extension.Backed by committee chairmen and women, including Mr Benn, Ms Cooper, Labourrsquos Rachel Reeves, and the Lib Demsrsquo Norman Lamb as well as senior backbenchers including Ed Miliband, the former Labour leader, and Sir Oliver Letwin, the former Tory Cabinet minister, this would require the Prime Minister to seek a delay to the planned Brexit date of March no deal has been approved by February .*Power to Parliament.Considered one of the proposals most likely to succeed, the plan tabled by Ms Cooper and former Conservative minister Nick Boles would force a vote on a bill giving Parliament control over the Brexit processthe PM fails to secure a deal by February . The bill would give MPs a vote on preventing a no-deal Brexit and extending Article .*Grieve amendment.Tabled by Dominic Grieve, the former Conservative Attorney General with cross-party backing from MPs, including former members of Mrs Mays Government Justine Greening, Phillip Lee and Sam Gyimah, this would set aside six days in the run-up to March  for debate of Brexit proposals put forward by MPs.*Free votes.This proposal from Labours Frank Field and Tory Ed Vaizey would require free votes on options, including the Irish backstop, a no-deal Brexit, Canadian and Norwegian models for relations with the EU, a customs union relationship and a second referendum to act as a \"guide\" for Government in future talks.*Stop no-deal.Drawn up by Midlands MPs Dame Caroline Spelman and Jack Dromey, with cross-party support from more than  MPs, this amendment rejects Brexit without a Withdrawal Agreement and Political Declaration on future UK EU relations.*Time-limited backstop.Tabled by Mr Murrison and thought to be viewed sympathetically by the Government, this would put a deadline of December   on the backstop arrangement required by the EU to avoid a hard border in Ireland. It is designed to give Mrs May additional negotiating clout by indicating to Brussels that this step might be enough to win parliamentary support for the Withdrawal Agreement reached last November.*No backstop.An amendment proposed by Conservative backbencher John Baron states that Parliament will not approve a Withdrawal Agreement which includes a backstop. Two further separate amendments tabled by the Basildon MP offer alternatives of a six-month time limit on the backstop or a requirement for the UK to have unilateral power to end it.*Business Committee.An amendment tabled by Mr Brake would establish a Business of the House Committee to govern the provision of parliamentary time for Brexit debates and legislation, including on a second referendum with Remain on the ballot paper. Mr Brake said the cross-party committee, with up to  members drawn from all parts of the UK, would put Parliament \"in the driving seat of the Brexit process\"."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/9037861.jpg?type=article-full","title":"nicola-sturgeon-says-scotland-should-be-given-control-over-immigration","story":"Speaking during First Ministers Questions, she said the UK Governments approach in handling the status of EU nationals during the Brexit process had stressed the need for changes to be made.On Monday, Prime Minister Theresa May scrapped a pound fee for EU citizens wanting to stay in the UK after Brexit on the same day as its registration policy was rolled out.Read more:Nicola Sturgeon faces questions over Queen Elizabeth University hospital infectionLast year, the Scottish Government pledged to pay the fee for EU citizens working in devolved public services.The First Minister said: \"Im pleased that the Prime Minister has belatedly seen sense and accepted our argument that the unfair settled status fee should be scrapped.\"Were very clear we want EU citizens to stay in Scotland.\"I dont think there should be a requirement for people who already have their home in Scotland to apply for the right to stay here, I think that is grotesque.\"But while there is that requirement, the Scottish Governments advice service, which will be delivered in partnership with Citizens Advice Scotland, will help ensure that EU citizens feel welcome, supported and valued.\"In addition to this, weve funded the EU Citizens Rights project to deliver outreach and awareness raising events with EU citizens across the country.\"Of course dropping the fee doesnt change the fact that the UK Government is making EU citizens apply to retain their current rights and I think the Prime Ministers approach to this and to migration more generally makes it all the more clear why its time for this Parliament to have powers over immigration.\"Ms Sturgeon said immigration policies being implemented at Westminster were not only morally wrong but \"practically damaging\" as well.She said: \"From the day after the Brexit referendum, I have been at pains to say to EU citizens that they are welcome here, this is their home and that we want them to stay.\"I regret deeply that people who have built their homes here, who consider this to be their home as much as I do or any of us in this Chamber do, are being made to apply for the right to stay here.Read more:Nicola Sturgeon gives public statement on Alex Salmond charges\"I think that is awful and I cant begin to imagine how that makes an EU national feel.\"In Scotland, we need people to want to come and live here and work here and study here.

The names of the companies involved have however, not been released.Minister for energy, connectivity and the islands, Paul Wheelhouse, said: “Issuing the Invitation to Tender marks the next stage of the process to award the new contract to operate the Northern Isles Ferry Services.“The contract will run for eight years, allowing us to build a strong working relationship with the successful bidder, and all the routes within the network are being tendered as a single bundle.“The Scottish Government remains fully committed to high quality ferry services to the Northern Isles. A key benefit of this new contract is the in-built flexibility, allowing the ferry services to be amended to reflect future changes in demand across the important sectors of the islands’ economies – tourism, fishing, food and drink, aquaculture and farming. Scottish Ministers will also retain control of all of important issues, such as fares and timetables, through the public service contract.“We are committed to a fair, open and transparent tender which aims to get the best possible deal for the communities that depend on these ferry services.”• Commenting on the issue, Northern Isles MSP’s Liam McArthur and Tavish Scott said: “The Scottish Government have finally issued the tender. The timescale is very tight indeed given the operator needs to be up and running the North Isles leline ferry services in  months’ time. It is essential that companies make constructive bids with improvements to the existing service. It must, in particular, recognise the growing freight volumes that are being exported south to the Scottish mainland.“So the tender bids must be properly assessed to ensure the service moves forward and not backwards.

OIC Leader James Stockan has notied Ministers that the council will hand over responsibility for running the service to Transport Scotland, unless sufficient funding is provided.A year ago, a similar level of support was secured, after a y campaign by OIC for fair funding. Of this, £. million was allocated to fully fund Orkney’s internal ferry service during the current financial year, with £ million awarded to Shetland Islands Council for its ferry operations.“But this time there is no specic amount allocated to Orkney or Shetland. The government recognises that it will cost £. million to operate our ageing fleet of ferries during - — and that is what we are asking the government to provide.”OIC is also looking to the government to fund the replacement of the current inter-island fleet. The council has been working with the government on this for a number of years and is currently developing a business case setting out the service levels local communities require, and the engineering options needed to achieve these.Councillor Stockan added: “We would object in the strongest possible termswe end up with a reduction in our ferries funding. This would place a wholly disproportionate and unfair burden on the smallest council in Scotland and would mean us having to make cuts to other vital services.“The ferries are a leline for remote and fragile communities across our islands. Orkney has the oldest fleet and the highest fares in the country — an inequality we cannot address without proper financial support from the Scottish Government.We are calling on the government to take an honourable approach to fulfilling the will of the Scottish Parliament that we should receive fair and equitable funding for our inter-island ferry service. The principle of transferring Orkney’s internal ferry service to the Scottish Government, at no net detriment to OIC, has already been approved by the council. That is a route we will have to take unless we are provided with the funds to run the service over the year ahead.”For the full story, pick up a copy of The Orcadian, this Thursday.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The most memorable film that I have worked on must be Swamp Tigers in the Bangladeshi Sundarbans.ldquoUsing a converted river ferry boat as a mobile base, a typical day would be, rising at four and travelling in the dark to a hide built on stilts embedded in a channel.ldquoI would stay there on my own usually for twelve hours and I did that for months.

People that are confident in their arguments don’t run away from the verdict of the people.”But Mrs May insisted it is the SNP that is “out of touch” with the people of Scotland, who she said do not want “another isive Scottish independence referendum”.The two leaders clashed at the same time as Ms Sturgeon faced growing calls within her own party to call for a fresh vote on Scotland’s future place within the UK.Former first minister Alex Salmond has argued that there is “not likely to be a better time to force the issue” following the PM’s Brexit deal defeat.Similarly, SNP Western Isles MP Angus MacNeil has argued that it is time for calls for a fresh independence vote “to come to fore”, urging Ms Sturgeon to prioritise this over demands for a second European referendum.However, SNP MEP Alyn Smith said supporters of holding another independence vote in the near future should “ca’canny” as uncertainty over what will happen with Brexit means practical questions over independence remain unanswered.Mr Russell told BBC Radio Scotland’s Good Morning Scotland programme that “everybody will have an opinion” about the timing of a possible second referendum.He added: “There are clearly many interests to be taken into account and I absolutely trust the First Minister’s judgment on these things.”Ms Sturgeon has already pledged to set out her views on this in a “matter of weeks”.But with the UK facing a Brexit “crisis” which he said was “getting considerably worse”, Mr Russell said Scots should “look to ourselves and our own future”.He stated: “It is absolutely the right moment to say that these are very, very serious concerns we are facing and the people of Scotland have the right to say ‘Do we have to go through this  It is something that we did not vote for’.“That is the truth at the heart of this. Scotland did not vote for Brexit, we’ve spent two-and-a-half years trying to negotiate the best possible outcome of this, compromising all the way, and we are incredibly within weeks of the supposed end date without anything firm in place.“Now the people of Scotland have the right to say ‘That is unacceptable, that is damaging and we must look to ourselves and our own future’.”Following Wednesday’s meeting between the First Minister and Mrs May, Downing Street revealed that both Ms Sturgeon and her Welsh counterpart, Carwyn Jones, had been invited to sit on a new Cabinet sub-committee which will “work on preparations for the UK’s exit from the EU, spanning both deal and no-deal outcomes”But Mr Russell said he had previously found promises of more involvement and consultation from the UK Government “to be hollow”.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4860727.1548235277!/image/image.jpg","title":"brexit how the british public can take control ian murray","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Labour can force a second referendum on Brexit and put control back in the hands of the British public, writes Ian Murray.There are just over  parliamentary sitting days left in the Commons before we are due to leave the EU.While Theresa May denies she is “running the clock down”, the reality tells a very dferent story.Nearly two years since Article  was triggered, what happens next remains unclear. What an extraordinary situation we find ourselves in as we hurtle towards the March  deadline.This week, the Prime Minister put forward her ‘plan B’ after her withdrawal deal was comprehensively rejected last week. You may have noticed that ‘plan B’ looked remarkably similar to ‘plan A’. In fact, it was nearly identical. The only dference was the letter describing it.If the Scottish independence referendum taught us anything, it’s that politicians who fail to produce genuine plan Bs are found out by the public – as Alex Salmond discovered when he failed to outline an alternative to using the British pound in .Theresa May is treating parliament and the public like fools. That’s why she is almost certain – once again – to lose the next vote on her withdrawal deal this coming Tuesday.It’s worth reminding ourselves why there is such opposition to Downing Street’s proposal.First of all, this isn’t even about our future relationship with the EU post-Brexit. This is merely the orce agreement – the terms in which we would leave the EU.It doesn’t cover what happens after we leave and that is why there is a ‘backstop’ to the issues with the border on the island of Ireland. That explains why Number Ten appeared to be floating the dangerous idea of reopening the Good Friday Agreement, before realising that was a complete non-starter. It is an international treaty underpinned by the United Nations and ratied by referenda in the north and south of Ireland.Nobody voted for a Brexit that would see Britain giving away control and leaving people poorer. It means paying a near £ billion orce bill but getting nothing in . It is the worst of all worlds, which is why it has united both Remainers and Leavers in Parliament.: First Minister warns Theresa May must drop hardline Brexit stanceThe Prime Minister has insisted she will continue making tweaks to win over MPs, but the EU has made it clear that the withdrawal agreement cannot be renegotiated. It is a legal text.That is not the EU being intransigent – the Prime Minister’s red lines make this the only option for the other  member states. To get any movement, she would have to loosen those red lines.Her red lines include leaving the customs union and the single market, ensuring that freedom of movement can end. That’s the freedom of movement which has allowed Brits to travel freely and live and work in European countries, and allowed the British economy to grow by addressing worker shortages in key industries.So we’re in an almighty mess. As things stand, the default scenario the country faces is a ‘no deal’ Brexit. I fear the full impact of this catastrophic option is still misunderstood.It means leaving the EU with no withdrawal agreement in place, falling back on World Trade Organizationtrade rules. That comes with tarfs on imports and quotas, for example cars would be taxed at  per cent every time they crossed the UK-EU border, and dairy products would be hit with a  per cent tarf – hence the stockpiling of key goods. As the EU confirmed only yesterday, it would also mean a hard border with Ireland.: Poll: Two-thirds of Scots believe Brexit makes independence more likelyA ‘no deal’ Brexit would wipe tens of billions of pounds off the UK economy, including around £bn in Scotland, according to the CBI. A hit of that magnitude would have a devastating impact on jobs and living standards, plunging public services into crisis. And who would be the worst affected  The poorest people in society. So that’s why those of us who care about our constituents talk about taking no-deal “off the table”. The fear is that the Prime Minister runs the clock down until March, and we automatically fall off that no-deal clf-edge because time has run out or she bribes MPs to back her botched plan.There are ways to prevent that happening, however.The Article  timetable can be altered – either extended with the agreement of the EU or unilaterally revoked. That has to happen now regardless of the way forward.If the Prime Minister allows us to leave the EU without a deal, her Government will be deliberately choosing to inflict untold damage on its people. That would be unforgiveable.Fortunately, while the Government flounders, many MPs are rising to the occasion. A series of amendments have been submitted, including a Labour frontbench amendment which legislates for the holding of a People’s Vote. Others seek to extend the Article  process.There is, of course, little point in extending Article  in an attempt to tweak the withdrawal agreement, because the negotiations are over.It should, however, be extended so that we can go back to the people of the United Kingdom and offer them a vote to decide our future.I am open-minded about what should appear on the ballot paper, but the most obvious solution is to give voters a choice between the clear measurable propositions of Theresa May’s Brexit deal – which would confirm that the people of the UK still want to leave the EU – and keeping the best deal we already have by remaining a member state of the EU.The Prime Minister claims that a People’s Vote would be damaging to democracy, yet it’s the devastation her deal will inflict on the country that will irreparably damage our democracy – and a ‘no deal’ more so.It’s time to let democracy flourish and put control back in the hands of the British people. Next Tuesday gives parliament an opportunity to do that andthe Labour Party supports a People’s Vote amendment and whips to support it, we can achieve this goal.When that time comes, I know I will put our national interest first and campaign tirelessly for the UK to remain in the EU.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4861273.1548262308!/image/image.jpg","title":"brexit sees scots tories mask slip over devolution joan mcalpine msp","story":"After Scottish Conservative MPs warn the UK Government not to give the Scottish Government a formal role in post-Brexit trade negotiations, SNP MSP Joan McAlpine says it shows they are putting #extreme unionist ideology# ahead of their constituents.The Scottish Tories were against the establishment of a Scottish Parliament in the first place.

They campaigned against self-government in the  referendum and were roundly defeated.

Yet the Scottish Tories believe decisions affecting our export business, and public services such as the NHS, are best left with this incompetent department.This confirms the Conservatives are as opposed to the notion of Scottish self-government as they ever were.It undermines attempts by Ruth Davidson and other Scottish Tories to detoxy their brand. : Theresa May says independence referendum the ‘last thing we want’Just look at Ms Davidson’s oscillating stance on Brexit.

A police investigation is taking place into the allegations made by two women and dating back to when he was first minister. But Mr Salmond won a legal challenge against the Scottish Government over its handling of the claims.The Scottish Government is carrying out a review of what happened and Ms Sturgeon has referred herself to independent advisers to consider whether she breached the ministerial code during meetings and phone calls with her predecessor. Mr Salmond said Ms Sturgeon’s focus should be on the drive to bring about independence. He said: “Nicola should be concentrating all her energies on the independence agenda where we will never have better circumstances. As far as I am concerned Westminster’s Brexit dficulty should be Scotland’s opportunity.” Ms Sturgeon is to give an update to the Scottish Parliament on her plans in the coming weeks. A formal request for a Section  order which would give Holyrood the authority to stage a referendum was rejected by the UK government last year, with Prime Minister Theresa may insisting “now is not the time” to revisit the Scottish constitutional issue amid the Brexit uncertainty. It is understood that a further request by the Scottish Government would also be rejected by Westminster.Writing in the Sunday National newspaper yesterday, Mr Salmond said: “One of our features in the national movement has been our inability to weigh the strengths and weaknesses of our political opponents. We have tended to concentrate on the shape we’re in.“However, right now the Westminster political establishment is at its weakest point in my letime while the national movement is in good heart. There is not likely to be a better time to force the issue.”However former SNP deputy leader Jim Sillars warned there is “no appetite” for a second independence referendum. He said: “There is no national Yes organisation in place – a prerequisite to success as many Yes activists and voters are not SNP.“No policy work has been done on the post-Brexit situation and thus we are not in a position to deploy then new policies in that post-Brexit new paradigm that will be needed to convince No voters to vote Yes next time.”Polls indicate there has been no rise in support for independence among Scots since the last vote in  and Perth and North Perthshire MP Pete Wishart said a vote should be held when it can be won.He said: “We are already making progress towards that with Brexit as the catalyst. But it will be dficult to secure the conditions to make a referendum happen before the next Holyrood election.”Alex Bell, a former SNP government adviser also called for a more considered approach.He said: “The SNP and Yes have to stop seeing independence as a sneaky prize to be won when everyone  is messing up and instead base their campaign on the reality of what Scotland can achieve through an honest understanding of the world.”Ms Sturgeon had pledged to hold a second referendum in the immediate aftermath of Brexit but “reset” her plans after the SNP suffered heavy losses in the  UK election.At First Minister’s Questions last week, she said: “Given the catastrophe that Scotland faces in our economy, our society, our living standards, the prospects for the next generation and our reputation in the world, it is essential that the option of independence is open to people in Scotland.“When people in Scotland have the ability to choose independence, I believe that the country will opt to be an independent one.”The Scottish Parliament has already voted in favour of a second referendum following the Brexit vote as the SNP combined with the pro-independence Greens.\u2028Scottish Secretary David Mundell has written to Mrs May to urge her to maintain her refusal to grant Holyrood powers for a second independence referendum.If the authority to hold a second referendum through a Section  is rejected, as expected, by the UK government, it has been suggested that the Scottish Government could make this the central issue of the next Holyrood election in , as it seeks to build the case for a independence in the years ahead.\u2028Tory constitution spokesman Adam Tomkins suggested Ms Sturgeon will seek a Section  order in the knowledge it will be rejected by in order to “stir up as much grievance and bad feeling as possible”.Scottish Liberal Democrat Leader Willie Rennie urged the SNP to abandon plans for another referendum. A Scottish Labour source added: “The last thing Scotland needs is more instability and chaos of yet another independence referendum, what our communities need are Labour governments here and in Westminster to end austerity.”An SNP spokesman said: “With the clock ticking down to Brexit date - and with the Tory government incapable of governing and Labour incapable of effectively opposing - the SNP will continue to focus on standing up for Scotland’s interests in the face of a disastrous Tory-driven Brexit and further austerity.”©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4848739.1547813565!/image/image.jpg","title":"these are the 6 most wanted people in scotland in 2019","story":"Can you help police track down these  men on their most wanted list Police Scotland would like to speak to the people below and are asking anyone with information to call .©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"vaarie ","story":"Offers over £,Detached four bedroom house, built in , with large garage and spacious garden, in excellent condition in quiet location  minutes from Lerwick."},{"url":null,"title":"jobs template week 3 ","story":"We are initially inviting Notes of Interest from inidals who would be interested in joining our small dedicated team.Positions available are:Permanent and seasonal opportunities are available, ious hours will be considered.Wage is dependent upon age and experience.

We have been getting passage plans and times and we have been disseminating that information out to the local fishermen. I believe much of the Inner Sound gear has been cleared from the anticipated path of the rig.“I spent a whole day moving my own gear. We can only hope that the rig sticks to the route given. It#s been quite a lot of disruption to many of the fishermen andthe rig deviates even a hundred or so metres there is still plenty of opportunity to foul the moved. and now more-densely packed fishing gear but at least in the area where I am working there has been a -plus metre corridor cleared where the advertised track says the rig will be.“No doubt there are some fishermen who are on holiday or who for whatever reason have not had the opportunity to clear all their gear. However, so long as the OGW sticks to its route damage should be minimised.”Despite the optimism, Mr Philp said he wasn’t sure what “process or policy is in place” in the event of damaged or destroyed gear.He added: “I would suggest that, considering this the first time this has happened in over  years, we assess the outcome from the passage of the rig and then cross that bridge when we come to it. So far, the fishermen and KPL are working together to minimise disruption. Hopefully,there are any issues, they can be resolved in good faith afterwards.“Considering this may become a regular occurrence and some fishermen are dedicating considerable time to moving gear clear and then once the rig is in Kishorn will have to dedicate considerable time to reinstating their gear, it would only seem reasonable in future to consider our options for some sort of compensation for the disruption.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/web-subs-3.jpg","title":"closure of tarbert ferry service to vehicles unavoidable say","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineCalMac’s director of service has  described a planned temporary closure of the linkspan at Tarbert ferry terminal as “unavoidable disruption”.The operator has announced the vehicle service will be out of action for five days across February and March.

If anything, it should be amplied.It turned into a trilogy. There was a Great Book of Skye Two in , and now we have the #Great Book of Skye Three#.That was perhaps predictable. In the first volume, Cailean Maclean commented that he had two problems in persuading Norman Macdonald to prepare the book. The first problem was to get him to start the second was to get him to stop.Three books and , pages later, the prof has stopped — or so he says.The three volumes comprise a Dictionary of Skye Biography. The lives of almost , people are profiled and illustrated inside their pages. They have all #been Skye born or bred or are people who have had an intimate connection with the island. They have all been noteworthy in one way or another… #There has never been more than , people living in Skye at any one time, and for much of history — particularly recent, recorded history — its population has been much smaller than that.Nobody, however, will be too surprised that Norman and Cailean uncovered and portrayed over a thousand eminent Sgiathanaich. Without wishing to kickstart Norman once again, the miracle is that they enumerated so few. The island, like almost all Hebridean islands, has been a breeding ground of talent and character.The only other qualication for entry in the Great Books of Skye is that you must be dead. You, dear reader, however, accomplished you might be, will not be able to read your entry unless metaphysics permits you access from your celestial cloud. These are obituaries, not panegyrics.That lends a sombre tone to certain pages of the Great Book of Skye Three. There are people featured here who, we are sharply reminded, were alive when volume one was in preparation.Here, for instance, is the smiling face of Dr Vicky Ann Galbraith, who was born in Portree in  and who died at home in Aird Bernisdale of brain cancer in .Vicky Ann was achievement personied. A leading scientist for Roche Pharmaceuticals, she also played for Scotland#s national women#s rugby union team on  occasions. Following her fatal diagnosis, she raised thousands of pounds for cancer research by leading sponsored walks from Portree to Glasgow, up the West Highland Way and where.Here is Thomas William Mackenzie. You may have known him as Tommy. He was born in  and he died last March. He was, in the GBS abbreviated subheading, a #printmaker, etcher and gallery owner, Chieftain of Skye Highland Games, boat race devotee, tug-of-war revivalist, shinty enthusiast, and half-marathon runner.#That just about covers it, as a dictionary of biography is forbidden to indulge itself and cannot add that for very many people, Tommy Mackenzie was the face and personality of modern Portree.These volumes, these hefty Great Books of Skye, are a leisurely parade along Wentworth Street and then out to the peninsulas, pausing to wave at or pass the time of day with Victorian land reformers, clan chiefs, bards, teachers, surgeons, fishermen, and climbers. It#s a verbal Skye equivalent of the cover of #Sergeant Pepper#s Lonely Hearts Club Band#.Sir Harold Boulton was not a Sgiathanach. He came from Hertfordshire and was educated at Harrow and Oxford.In  he married into the Highland quality via a Dingwall military family. Boulton already had an interest in Gaelic song and music.He enters the Great Book of Skye because, in the late th century, Boulton seems to have heard a Gaelic rowing song and put his own, English, words to the tune.Those lyrics and that tune have become internationally known as #The Skye Boat Song#. Norman Macdonald digresses wonderfully on Boulton#s creation of a supposed Jacobite anthem.We are still left with the dilemma of the bonnie boat#s journey. The original Gaelic version may have celebrated a voyage from Torrin to Loch Coruisk. For most of the th century, it was assumed to refer to Charles Edward Stuart#s post-Culloden flight by sea from the mainland to Skye.As Charles never made such a journey directly by sea, pedants have more recently suggested that Boulton must have been referring to the Pretender#s actual sea voyage It really, really, does not matter. We are in the realms of mythology. Charles may as well have been sailing from Papua New Guinea. Harold Boulton invented the whole damn thing — the misty isle#s most famous song is a Victorian concoction — and in recognition of that, he deserves his entry in the Great Book of Skye Three.And finally, here we are back in Portree. William Cowie was born in Kiltarlity in  and became an agricultural advisor in Skye in the s. The brother of a professional footballer, Cowie devoted himself to shinty and became one of the greatest players of his era.Fittingly, he married in  a grand-daughter of the captain of the Skye shinty team which had won the inaugural MacTavish Cup in .William and Margaret Cowie had two sons, Ross and William. He died too young, at the age of  years, while playing badminton in Portree Drill Hall.William Cowie would, therefore, have been shy of his th birthday had he led his natural course to June  and a day in Fort William which would have caused him, more even than the rest of Skye, unimaginable pride.It is tempting to say of all three Great Books of Skye that they are for dipping in and out rather than reading as a single narrative. The trouble with that suggestion is that once you#ve dipped in, it is very hard to dip out again.As a trilogy, they are a phenomenal publishing achievement. They should take their place, alongside the inevitable Tommy Mackenzie print, in every home in Skye."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Campbell-Stewart-MacLennan-Co.jpg","title":"skye schools indoor shinty competition all the action in","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineYoung shinty players from throughout Skye gathered to take part in two indoor tournaments for primary school teams last weekend.Portree High’s Fingal Centre hosted competitions for P-P and for P-and-under teams.On a fast and furious day of excellent shinty action teams from Bun-sgoil Ghàidhlig Phort Rìgh won both competitions.Broadford were runners up in the P- competition, with North West taking second spot in the P-under tournament following an epic final."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.ballymenatimes.com/webimage/1.8768911.1547477230!/image/image.jpg","title":"antrim emergency department under extreme pressure","story":"The Northern Health and Social Care Trust has issued advice to residents as  people continue to wait for beds at Antrim Area Hospital.

For many years, you ask the question why.You also wonder,only they had engaged with someone, and that person had been able to offer some glimmer of hope, which resulted in them not pursuing their course of action. “There have been a number of suicides in our town recently and since the Samaritans are a wonderful organisation, who offer a tremendous telephone helpline service, we thought that it would be worthwhile to try and raise some funds, for this great charity.”The Samaritans’s vision is that fewer people die by suicide. They believe that it is time to look beyond the statistics and into the real lives of these people, so that they and others, can find ways, to reduce any unnecessary deaths. The Samaritans know that when people are in crisis, talking can help that person.Beverley added: “ the money raised at this event, can fund just one phone call to the Samaritans and the Samaritan at the other end of the line is able to provide some hope and results in one person not proceeding with their plan to take their own le,then this event will have been very worthwhile. “I would appeal to anyone who is facing dficulties, no matter what they are, to call the Samaritans on  . The Samaritans volunteers provide a listening ear,  days per year and you can call them any hour of the day, or night,”If you are able to help out in any small way, by baking a few scones tray bakes or by just coming along to have a cuppa and a scone and to give a donation, the organisers will certainly appreciate your kindness.Vintage car show celebrates th birthdayIN PICTURES: Dromore High opens its doors to prospective pupils Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\""},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_auto,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8779110.1548153767!/image/image.jpg","title":"education  ","story":"Students from local schools were thanked by Action MS recently for their fundriaising efforts over the last year.

P children from Seymour Hill met with Mrs Jess before her birthday and found out more about her le, before sharing the story with the rest of the school.School Principal Mr Stephen Nimmons explained: “During World War Two Mrs Jess worked at a hem stitching factory near Dromore, where she worked on the machines and made fancy patterns around pillow cases and table cloths. “Every day she would have to cycle four miles to work and in the evenings four miles back home – rain, hail or snow. When the war was at its height, the factory started making unorms for the soldiers. From her house in Kinallen, she could see the lights of Belfast light up the sky when the German bombers came.“Just after the war, in , Mrs Jess married and went on to have three daughters. She has been a widow for  years and now has three children, six grandchildren and six great grandchildren. “Mrs Jess came to live in Seymour Hill on February ,  when there were no schools, shops nor churches built on the estate at the time. Seymour Hill Primary School was built by September  when the first pupils started the school. “She started working in the school when it opened in  and she worked in the school for over  years until her retirement. She worked as a cleaner for most of those years, as well as being a lunchtime supervisor and for a short time, she was also the school caretaker.“The children, staff and PTA of Seymour Hill PS wish to thank Mrs Jess for taking time to talk with them and visit the school on such a special occasion.”IN PICTURES: Banbridge and Dromore students honoured at Action MS Awards Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\""},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8771401.1547635371!/image/image.jpg","title":"vintage car show celebrates 25th birthday","story":"The annual Vintage, Classic and Sports Car Show will turn  when it opens at the Slieve Donard Hotel at the end of this month from January  - .

We regard this as the most important constitutional gathering in a generation,” he said.The conference comes as uncertainty continues to remain over the issue of the Irish border backstop along with the need to ensure EU rights are protected after Brexit.Last November one thousand prominent nationalistsportspeople, artists, actors and leading business heads put their signatories to an open letter to Taoiseach Leo Varadkar outlining their concerns.

But, after representations from his solicitor, it was agreed that the fine would be waived when it was learned that no tax book had been available for the vehicle.He was held for an hour and a half in Dunmurry and was released when a relative arrived and paid the fine.The RUC men – one of whom was in plain clothes – had arrived in the area in a red Vauxhall car without markings.One Twinbrook resident said later: “So much for the RUC’s concern about the peace talks. They wouldn’t have done that sort of thing before the ceasefire.”Order is expected soon for new IRA ceasefireA NEW ceasefire order is expected to be issued to all IRA units within the next  hours. But a formal announcement by the Republican Army Council is not expected until early next week.The decision to order a ceasefire came after a second round of talks between senior Stormont and republican officials at a secret venue about five miles from Belfast on Wednesday night.In a statement issued late on Wednesday Britain’s supremo here, Merlyn Rees, said: “I am sure that the people of Northern Ireland would wish to see effective arrangements made to ensure that the ceasefire did not break down. I attach very great importance to this, and practical arrangements would be necessary.”Republican leaders are now believed to regard this as a sufficient gesture to allow them to order another ceasefire.But it is believed that they will want meaningful talks on a number of issues shortly after their ceasefire is publicly announced. Another reason why a new ceasefire is possible has been the low profile approach adopted by the British Army since the shock announcement last week that the truce was off.A key factor in the decision to call off the Christmas ceasefire was the behaviour of British units in Belfast and several rural areas where they stepped up their activity to take advantage of the ceasefire.British leaders in London are known to have been surprised at the IRA decision and there has been speculation that advice from their military leaders – who had claimed that the IRA ceasefire was certain to continue because the IRA was beaten – is now being ignored by Westminster leaders.British Premier Wilson is said to have been furious that the much-vaunted military intelligence network in Ireland was totally unaware that the ceasefire was in danger.And parallels are being drawn between the military intelligence blunder of last week and similar blunders before Internment Day and Operation Motorman – when politicians were advised that both moves would “help solve the Irish question”. IN a front page article in the Sunday World this week reporter John Keane disclosed that the , political prisoners in the Long Kesh internment camp are being held in huts which would be regarded by the EEC farming officials as unsuitable for pighouses.AdvertisementsHUNTING LODGEScotch from £.Vodka from £.Gin from £.Double litre Italian wine £.Full range of winesCans Skol p  doz Packs Lager pBrandy from £.Hennessy Brandy at £.Plus an extensive range of LiquersLámh Dearg GAC Social Club Behind Watters old pub at the top of Hannahstown Hill.A great night of singing and dancing on Sunday.ROMANOSSaturday  January - – From the top of the charts KENNYSaturday  February GLITTER BAND."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"fly me to the moon hilarity and reality in equal measure","story":"THE opening night of Marie Jones’ dark comedy Fly Me To The Moon at the Grand Opera House was one full of raucous laughter. The Belfast playwright’s scripts have a reputation for their intense humour, but at the heart of this play are the stark realities of working class le, isolation, and the emotional labour of mothers. The story gives the audience a veritable look into the lives of two overworked and underpaid care workers, Francesand Loretta , who look after the housebound -year-old Davy Magee, whose sole joys in le are horse betting, reading the Daily Mirror, and the music of Frank Sinatra.What turns out to be a catastrophic Monday for the pair begins with a small personal disaster for Loretta her son has forgotten his PE gear – she has to double back home and is late for work. In her absence, Francis has already helped Davy to the bathroom. Loretta arrives at Davy’s bungalow and chats to her friend about their respective family lives – Frances lambasts the education system for failing her entrepreneurial son, who has recently found success selling knock-off DVDs, while Loretta worries about her out-of-work husband and their inability to pay for their daughter’s school trip to Alton Towers. All the while Davy hasn’t emerged from the bathroom.When their charge fails to respond to repeated knocks at the door, Francis and Loretta panic, fearing the worst. As it turns out Davy has, in fact, died. Hilarity ensues as the women come to grips with his death and are presented with a further dilemma whatthey waited a few hours before reporting his demise, allowing them to withdraw his pension from the ATM and collect his winnings from the bookies  It would surely solve their money woes.Fearing the consequences of their petty crime, Frances and Loretta scheme up more and more elaborate ways to cover their tracks. Whatthey were caught  Whatthey were blamed for his death – could they be “up there with Myra Hindley and Fred West ”Theatrical comedy often treads a fine line between being side-splittingly funny and desperately exaggerated, but Fly Me To The Moon undoubtedly falls into the former camp. Despite the unfolding madness and slapstick antics, Tumelty and McGibbon manage to retain a level of realism in their fantastic performances. These two absurd characters could easily be ordinary Belfast women.Jones has written and directed a truly magnicent piece of comedy in Fly Me To The Moon but, crucially, the humour is punctuated, at critical moments, by important social commentary. Like many pensioners, the lonely Mr Magee, whose phonebook only contains the number of his bookie, lived a le in isolation – “a le of misery” as Frances says. The protagonists struggle with the daily problems of impoverished Belfast mothers, their crimes paling in comparison to the grand-scale corruption of politicians and bankers often mentioned in pages of their charge’s Daily Mirror. Loretta’s admission that her husband “even seemed smaller” since losing his job almost presented itself as a moment of comedy on the night, drawing a few solitary laughs before its signicance sank in. The preceding paragraph should leave readers in no doubt as to the hilarity of this play – there wasn’t a person at the Grand Opera House whose cheeks weren’t sore by the end.However, audiences will also go home, having had some laughs, with something more to ponder."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Screen-Shot-2019-01-24-at-16.25.07.png","title":"womens place in national debate","story":"LAST year was a year to remember for women’s rights. ‘Me Too’ was a phrase heard around the globe as artists in many spheres made sexual harassment, abuse and discrimination visible. It was a lesson that went way beyond the arts.The referendum on the th Amendment to the Irish constitution made the experience of women visible in multiple ways. It was not merely about the personal heartbreak of inidual women, it was also about systemic oppression of Irish women and children, and reached into the earth of Tuam, County Galway, where babies’ bodies had been buried in an unconsecrated septic tank by nuns and priests.It was the year that celebrated  years of some women’s franchise and paid homage to suffragettes and the first woman MP, Constance Markievitz.With the election of Clare Bailey as leader of the Green Party we now have women leaders of four of the six mainparties. In many ways it all seemed seminal. That women’s agendas could no longer be ignored. However, we are all too aware of its limitations too. The words ‘The North is Next’ regarding access to full choices in pregnancy clearly require the addition of ‘at some point’.Women’s participation in politics, while improving, remains poor. In the forthcoming council election watch how many women are standing in winnable seats and watch which parties do what. A fair enough group photo of gender balance announcing candidates is often at quite a distance from the elected officials’ photograph afterwards.Just as in , contemporary strides on women’s rights need to be carefully looked after in the years to come. While Cumann na mBan and feminism were integral to the operation of the First Dáil and the appropriation of public le during the Tan War, what we witnessed afterwards was an assault on women’s rights, from the constitution to the maternity ward afterwards. In the north the oppression of women went hand in glove with the oppression of the nationalist population in the right wing statelet.Right now, there is a conversation happening about what a new Ireland might look like. The conversation focuses on constitutional rights, economic interests and demographics. Campaigns feed into it with social and cultural rights featuring intermittently.What we have failed to do is insert the vibrant and rich debate last year on women’s rights into this national debate in the meaningful way. For instance, women who cannot be equal participants in our society because their citizenship and culture are denied to them are doubly oppressed as women are unequal participants in so many avenues of le.Just as in - when Irish suffragettes gave expression to their fight for self-determination being linked to their country’s fight for self-determination, we need to seek out space and language for a modern Irish women’s vision. Indeed, in those years Irish suffragettes’ colours were not purple white and green – they were orange, white and green. It was a bold statement of intent: that women would not be written out of the Proclamation or a new Ireland.That new Ireland was never realised with the imposition of partition. Specic attention must now be paid to women’s participation, needs and aspirations as we build our new vision for a transformed Ireland."},{"url":null,"title":"nodeal brexit could cost northern ireland 5bn a year","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

He accused the CBI of ignoring \"the centrality\" of the British market to Northern Irelands economy.

both the United Kingdom and Ireland would have responsibilities to honour the Good Friday Agreement and the peace process,\" he said.\"So I think wed end up in a situation whereby the EU and Ireland and the UK would have to come together and in order to honour our commitment to the people of Ireland that there would be no hard border, we would have to agree on full alignment on customs and

the North Belfast MP said.\"In any case, the Taoiseach’s comments about the Belfast Agreement actually ride a coach and horses through that Agreement. \"Mr Varadkar is evidently and understandably

It also facilitates the ongoing immigration co-operation arrangements that are already in place.The proposals also aim to ensure there is protection in place for consumers who have already bought financial service products before the date of Brexit.On energy, the Bill will allow for the continued operation of the all-island single electricity market in the context of a no-deal Brexit, pending longer term provisions in this area.A Government spokesman said ministers will work closely with opposition parties to ensure necessary legislation is passed through the Oireachtas before the UK leaves the EU at the end of March.This would mean that at committee stage, the proposed legislation could be debated on the floor of the House instead of at committees to help speed up the process of the legislation becoming enacted."},{"url":null,"title":"remains of woman discovered on co donegal beach","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

But it is not an automatic approach.“Particularly at times when there are big changes, you have to have some constants and for a central bank there are two constants: have a financial system that s, which we would havethat were to happen, and keep your focus on your democratically given mandate, which is to achieve the inflation target.”Inflation last month fell to .%, within touching distance of the Bank’s % target.Mr Carney also said that British businesses cannot completely prepare for a no-deal Brexit due to a lack of infrastructure at UK ports.“There are a series of logistical issues that need to be solved, and it’s quite transparent that in many cases they’re not.“So, port infrastructure is not there, border infrastructure is not there to the extent that it would need to be from jumping from an absolutely seamless trading environment to one with frictions that aren’t just tarfs, but are rules of origin of products, safety standards and other inspections that would need to be done.“There is a limited amount businesses can do to preparethere are going to be substantial delays on the logistical side”.He used the example of logistics and supply issues that could arise for UK carmakers from a no-deal Brexit.“If you are a car plant that relies on  -wheelers [trucks] coming through Dover a day, and they have to show up within minutes of each other in order to meet the just-in time-requirements of the plant, you can’t stack things up all over Wales in order to ensure that you can continue to run it for months.

We need to grow our working age population.“So as well as what the UK Government is doing being wrong in principle, it’s practically damaging for Scotland and that’s why the sooner we get these matters into our own hands and are able to take decisions here in Scotland, rather than have them taken in Westminster, the better for all of us”.Labour MSP Pauline McNeill said: “The approach of the UK Government to European citizens, who’ve made their home in Scotland and the UK, is a slap in the face to their commitment to the United Kingdom, many of who have lived here longer in Scotland than in their country of birth.“What the UK Government don’t seem to recognise is the rejection that those EU citizens feel.”"},{"url":null,"title":"possibility of a second brexit referendum has somewhat increased says blair","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

I would definitely describe that as sub-optimal.“When is the Government going to make its own announcement that under no circumstances it will allow the UK to leave without a deal so we can stop this slow and damaging haemorrhage ”Brexit Minister Chris Heaton-Harris replied: “It does beg the reply that why on earth is he not then backing the deal that delivers the certainty all of those businesses he named have asked for “I think he needs to look at the deal once again, to deliver the certainty that businesses across the UK require.”The developments came amid growing support in Labour ranks for a parliamentary bid by former minister Yvette Cooper to extend Article , which would keep the UK in the EU longer, unless a deal is reached by the end of February.Leading Brexiteers have attacked such initiatives, saying they would take control of events from the Government.In another sign of opposition to the Prime Minister’s stance,  ministers, including Cabinet members, have been meeting to discuss preventing a no-deal Brexit, according to the Daily .I think it would be betterit was a binary choiceSir Keir Starmer on a possible new Brexit referendumFacebookTwitterOne member of the ministerial group dubbed it the “hair-shirt club”, the newspaper reported.Unions have been warning of the impact on jobs of a no-deal Brexit and have been pressing for assurances about employment rights after the UK leaves the EU.Some have also argued in favour of a second referendum.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Nigel Farage On the issue of a new national poll on EU withdrawal, shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer said any referendum should have just two options.He told ITV’s Peston: “I think there should definitely be Remain.“And there should be a genuine Leave option.“I think it would be betterit was a binary choice.”Former Ukip leader Nigel Farage insisted Mrs May’s withdrawal plans should be opposed, eventhat risked a new referendum.He told ITV’s Peston: “Personally, my view at the moment is better to vote down this dreadful deal and take the risk of a second referendum.”Ms Cooper’s Article  bid, which has cross-party backing including from Conservative Nick Boles, is one of a number of amendments that could be voted on next Tuesdayselected by Commons Speaker John Bercow."},{"url":null,"title":"social media users are recounting their hilarious mistakes made on autopilot","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The move set up a high-stakes standoff with President Nicolas Maduro, who is increasingly seen as a dictator both at home and abroad.Instead of backing down, Mr Guaido stunned Venezuelans on Wednesday by declaring himself interim president before cheering supporters in Venezuela’s capital Caracas, buoyed by massive anti-government protests. \" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Juan Guaido declares himself interim president in Caracas And support from US President Donald Trump, Canada and numerous Latin American countries, along with the Organisation of American States, immediately rolled in.But even as he was symbolically sworn in, he foretold of dangers, telling supporters: “We know that this will have consequences.” Moments later, he slipped away to an unknown location amid speculation he would soon be arrested.Last week, Venezuela’s feared SEBIN intelligence police pulled Mr Guaido from his vehicle as he headed to a town hall meeting and briefly detained him. And the rival constitutional assembly controlled by Mr Maduro’s allies threatened Mr Guaido and others with an investigation for treason.Key to Mr Guaido’s rise to prominence has been timing – and behind-the-scenes backing.As Venezuela’s economic crisis deepens, with masses fleeing the country to escape runaway inflation on pace to surpass  million per cent, many are desperate for a new leader to rescue the once-wealthy oil nation. Into that void stepped Mr Guaido.An industrial engineer who cut his political teeth in a student protest movement a decade ago, he was elected to the National Assembly in , and in its first session this year was named its leader.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Anti-government protesters show a sign that reads in Spanish ‘Guaido President of Venezuela’ At the time, Mr Maduro made light of his newcomer status, feigning confusion over whether his name was Guaido or Guaire, a notoriously polluted river that runs through Caracas.But following Wednesday’s presidential self-declaration, and a US-led chorus of Western hemisphere nations backing his challenge, Mr Maduro responded with fury, swtly cutting off diplomatic relations with the United States and giving American diplomats  hours to leave the country.The architect of Mr Guaido’s meteoric rise is Leopoldo Lopez, Venezuela’s most popular opposition leader, who is muzzled under house arrest and considered by government opponents to be a political prisoner.At a time when many had written off the National Assembly, which was stripped of its last bit of power after the government set up the rival constitutional assembly in , Mr Lopez manoeuvred behind the scenes for his Popular Will party to assume the presidency of the gutted legislature.He then tapped Mr Guaido, serving his first full term as a lawmaker, who rose to the helm of their party in Venezuela after eight more senior politicians sitting on Popular Will’s national board were exiled since .Mr Guaido has been a loyal acolyte of Mr Lopez for years, standing beside him at a  news conference when the activist announced a strategy of anti-Maduro unrest. What was called The Exit bitterly ided the opposition because it came less than a year into Mr Maduro’s presidency, when support for his rule was still strong.The two talk half a dozen times each day, and not a single speech or move is not co-ordinated with Mr Lopez first, said one ally.Critics say Mr Guaido lacks a political vision, pointing to his rambling debut speech as the legislature’s president, which was full of rhetorical barbs aimed at the “usurper” Mr Maduro but short on specics on how to get out of the malaise.Still, others see his youth and relative inexperience as breathing le into the beaten-down opposition, making Mr Maduro’s frequent diatribes that it is dominated by elitist relics from Venezuela’s pre-revolutionary past harder to stick.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Anti-government protesters hold their hands up during the symbolic swearing-in of Juan Guaido Mr Guaido told the Associated Press in a recent interview he does not fear running into the same fate as his political allies. He pointed to scars on his neck caused by rubber bullets fired during  street demonstrations against Mr Maduro.“I still have projectiles lodged here,” he said.Mr Guaido has endured hardships for much of his le. At the age of , shortly after Mr Maduro’s mentor, the late Hugo Chavez, assumed the presidency and ushered in a socialist overhaul, Mr Guaido and his family survived a torrential mudslide that killed thousands and left many more homeless in the port city of La Guaira, a short distance from Caracas and home to the capital’s airport.“We are survivors,” he said. “If they take Juan Guaido prisoner, someone  will emerge, because our generation won’t give up.”Like Mr Lopez, the wiry Mr Guaido prides himself as an athlete and is a devotee of his home town’s Sharks – a perennial loser in the Venezuelan baseball league. He and his we, a fellow activist, have a daughter named after Francisco de Miranda, a precursor to Venezuelan independence hero Simon Boli.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Juan Guaido takes a selfie with his we Fabiana Rosales and his daughter Miranda In congress, Mr Guaido earned a reputation as a hard worker and consensus-builder while serving as the head of the comptroller commission that investigates allegations of government corruption.Now he is drawing attention on the international stage.Mr Trump promised to use the “full weight” of US economic and diplomatic power to push for the restoration of Venezuela’s democracy.But for the frontal assault on Mr Maduro’s authority to succeed, Venezuelans fearful of taking to the streets again after past uprisings ended in violent crackdowns and bitter isions must be prepared to risk it all again.On Wednesday, they responded to Mr Guaido’s call by gathering in the tens of thousands in Caracas waving flags and chanting “Get out Maduro!” in what was the largest demonstration since a wave of unrest that left more than  dead in .While the protests were mostly peaceful, there were no signs that security forces heeded Mr Guaido’s call to join the anti-Maduro movement and go light on demonstrators.His supporters say the constitution gives him the authority to declare himself interim president as head of the National Assembly.“The constitution gives me the legitimacy to carry out the charge of the presidency over the country to call elections,” Mr Guaido said last week. “But I need backing from the citizens to make it a reality.”"},{"url":null,"title":"city deal secretary state ni questioned progress derrys city deal westminster wake weekend bomb","story":"Proposals for a Derry City Deal have just been submitted to the British government for ‘review and development’, it has emerged.The secretary of state for Northern Ireland was this week asked about the progress of a City Deal for Derry in the wake of the weekend bombing and subsequent unrest in the city.Secretary of State, Karen Bradley, fielded questions at a meeting in the House of Commons, during which the Bishop Street car bomb was high on the agenda.  The meeting heard that the terrorism threat level in NI remains ‘severe’, however, the threat level in GB from NI paramilitaries is still deemed ‘moderate’.Labour MP Mike Kane joined with others in condemning the ‘appalling terrorist attack’ and welcomed the strong community response of the ‘good people of Derry’.  He then asked the secretary of state about the progress of ongoing negotiations for a City Deal in Derry.In response, Ms Bradley said: “There is a process by which all city regions applying to get a city deal go through.  Those negotiations are ongoing and the work is being done by the Ministry for Housing, Communities and Local Governmentand the treasury to make sure the Derry and Strabane City Deal can be delivered.”Yesterday, in a statement to the Derry News a spokesperson for the MHCLG, explained that a set of proposals have been submitted to the UK government this month which are currently being reviewed.She said: “We remain committed to negotiating a Derry and Strabane City Deal and recognise its importance to the local area.”“At Budget  we announced that we were officially entering into negotiations with local partners on a Derry and Strabane City Deal.  Since then, officials met local partners in Derry in December to discuss their emerging proposals and the next steps.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh“This month, Derry and Strabane Council have submitted a set of proposals to UK Government, which we are now reviewing and on which we will work proactively with local partners to develop.”In July of last year the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Philip Hammond, attended a meeting at the Magee Campus in Derry where he said Northern Ireland has been leading the way within the UK in productivity growth and he wanted to ‘support this progress by inviting a bid for a Derry City Deal’.However, there has been little by way of an update since Secretary of State for Housing, Communities and Local Government, James Brokenshire, appeared in Derry last August.  At the time he made no concrete commitment that it would be delivered, saying it would require a ‘detailed submission’ of proposals and ‘further dialogue’.A successful bid could see a signicant sum of money injected into the local economy.A previous recipient of a city deal which would be comparable to that of Derry and the North West is the Inverness and Highland City Region in Scotland which received a commitment of £m in public funds, from the UK government, local council and regional partners – which will be invested over - years.Inverness invested in roads, housing, internet connectivity and science and technology, however, Derry’s plans are believed to be ‘much more ambitious’, according to those involved in negotiations.Derry has been lobbying for such a deal for years, however, in November of last year it was snubbed when the Chancellor announced plans for a Belfast City Deal instead.According to statistics published last year the Derry City and Strabane District Council area has the highest levels of unemployment in the country."},{"url":null,"title":"result weeks foyle hospice prize draw winner","story":"Winners in this weeks Foyle Hospice Weekly Prize Draw are -

The resulting m scrum led to a succession of drives for the line and when the ball was recycled a loose pass missed its intended target, but Rory Campbell took the ball smartly on the bounce to score in the corner for an early Malone lead.After Paddy Wright missed a long-range penalty, Ballynahinch earned an excellent attacking position with a m line out following an excellent Ross Adair touch-finder. The line out was won, but Malone forced a crucial turnover and the chance went begging.Both sides continued to be careless in possession in a niggly match, which was low on quality.On  minutes a Malone breakdown penalty gave lsquoHinch a chance to drive for the line and as they progressed, Malone blatantly killed the ball and could count themselves lucky not to receive a yellow. Wright slotted the penalty to close the gap to two points.Following a Malone penalty miss, lsquoHinch botched their own line out allowing the home side to pile into the . Zack McCall was penalised for offside as Malone looked to sweep the ball wide and was given a yellow card. Malone then scored from a tap penalty to take a - half-time lead.The second half followed a similar pattern to the first with Ballynahinch going further behind to another try from the prolic Campbell after another lsquoHinch mistake on their own line out.Ross Adair reduced the arrears on  minutes with a converted try to put lsquoHinch in bonus point territory and the away side belatedly roused themselves to pile the pressure on Malone during the final ten minutes.However, the home defence held and lsquoHinch had to settle for a point, earned largely through the woes of the Malone place kicker, who failed to land any of his attempts on goal.A disappointing start to  for the locals and they will need to be more accurate this week as Ballymena come to Ballymacarn Park.Malone Ballynahinch AIL DIVISION B.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Ballygowan’s Emma hoping to make waves at Abu Dhabi Special Olympics  ","story":"A BALLYGOWAN swimmer is hoping to make a big splash when she goes to the Middle East in March.Twenty three year-old Emma Carlisle will be going for gold when she swims for Ireland at the  Special Olympics World Summer Games in Abu Dhabi.Emma is one of seven athletes from Co Down included in the -strong Team Ireland squad for the Games which take place over March -.Newry is well represented with four athletes selected.

He defeated the Irish at Downpatrick and gave these families who followed him large estates.Their strongholds were no match, however, for the energy and enthusiasm of the locals and eventually it was easier for them to adopt Irish manners and dress and conform to the customs of Down.According to Irish custom, land didnrsquot belong to the king mdash it belonged to the people and usually went to the strongest chieftain. The residents are reported to have disliked taxes, not much change there down the centuries.McBride dedicates a chapter to the United Irishman mdash immortalised as lsquoThe Man From God Knows Wherersquo mdash who was hanged outside Downpatrick Gaol .And where would society beit wasnrsquot for the humble rubber tyre, whose inventor, John Boyd Dunlop, worked for several years in his brotherrsquos veterinary practice in Downpatrick.Of course no book on the history of Co Down would be complete without a chapter on some of our ghosts and ghouls.McBride has included some of the most interesting. The book tells the story of Noel Killen, originally from Loughinisland, who rode his bike passed the old derelict Ballydugan Flour Mill, near Downpatrick, when he was a young lad and dreamt of restoring it.His dream came true. By virtue of his hard work he recaptured the millrsquos former glory and turned it into an award-winning wedding venue, complete with three happy ghosts who attend weddings and bring luck.Therersquos a Presbyterian minister who loiters around the basement and sometimes appears on the ground floor in the corner near the fire. Then there is Bobby, who danders across the first floor. He can be unpredictable as he is often said to slam the occasional door.Then there is the young girl dressed in sackcloth who loves to dance. She can sometimes be seen to be dancing to the music provided at the wedding breakfast.The book also notes the fable of Maggie who leapt across a deep chasm between the clfs near Newcastle in a bid to outrun a group of soldiers while carrying a basket of stolen birdrsquos eggs.Not an egg was broken in her successful attempt to clear the clf and she lived to see a ripe old age.

Local people have sought a meeting with Department of Health officials on this matter and I will be happy to pursue and facilitate this.ldquoThere is a need for such a crucially important service for parents and indeed the wider family circle to be delivered regionally.Three weeks ago, local politicians called on the Permanent Secretary to reduce the ldquoalready enormous burden from parents suffering from bereavement and come up with a better solution than sending babies to Liverpool.Politicians said they were not averse to an all island service, insisting the reinstatement of the Belfast-based paediatric pathologist who retied is also vitally important moving forward..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"New £217k play park welcome boost for Meadowlands estate  ","story":"MEADOWLANDS estate in Downpatrick is at last to get a new play park costing pound,.Work on the park should start within weeks and be ready by the end of March.A proposal to proceed with the scheme was approved by Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos Active and Healthy Communities Committee on Monday night.The new park is a joint project with the council and Downpatrick Neighbourhood Renewal with % funding from the Department of the Communities.The council will be responsible for managing its construction and its maintenance.The new park is to be located in front of Drumcloon Walk and adjacent to the Quoile Crescent housing development.According to the Northern Ireland Neighbourhood Information Service statistics, Meadowlands is ranked th out of  areas of high health deprivation.The need for the park has also been supported by statistics from the Northern Ireland Research and Information Agency which show that there are  children under the age of  living in the Quoile Ward area who could avail of the park.It is also hoped that the park will help with the regeneration of the area and improve its overall look.The siting of the park was moved after some local concern was expressed that it would too close to pensionersrsquo homes in Drumcloon Park.Meadowlands Community Association, which was formed with help from local councillor Cadogan Enright, last week welcomed the move and the fact that the council listened to its representations.At Mondayrsquos meeting, Cllr Billy Walker proposed that the committee agree to go ahead with the park.He said: ldquoI really welcome this play park, as will the residents, he said. ldquoBeing the last chairman of the old district council, I know that a park for Meadowlands was a legacy issue.ldquoThere is real need for this as Meadowlands is one of the most deprived areas in the Downpatrick DEA and itrsquos to good see that that hard work is at last bearing fruit.Cllr Cadogan, who seconded the proposal, added: ldquoI am delighted that this play park can go ahead as I have been working with the residents for years and itrsquos at last getting over the line..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"New amenity centre set for spring opening  ","story":"DOWNPATRICKrsquoS new ultra-modern civic amenity centre could open as early as the spring, council officials have confirmed.The new facility at Flying Horse Road will replace the existing centre at nearby Cloonagh Road, which continues to struggle with the increasing demands being placed upon it.Over the Christmas and New Year holiday period, the centre was forced to close early due to the volume of waste.The early closure annoyed many ratepayers with council officials confident the new centre mdash which is signicantly larger mdash will be able to handle more recyclable material.Over recent years, Newry, Mourne and Down Council has invested signicant sums building new civic amenity sites in Ballynahinch and Castlewellan, with the Flying Horse Road facility set to be one of the most modern of its kind.Confirmation that the new Downpatrick centre could open as early as the spring will be given at this eveningrsquos meeting of Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos Regulatory and Technical Services Committee.There was a delay in building the new facility as a suitable site could not be identied and when work did eventually get underway, progress was temporarily halted as equipment belonging to contractors was targeted by vandals.Downpatrick councillor Dermot Curran has welcomed news then the new centre could open for business as early as the spring.The local authorityrsquos lease of the Cloonagh Road facility has been extended until the end of March but it has been recognised for some time that this facility has passed its sell-by-date.Cllr Curran said it was important Downpatrick had a recycling centre which was fit-for-purpose and could meet the needs of ratepayers across a wide area.He said the facility was not solely used by people in the town.

Credit is also due to the coaches and senior members of the club for their part in the planning of operations.This weekendItrsquos NI and Ulster Intermediate and Masters Championships races in Barnettrsquos Park on Saturday, beginning at pm.Please, ladies in particular, note the revised schedule as due to the numbers involved the intermediate ladiesrsquo race will be a separate race at pm, and will not be combined with theMasters Women, as originally planned.See you there..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Reception celebrates 45 years’ service  ","story":"THE contribution of the provincersquos longest serving councillor to the district and its people was recognised at a civic reception in his honour last weekend.Dermot Curran has served the people of the district for an incredible  years and his letime of public service recognised by Newry, Mourne and Down Council at a celebratory event at the Millbrook Lodge Hotel in Ballynahinch.Joined by his we Karen, family friends, former and current council colleagues and Northern Ireland Local Government representatives, Cllr Curran was overwhelmed by the good wishes of around  people who attended the event.Also in attendance were representatives from regional and national governments and non-governmental organisations who joined together to celebrate a remarkable achievement.Tributes were paid by current council chairman Mark Murnin, local authority chief executive Liam Hannaway and Northern Ireland Local Government Associationvice-president Fred Donnelly.The council presented him with a beautul James G Miles painting of Ballyhornan beach where he revealed he played as a boy, while Cllr Curranrsquos SDLP colleagues presented him with a portrait oh himself by Killyleagh artist Leo Casement.Cllr Murnin said his council colleague has been dedicated to public service since his first election in , serving two terms as Down Council chairman and then being elected to Newry, Mourne and Down Council in .ldquoOur council has been fortunate to have many hard working and exemplary councillors who strive to make this district a better place to live and work in, he continued. ldquoNo one demonstrates this more clearly than Dermot and during his first term as council chairman, he had the vision to work with councils across Ireland to develop relationships and encourage co-operative projects.ldquoBut we are not the only body to recognise the contribution that Dermot has made to our district. In , he was judged the winner of the Local Government Awards Best Initiative by a Councillor and just last year was presented with the National Association of Councillors Long Service Award.Cllr Murnin said he was ldquoproud to be Cllr Curranrsquos colleague and friend and looked forward to working with him for many years to come.He added: ldquoI believe all councillors look at Dermot with respect and admiration and see him as a great role model.

I always find you a pleasure to work with and a very helpful and hardworking councillor.Mr Hannaway described Cllr Curran as the ldquosage officers and councillors alike got to talk to and said the civic reception was a fitting occasion to mark his service to local politics, the district and his achievements.He continued: ldquoNot only has Dermot devoted his le to serving the people of our area, he has also been active as an executive member of NILGA since its inception and is currently its president, having previously served as chairman.ldquoAmong his many other responsibilities, Dermot has held positions in the Safety Partnership, the South Eastern Health Local Commissioning Group, Down Rural Area Partnership, Peace IV Partnership, Partnership Panel for NI, ARC, National Association of Councillors, FLAG Fisheries Fund and the Investment for Growth and Jobs Programme. He has also been a member of the Eastern Group Environmental Health since it was established and was its chairman in  and .ldquoAt the same time, Dermot has focused his attention on improving the infrastructure and economic possibilities within the district.

I was completely taken aback by the huge response.\"I had people contacting me from all over the world ndash Australia, Spain, Texas, askingI would post calendars to them. This is on top of the response from local people.\"I spent most of my evenings in that first week doing deliveries all over Penarth,\" Mr Lewis added.Through the sales, Mr Lewis has raised more than pound, for the Alzheimers Society.He said: \"It seemed like the right thing to do really, as Penarth is a very community-oriented town so doing a calendar for charity fits with the outlook of the people of Penarth.\"Now, Mr Lewis is looking at printing more calendars this year to help raise further funds for the charity.\"If the idea of this calendar had never been suggested then my photos would have ended up just sitting on my computer,\" he said.\"Irsquom just glad that this hobby that I really like has ended up being put to good use by raising this money for charity.To get in touch with Mr Lewis about purchasing a calendar, email philip.lewis@live article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The site will potentially generate up to  new work positions across management, supervisory, warehousing staff and apprenticeship roles.Speaking of the new facility and what it will bring, Mr Rattenbury said: ldquoWe are delighted that our vision of a lsquoone stop shoprsquo for our customers is being realised and having a  hour, seven day a week co-packing facility in the heart of Wales, is a game changer for our industry. We can now offer our customers a streamlined product supply chain package by integrating their co-packing requirements with the grouprsquos warehouse and transport subsidiary companies.ldquoLogistically, this works out to be more cost effective overall, but also lowers the carbon footprint on the transportation of food products, which is something we are passionate about.Wild Water Group has a current annual turnover of poundm and Mr Rattenbury believes the company can increase that figure by a further poundm within  months and then reach poundm within two to three years.The project is backed by a pound. million investment from Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking and the Development Bank of Wales and has secured Welsh Government funding under the new economic contract.Using a similar business model to the grouprsquos other three sites in Merthyr Tydfil, Llanishen and Cardf Bay, the first phase of development will be the conversion of available space into a large ambient open plan co-packing facility, which will be operational early November  to meet festive season demand.During the first quarter of , Wild Water Group will move the entire Cardf Bay co-packing facility to Aberbargoed, once freezer facilities, production lines and machinery are in place.The company will then continue services such as frozen to frozen storage, bagging, over wrapping, sleeving and tray sealing, as well as the full spectrum of print labelling applications required under the Food Safety Technicalspecications.Economy Secretary Ken Skates said: ldquoThis project will not only see a successful, growing Welsh business create an additional  jobs, it will also create a new strategic hub and facility for both large and small food and drink businesses across the region to pack or store products themselves. This could, in turn, open up new markets for those businesses ndash so Irsquom excited about what this means not only for Wild Water Group and Aberbargoed, but for the region more widely.ldquoIt shows that both our Economic and Food and Drink Action plans are delivering what we had hoped ndash jobs, prosperity and sustainable growth. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

I now intend to present an amended report to cabinet on February .ldquoThe report will propose that option one in the previous report now be taken forward, which retains the current roundabout though enhances the gateway route into Penarth whilst providing much safer crossing opportunities for cyclists and pedestrians. There is no requirement to complete any spending on this project by the end of this financial year.ldquoIt is very dficult to please everyone with highway improvement schemes but I very much hope that this option provides the active travel benefits we are seeking and is viewed by residents and visitors to Penarth as being the most appropriate. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It was made with willow grown in the grounds of Cogan Primary School.More than  people attended the hill rolling ceremony down Clf Hill towards Penarth Esplanade - with the school pupils from Cogan and pupils and families from Ysgol Pen Y Garth helping to roll it along.The head was accompanied by a wooden frame from the Mabinogion stories called the Window of Sorrows made by Tony Simms, and the artist Ifor Davies undertook the ritual sawing of the Window of Sorrows on the clftops and read the Bendigeidfran story from the Mabinogion tales before the rolling went ahead.The head of Bendigeidfran and the Window of Sorrows was accompanied by Penarths Mari Lwyd which is a symbol of hosting, and negotiating hospitality through song and teasing. Richard Parry led the Mari Lwyd this year, and on arriving at the bottom of the hill the celebration visited local shops and resaurants along the sea front wishing the proprietors and customers a Happy New Year. We sang for Romeo Italian restaurant, The Fig Tree, James Sommerin, The Crazy Cafe and Hamptons seaside shop. After reaching the bottom of the hill the head was carried by the children along with the Mari Lwyd to the shops and cafes along the seafront where dferent New Year songs - called Calenig - were sung in each venue and led by local opera singer Richard Parry.Speaking about the event, artist Haf Weighton said: \"I loved working with Cogan School. Itrsquos a hidden gem in Penarth with very enthusiastic staff who were happy to jump in to get involved in this project at short notice. Richard Parry and the schools deputy head Tom Lewis, ran a assembly to the whole school on the new year traditions. Then children from across the school came to see me working on the piece. \"It was lovely to hear children who donrsquot come from homes where Welsh is spoken enthusing about the mabinogi tales and Welsh traditions. Children from Pen y Garth joined in after the head was created. They helped us roll it down the hill from the clf tops.\"Richard Parry, who helped to organise the event and led the Mari Lwyd, said: \"It was great to see so many people come together to celebrate Hen Galan in Penarth. The giant Bendegeidfran got his name because he was the Blessed Bran - the best friend anyone could ever want - and in the stories of the Mabinogion he was loved by those who knew him. He is a symbol of friendship and celebrating together. \"The community celebration on the clftops was thoroughly enjoyed by children and adults alike, and even though its a bit chilly it was wonderful to see so many people out of doors, celebrating, singing and enjoying wishing everyone we met Blwyddyn Newydd Dda and Happy New Year.\"The head will now go on display at a iety of places, including Pen y Garth School, Cogan Primary School, Penarth Library and The Hearth Gallery Llandough Hospital. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work.

There is a lot taking place and there are a lot of new amendments. Wersquoll have to wait and see.Ms Rudd told the programme she is ldquocommitted to making sure we avoid no-deal, which she described as ldquothe worst possible outcome.It came after a string of union bosses visiting Downing Street for talks on Mrs Mayrsquos Plan B urged the Prime Minister to take no-deal off the table or ask for an extension of the two-year Article  negotiation period.Business Minister Richard Harrington declared he is happy to be sacked by the PMshe objects to him speaking out about the dangers of leaving without an agreement on March .Meanwhile, Chancellor Philip Hammond told a business audience at the World Economic Forum in Davos that a no-deal Brexit would be ldquoa betrayal of the promises that were made to voters in the  referendum.And in one of the starkest business warnings to date, Airbus chief executive Tom Enders branded the Governmentrsquos handling of EU withdrawal a ldquodisgrace and said the company could pull out of the UKBrexit undermines its ability to compete.Mr Enders said the UKrsquos multibillion-pound aerospace sector is ldquostanding at a precipice.He said: ldquoBrexit is threatening to destroy a century of development based on education, research and human capital.ldquoIf therersquos a no-deal Brexit, we at Airbus will have to make potentially very harmful decisions for the UK.ldquoIf therersquos a no-deal Brexit, we at Airbus will have to make potentially very harmful decisions for the UK.Airbus senior vice-president Katherine Bennett later said the Government had asked the company to ldquomake clear the potential impact of a no-deal.But a Downing Street spokeswoman insisted there is ldquono knowledge in Number  of any request.Mr Harrington said he was ldquodelighted Mr Enders is ldquotelling it like it is on Brexit.The minister told an audience of German industrialists that crashing out without a deal would be ldquoa disaster for business, adding: ldquoI really donrsquot believe in this idea. I am very happy to be public about it and very happythe Prime Minister decides I am not the right person to do the business industry job.The Number  spokeswoman said Mrs May continues to have full confidence in Mr Harrington, adding: ldquoThe Prime Minister expects ministers to be focused on getting the Governmentrsquos deal through.Addressing a CBI lunch in Davos, Switzerland, Mr Hammond said ldquothe only credible and sustainable solution for the Government is to deliver EU withdrawal in a way which protects the economy.The TUCrsquos Frances OrsquoGrady said Theresa May should lsquostop listening to the bad boysrsquo on Brexit The Chancellor said: ldquoIn the  referendum a promise was made to the majority who voted for Brexit ndash that they were voting for a more prosperous future.ldquoNot leaving would be seen as a betrayal of that referendum decision. But leaving without a deal would undermine our future prosperity, and would equally represent a betrayal of the promises that were made.Emerging from Downing Street after talks with Mrs May, TUC general secretary Frances OrsquoGrady said she had not received the guarantees unions are seeking on jobs and workersrsquo rights.ldquoThe Prime Minister should do the right thing and take no-deal off the table so that genuine dialogue can take place, said the TUC boss.Mrs May should ldquostop listening to the bad boys at the back of the class who play down the risks of departure without agreement, she said.The PM invited a string of union leaders to Number  as part of her bid to get widespread political backing for a Brexit plan that could command a majority in the Commons after her deal was overwhelmingly rejected by MPs last week.Unite leader Len McCluskey said he told her companies are putting investment on hold because of uncertainty over the outcome.Urging Mrs May to extend Article  by three months, Mr McCluskey said: ldquoI cannot conceive any prime minister taking us out of Europe with a no-deal. It would be catastrophic.Unisonrsquos Dave Prentis said a no-deal Brexit ldquomust be avoided at all costs, while GMB general secretary Tim Roache said: ldquoWe canrsquot carry on like this.

Before her move to London she had worked for Paul Rankin at Roscoff’s.Mary-Anne said she had always intended to come home from London and her original intention was to open a café deli. She said the market stall was designed to be a stopgap while she looked for premises but she ended up spending ten years there until she had her twins three years ago.“I was self-employed so I couldn’t take maternity leave from the market for more than eight weeks or I would lose the pitch,” she said.“I was already doing some midweek cookery classes at home in Moy, so I decided to expand on that and convert the garage into a state of the art facility. I really enjoy it and it allows me to work from home.”Courses cost from £ and include tea coffee and scones. Mary-Anne delivers savoury cookery classes as well but explained that baking is far and away the most popular.“I wasn’t actually trained as a pastry chef but there has been such a resurgence in the popularity of baking. That is where the demand is. I would love to do more cookery classes where people can learn to do savoury foods too, however the majority of bookings are for those sweet treats we all love. I like to combine traditional recipes and new flavours. Local, seasonal and organic ingredients are key.”Each course can accommodate - people and are booked out weeks in advance. All recipes andequipment are provided and you get to take home what you make.“My style is informal, it’s all about having fun. I do hands-on and demonstration classes and cater for all levels from complete beginners to more experienced cooks. The aim is to get stuck in. The children’s classes are really popular, and I love that.

The £m development project, is a , sq ft grade A office development to be delivered by McAleer  Rushe which will accommodate over , people upon completion.

Ulster Business takes a further look A few years back, the options were fairly limited for NI firms when it came to venture capital funding.Now, between private funds, investors and those backed by Invest NI, the options have widened signicantly for companies – especially those which are high-growth – to seek a cash injection, and get to the next level.Jayne Brady is partner at the Bank of Ireland Kernel Capital Growth Fund NI.“We have been operating in Northern Ireland for five years, and in that period we have seen a growing momentum in the Northern Ireland ecosystem,” she told Ulster Business.“We have  companies in our portfolio, and have invested in eight companies in Northern Ireland as part of that.”And a lot has changed in the last few years, particularly with the sheer number of avenues in which businesses can find access to funding.“There wasn’t an availability of local funds, and it was dficult to get that level from GB, because you needed to reach a certain level.”And where is the investment now going in Northern Ireland  “It’s very strong sectors of expertise, and there is a big FDI element – medical technology, cyber-security. It’s not created in isolation, andan availability of skills.”“More recently, there has been more external investors. We would co-invest, and there is a level of investment from outside players – there are good opportunities.”Jayne says that Kernel Capital tracks investments, and the level and size of deals here has grown. A lot of that has been down to the growth of the Knowledge Economy – which has expanded seven or eight-fold in the last few years.For businesses looking towards funds like Kernel, a typical deal size is from around £m up to £m.One of the largest investments was secured by B-Secur, which has created a biometric technology which uses the human heartbeat to unlock everything from finance and healthcare through to cars and buildings.The company, based at Catalyst Inc, secured £.m from investors including Kernel Capital and ADV.For Jayne, Kernel is looking at companies with turnover of more than £m, which have the ability and scope to be scaled.“We see investment where there is a scaling potential. We look at companies where we are generating £m plus –– which you can scale rapidly, or those with a deep IPfocus. Some companies in services won’t have that level of scale.”Then, there’s the Growth Finance Fund, and Growth Loan Fund II, which provide a total of £m of funding for Northern Ireland’s SMEs.The two new funds are being managed by WhiteRock Capital Partners, a homegrown fund manager set up in  to manage the first Growth Loan Fund, which has committed £m of loans to more than  businesses over the last six years.There’s also the Growth Finance Fund. That will see loans from £, up to £m going to growing businesses. It’s also the first time the British Business Bank has invested in a fund aimed solely at supporting Northern Ireland businesses. The latest figures from the Irish Venture Capital Association, which covers businesses across the island, show venture capital funding has slumped, with a fall-off in major deals and seed funding.Investment was down by almost a third to €min the first nine months of the , confirming a signicant slowdown on .The drop-off in cash accelerated during the year, with the amount raised by tech firms and startups in the last three months just half what it was a year earlier.The figures suggested that the largest segment of funding to see a decline is in deals was above €m .But a Northern Ireland report by Catalyst Inc, published last year, showed companies raised over £m in equity capital in .Elsewhere, flying the flag for venture capital in Northern Ireland for more than  years is Crescent Capital.Run by Colin Walsh, former CBI chairman in Northern Ireland, it’s invested in a raft of the most successful and leading companies here.That includes Andor Technology and Belfast-based biotech firm Fusion Antibodies, which is based at Springbank Industrial Estate in the west of the city.According to Jayne, it’s not just about backing Belfast firms, or FDIs setting up shop in the heart of the city.“We look towards the strong sectoral focuses, and outside Belfast as well. We are very conscious to go to our customers.” That includes holding regular open events across areas such as Newry, Co Tyrone and Londonderry. “We are very open to meeting any companies, and our door is open,” she says.But will Brexit play a part in the future of venture capital funding in Northern Ireland  “We need to be cognisant of any particular indication of any change in regulation,” Jayne says.“From our perspective, because we invest in deep tech, they are somewhat removed from that direct impact.” Elsewhere, there are other revenue streams which firms can look towards, especially when it comes to working capital.That includes Upstream – an alternative finance company run by Judith Totten, which specialises in funding for SMEs.“As Northern Ireland’s largest independently owned and managed provider of working capital, Upstream works collaboratively with organisations’ existing lenders to provide additional capital in a more flexible way to help businesses thrive,” sales director Alan Wardlow says.“Businesses come to us for our responsiveness – our formal credit approvals are achieved in days rather than weeks or months. Upstream has long standing relationships with many local venture capitaland private equity providers as well as the ious Invest NI-backed loan funds and we work closely together to provide solutions for business owners across Northern Ireland“We recently incorporated a trade finance solution into our product range to bridge the gap for organisations who require additional growth funding, quickly, to deliver orders beyond their current capability. This funding is proving incredibly popular alongside our long-standing invoice finance option which gives organisations the ability to release funds against their debtor book thereby freeing up cash flow for businesses to seize growth opportunities as they become available.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/steve_web.jpg","title":"the catalyst to putting northern ireland on the global map","story":"Posted on Wednesday  January  by Ulster Business Ulster Business speaks to Catalyst Inc chief executive Steve Orr about his hugely ambitious plans for growth, expansion and moulding NI into a world-leader in tech ‘We aren’t going to follow anyone , and we need toto becoming leaders in the world.’It’s immediately clear that Steve Orr has big ambitions for Catalyst Inc. He’s just taken over at the helm of the internationally renowned next generation science park which is home to  innovative knowledge based companies, who are employing more than , engineers, researchers, entrepreneurs and executives, across four locations – and has his sights firmly set on making Northern Ireland a leader in two key innovative areas of tech business.Taking on the role as chief executive of Catalyst from stalwart Professor Norman Apsley OBE, just two months ago, plans are under way to build on the foundations of an organisation which has an estate of , sq ft of agile workspace filled with innovative companies. Catalyst leads the way in innovation and entrepreneurship by supporting the creation and growth of innovation companies in Northern Ireland.“We have a rightful place in leading the world. We aren’t going to follow anybody. Let’s get back to leading the world,” Steve tells Ulster Business.“I am going to take the foundation that Norman left and look at how we leverage that by a signicant factor – in terms of economic activity and dynamism for Northern Ireland.“We need deeper, more strategic partnerships with key institutions. It is through collaboration we can do something to scale and put Northern Ireland on a world map.”Catalyst is the thriving, beating heart of Northern Ireland’s booming technology sector and leading the way in educating and preparing companies and young people for the changing world of work through the impact of the ‘Fourth Industrial Revolution, which is seeing the impact of new technologies impacting on le, work and society.Formerly known as the Northern Ireland Science Park, Catalyst is an independent not-for-profit organisation operating across the region. It provides agile workspace across four locations – the main site in Belfast’s Titanic Quarter, the Innovation centres in Londonderry, and Ballymena and most recently opened Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub, a co-working space dedicated to the fintech sector in Belfast city centre, which is a partnership with Danske Bank.“The business model we have had for the first  years was the perfect model for that period. We need a new model for the next. We are identying a simple, but ambitious strategy – building on the existing foundation.”Part of the strength of Catalyst is in attracting big international firms, such as Citi, in close proximity to businesses at the very birth of existence. Steve says as a result, “accidental encounters” lead to relationships and outcomes which otherwise, would not have happened.It also plays host to Queen’s University’s leading research body, ECITwhich itself is home to CSIT .Some of the leading thinkers based at the site include ECIT’s Professor Maire O’Neill – one of the youngest ever engineering professors at Queen’s, one-time UK Female Inventor of the Year and a leading researcher. “You have US companies looking at why would they want to move to Northern Ireland – they want to meet Professor O’Neill. She’s amazing,” Steve says.“Then there are cyber companies, like B-Secur. The firm specialises in technology which can read your ECG heartbeat as a unique biometric identy verication.“There are other indigenous companies, like Titan IC in cyber-security, Displaynote and ProAxsis. We have great companies that are now making a dent in the world.”And pushing forward with what his predecessor Norman Apsley built, plans are under way to expand and redevelop Catalyst further still.That includes another new building, Pierpont  – which will provide another , sq ft of space – and a revamp and refurbishment of Catalyst’s Innovation Centre, as part of an addition £m investment.“We want to make this the best place to work – improving the environment, the flow around the campus, the accessibility, and the experience, so that you love being here.“We want to refresh some of the buildings on the site. The Innovation Centre will be modernised by March and we will freshen-up our identity.”His big goal is to lead the way in two areas of technology and business at Catalyst – putting Northern Ireland front and centre.“We want to help to incubate two clusters where Northern Ireland leads the world.“How do we build on what ECIT is doing  We take the start-up capability, and ecosystem we have in Northern Ireland and leverage that further.“We want to make it easier for corporations to set up in Belfast and Northern Ireland in order to access amazing research talent. They want to define what the next big breakthrough is.“We can develop something for global companies that they can’t find where in the world. We want to create clusters, that will act as a magnet to attract hundreds of companies.”One of the unique elements of Catalyst is Connect – a network of experienced entrepreneurs, business professionals, top research talent and potential investors who provide their time and experience pro bono to help foster and develop the next generation of entrepreneurs.“It’s helping entrepreneurs to figure out how to build a company around their product idea and providing the support to validate and access the marketplace, capital, investment and or talent,” Steve says.“With the Connect network, we had  early stage companies or entrepreneurs engaged in our programmes last year. There is a lot of exciting and vibrant activity going on at the moment.”And it was Connect, which Steve founded and developed at Catalyst, which first drew him back home to his native Northern Ireland, following years of running and founding tech firms in the West Coast of the US.“I was an entrepreneur in Calornia for a number of years, in San Francisco and San Diego. I was there for the peak of the dot coms,” he said.That included his own start-up business, Kineticom, as well as other tech companies. It was his time in San Diego which resonated strongly with Steve.“Personally, I became obsessed with the San Diego story and the parallels to Northern Ireland. When they started on their journey in , San Diego had a population of . million people, % of their economy was dependent on the public sector. They have an ocean to one side, a mountain range around them and another country to the bottom of them.”San Diego went from the bottom of every league table to the top – with the collaboration of top universities, research and development and entrepreneurship, building the city into the tech stalwart it is now.The Connect  emanated from San Diego – a concept which help shaped the programme in Northern Ireland.“Meeting Norman Apsley at the Science Park was just the most beautul thing ever,” Steve says.The financial and economic impact and contribution that Catalyst has is hard to ignore. It’s estimated the businesses which operate there contribute around £m in GVA each year.“Everything we do is based on the simple belief that innovation has the power to transform our economy. People around the world are all innovating quickly, adapting new technologies, articial intelligence, for example. In Northern Ireland,people are producing goods and services, but are behind in adopting those new technologies, our economy is going to be in trouble as we will not be competitive.“The question is, how does innovation become the foundation on which everything is based ”And as a result of Catalyst’s research into the NI Knowledge Economy, an annual report published later this month, which acknowledges the huge changes to the workplace in the coming year, Catalyst is hosting their second Future of Work summit in May  – aimed at demystying how roles and traditional jobs are changing, right across the Knowledge Economy sectors.Of course, Brexit is still on the horizon. For Steve, the main concern is around the availability of talent. “The tech sector is hungry for talent, but with the uncertainty in the last couple of years, fewer people have been willing to consider moving to Northern Ireland. That places a lot of pressure on the existing employees in the sector.”“Long-term, we have to be optimistic and look at the opportunities which can come out of Brexit. The businesses within the Knowledge Economy are export driven, representing over % of all NI exports. With % of these exports outside the EU, the Knowledge Economy is the sector least dependent on Europe and should be the key for driving growth at this time of uncertainty.”So, for Steve, his level of optimism and dynamism is clear in his new role, one which he says he is “very fortunate” to have.“It’s a position which comes around so rarely, and whoever gets the opportunity is so blessed and fortunate to have the opportunity to lead. We have a talented team of people who are all passionate about what is possible. It’s so exciting. The opportunities and possibilities are endless.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/323433.jpg","title":"theresa mays brexit deal voted down business reaction","story":"Posted on Wednesday  January  by John Mulgrew Business groups have overwhelmingly raised concerns over crashing out of the EU without a deal after Prime Minister Theresa May’s withdrawal plan with Brussels was overwhelmingly rejected by MPs. Ann McGregor, chief executive of Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry “The business communities that we represent have always had a erse range of views on what form the UK’s future relationship with the EU should take, however they do agree on the need to avoid a messy and disorderly Brexit. “To achieve this we therefore need an agreement that will secure the transition period and protect jobs. As businesses wait to see what happens next in Parliament, it is crucial that those at Westminster move beyond tactical manoeuvring and look at all the options in order to avoid a ‘no deal’s scenario. “Firms are in the dark on too many aspects of le after March . This has already led to many businesses taking action – pausing on recruitment and investment, stockpiling goods, and relocating factories in other parts of the EU. In fact, a third of NI Chamber members are currently putting growth and investment plans on hold in the absence of clarity from Westminster. There is however nothing to stop government acting decisively on areas within their control, such as migration and customs procedures.”  Aodhan Connolly, director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium “The result this evening will be a cause for concern across the Northern Ireland business community. Northern Ireland businesses desperately need certainty about the UK’s future trading relationship with the EU and will be severely disadvantaged by a no deal. A no deal Brexit means that Northern Ireland households will face higher prices and less choice on the shelves something they can ill afford. “Se need politicians  to coalesce around a workable solution that protects consumers from the costs and disruptions due to the loss of tarf-free and frictionless trade we currently enjoy with partners in the EU. We are now closer than ever to the possibility of a no-deal that will be a disaster for Northern Ireland.” “  Angela McGowan, CBI Northern Ireland director “Every business will feel no deal is hurtling closer. A new plan is needed immediately. This is now a time for our politicians to make history as leaders. All MPs need to reflect on the need for compromise and to act at speed to protect the UKs economy. “No deal would immediately put Northern Irish jobs and businesses at risk and jeopardise years of positive economic development and integration across the island.  It must be avoided to protect our all-island economy.”  Glyn Roberts, Retail NI chief executive “This is a disappointing but not unexpected result. While the Prime Minister’s draft Withdrawal Bill was in no way perfect, it was definitely preferable to crashing out of the EU with no deal. “The Government now needs to work on a cross-party basis with Labour and other opposition parties to reach a broader agreement for a withdrawal deal and secure the transition period, protect jobs and a positive future relationship with the EU  Colin Neill, chief executive, Hospitality Ulster “Leaving the EU without a deal would damage the sustainability of the Hospitality industry and impact on the potential growth of Tourism in Northern Ireland. We appeal to our elected representatives to work together in a spirit of consensus government to ensure that a no deal scenario does not happen.”  Tina McKenzie, FSB NI policy chair “With the clock ticking down to Brexit Day in just  weeks, we are running out of time to avoid a clf-edge, no-deal outcome. “A disorderly exit from the EU would be deeply damaging for small businesses, causing disruption to supply chains, increasing costs and stling investment. “A no-deal is something which we simply cannot countenance, so it is imperative that political leaders sharpen their focus and do all they can to reach agreement in the short time available.”  View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"no deal brexit could cost ni economy bn by ","story":"Posted on Monday  January  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland’s economy could suffer a £bn drop in output by  in the event of a ‘no deal’ Brexit, it’s been claimed.

The CBI calculates this could amount to an annual loss of output worth almost £bn by , based on today’s prices. It says “manufacturing activity is particularly important in Northern Ireland, and the agri-food sector, which employs thousands, is likely to be severely impacted as it is particularly exposed to the risk of higher tarfs and trade costs”. Angela McGowan, Northern Ireland director of the CBI, said: “CBI members across Northern Ireland are clear:the new approach to finding a Brexit deal continues to be a game of who blinks first, the Northern Irish economy will pay the price. “The deadlock will only be broken by a genuine attempt by all MPs to find consensus and compromise, not stick to rusting red lines and political conditions. Like the rest of the UK, Northern Ireland is not – and cannot be – ready for no deal. “The projected impact on our economy would be devastating and while business will do all it can to reduce some of the worst aspects, a no deal scenario is unmanageable. “The message from the CBI to our politicians is clear – we must see compromise or the whole country faces the unforgivable prospect of a disorderly Brexit which will affect jobs and livelihoods in Northern Ireland for decades to come.

It’s still lovingly referred to as the Swiss watch stalwart’s sister brand.From there, following the Second World War, he decided now was the time to expand and give the brand an identity of its own.The primary dference between the brands back then, was that Rolex watches carried in-house movements, and that Tudor would offer familiar watch styles, such as the Oyster and Submariner, at a more affordable cost, while its big brother would guarantee the technical, aesthetic and al characteristics, along with distribution and after sales service.But the brand back then, and the company now, has changed radically. Just a few years ago, it tore up the rulebook on its traditional line – moving away from historically similar watches to Rolex, and a few changes from its classical lines, towards a tight range of watches, bringing in the old and the new.The core model is the Black Bay. A millimetre larger than the Rolex Submariner, it’s a slightly chunkier affair, without treading into the excessive sizes of some other brand’s modern timepieces. It also offers a new ‘’ –  a smaller mm watch, which fits right in as a cheaper alternative to the Submariner, a Black Bay Chronograph and the Pelagos – a larger, more modern affair made out of titanium.The brand also comes in at a time when Rolex prices have shot up, considerably. Many of the most desirable models in the Rolex line have a waiting list – with second-hand prices outpacing the new book price.Tudor itself has also embraced this burgeoning demand, releasing its own GMT watch – with so-called ‘Pepsi’ blue and red bezel. Currently, Rolex’s own model – aside from the sizeable price dference – will mean joining a waiting list. A WEEK ON THE WRIST Tudor Heritage Black Bay Sitting as Tudor’s poster-boy or flagship in its range, the Black Bay is a e watch which melds the styling and inspiration of, possibly the most recognisable watch in the world, the Rolex Submariner, with a larger case, while adding patina on the hands and markers.There’s no crown-guard, ala Rolex. This time, it’s a larger, screw-down, with an etched Tudor rose – formerly the brand’s logo.Overall, the Black Bay’s case is brushed, including the caseback, with the finish smoothly transitioning into a polish around the sides and crown.The sapphire crystal glass is slightly domed, sitting around a millimetre off the face off the watch. Around the edge, the bezel is a solid, thick and satisfyingly sold -click version, with red triangle and lume dot.This version is on a steel bracelet, but is also available on a leather or fabric band, along with red dial and blue – the latter without the patina on the markers and hands.The bracelet is a stand-out characteristic of the piece, certainly in terms of build quality. The three-piece links have a lug width of mm, tapering to around mm. It’s brushed, but polished and riveted along the side. On the clasp, there’s a double-locking system, with a thoughtful inclusion of the Tudor shield logo into the mechanism, along with three points of micro-adjustment.This watch, available from jeweller Lunn’s, spent several days on my wrist – from the office, to out-and-about and around the house. It’s a comfortable piece to wear – balanced between a bit more heft than its more expensive sibling, but never straying into the realm of gaudy or garish.After a few hours, it felt very much like one of my own. I did miss the date, however, but those after additional complications or ality could look to the chronograph version, or the larger Pelagos.The Black Bay is a well-balanced piece – easily sitting at the centre of a Venn diagram between casual and formal.The brand itself is firing everything at the new range, with endorsements from David Beckham and Lady Gaga, aimed at a younger generation with disposable income to spare. While that may not appeal or speak to the horological purists, with the in-house movement, attention to detail, provenance and mixture of the traditional and modern, it’s likely to build a fresh reputation as a ‘watch fan’ timepiece, and for those who have no issue explaining to those admiring the chunk of steel on their wrists, that it isn’t a Rolex.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
