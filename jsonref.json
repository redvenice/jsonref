I like that she\u0027s still given such a classic look a contemporary twist, by wearing the bun to the side, rather than in the middle\u0027\u0027Going back to the bun is a step away from the more casual low ponytail she sported yesterday, but as that was more of a private family occasion, perhaps she felt comfortable enough to try something new – today is a day for a tried-and-trusted look that she knows will photograph well.\u0027Meghan is known for wearing her hair in a looser and more relaxed style, but her hair today is much sleeker and more elegant, with a very tight ballerina-style knot in place of her usual messy bun.\u0027 Jason added: \u0027It\u0027s a sophisticated update on the look, ideal for such a formal occasion. I like that she\u0027s still given such a classic look a contemporary twist, by wearing the bun to the side, rather than in the middle of her head.\u0027This look also shows the neckline of her dress beautifully she clearly likes the combination of a bateau neckline, a fascinator and an up \u0027do. All three works together beautifully and it\u0027s a combination that looks fantastic, so I think it\u0027s safe to say this won\u0027t be the last time we see this look on Meghan.\u0027             The Duchess of Sussex was all smiles as she arrived at the event. To mark the RAF\u0027s centenary year, special events, activities and other initiatives at local, regional and national levels will run from April to the end of September 2018This year marks the centenary of the  Royal Air Force – the world\u0027s first independent air force – which was founded on 1 April 1918, independent of the British Army and Royal Navy.For one hundred years the RAF has defended the skies of Britain, preventing conflicts, delivering aid and combating cyber threats while working in partnership with other services.These include Operation Ruman – the UK\u0027s humanitarian assistance operation in the aftermath of hurricane Irma which hit the Caribbean in September 2017 – and the RAF\u0027s Quick Reaction Alert Typhoon Aircraft, providing a UK air defence capability 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.Today, the RAF is engaged on some 13 missions across 26 countries and is heavily committed on operations both at home and abroad.             The royals spent time speaking to RAF officials and members of the clergy before taking their seats in the church.

They also lack a dot in the centre of their spots, which is the mark of a jaguar.           The leopard is lazing in the branches of this tree, which is one of the animal\u0027s favoured hang-outs, as it keeps it out of the way of much larger predators that patrol the ground below          Even standing up in the tree, the leopard is hard to see (centre). The cats will often drag their prey into trees to stop it being stolen by lions and other large predators          Leopards are relatively common across Kenya but particular concentrations can be found inside the Maasai Mara and Samburu National ReservesIt is unlikely that the two species would be confused in the wild, however, as they do not share a habitat.Leopards live mostly across southern parts of Africa and in scattered communities across Asia, Pakistan and Malaysia, while jaguars live in the Americas.Leopards can be spotted across Kenya but there are particular concentrations in the Maasai Mara and Samburu National Reserves.As with many of Africa\u0027s largest predators, their numbers increase dramatically around wildebeest migration season as they follow the herd, hoping to pick off stragglers.Igor Gerlach has been a photographer since 1974 and began taking pictures of wildlife in 1976.

Meghan unveils a twist on her go-to style as she arrives in Ireland with a side bun and centre partingBy SIOFRA BRENNAN FOR MAILONLINE She\u0027s recently abandoned her beloved messy bun in favour of a more sleek and formal updo, and today the Duchess of Sussex debuted a new twist on the look.Stepping off the place in Dublin for her first official overseas visit with Harry, Meghan showed off a neat side bun with a side parting.It was a departure from the more severe style she\u0027s worn on several occasions, with hair swept to the back of her head with her hair parted down the middle.  The Duchess wore her hair in a neat updo with a side parting, lending a less severe look to the formal style. She wore her hair in swept back bun with a centre parting to a reception at Marlborough House in London last week Celebrity hairdresser James Johnson told Femail: \u0027The changing of a parting can alter your whole style, instantly.\u0027By keeping the side bun low and opposite, she\u0027s kept the symmetry in her look. This helps keep the over-style elegant, yet with a slight twist, making the hair a focal point.\u0027By keeping the hair balanced Meghans created a formal, more structured style, ideal for any royal appearance.\u0027Switching up the parting can create more dimension for any look, perfect for a plain outfit like Meghan has on here, giving the whole look more personality.   She ditched the messy bun she used to favour, seen here on a visit to Northern Ireland in March (left).

Attorney General Geoffrey CoxYesterday, it was revealed that the Ministry of Justice has already been handed £17million to prepare for a no-deal Brexit.Justice Minister Lucy Frazer revealed that the Treasury had freed up the funds to ensure the MoJ ‘are ready for’ a no deal.The revelation came after a question in the Commons from Tory backbencher William Wragg.Justice Secretary David Gauke yesterday said that leaving the EU without a deal was ‘not an attractive proposition’.But, with time running out ahead of the UK’s departure next year, Mr Gauke said ministers had a duty to accelerate preparations. ‘It is absolutely right that we prepare for no deal,’ he said.Merkel praises May\u0027s \u0027progress\u0027 on Brexit and EU negotiator...May\u0027s fightback reshuffle: Millionaire lawyer who forgot to...Share this article‘We cannot rule out that that is where we will end up for one reason or another.’Mrs May warned MPs on Monday there was a ‘serious risk’ of Britain leaving without a deal if the EU rejects her latest compromise proposals.She added: ‘A responsible Government must prepare for a range of potential outcomes, including the possibility of no deal, and given the short period remaining before the conclusion of negotiations, the Cabinet agreed on Friday that these preparations should be stepped up.‘But at the same, we should recognise that such a disorderly no deal would have profound consequences for both the UK and the EU, and I believe that the UK deserves better.’Privately, Whitehall insiders believe Mrs May will be unable to go much further in offering concessions to the EU.          New Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab, pictured, told his first meeting of the Cabinet that accelerating contingency plans would be one of his first priorities in the new jobOne said: ‘If the EU won’t agree then we have got a very serious problem with the negotiations at that point.’EU leaders have so far given a muted reaction to Mrs May’s Chequers deal, saying they want to hear more detail before passing judgment. But the EU’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier yesterday suggested he was sceptical about Mrs May’s idea of the UK retaining full access to the single market without signing up to all the rules.Speaking at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York, Mr Barnier repeated that the single market and the four freedoms – goods, capital, services and labour – were the ‘the fundamental principles on which the EU is based’ and would be defended.Mr Barnier said 80 per cent of the issues surrounding the UK’s exit had now been resolved.But asked if he was worried other countries might follow Britain’s lead, Mr Barnier said: ‘Once again, I regret profoundly this vote of the UK, we respect it and we implement it.‘But it’s day after day more clear... I can tell you that it will be clear, clear, crystal clear at the end of this negotiation, that the best situation with the best relation with the EU, will remain to be a member of the EU.’Mr Barnier later said Brexit would be ‘costly and unpleasant’ for the UK. He warned the cost of Brexit would be ‘substantially higher for the UK than the EU’.He said that the EU would not accept Mrs May’s proposal for an exception for the financial industry from EU rules. He added: ‘It would go against all our objectives... I don’t know any country in the world that would accept such a loss of sovereignty.’He then half joked: ‘I have no personal experience of orce, it’s always costly and unpleasant’.Angela Merkel yesterday offered Theresa May a slender Brexit lifeline, saying the Chequers proposals would be viewed ‘in the spirit of friendship’.The German Chancellor also did not outright dismiss Mrs May’s idea of the UK retaining full access to the single market without accepting free movement. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/10/22/4E19D84000000578-0-image-m-25_1531257019411.jpg","title":"Where Harry Kanes school cup winners Former classmates watch Englands Captain","story":"    His former teammates admit that as they grew older their priorities switched to job hunting and socialisingEven then, the 15-year-olds were often referred to as the ‘Harry Kane team’ and the players were under instructions to pass the ball to him if in trouble. His former teammates admit that as they grew older their priorities switched to job hunting and socialising. Kane, they said, shunned alcohol and was single-minded in his determination to become a professional footballer.One schoolfriend, Jack Coker, is at least a goalkeeper with semi-pro West Essex in the Essex Senior League but he earns his living as a PE teacher.Dean Ercan, a scaffolder from Chingford, played football with Kane from the age of eight.Share this article    Harry Kane of England national team plays with toy rooster during an England training session ahead of the 2018 FIFA World Cup Russia Semi-Final match against Croatia, on July 10English teacher Denis McElligott was coach of the school team and said Kane was always determined to make the most of his talent.‘He was a little bit stocky but then you would see him after a game out running, losing weight and working on his fitness,’ he said in a previous interview.‘Kids from other schools started to know who he was and know his name.

But GP leaders are very concerned about virtual consultations and fear they will miss serious, less obvious symptoms that doctors pick up through their gut instinctsSurgeries – including the one run by Babylon – are paid an average of £150 by the NHS for every patient on their books, so practices whose patients are moving to Babylon stand to lose substantial amounts of money.

Meghan stuns in Dior as she joins the royal family at Westminster Abbey - just HOURS before flying to Dublin with HarryThe Duchess of Sussex put on a stunning display as she joined the royals at Westminster Abbey this morning.Meghan, who will fly to Dublin with Prince Harry tonight, stunned in a little black dress for a service commemorating the 100th anniversary of the Royal Air Force.The Duchess, 36, paired the fit-and-flare frock with an elaborate netted headpiece from milliner Stephen Jones, just hours after she ided fans with her olive green Ralph Lauren ensemble for Prince Louis\u0027 christening at St. James\u0027s Palace. She wore her tresses in an elegant side bun, which celebrity hair stylist Jason Collier says is a \u0027sleeker and more elegant\u0027 take on what is fast becoming her signature look.The service marks the start of a busy day for Harry and Meghan, who will later be whisked off to Buckingham Palace for a reception before boarding a private jet to Ireland to kick-start their first overseas engagement since tying the knot.     Curve ball: Based on the cut and style of Meghan\u0027s elegant bateauneck frock, royal watchers were convinced it was a bespoke piece by her wedding dress designer, Clare Waight Keller of Givenchy, however it was later revealed as DiorCommenting on Meghan\u0027s dress, celebrity stylist and designer Lucas Armitage (the-timeless.com) told MailOnline that Meghan had made a \u0027bold choice\u0027 by choosing black. He added: \u0027The boat neck and cut is reminiscent of the wedding gown so it\u0027s a silhouette she knows wows.\u0027Based on the cut and style of Meghan\u0027s elegant bateauneck frock, royal watchers were convinced it was a bespoke piece by her wedding dress designer, Clare Waight Keller of Givenchy, however it was later revealed as Dior.Harry and Meghan were joined this morning by the Queen, Prince Charles and Camilla, and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, with Kate putting in a rare appearance during her maternity leave.Also in attendance were Prince Andrew, Prince Edward and Sophie, and Princess Anne, and Prince Michael of Kent.Celebrity hair stylist Jason Collier, whose A-list clientele include the likes of Victoria Beckham, told MailOnline: \u0027The bun is quickly becoming the Duchess\u0027s signature look, so it\u0027s no surprise to see her sporting this style at today\u0027s ceremony.\u0027It\u0027s clearly a style that she feels comfortable with, which is so important when you\u0027re stepping out in front of the cameras.      Meghan takes her husband\u0027s arm as they make their way into the church. Later they will hop on a plane to Ireland, where they will spend their time visiting organisations which are \u0027central to Irish life\u0027, including the home of Gaelic football            Meghan wore her hair in an elegant side bun for the service at Westminster Abbey this morning, which celebrity hair stylist Jason Collier says is a \u0027sleeker and more elegant\u0027 take on what is fast becoming her signature look            Commenting on Meghan\u0027s sleek bun, Jason said: \u0027It\u0027s a sophisticated update on the look, ideal for such a formal occasion. I like that she\u0027s still given such a classic look a contemporary twist, by wearing the bun to the side, rather than in the middle\u0027\u0027Going back to the bun is a step away from the more casual low ponytail she sported yesterday, but as that was more of a private family occasion, perhaps she felt comfortable enough to try something new – today is a day for a tried-and-trusted look that she knows will photograph well.\u0027Meghan is known for wearing her hair in a looser and more relaxed style, but her hair today is much sleeker and more elegant, with a very tight ballerina-style knot in place of her usual messy bun.\u0027 Jason added: \u0027It\u0027s a sophisticated update on the look, ideal for such a formal occasion. I like that she\u0027s still given such a classic look a contemporary twist, by wearing the bun to the side, rather than in the middle of her head.\u0027This look also shows the neckline of her dress beautifully she clearly likes the combination of a bateau neckline, a fascinator and an up \u0027do. All three works together beautifully and it\u0027s a combination that looks fantastic, so I think it\u0027s safe to say this won\u0027t be the last time we see this look on Meghan.\u0027             The Duchess of Sussex was all smiles as she arrived at the event. To mark the RAF\u0027s centenary year, special events, activities and other initiatives at local, regional and national levels will run from April to the end of September 2018This year marks the centenary of the  Royal Air Force – the world\u0027s first independent air force – which was founded on 1 April 1918, independent of the British Army and Royal Navy.For one hundred years the RAF has defended the skies of Britain, preventing conflicts, delivering aid and combating cyber threats while working in partnership with other services.These include Operation Ruman – the UK\u0027s humanitarian assistance operation in the aftermath of hurricane Irma which hit the Caribbean in September 2017 – and the RAF\u0027s Quick Reaction Alert Typhoon Aircraft, providing a UK air defence capability 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.Today, the RAF is engaged on some 13 missions across 26 countries and is heavily committed on operations both at home and abroad.             The royals spent time speaking to RAF officials and members of the clergy before taking their seats in the church. In just a few hours, Harry and Meghan will be whisked back to Buckingham Palace for a reception before flying to DublinTo mark its centenary year, special events, activities and other initiatives at local, regional and national levels will run from April to the end of September 2018. The centrepiece of RAF100 will take place on 10 July, with a service in Westminster Abbey, followed by a parade in The Mall and spectacular flypast over Buckingham Palace.This afternoon, Harry and Meghan will join royals at a Buckingham Palace reception to mark the centenary of the Royal Air Force.

Snaps of Meghan entering the church give a back view of her hair.

Meghan unveils a twist on her go-to style as she arrives in Ireland with a side bun and centre partingBy SIOFRA BRENNAN FOR MAILONLINE She\u0027s recently abandoned her beloved messy bun in favour of a more sleek and formal updo, and today the Duchess of Sussex debuted a new twist on the look.Stepping off the place in Dublin for her first official overseas visit with Harry, Meghan showed off a neat side bun with a side parting.It was a departure from the more severe style she\u0027s worn on several occasions, with hair swept to the back of her head with her hair parted down the middle.  The Duchess wore her hair in a neat updo with a side parting, lending a less severe look to the formal style. She wore her hair in swept back bun with a centre parting to a reception at Marlborough House in London last week Celebrity hairdresser James Johnson told Femail: \u0027The changing of a parting can alter your whole style, instantly.\u0027By keeping the side bun low and opposite, she\u0027s kept the symmetry in her look. This helps keep the over-style elegant, yet with a slight twist, making the hair a focal point.\u0027By keeping the hair balanced Meghans created a formal, more structured style, ideal for any royal appearance.\u0027Switching up the parting can create more dimension for any look, perfect for a plain outfit like Meghan has on here, giving the whole look more personality.   She ditched the messy bun she used to favour, seen here on a visit to Northern Ireland in March (left). But Meghan did mix things up today with a side parting and side bun The Duchess also showed off her prowess at literal dressing, wearing a top and pencil skirt by Givenchy in forest green, in a nod to the colour closely associated with the Emerald Isle.And she carried a £475 tan tote bag by Strathberry, the small Scottish brand whose designs Meghan has previously caused to sell out.This engagement is likely to be of particular interest to the Duchess, who has been outspoken on the topic of female empowerment.It\u0027s been a busy time for the newlyweds who kicked off the week by attending Prince Louis\u0027 christening at St James\u0027s Palace on Monday.Earlier today, they joined fellow members of the royal family for service to mark 100 years of the RAF at Westminster Abbey, followed by a flypast at Buckingham Palace.  Finding her royal feet!

Attorney General Geoffrey CoxYesterday, it was revealed that the Ministry of Justice has already been handed £17million to prepare for a no-deal Brexit.Justice Minister Lucy Frazer revealed that the Treasury had freed up the funds to ensure the MoJ ‘are ready for’ a no deal.The revelation came after a question in the Commons from Tory backbencher William Wragg.Justice Secretary David Gauke yesterday said that leaving the EU without a deal was ‘not an attractive proposition’.But, with time running out ahead of the UK’s departure next year, Mr Gauke said ministers had a duty to accelerate preparations. ‘It is absolutely right that we prepare for no deal,’ he said.Merkel praises May\u0027s \u0027progress\u0027 on Brexit and EU negotiator...May\u0027s fightback reshuffle: Millionaire lawyer who forgot to...Share this article‘We cannot rule out that that is where we will end up for one reason or another.’Mrs May warned MPs on Monday there was a ‘serious risk’ of Britain leaving without a deal if the EU rejects her latest compromise proposals.She added: ‘A responsible Government must prepare for a range of potential outcomes, including the possibility of no deal, and given the short period remaining before the conclusion of negotiations, the Cabinet agreed on Friday that these preparations should be stepped up.‘But at the same, we should recognise that such a disorderly no deal would have profound consequences for both the UK and the EU, and I believe that the UK deserves better.’Privately, Whitehall insiders believe Mrs May will be unable to go much further in offering concessions to the EU.          New Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab, pictured, told his first meeting of the Cabinet that accelerating contingency plans would be one of his first priorities in the new jobOne said: ‘If the EU won’t agree then we have got a very serious problem with the negotiations at that point.’EU leaders have so far given a muted reaction to Mrs May’s Chequers deal, saying they want to hear more detail before passing judgment. But the EU’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier yesterday suggested he was sceptical about Mrs May’s idea of the UK retaining full access to the single market without signing up to all the rules.Speaking at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York, Mr Barnier repeated that the single market and the four freedoms – goods, capital, services and labour – were the ‘the fundamental principles on which the EU is based’ and would be defended.Mr Barnier said 80 per cent of the issues surrounding the UK’s exit had now been resolved.But asked if he was worried other countries might follow Britain’s lead, Mr Barnier said: ‘Once again, I regret profoundly this vote of the UK, we respect it and we implement it.‘But it’s day after day more clear... I can tell you that it will be clear, clear, crystal clear at the end of this negotiation, that the best situation with the best relation with the EU, will remain to be a member of the EU.’Mr Barnier later said Brexit would be ‘costly and unpleasant’ for the UK. He warned the cost of Brexit would be ‘substantially higher for the UK than the EU’.He said that the EU would not accept Mrs May’s proposal for an exception for the financial industry from EU rules. He added: ‘It would go against all our objectives... I don’t know any country in the world that would accept such a loss of sovereignty.’He then half joked: ‘I have no personal experience of orce, it’s always costly and unpleasant’.Angela Merkel yesterday offered Theresa May a slender Brexit lifeline, saying the Chequers proposals would be viewed ‘in the spirit of friendship’.The German Chancellor also did not outright dismiss Mrs May’s idea of the UK retaining full access to the single market without accepting free movement. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/10/22/4E19D84000000578-0-image-m-25_1531257019411.jpg","title":"Where Harry Kanes school cup winners Former classmates watch Englands Captain","story":"    His former teammates admit that as they grew older their priorities switched to job hunting and socialisingEven then, the 15-year-olds were often referred to as the ‘Harry Kane team’ and the players were under instructions to pass the ball to him if in trouble. His former teammates admit that as they grew older their priorities switched to job hunting and socialising. Kane, they said, shunned alcohol and was single-minded in his determination to become a professional footballer.One schoolfriend, Jack Coker, is at least a goalkeeper with semi-pro West Essex in the Essex Senior League but he earns his living as a PE teacher.Dean Ercan, a scaffolder from Chingford, played football with Kane from the age of eight.Share this article    Harry Kane of England national team plays with toy rooster during an England training session ahead of the 2018 FIFA World Cup Russia Semi-Final match against Croatia, on July 10English teacher Denis McElligott was coach of the school team and said Kane was always determined to make the most of his talent.‘He was a little bit stocky but then you would see him after a game out running, losing weight and working on his fitness,’ he said in a previous interview.‘Kids from other schools started to know who he was and know his name.

The firm has encouraged patients in the nearby area to de-register with their own surgery and join the new practice and 20,000 patients signed up in the first six months.But the BMA and the RCGP have accused Babylon of ‘cherry-picking’ the younger, easy-to-treat patients and leaving surgeries with the older, complex patients.          But GP leaders are very concerned about virtual consultations and fear they will miss serious, less obvious symptoms that doctors pick up through their gut instinctsSurgeries – including the one run by Babylon – are paid an average of £150 by the NHS for every patient on their books, so practices whose patients are moving to Babylon stand to lose substantial amounts of money. Last night it emerged that former culture secretary Mr Hancock, who was made Health Secretary in Monday’s mini-reshuffle, received a £5,000 in March 2015 from a donor who is the director of a number of companies working in the health sector. According to Companies House, Gurdev Dadral is director of several firms providing agency nurses and healthcare staff.Mr Hancock, 39, the MP for West Suffolk, who has three young children with his wife Martha, an osteopath, has inherited the hugely contentious social care remit from Jeremy Hunt and is supposed to be publishing a social care green paper this autumn.In a speech in 2012 he backed introducing an insurance system to fund social care. This would allow adults to take out insurance against the possibility of needing to spend many years being looked after in old age, if they develop dementia for example. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/06/12/4DF8E52E00000578-5925061-image-a-57_1530878002508.jpg","title":"Magical moment grandmother aunt learn Titan freed 18 days underground","story":"    As he was plucked from the cave mouth, his tearful grandmother Kong Kantawong, 60, spoke of her sheer relief, saying: ‘I am very happy and excited.

Of the 90 exhibitions that fill the city’s museums and cultural spaces, five core shows have been selected and curated by the photographer Cristina de Middel, best known for her Afronaughts series, a playful reimagining of Zambia’s short-lived 1960s space mission. In Middel’s world, play isn’t a time-wasting, puerile distraction but an essential part of creativity. It is an invitation to stop and think differently. For this show of works by Magnum photographers, Middel and her co-curator Martin Parr searched for the word “players” in the Magnum archive. The resulting images show an unexpected side of the photography agency, bringing up questions about the definition of play and how it pervades everyday life, even in times of hardship.Marking 250 years of the modern circus, this exhibition explores the spectacle and thrill of the art form’s golden age, drawing from the vast collections within the Archive of Modern Conflict. While images of elephants standing on their hind legs and lions jumping through hoops are troubling from a contemporary perspective, they stand as a reminder of how differently joy has been experienced in the past. The show traces the trajectory of the spectacular, from human cannonballs to the nuclear tests in the 1950s. Here, Middel has chosen photographers who play with notions of time, place and scientific reason in unexpected ways. AnaHell’s absurdist series Secret Friends features people in multiple locations around the world, neatly bending their bodies forward to expose their backs. A hastily drawn face and a wig instantly transforms them into comic potato-like caricatures of the everyman.A comprehensive retrospective – and the 2018 PhotoEspaña award – celebrates Nigerian photographer Samuel Fosso’s exploration of identity, gender and colonialism in the African diaspora. The exhibition title references his own extraordinary journey from his childhood in Nigeria via Cameroon to the Central African Republic where he fled as a refugee after losing his parents in the civil war. Still a teenager, he became a photographer’s assistant before going on to run his own portrait studio. Fosso’s sardonic humour shines in his early experimental work and his later stylised recreations of black photo icons.

Purportedly drawn by Christopher Robin himself, the map is littered with spelling errors – “nice for picnicks” and “100 aker wood” – and is captioned “Drawn by Me and Mr Shepard helpd”.The London auction house Sotheby’s had estimated its value at between £100,000 and £150,000.“We’re extremely pleased, obviously,” said Philip Errington, Sotheby’s senior specialist in the book department, who said there had been significant international bidding. “It reflects the fact that people fall in love with the works of AA Milne and EH Shepard. The map is part of the defining world of Winnie-the-Pooh. However you approach Pooh, whether it was through a book or a Disney cartoon, the map is your way in. It is the first thing you encounter. It has a resonance.”Shepard illustrations are not rare at auction, according to Errington, with the first sold by Shepard himself in the 1920s. “They are out there and do well on the market. But the important thing is that this hasn’t been on the market for 50 years. There was particular desirability because it hasn’t been seen for so long,” he said.The previous record for a book illustration was also held by Shepard: Poohsticks Bridge, an ink drawing of Christopher Robin and his bear playing their favourite game, which featured in AA Milne’s book The House at Pooh Corner, was sold by Sotheby’s for £314,500 in 2014. The 1928 drawing had also been held in a private collection, for 40 years. Before that, a 1890s watercolour illustration by Beatrix Potter, the creator of Peter Rabbit, held the record after selling in 2008 for £289,250.This was the third time Shepard’s original map had been sold by Sotheby’s, after it fetched £650 in 1968 and then £1,700 in 1970. “So we look forward to seeing it again in another 50 years,” Errington said.Four other original Winnie-the-Pooh illustrations were also sold at the auction on Tuesday. The five drawings sold for a combined total of £917,500, including buyer’s premium. Experts had estimated the five would sell for £310,000-£440,000.

So how to keep track of what’s down there?Just over a year ago I was sent a photograph of a tunnel-boring machine in a dirt lot in Los Angeles. The caption read: “Elon Musk is about to start digging.”The message was from Wayne Chambliss, a geographer in southern California, who tends to be prescient in such matters – and indeed, Musk’s freshly minted Boring Company soon set its machine loose, ripping through the subsurface soil under the SpaceX headquarters in Hawthorne to create a short tunnel. This pet project – to test a private mass-transit system based on Hyperloop technology that would magnetically propel small pods and cars through LA’s underbelly – has now become a serious challenge to the famously traffic-snarled city’s failure to create viable public transit. The company’s website suggests “roads must go 3D” and Musk has stated “in theory, you could have hundreds of levels of tunnel” as more thoroughfares are required. As so often with Musk’s projects, the company is treating subterranean space as a tabula rasa – or in this case, tubula rasa – to be played in for profit. Indeed, in most major cities, just as you can’t expect commercial planes to stop flying over your house through aerial highways, you also can’t prevent public transport routes being dug out underneath it. Outside Melbourne, Australia, for example, the government is currently preparing to bore underneath 260 properties – including more than 100 homes – to build a road tunnel. Homeowners received a letter explaining that their “sub-stratum” land was being sequestered – without compensation. In London, a city with 150 years of trenching, digging and boring to its name, the chaos is reaching new depths. According to Newcastle University’s Global Urban Research Unit, more than 4,600 basements have been granted planning permission in the last decade – in just seven of London’s 32 boroughs. The space under London is now getting so busy that the Ordnance Survey, Future Cities Catapult and the British Geological Survey have joined forces to create a new initiative called Project Iceberg, which will attempt to aggregate cities’ subterranean data. In London it will include transport tunnel information, geological records and maps of 1.5m km (0.9m miles) of underground utilities and four million kilometres of telecommunications lines.Los Angeles does not have the same degree of vertical complication as a much older city like London, and the city council seems to be tentatively backing Musk’s new private transit tunnels. But Musk’s vision of underground dominance presents us with another thorny problem: what complications arise from passing the underground into the hands of private industry? And should the state be allowed to cede subterranean land to a billionaire to build a private transport system?Historically, the foundation of property law in the US and UK was enshrined in the Latin phrase “Cuius est solum, eius est usque ad coelum et ad inferos” – which roughly translates as: “Whoever owns the soil, holds title up to the heavens and down to the depths of hell.”Subterranean scholar Dr Marilu Melo of the University of Sydney explains that not all countries behave this way. In Mexico, for example, “property rights are effectively superficial, they do not extend volumetrically into the earth,” she says.Even in places that have traditionally been ardent defenders of private property, however, once human beings took to the air and started tunnelling underground, the old heaven to hell ideal began to require caveats. In Australia, although pre-1891 land titles went “to the centre of the Earth”, those issued after 1891 extend down just 15 metres (49 feet). The new Melbourne tunnels will edge right up to this legal vertical limit.“Land prices tend to force private construction downwards, especially where there are planning limits on upward expansion,” says the Ordnance Survey’s Rollo Home.There has been a growing concern in London over “iceberg architecture”, where the volume of subterranean expansions can quickly eclipse the “host” architecture in size. The Newcastle researchers separate the London basements it studied into what sounds like fast-food drink sizes: “standard”, “large” and “mega”. In the “mega” category, they found that on average owners pulled almost 1,700 cubic metres of dirt from under their houses. Many of the basements contained cinemas, gymnasiums, pools, wine cellars and panic rooms. One even included plans for a subterranean beach with an accompanying waterfall. Kensington and Chelsea and Westminster councils have now taken steps to curb the maximum depth of such projects. The Ordnance Survey has suggested that £5.5bn ($7bn) is spent every year on exploratory excavation just to figure out what’s underground, and according to a 2013 Mayor of London report, £150m of damage is done every year to underground utilities because of a lack of information. Underground urban planning of an extension of a tube line, for instance, requires knowledge of where sewer and water systems, electricity and utility tunnels, bunkers, foundations, basements, cellars, vaults, passageways, archaeological remains, data centres, basements, and other transport tunnels are located. Most cities have a “dial before you dig” hotline because there is no central holding place for data about underground space. Enter Project Iceberg. The goal is to serve as a repository for data on all of these underground elements, from which a comprehensive visualisation can be built. The resulting map would need to be an all-inclusive spatial database, but how volumetric cartography might look is not yet imagined. It could perhaps be something like Bruno Imbrizi’s real-time 3D tube map that went viral in 2013. Or the framework could feed an augmented reality engine, so that aiming a phone camera at the ground would reveal what is underneath. Singapore, Helsinki and Hong Kong are model cities for developing underground masterplans – and it is no coincidence that tightly controlled and regulated cities hold better data in this regard. Private developers digging and burrowing into cities like Los Angeles and London make this immensely more complicated – as does the need for secrecy on many underground projects. The underground is, after all, where we hide things. When Westminster tube station was built, much of it had to be “planned by omission”, a guide told me. Engineers would submit plans and the government would send them back with suggestions for different routes – refusing to explain why. Land registry data later confirmed what anti-secrecy journalists like Duncan Campbell had suspected all along: the existence of a network of covert tunnels connecting government buildings in Westminster. The government, in short, wasted loads of public money denying the existence of something that it had secretly spent a great deal of public money building in the first place. Further clandestine excavations spring to mind: tunnels under borders used to smuggle people and contraband shipping containers stockpiled with food buried in the wee hours by doomsday preppers. Given London’s history of furtive diggers – like William Lyttle, the Mole Man of Hackney, who burrowed under his house for 40 years – it doesn’t seem a stretch to imagine a TfL boring machine punching through the side of a fallout shelter dug without permission. Although it is an open project, Iceberg researchers have suggested creating a hidden vault layer in the 3D map, where secret data could be locked away from general view. Yet as was clear in the Westminster example, the absence of data is data in a comprehensive archive. Given this, both governments and criminals who wish to keep their underground infrastructure under wraps may find it difficult to do so in the coming age of volumetric transparency. We have little virtual privacy left within decades, all spatial privacy may evaporate, too.The US government has been trying to map the subsurface of the Earth from outer space, by measuring differences in the gravity field at the Earth’s surface. An Air Force project undertaken more than 20 years ago on a tunnel in Texas was able to capture “reasonably accurate readings of the tunnel’s size, shape, variable depth, and orientation”, as Chambliss told attendees of the recent annual American Association of Geographers conference in New Orleans. This could soon enable a planetary-scale survey of the underground, revealing new tunnels, bunkers, silos, and compounds. His recommendation to the assembled geographers: “Dig now.”Many are. In Sweden, which already has 65,000 known shelters for a population of just under 10 million people, the government has begun building new bunkers. Seoul in South Korea has more than 3,000 large public shelters. In the plains of Kansas, I recently visited two cold war-era Atlas intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) silos being redeveloped into “Survival Condos for the wealthy. Meanwhile, the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (Darpa) is currently funding a “subterranean challenge”, soliciting bids for techniques to enhance “situational awareness” of global underground spaces, with a $2m prize. The challenge is to create machines that can make their way through tunnel systems, urban undergrounds and natural caves. Robots will need to climb, crawl, squeeze and sense their way through these environments, with an eye towards future use in dangerous or hostile underground environments that human bodies can’t access. These robots will effectively become our subterranean avatars, and their deployment will mean that there really is nowhere left to hide.“If we are to take control of the subsurface, we need to have an holistic view of the subsurface,” says Home. But who is to wield that control? For almost 200 years – since Marc Brunel’s invention of the tunnelling shield, which protects workers as they inch forward during excavation – human beings have almost exclusively excavated using money from the public purse. Only two years ago, for example, more than £9bn of public money was used in Switzerland to tunnel 35 miles through the Alps, down to depths of almost 2.4km.Underground has long been a space of public investment, communal infrastructure, exploration and, when required, secret assembly. In many ways subterranean environs have been more democratic than the surface of the Earth, as depicted in Gabriel Tarde’s 1896 utopian novel The Underground Man, in which in which people not only survive but thrive after a “fortunate disaster” forces human kind to burrow. But as we rush to render our underground world in three dimensions, increasingly it appears we are backing – tacitly or otherwise – private ownership and comprehensive surveillance. The mayor of Chicago, Rahm Emanuel, has just handed Musk’s Boring Company a contract to build a Hyperloop to shuttle people from O’Hare International Airport to the city centre. Although Musk’s company will build the tunnel, the city will own it and lease it back to Musk for use, and Musk has also stated that (unlike in Melbourne) no land will be seized to build it. Both sound like good caveats, but neither dilute the fact that this will be a private, for-profit, transport system – not public transport.Just like our drone-filled skies, the undergrounds of the future appear to be just another territory for the rich and powerful to colonise the rich and powerful , a process that may replicate and compound the inequalities of the present. This may be cause enough to throw a wrench into Musk’s tunnel-boring machines. Metaphorically speaking, of course.Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, or explore our archive"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ddaa7ee379b24633e7dbc375b8454e7852265a44/0_128_3840_2304/master/3840.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eb15f4fd726e2ee82c24d224c45e8b23","title":"brett kavanaugh nomination victory originalists","story":"Donald Trump’s court pick belongs to a group of conservative legal thinkers who believe in a strict, textual interpretation of the constitution. That’s troublingEd Meese was the cherry on top.The 86-year-old former attorney general was one of the first dignitaries Donald Trump trotted out at his carefully orchestrated, prime-time roll-out of Brett Kavanaugh’s nomination to the US supreme court. Meese, Ronald Reagan’s right-hand man from California, is the godfather of “original intent”, the crackpot, rightwing legal theory that will, if Kavanaugh is confirmed, be enshrined for decades to come. For the first time since Reagan began stacking the court with originalists like the late justice Antonin Scalia, they will, if Kavanaugh is confirmed, have a solid, unbending court majority. Kavanaugh’s nomination, no surprise, is a huge victory for the originalists, conservative legal thinkers who believe in a strict, textual interpretation of the constitution. They believe in adhering to the intent of framers of the constitution, white men whose outlook reflected 18th-century realities and whose thinking the originalists believe they have a unique ability to ine.Various mainstream legal scholars, including Harvard’s Cass Sunstein, have shredded the originalist approach, showing how so-called strict construction of the constitution can be used to justify horrifying, retrograde acts like banning contraceptives, discrimination against women and blacks and to nullify environmental protections. Originalism animates Kavanaugh’s legal career and infuses his 300 legal opinions. It isn’t conservative or principled, as Kavanaugh’s champions argue. It’s radical and retrograde. That’s why rightwing nuts like Sean Hannity, who was reported to have preferred another candidate, Amy Coney Barrett, were doing cartwheels for Kavanugh after Trump’s announcement.Originalists often turn out to be hypocrites. They pose as conservative defenders of the constitution and then move in wild, new directions. That was manifest when Kenneth Starr, Kavanaugh’s old boss, overreached and tried to impeach former president Bill Clinton over a lurid affair with a White House intern.  In poring over Kavanaugh’s record, more needs to be known about where he stood on former president George W Bush’s radical, post-911 restrictions on civil liberties, the cornerstone of the constitution. How did this young originalist justify overzealous policies like torture and rendition when he was Bush’s staff secretary? Surely, the framers were frowning. Of course, originalists are especially untrustworthy when it comes to women’s rights, since the framers were noticeably silent in granting distaff power. There have been glowing accounts of Kavanugh’s clerkship for Justice Anthony Kennedy, but little said about his sojourn in the chambers of Judge Alex Kozinski of California, whose rampant sexual harassment of women forced his abrupt retirement last year. Roe v Wade is anathema to most originalists. Expected staunch opposition from women’s groups and possible defections from Republican senators like Lisa Murkowski and Susan Collins help explain Monday night’s White House paeans to Kavanugh’s mother, wife, daughters and the women’s basketball team he coaches. According to Adam Liptak, the always-wise New York Times correspondent who covers the court, Kavanaugh “has written countless decisions applauded by conservatives on topics including the second amendment, religious freedom, the campaign finance. But they have particularly welcomed his vigorous opinions hostile to administrative agencies, a central concern of the modern conservative legal movement.” A dissent that surely must have comforted Trump as he reportedly tossed and turned over who to pick was one in which Kavanaugh attacked the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and promoted the notion of an all-powerful presidency.“To prevent tyranny and protect inidual liberty, the framers of the constitution separated the legislative, executive and judicial powers of the new national government,” Kavanaugh wrote. “To further safeguard liberty, the framers insisted upon accountability for the exercise of executive power. The framers lodged full responsibility for the executive power in a president of the United States, who is elected by and accountable to the people.” Another source of comfort was surely that Kavanaugh, departing from his past work for Starr, amended his views in a 2009 article and decided presidents should not be distracted from doing their jobs by pesky legal prosecutions.From the get-go, I figured Kavanaugh would be Trump’s pick. His perfect macho looks, his perfect academic pedigrees, his full backing from the Federalist Society all lined up. Best of all, he once mouthed the word bitch as he looked at Hillary Clinton on TV, according to David Brock.For Trump, that certainly must have been the cherry on top."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0afc1a67f40ba302e3dd3a58ed58c366b894efbf/0_294_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e22d2d333e4d3847997c415af9c7c1f1","title":"eu europe theresa may brexit red lines ministers","story":"The EU’s initial reaction to the Chequers plan is polite, but negative.

Many EU ministers despised Johnson, viewing him as a self-obsessed showman whose dishonesty had helped to deliver Brexit.The EU has long considered Theresa May’s key Brexit official, Olly Robbins, as her main representative – Davis had spent only four hours with Barnier since the start of this year. The commission had become increasingly frustrated with May’s inability to define a UK plan and to take on the hard-Brexit ministers. Now the Chequers agreement and the cabinet resignations show that she has found some mettle.This has boosted her credibility with the EU, which is fortunate, because its initial reaction to the Chequers plan, though polite, is negative. It views the “facilitated customs arrangement” (FCA) – the complex, hi-tech scheme for the UK to collect customs dues on behalf of the EU – as unworkable. It would have helped if May had spelt out what must be her intention, which is to keep the UK in a customs union until the FCA works (if it ever does). More importantly, the EU dislikes the idea of the British staying in the single market for goods, even though they would be “rule-takers” – signing up not only to current rules but also to future laws, without having a vote on them.May’s point is that the single market for goods would – if combined with satisfactory customs and VAT arrangements – obviate the need for checks on the intra-Irish border, as well as avoid disruption of manufacturing supply chains. Service companies would have to cope with poorer access to EU markets, but she thinks the UK financial services industry is too big and important to be a rule-taker. May is probably right to believe that her plan is the least-bad model for the UK economy that might work politically.But she will struggle to persuade the EU to grant free movement of goods without the UK also signing up to the remaining “four freedoms” – of services, capital and labour. EU leaders consider the four freedoms inisible: if the UK could “cherrypick” parts of the single market without accepting free movement of people, other states, inside or outside the EU, could ask for similar deals. And that would undermine the strength and cohesion of the EU’s institutions.Johnson\u0026nbspsays in a long-awaited statement\u0026nbspthat \u0027after a huge amount of heartache\u0027 he will​ back the leave campaign. In January, David Cameron had announced ministers could campaign on either side, and despite being a backbencher, Johnson\u0027s view was seen as influential.Johnson campaigns around the UK, posing with the now infamous bus saying leaving the EU would provide the NHS with an extra £350m a week – a\u0026nbspclaim later condemned\u0026nbspas a misuse of statistics.After Cameron quits, Johnson\u0026nbspannounces he will contest\u0026nbspthe Conservative leadership, pitching himself as a unifier. In a surprise twist, Michael Gove\u0026nbspsays he will also stand, warning that Johnson cannot provide the leadership needed. This\u0026nbspprompts Johnson\u0026nbspto use the launch of his leadership bid to say he will no longer stand.Theresa May, who took over the leadership unopposed, appoints Johnson as foreign secretary.Labour MPs call for Johnson to step down after\u0026nbsphe wrongly states that\u0026nbspNazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, who was jailed in Iran, was \u0027teaching people journalism\u0027 – something both her family and her employer said was untrue, and was used by Iranian officials to justify her detention.Johnson is among 29 ministers who discuss May’s plan for Brexit at Chequers. He\u0026nbspagrees to her proposals, though it is later reported he had initial doubts.After vanishing for several hours,\u0026nbspJohnson resigns.\u0026nbspThe EU worries that the UK is asking for something close to the Swiss model. Switzerland is in the single market for goods, but not services – which Brussels dislikes because the European court of justice cannot enforce the rulebook on the Swiss.Commission officials add that these days, goods and services cannot be disentangled much of the value of a good comes from related services (such as the design, marketing and financing of a car). And if the UK were free to undercut EU standards on services, it could distort the level playing field for goods. But the Chequers plan seeks to meet concerns about the playing field by promising to maintain EU social, environmental and consumer standards and to respect its state aid rules.Some continental companies, such as those making cars and aeroplanes, are more open to the UK plan than the commission. So are some governments, including those in central Europe that fear the geostrategic consequences of a Europe weakened by a hard Brexit. Yet so far there is little evidence of Britain’s friends seeking to soften the hard line set by the commission and many member states. Indeed in the commission and in Paris some officials say that they are relaxed about the prospect of a no-deal Brexit, believing the costs acceptable.May’s strongest argument is that only her plan can ensure there is no hard border between the two parts of Ireland. The commission’s line is that a Canada-style free trade agreement for the UK, combined with Northern Ireland staying in a customs and regulatory union with the EU, would deliver the same outcome. But May and many other British politicians believe that that scheme, involving checks on goods crossing the Irish Sea, would challenge the UK’s constitutional integrity.Barnier says that if the UK’s red lines alter, the EU’s offer could change. But May would have to make substantial concessions before the Chequers plan became viable. She would need to commit to a customs union until some hi-tech alternative became viable. That would mean a stringent mechanism for following new EU rules and a significant role for the European court.May has indicated flexibility on all three points. But she would find it harder to cede on payments to the EU and free movement of labour (both of which Norway and Switzerland accept as the price for market access). There are probably ways of fudging the money issue, but free movement will be much harder. The EU shows no signs of wanting to restrict free movement of workers within its single market.And May’s dilemma is that the paler her red lines become, the greater the risk of losing more ministers.• Charles Grant is director of the Centre for European Reform"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0af18644225f1acb8923b110408d1a884c399c0c/0_91_4892_2935/master/4892.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0deebf057d075d1fab9c31d9a067b06e","title":"the guardian view on the nato summit europe must come together","story":"James Comey, the former FBI director, said of Donald Trump that he bore more resemblance to a mob boss than a democratic politician. In Mr Comey’s experience Mr Trump was a leader who demanded loyalty oaths, wanted absolute control, traded in lies and insisted on an us-versus-them worldview. Unfortunately these traits\u0026nbspwill undoubtedly be on display when the US president arrives at the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation summit in Brussels tomorrow.It is these kinds of actions that make Mr Trump so dangerous. The Nato alliance has helped mould the modern world and ushered in a democratic, liberal world order characterised by open trade and open societies, which after the collapse of the Soviet Union needed only to be lightly defended. This in turn contributed greatly to American peace and prosperity. A perception that the burdens are unequally shared is not new. It is almost as old as the alliance itself. Barack Obama worried that other nations did not act for themselves, waiting instead for Washington to lead. Mr Obama could be criticised for sermonising, but he was being straight. He saw that the defence of the multilateral rules-based order against jihadist terror, Russian adventurism and Chinese intimidation was essential. But it required other nations to shoulder their responsibilities. This seems fair. By contrast Mr Trump wrongly sees the US being disadvantaged, not advantaged, by the current global order. His tactics are to tear down this order rather than build it up.Nato’s top brass will have their work cut out. The US president prefers the argument of power to the power of argument. He thinks little of humiliating allies over the Iran nuclear deal or snubbing them over the Paris climate change pact or infuriating them with tariffs. This could lead to anarchy, as nations conclude that they are freer to act with impunity. With rising powers such as China, it might end in confrontation. The US president’s description of Nato as being “as bad as Nafta” at the last G7 summit is not a good sign. The twin pillars of Europe’s place in the world are law-based global order and the transatlantic alliance. Mr Trump will find to his cost that Europeans cannot choose between them. Order cannot be imposed it needs to be accepted. Mr Trump likes to think of politics as business, but he won’t strike good, lasting deals with allies – and enemies – without rules that everyone plays by."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d2042a72150777214222c1b7cb11b47d325427b8/0_272_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f4acb585d4b3e5ab0e4c15b9f79aa379","title":"mps want new watchdog to monitor misconduct by researchers","story":"Proposed body would monitor universities to ensure that allegations of malpractice are properly investigatedA national watchdog that has the power to punish British universities for failing to tackle research misconduct is needed to ensure that sloppy practices and outright fraud are caught and dealt with fast, MPs say.The new body would rule on whether universities have properly investigated allegations of malpractice and have the authority to recommend research funds be withdrawn or even reclaimed when it finds that inquiries into alleged wrongdoing have fallen short.While serious research fraud is thought to be rare in British universities, a quarter of institutions fail to report cases of potential malpractice, according a survey by the Commons science and technology committee which urged ministers to set up the new watchdog in a report on research integrity published Wednesday.Under a 2013 concordat, UK universities are supposed to publish annual reports that list all their investigations into alleged malpractice that year. But even though compliance with the concordat is a prerequisite for receiving funds from UK funding councils, “meaningful sanctions have never been deployed,” the report states.“This has to be taken far more seriously,” said Norman Lamb, chair of the committee. “Institutions with track records have been destroyed by scandals and crises. The danger is that something comes along out of the blue that completely undermines public trust.”One recent case of misconduct centred on Paulo Macchiarini, a visiting professor at the prestigious Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, who was hailed as a pioneer in regenerative medicine for transplanting the world’s first synthetic windpipes into patients between 2011 and 2013. But he was later dismissed for scientific and clinical misconduct when it emerged he had exaggerated the success of the work. All but one of his patients have since died. The scandal led to a flurry of resignations, including that of Anders Hamsten, the institute’s vice chancellor.Twenty universities told the MPs that they had not investigated any cases of misconduct since they signed the UK’s research integrity concordat year ago. But Lamb said that was troubling given the pressure researchers are under to cut corners and publish what appear to be impressive results. “At the very least it raises concerns when universities report zero investigations year after year, particularly when they do a lot of research. It’s not really credible to imagine nothing ever goes wrong,” he said.Other institutions, including the University of South Wales, the University of Bedfordshire, Middlesex University and Birkbeck University in London said they did not publish reports on malpractice cases because of confidentiality issues. The Master of Birkbeck, Professor David Latchman, has been investigated for research misconduct himself several times. The latest formal investigation at University College London accused him of “recklessness” for allowing research fraud to happen on his watch at UCL’s Institute of Child Health. He was investigated after a whistleblower alleged malpractice in dozens of research papers published by his group.The MPs’ report calls for the UK’s research integrity concordat to be strengthened so that annual reporting becomes the norm, whistleblowers are better protected, and that investigations are transparent and robust. For the most serious cases, independent experts should be appointed to investigation panels to ensure universities are not tempted to cover up wrongdoing. The watchdog, or ‘national research integrity committee’, would mirror a system already in place in Canada and be run by UK Research and Innovation (UKRI), the government’s main research funding body.“We’re asking the sector and the UKRI to take the lead on this by establishing this committee to head off demands for statutory regulations which will inevitably follow when there’s a scandal which, as sure as night follows day, there will be at some stage,” Lamb said.A UKRI spokesman said the funder would give “careful consideration” to the report’s recommendations.“Creating a strong and responsible culture is crucial to enable the best research and innovation and to gain and maintain public trust,” he said. “We are committed to working with stakeholders, both in the UK and internationally, to use our position as the UK’s largest public sector funder of research and innovation to lead positive behavioural change.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/05e7a70751c5c32f6594512060c0dbc538bf5e67/0_438_6570_3942/master/6570.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6cbb30d68068d3613209e976ab1357cc","title":"schools miss out in rush to set up academies mps find","story":"Highly critical report says DfE has not learned lessons from high-profile failuresA rush to set up academies is leaving hundreds of schools ignored by inspectors amid mounting costs for the taxpayer, parliament’s spending watchdog has found.The public accounts committee has concluded that escalating problems in the sector have left civil servants scrambling to change how they examine prospective academies’ financial viability and sponsors’ ability. In a highly critical report released on Wednesday, MPs said they were worried that the Department for Education has not yet learned the lessons from high-profile academy failures that have been damaging children’s education.It followed an analysis by the National Audit Office in May that showed more than 1,600 schools had not been inspected for six years or more and, of those, almost 300 had not seen an Ofsted inspector for at least 10 years.Operators of dozens of academies have declared that they are struggling during this academic year. Meg Hillier, the chair of the committee, said the government’s haste in pushing ahead with academisation has come at a high cost. “The DfE … must strengthen scrutiny of prospective academies and sponsors. Costs associated with conversion can reduce funding available to local authorities to support remaining maintained schools. Academisation can also undermine councils’ ability to provide school places. “Oversight of the sector has become confusingly complex, which can place unnecessary burdens on schools and risks weakening decisions in the conversion process,” she said. Converting local authority schools into academies is a central plan of the government’s education policy, with all schools since 2010 allowed to apply for academy status with more freedom over areas such as the curriculum and staff pay.By January, 6,996 schools had become academies and converting them has cost the DfE £745m since 201011.The report said the department’s policy for converting schools to academies is unclear, adding that the full cost of conversion is also unclear, while the department has not learned lessons from high-profile academy failures.“The one-off costs to the Department for Education of converting schools to academies have been £745m since 2010-11, but the full cost of conversion, including spending by schools and local authorities, is unclear. We are concerned, however, that the department is failing to give a clear sense of direction for maintained schools, academies, local authorities, pupils and parents,” the report said. Reacting to the report, Geoff Barton, a former secondary school head teacher who now leads the Association of School and College Leaders, said the government had failed to provide sufficient safeguards and a coherent strategy in overseeing the biggest structural change in the history of the state education system.“This has resulted not only in high-profile failures but a fragmented system in which oversight, as the PAC points out, is confusingly complex and burdensome, and schools are left in limbo because of a shortage of sponsors in some areas.“Despite these circumstances, however, there are very many good academies across the country working tirelessly to give their students the very best education possible, and we need to be careful that the discourse about academies doesn’t become corrosive,” he said.A Department for Education spokesman insisted that academies are raising standards. “Converting to become an academy is a positive choice made by hundreds of schools every year to give great leaders the freedom to focus on what is best for pupils. The number that have failed to meet those standards represents a tiny fraction of the academies sector – a stark contrast to the previous local authority-led system. “We always act quickly to tackle under-performance, taking action to support head teachers and build the capability of trusts to drive further improvements in our schools.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0ff48d01b27fd5d872a53b5cf5c262116d467d90/0_0_1190_793/master/1190.jpg?w=720\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2ca4c3a32b306ea9eb1fb6ed2937d5ea 720w","title":"high fashion cycling sunglasses kim kardashian princess anne bella hadid performance shades","story":"Cycling’s sartorial reinvention is nothing new. Brands such as Rapha, CHPT3, Pas Normal Studios, Isadore and MAAP have offered style-conscious cyclists an alternative to poorly fitted fluro gear for a decade. The fashion world has paid attention too, with Moschino taking cycling style to the catwalk in 2015, and caps becoming essential wear for Williamsburg’s hipsters. But recently, a specific piece of cycling apparel has become co-opted by the fashion crowd: sunglasses.At men’s fashion week last month in Paris, Bella Hadid, Rita Ora and Kim Kardashian were spotted in high-end performance sunglasses: Hadid in Heron Preston x Nike Visions, Ora in Oakley Jawbreakers (as worn by Mark Cavendish) and Kardashian in Alpinas. Vetements – one of the most influential brands in the world – put them on models on the catwalk. Stella McCartney makes Turbo Wrap sunglasses that would be at home on Mont Ventoux. American Vogue has even started running editorials on them.“It’s bizarre,” says cycling journalist Stuart Clapp, who edits Rouleur’s apparel section. “Princess Anne wore some to the royal wedding. It’s like a 90s throwback thing. In cycling terms, you wear cycling sunglasses when you’re on the bike, but no one wants to wear them off it. Not even when you’re in\u0026nbspthe cafe.”But perhaps it’s not that strange. Brands such as Off-White have been designing cycling shorts for a while and, as the ’s fashion editor Hannah Marriott tells me, “they go with the ironic ugly trainer vibe permeating fashion. They’ve never really been fashionable before so they make early adopters feel a bit clever on Instagram.”Cycling sunglasses have had some distinct eras. In the early pre-war years, riders would don the kind of goggles you would expect to see in a cockpit rather than in the peloton. In the 50s and 60s, innovators such as Fausto Coppi and Britain’s most stylish cyclist, Tom Simpson, began wearing aviators. But it was the 80s and the introduction of Oakley that broke the mould.The story goes that when American pro-cyclist Greg LeMond wanted a pair of performance glasses, Oakley, until then mostly known as a motocross brand, delivered the Factory Pilots: huge yet minimalist wraparound glasses, which provided protection from flies and grit flicked up from the road, as well as the sun. Their ungainly aesthetic caused ripples of laughter in the peloton at first, but became must-haves among pros soon after.In the 90s, Oakley’s dominance was challenged by Briko’s extreme big-and-bold styles, worn by the late, great Italian Marco Pantani.It is exactly these large styles that are being embraced by the fashion crowd now: the Alba Optics I try out engulf your entire field of vision.They are most in demand with cyclists who want to make a statement, according to Clapp. “Cycling had that thing with the statement socks,” he says. “You had\u0026nbspto have really lairy socks. Now\u0026nbspit’s all about wearing sunglasses\u0026nbspand them being outrageous.” No wonder fashion’s front row are road-testing them."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4b7ad8985bb32aee29cfde45ed590d591b9f6f02/0_195_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e52255ebf059930548961f6933ba2958","title":"croatia world cup semi finals masters improvisation england","story":"As Zlatko Dalic’s side face England in the World Cup last four with no system for developing players at home, is it chaos that makes them good footballers?As Croatia won the coin toss before the penalty shootout against Russia in the World Cup quarter-final, Luka Modric, their captain, shouted across the pitch to his goalkeeper, Danijel Subasic: “Are we gonna go first?”Giving Subasic the chance to save a penalty first could conceivably have handed Croatia an edge. But that is not the point here. The point is that they got all that way, to a quarter-final of a World Cup, and to a second consecutive shootout without a plan.These players got to the defining moment of their international careers without knowing what to do in that situation. Compared with England’s thorough preparation for their shootout against Colombia, Croatia’s seems a joke.“Penalties are always a lottery you never know what will happen,” the Croatia manager, Zlatko Dalic, said after the win against Denmark. “The day before, we shot two series of them, although it wasn’t my intention to practise penalties because we always expect to solve everything within 90 minutes.”In some countries the manager might be criticised or even mocked for that kind of approach but in Croatia few seemed to care. “We went through, everything is great,” Subasic said, summing up the general mood before adding the old “lottery” shtick himself. And of course he got away with it, because that is the culture – no one should question you as long as you are winning those who do are denounced for “ruining the atmosphere”.But it was also symptomatic of a more general decision-making and preparation process in Croatian football. There is no long-term or medium-term plan, no blueprint, no established system. Croatians are masters of improvisation.People often ask how it is possible for a nation of only four million to produce so many class footballers. A proper answer, apart from the esoteric clichés of natural predeterminism or genetic predisposition, has never been offered by anyone. Sure, there are some good youth coaches – obviously, given all the talent developed in recent years – but there is no general programme in place that systematically educates or distributes young players across the country. Very few new stadiums have been built or properly renovated in the past three decades and the same goes for training grounds. The facilities almost everywhere are basic, at best a lot of pitches are awful, the clubs struggling to make ends meet.For years Croatia’s youth national teams depended heavily on the output of one club’s programme. Lavishly funded by the city, the Dinamo Zagreb academy could afford to have the best (and the most) coaches and broaden its catchment area throughout the country, and beyond. Thanks to Dinamo’s massive influence in the Croatian football federation, their youngsters have been almost automatically called up for Croatia – at one point two years ago, the under-17 team had 11 out of 11 players from Dinamo in their starting lineup – and only recently has their monopoly started to be broken up. Other clubs are slowly catching up, particularly Dinamo’s arch rivals, Hajduk Split, who are revamping their academy.Dinamo have also had Lokomotiva – their feeder club to all intents and purposes – allowed to play in the top ision against all competitive logic. Six players from the current World Cup squad have played at Lokomotiva at some point, gaining valuable first-team experience at top national club level after graduating from the academy.Still, there is no system, no plan. Dinamo have for years manically fired and hired coaches, changing their approach to youth development almost every time and Croatia did the same. Dinamo have sacked their head coach 17 times in the past 13 years – during which time they have won 12 league titles. The last three Croatia managers who lost their jobs – Igor Stimac, Niko Kovac and Ante Cacic – did so just before decisive matches in qualifying.The current incumbent, Dalic, was appointed only 48 hours before the final group game in Ukraine, which Croatia had to win in order to reach the play-offs. He met his players at Zagreb airport before flying to Kiev.All this time the federation’s investment in infrastructure and grassroots football has been down to a bare minimum, their vision non-existent. A couple of years ago they commissioned Romeo Jozak, their technical director at the time, to put together a long-term plan for the development of Croatian football, very much like what Michel Sablon has done for Belgium. Jozak was fired weeks before presenting his plan.Strategy, logic and order play little part in Croatian football. And some would suggest that ethos – or lack of it – translates to the pitch as well. How else can you explain that a team with some of the best midfielders at this tournament is refusing to take control of the midfield in matches?Against Russia, Croatia played 109 long balls and, although they were clearly the better team, made things hard for themselves by not playing to their strengths. Consequently they had to rely on another “lottery” to progress.Could it be, however, that these cheeky and resourceful Croatians, in fact thrive on chaos and lack of organisation? Being used to improvisation from a young age, maybe they have accepted it as part of their mentality and now cannot succeed in any other way as a group? It is a tempting theory – although, of course, maybe they were just plain lucky."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/271f90b7eb5b63abe18839d825dac3982a2c5037/0_71_4719_2833/master/4719.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0828920b66f3e728914b69d06aa5866d","title":"england excited nervous world cup semi final croatia moscow","story":"Much has been said about this new England side but, if they can beat Croatia on Wednesday to reach the World Cup final, they would probably take even that in their strideThe last time England had this kind of rare opportunity Bobby Robson was being driven to the point of distraction by the footballer whom Gianni Agnelli, the president of Juventus, described during that run to the 1990 World Cup semi-finals as “a dog of war with the face of a child”.Paul Gascoigne had, among other episodes, contributed to Bryan Robson’s absence because of a drunken prank in which a bed landed on the captain’s toe (achilles trouble, was the official line). Gascoigne broke curfews as a habit, spooked Bobby Robson into thinking he had fallen off a balcony and come to an arrangement with the hotel barman that, when he ordered a milkshake, it was in fact Baileys.But most of all he had played football beautifully. “You do realise you’ll be playing against the best midfielder in the world?” his manager asked him before that famous night in Turin. “No,” Gazza replied, “he is.” Then the game started and he made a point of nutmegging Lothar Matthäus, captain of West Germany.Did you see Dele Alli this week reminiscing about the time he did the same to Luka Modric? Perhaps you thought he sounded a little overconfident to be talking of such a thing. But it was actually quite reassuring, from an English perspective, to be in Alli’s company and see, close-up, how confident he was at a time when this bunch of players, more than ever, need to show they have moved on since the days when Fabio Capello said the England shirt “weighed heavily” on their shoulders.Already that process is well under way and Gareth Southgate gives the impression he has freed himself of some of his own demons. One story he told after his team’s arrival in Moscow related to how, for more than 20 years, he could barely bring himself to listen to Three Lions because it brought back painful memories of his missed penalty in the Euro 96 semi-final. “I would just walk out of the room,” he said. “It is an anthem and it has followed the team for a long time but that has involved some difficult moments as well.”Two more wins for England and Southgate might even catch himself humming a tune he used to hate. And, once again, it was remarkable how relaxed everyone inside the England camp appeared to be. For those of us who have travelled with this team around Russia from day one, and not detected even a flicker of apprehension, it has been like that since the start. Heck, they even began their latest training session with a game of catch, using a rubber chicken rather than a ball. “A bit of fun to get them moving,” Southgate explained.The serious business takes place in the Luzhniki Stadium on Wednesday to find out whether his players will be returning to Moscow on Sunday for the day of their lives.Yet Southgate is correct when he says it would come as a surprise if the sense of occasion got to any of his players. Harry Kane, for one, gives the impression he is immune to stagefright when there are glories to be had and a Golden Boot glistening in the distance. Kieran Trippier is one of the players of the tournament. Alli is not faking it when he says he has never felt nervous before any football match in his life. And that is just the Spurs boys. Alli’s take – “excited, not nervous” – summed it up neatly.Nor did Southgate seem in the slightest bit uptight as he told a story, with more of that self‑deprecating humour, about what he makes of superstitions in football. “I’ll tell you a story about me and superstitions. When I was managing Middlesbrough we had a game at Reading and I was under a bit of pressure. I’d forgotten my socks so I went to the kit man and I borrowed a pair of black goalkeeping socks. When we won the staff made this big thing about my ‘lucky socks’, saying I had to wear them next game. I thought: ‘Hmm, shall I wear those socks? No, it’s ridiculous.’ Well, we lost the next game. Then, on the Tuesday, we were playing again and I thought: ‘Well, I’d better put the socks on’ and we won 2-0.”Brilliant! So did he still wear these lucky socks? Southgate had not finished his story. “Then I went upstairs and got sacked. So really, from that moment, superstitions have rather gone out the window.” Classic Gareth.To put the Croatia story into context, the entire population of their country (4m) is a third of that of the city in which the game will be played. England have suffered before, of course, because of Luka Modric’s expertise on the ball. Indeed, before the ordeal against Iceland at Euro 2016 the most harrowing England game of the 21st century was arguably against Croatia, with Steve McClaren watching beneath an umbrella as his team lost 3-2 and failed to qualify for Euro 2008. The pitch that night was soaked and rutted but Modric passed the ball as though he was playing on a bowling green. He has done likewise for the past decade and part of the battle for England, inevitably, will be to subdue the Real Madrid player.‘Equally we’re looking at how we can hurt them,” Southgate countered. “What are the areas we can exploit? Bloody hell, we played Nuneaton Borough in the cup once and thought their centre‑forward was Eusébio because we’d built him up that much in the pre‑match briefing. You can overdo the information for players. The lads know these players but we have good defensive organisation. We don’t have to shift from what we’ve been doing.”He sounded like a man who fully believed in his own team. “We’re enjoying the journey,” Southgate said. “We came here to enjoy our football and we’ve made several pieces of history already: our biggest win in the tournament, our first knockout win for 12 years, our first quarter‑final win for even longer. We keep looking to break the barriers down. It’s been an enjoyable journey. We want to keep it going.”The alternative is that England end up in the third-versus-fourth play-off in St Petersburg on Saturday and going through the motions of a game that, frankly, feels like an irrelevance. “It is one of the curiosities of the World Cup that they should have such a match,” Peter Shilton, England’s goalkeeper in 1990, once said. “The players don’t want it and it has little interest for the supporters. The last thing you want to do is stay to play a meaningless match.” Nobody, however, forgets a World Cup final. As Southgate said, the players should not need a team talk."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f9e8355577ad2299b900c1cf1372efe06d47a1f4/0_124_4107_2464/master/4107.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=55b6156d401170734143e957c8d87bc6","title":"football manchester city sign riyad mahrez leicester city","story":"• Long-term target signs five-year contract at Etihad• Mahrez: ‘City are redefining the English game’Manchester City have signed Riyad Mahrez from Leicester, the 27-year-old winger costing a club record £60m that could rise to £75m with add-ons.Mahrez, who has signed a five-year contract and will wear the No 26 shirt, is Pep Guardiola’s first signing of the summer, with the manager having targeted a wide forward and defensive midfielder in this transfer window.Mahrez, who was a key player in Leicester’s 2016 title-winning side, told Manchester City’s website: “I am so pleased to have joined City, a side playing great football under Pep Guardiola.

France had made it to the World Cup final and will surely fancy their chances of being reunited with that coveted piece of gold in Moscow on Sunday. The players in blue were embracing and a Belgium side heavily made up of players from the Premier League will have to wonder whether the time will ever come for their golden generation.The unfortunate truth is it may not but, if nothing else, Belgium will go with a lot of people’s good wishes bearing in mind Roberto Martínez’s side knocked out Brazil to reach this semi-final and have contributed richly to what is being acclaimed as the most attractive World Cup in memory. Here, though, they could not build on an encouraging start and were worn down by a side with a superior blend when it comes to striking the right balance between attack and defence.That will make France formidable opponents in Sunday’s final, no matter whether it is England or Croatia who join them in the Luzhniki stadium, and especially when the feeling persists that they may be capable of taking their football to a higher level. This was a controlled victory, rather than an exhilarating one, but there were still plenty of reasons to admire the team Didier Deschamps has put together.Samuel Umtiti scored the decisive goal but the lingering memory might actually be Kylian Mbappé’s exquisite drag back to present Olivier Giroud with another chance later in the second half. If England can make it back to Moscow for the final, what a challenge it will be to keep out this brilliant young player and that is even before considering the elegant brilliance of Antoine Griezmann, or the uncommon gifts of a midfield featuring Paul Pogba and N’Golo Kanté.France might have taken their time to get going but after a slow start they began to take control towards the end of the first half and once they had taken the lead six minutes after the interval there were only fleeting moments when Belgium threatened an equaliser.Early on the team in red had kept the ball with an assurance that suggested this could be a famous night for Belgian football. By the end Eden Hazard was starting to take on too much and Belgium had conspicuously run out of ideas. Even Kevin de Bruyne began to look a little wild.Hugo Lloris 8\u0026nbspOutstanding first-half save from Alderweireld and solid thereafter has been an unsung star of France’s tournament.Benjamin Pavard 6\u0026nbspStruggled against Hazard early on, needing encouragement from Pogba, but grew in confidence as Belgium lost their way.Raphaël Varane 8\u0026nbspA class act who marshalled Lukaku superbly throughout and made some acrobatic interventions when France were stretched.Samuel Umtiti 7\u0026nbspMade the crucial breakthrough with a fine run and jump, rendering occasional wobbles at the back irrelevant.Lucas Hernandez 7\u0026nbspFielded Belgium’s wide threat well and helped the attack when possible too. Impressive tournament so far.N’Golo Kanté 8\u0026nbspAnother fine performance from France’s midfield dynamo, who mopped up repeatedly and set counters in motion.Paul Pogba 7\u0026nbspDiligent showing with some important defensive contributions still the sense he can offer more going forward.Blaise Matuidi 7\u0026nbspUsual all-action fare on left of midfield three but his late injury will be a major concern.Kylian Mbappé 8\u0026nbspIn the mood from the first whistle and created chances for Giroud and Pavard threat is impossible to ignore.Olivier Giroud 6\u0026nbspStill looking for his first effort on target of the tournament wayward here and Guivarc’h comparisons look valid.Antoine Griezmann 8\u0026nbspVirtually a one-man attacking show at times, roaming everywhere, and set up Umtiti with a devilish delivery.Steven Nzonzi 6\u0026nbspIntroduced to shore things up in the final 10 minutes as France held on in comfort.Corentin Tolisso 6\u0026nbspAlmost put the icing on the cake in added time but was denied by Courtois’s fingertips.Ratings by Nick AmesRomelu Lukaku had a difficult match and in the final exchanges it was Corentin Tolisso, one of the France substitutes, who had the best chance. De Bruyne was dropping back into the centre circle to get the ball in his desperation to create something. Hazard was doing the same and, when Belgium really needed something special from their elite performers, it never arrived. It was a disjointed second-half display and, with such an array of category A players, a hugely disappointing one, too.It was France who produced the more rounded display and created the better chances, usually on the counterattack. They were set up to play that way for most of the game and, when Mbappé was getting into his stride, with his combination of speed, directness and raw power, anything was possible.Thibaut Courtois 7 Saved from Pavard in the first half and Tolisso at the end. Little chance of stopping Umtiti’s powerful header.Nacer Chadli 6\u0026nbspOperated as a de facto winger and had some early joy but the experiment did not really pay off.Toby Alderweireld 6\u0026nbspIt could all have been so different had he scored in the first half. Competent defensive display, bar a yellow card.Vincent Kompany 6 Composed showing and was rarely outdone but could not galvanise his team-mates to come back.Jan Vertonghen 6 Had his hands full with Mbappe and was fortunate not to be punished more severely at times.Axel Witsel 7 Saw a meaty late effort parried by Lloris and was the most dynamic of a disappointing Belgium midfield.Mousa Dembélé 5 Surprise selection did not work out. Looked ponderous in possession and was replaced on the hour.Marouane Fellaini 5 Should not have been beaten by Umtiti for the goal much less influential than in his previous two outings.Kevin De Bruyne 7 Tried everything in a bid to get Belgium going but could not get into the right areas often enough.Romelu Lukaku 6\u0026nbspBack in a more familiar role and was far less effective, receiving little service of note.Eden Hazard 6\u0026nbspHad Pavard on toast in the early stages but as the game wore on service to him was sorely lacking and his impact waned.Dries Mertens 6\u0026nbspIntroduced as right-sided attacker but made little impact despite some shows of intent.Yannick Carrasco 6\u0026nbspCame on for Fellaini but was virtually anonymous during his cameo.Michy Batshuayi 6 Last roll of the dice as the clock ticked down on six minutes of added time, replacing Chadli.Yet this was not a team who went for the throat – not all the time, anyway. Deschamps had even modified his formation to use Blaise Matuidi in a more withdrawn role than normal, reducing the risk of being opened up in midfield. Griezmann occupied a left-sided role, rather than playing as a classic No 10, and it took a while before they started to examine the theory – as many sides once discovered in the Premier League – that teams managed by Martínez often tend to be vulnerable at the back.He had an attacking midfielder, Nacer Chadli, operating at right-back and a centre-half, Jan Vertonghen, on the left. For all the talent in Belgium’s squad, where were the full-backs? Vertonghen, in particular, had his work cut out given Mbappé was his direct opponent and the game’s decisive moment told its own story: a corner, a header and that was all France needed.The most surprising part on this occasion was to see Marouane Fellaini losing out in the air. Griezmann swung the ball over from the right and Umtiti had the run on his marker. The ball flashed off his forehead but it also took a little touch off Fellaini before going past Thibaut Courtois in the Belgian goal.Courtois had already kept out Benjamin Parvard during that first flurry of France pressure towards the end of the first half and Belgium, having started so assuredly, were finding it difficult to rediscover their fluency. Too often their passes went astray.Lukaku had only one reasonable chance throughout. Mousa Dembélé was substituted after an unusually poor game and, as Hazard and De Bruyne faded, France started looking forward to a showpiece night and the possibility of joining Argentina and Uruguay as two-times winners of the World Cup. They will take some stopping."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4e60b676337a4ca9310013ca387324045012d062/221_768_1630_978/master/1630.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3e5f7abe02f5b6c9c5217655145a3e23","title":"gareth southgate england players croatia world cup semi final","story":"Gareth Southgate believes the success his young England side have enjoyed in Russia has offered only a first glimpse of their potential, as the least experienced team at the tournament seek to go beyond Croatia and into a first World Cup final in 52 years.England go into their semi-final at the Luzhniki Stadium with a fully fit squad and an opportunity tantalisingly within their grasp. Southgate pointed to the uniting effect the side’s exploits have had on a nation enduring “difficult moments” economically and politically, with the seniors poised to emulate the achievements of England’s world champion under‑17s and under‑20s, and the European Championship-winning under-19s.The manager, formerly the head of elite development and the under‑21s coach, had played a key role in the Football Association adopting the England DNA blueprint after the dreadful showing at the 2014 World Cup, a strategy which championed best practice in scouting, coaching, development and preparation of young players, and which is reaping rewards. “I’ve been involved in all the plans really, right through the age groups,” he said. “To have seen our younger teams have success they have has been hugely rewarding.“We know our academies at club level are producing really good players, technically good players. We made a lot of changes with the national teams that helped us be successful. We\u0026nbspbelieve we have to continue doing that, to constantly evolve and improve. With this team, it’s the same. The experiences of the last few weeks, the milestones they’ve hit, will\u0026nbspbe a great reference point moving forward. The more big games we’re involved in, the more pressure situations they’re involved in and emerge from successful, the more belief it will build.“We have a core group of young players in this squad we believe will take us forward, and others coming through the age-group teams with good experiences who have belief they can win, but also expectations that we should be in quarter-finals, semi-finals and finals more regularly. That’s what we wanted to do with our younger teams. All of that work is great but you really have to achieve at senior level in the end for that to be fulfilled. And we have a great opportunity now to get to a World Cup final.”Eleven of Southgate’s 23-man squad in Russia had featured at Euro\u0026nbsp2016, when that humiliating knockout defeat by Iceland had prompted new doubts over the FA’s long-term planning. “But sometimes you have to go through difficult times as a team, and failures, to learn and to improve,” said the manager. “There were a lot of young players involved in the team two years ago who suffered a huge disappointment, and we could have ignored that and tried to be positive and look to the future. But we felt it was important to learn from it, unpick it a bit, and find out why we’d gone so long without winning a knockout game.“We’ve been fortunate the FA have backed us financially to bring in a lot of staff, experts in lots of fields: physical, medical, coaching, to offer good support for the players. We’ve planned really well, and learned as much as we can. We’re starting to see through the age groups some success because of that. But it’s an ongoing process. This team is nowhere near the level they’re going to be capable of, partly because of their age but also because they’ll have more big-match experiences over the next few years. We are excited about the future but we want to make the most of this opportunity as well.”Expectations have risen as the team have progressed, with the players well aware of the frenzied scenes of celebration in England which have greeted each of their successes in Russia. Those victories at a time of political chaos, Southgate suggested, have had a wider impact back home.“We’re really proud of the support we’re receiving,” he said. “We’ve had the chance to make a difference. Our supporters, our country, has had a long time of suffering in terms of football. But the enthusiasm for these players, not only because of the way they’ve played but how they’ve conducted themselves … they’ve been brilliant ambassadors for our country.“Everybody can see they are proud to wear the shirt. It’s great for them that they’ve got some enjoyable experiences now playing for England. Our country has been through some difficult moments recently in terms of its unity, and sport has the power to unite. Football, in particular, has the power to do that. We can feel the energy and feel support from home and it’s a very special feeling, a privilege for us.”Croatia, inspired by stellar performers in Luka Modric and Ivan Rakitic, represent England’s most daunting opponents yet. “They’ll be the best team we’ve played in terms of what they’re capable of doing with the ball, and what iniduals are capable of, definitely,” Southgate said. “For us as a team, it’s another chance to create a small piece of history.“We’re only the second team to reach a semi-final out of our country, and that’s quite significant … I know we talked about the success of the younger teams, but this is a much harder, much bigger level for the players. The belief is building as things are happening. The more of these tests we can come through, the better, not just for now, but moving forward.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7edf4ed647cec5c24df387028aeff74239e6670b/0_84_3214_1928/master/3214.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6b7c79e6e78d414e6c3677d2bc7856ac","title":"harry kane england world class striker attributes","story":"Talent is not enough to be one of the best you need mental strength to perform at a World Cup and a desire always to improveI was convinced before the World Cup that Harry Kane would have a good tournament – and he has not failed me. We can all see the difference he has made for England, not only with his goals but also because of his great movement, which creates so many chances for teammates.There were people, before the tournament, who wondered whether Kane would be able to shine on the biggest stage and I can understand why because playing in a World Cup is very different from playing for your club. When you are representing your club you normally have a long sequence of matches to put something right that maybe went wrong in one or two games.Though the matches in a World Cup may be as frequent, they are also far more limited – possibly only three – and we have seen with Kane that he is taking this extremely seriously. He knows this is his and England’s chance to achieve something incredible. But despite this he has not displayed any signs of nervousness or fear – only a desire to score goals and for England to win. He is playing his best football and he is making a difference to a team.People often ask me what the secret to being a good goalscorer is but there is not just one thing that makes someone a brilliant and consistent striker. You need a bit of everything. You need technique and positional awareness you need to be able to read the game and be quick. To be great, you need all of these things.These attributes, however, are not just given to you, handed down to you, even if you are talented. If you don’t work hard and practise and improve all the time you will have no chance of making it to the top. The secret to being a good goalscorer, I would say, is to realise that you always need to improve. Always.Training provides a player with situations that will happen during the game and is therefore a perfect environment for you to learn about what you should and should not be doing in a game. Moreover, you also need to be extremely persistent – and I feel that is another box Kane is ticking. Always striving to be better, always looking at the next thing to improve. That is what I do in training and I am sure Kane does too.I practise finishing, I practise positioning and taking different positions on the field. I look at the spaces on the pitch and I try to read the opponents who are marking me – what is their next move and how can I use that to my advantage? I try to find their weaknesses and exploit them. I also practise much more with my right foot than my left foot because it is my weaker one.All the above may sound hard work but sadly it is still not enough to be able to perform at the highest level. One key aspect to being a good striker is to stay focused throughout the game. To begin with you need to focus on just the game and not what is going on off the pitch, whether it is a headline in a paper you have read, an argument with a family member or a girlfriend or boyfriend.Playing the game at the highest level means being focused from the start – but also to keep that focus until the very end. There are many games where goalkeepers can have a cracking game, saving everything you throw at them, before suddenly, in the 89th minute, they make a small mistake that allows you to steal in and score.Strikers live off goals but there can be some games when there are just no chances throughout a whole game – but you still have to keep going until the very end. Kane has shown that he can do that, time and time again with Tottenham but also with England, in the first game against Tunisia, in this World Cup, when he scored a very late winner. He was sharp and focused despite it being in the 90th minute – and that is very impressive.Confidence, of course, is important too but not in a selfish way. If a striker focuses too much on himselfherself it can have a negative effect on the team – especially if the person is always shooting, always trying to win the game on his or her own. Confidence does not come only from goals but also from being focused on the team, having good communication between teammates and having respect for your colleagues.Everyone can have good and bad days and also good and bad spells in a game. We have to keep believing, though. For example, only this week, in my most recent game, for Orlando Pride against Washington Spirit, I started playing up front. In the second half, however, the coach put me in a different position. I created more opportunities but still the ball would not go in.I started to think that this would not be our day but I was adamant to push these thoughts out of my head. I tried to think that we would still do it and, thankfully, in the 86th minute I received the ball in a good position, took two players on and managed to score off the crossbar! We won the game 2-1.As I said, you have to be focused all the time. Harry Kane has shown us what he is capable of at this tournament but he has to retain his focus. The whole England team have to keep their minds on their goal. Only then can they win the World Cup. Four years is a long time to wait for the next chance."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b7ee03c4e9108dd0490c25ccc3eacad8cbe47689/0_87_4496_2698/master/4496.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=263c655ae9f3ee1417d680103ff2b4b7","title":"psychology england football team change your life pippa grange","story":"England players seem happier and more grounded – and much of the credit goes to psychologist Pippa Grange. What can the team’s approach teach us all about facing fear and failure?This week, the England midfielder Dele Alli was asked if he was nervous about the big tests up ahead: first, of course, the team’s semi-final against Croatia on Wednesday. “Excited, not nervous,” he replied. His apparent happiness and confidence reflected an England team that seems transformed from previous incarnations. Where once it was stuffed with entitled, surly stars, burdened with the weight of history and the pressure of expectations, it now comes across as a hungry, humble team, playing with lightness and joy.“We’ve spoken to the players about writing their own stories,” said the manager, Gareth Southgate, after the team beat Colombia in an unprecedentedly victorious (for England) penalty shootout. “Tonight they showed they don’t have to conform to what’s gone before. They have created their own history … We always have to believe in what is possible in life and not be hindered by history or expectations.”The team appears in a better place psychologically than it has for generations. Much of the credit has gone to Southgate, but also to Pippa Grange, the team psychologist, who has been working behind the scenes. “She’s an amazing person,” Alli said on Monday. “Everyone listens to her when she talks.”Grange was appointed by the FA as its head of people and team development in November last year, given the job of building resilience while confronting the pressures and psychodramas faced by previous England squads. The FA has said it searched globally for the right person for the job, but Grange, like most of the young players, isn’t an obvious superstar in her field there is no self-promoting social media presence or bestselling self-development books.She wrote in 2013 that being a woman in a male team environment “is a constant navigation, for everyone. I have no interest in being one of the lads and I don’t quite fit in the ‘nurturing mother figure’ category in terms of the leadership work I do. I would be professionally ineffective if I remained in the background, psychologically safe with minimal voice, and I am not here to be the centre of attention as some form of entertainment. I don’t want to be completely separate because that would make me inaccessible and probably be a lonely place to operate from.”The midfielder Eric Dier said: “I think a lot of the work that we’ve done with her has been prior to the tournament starting, over the last six or seven months.” This has reportedly included getting the players to sit down together in small groups to share their life experiences and anxieties, and to reveal intimate truths about their character and what drives them. The point, Southgate has said, is to build trust, “making them closer, with a better understanding of each other”.The England football team has focused on the mental side of the game before, most prominently with the psychiatrist Steve Peters, who was recruited before the 2014 World Cup. What is new is the extent to which psychology has been embraced (prior to Grange’s appointment, the performance consultancy Lane 4 was working with the FA on psychological tactics). Access to Peters, it was reported, was offered to the players only if they felt they needed it – and not many would have admitted to wanting help.“The whole group must buy into the idea that the sports psychologist has come with a specific set of skills and practices that are really worthwhile,” says Andy Lane, the professor of sport and learning at the University of Wolverhampton. “A recent turnaround in professional soccer is the preparedness to use sports science in an integrated way. It’s that acceptance by the whole group that gives one professional the chance to be effective.” Much of that culture shift will have been down to Southgate, who has shown his support for Grange, whom he clearly respects. “She is a strong and important addition to the team,” the manager said in May.Grange is a fan of inspirational quotes, from Oscar Wilde to Nelson Mandela to Michael Jordan some adorn the training gym walls (“Success isn’t given, it’s earned,” reads one). She is also said to encourage the players to get off their phones and play games with each other – including one in the hotel pool with inflatable unicorns after the win against Tunisia in the group stages and she is said to dislike social media, which she expects the players to use wisely. Southgate hasn’t banned social media – unlike previous managers, he hasn’t appeared to ban anything – but has apparently taken Grange’s thoughts on board. While he acknowledged it was good for the players to engage with fans, he added: “Personally, I’m not sure there’s value to reading comments that come in. It comes back to: what creates pressure, or what creates misery in your life?”Michael Caulfield, a sport psychologist and the co-director of the consultancy Sporting Edge, says Southgate, with whom he worked at Middlesbrough, has a leadership style “built on incredible levels of trust between him and his players and staff. He was determined to convince the team there was nothing to fear from playing in the World Cup for England, whereas in the past people were nervous or fearful. He was determined to change that mindset from one of fear to one of adventure. That’s the biggest thing he’s done.”When someone is under a moment of extreme pressure, using a tactic such as mental cues can be helpful, says Kate Hays, the head of psychology at the English Institute of Sport. “People will have cue words that will bring them back into focus on the task at hand – for some, they could be emotional cues for others, it could be technically focused. It’s just one or two words that can get people to focus on the right thing.”Southgate, who has experienced his own disappointments – that missed penalty at the semi-finals of Euro 96, and his managerial career at Middlesbrough ending in relegation – has said as much: “I have learned from things that have gone wrong and had to pick myself up … Because of those failures, I feel it gives you the freedom of being able to say, ‘How might we be the best possible team?’ and not be afraid of what goes wrong – because whatever goes wrong we can deal with, as I have lived through it.”Grange has no fear of failure either. She has written: “I’d like to turn this unhealthy preoccupation with success on its head and put it on the record that I think failure is really useful. For without failure we cannot progress longer, higher or faster. It’s a funny paradox – our successes are achieved through trying, and trying most often ends in failure. Every day in our general lives and our sporting lives we will win some and lose some it’s just part of the way life should be. It could be missing out on a promotion, being pipped at the line in a running race or bombing out in an exam – it doesn’t matter – the important lesson is to learn from our failures, reassess, rethink, move forward (sometimes in a different direction) and keep those dreams and goals alive.”Kevin George, the author of Soccology, who works with clubs and coaches on performance, also says that respecting the inidual qualities and personalities of your players (or your employees) is key. “To instil confidence in one player might be to give them freedom, so they know you trust them,” he says. “For somebody else, it might be a lot of praise. For a group of people, you have to tap into who they are inidually, but as a group, give them the belief that you trust them.” Singling people out for praise in a group setting can be tricky, he adds. “People can think: ‘That person’s a favourite, I’m not a favourite.’ It is tough.” Southgate doesn’t play favourites everyone feels as if they have a chance.The era of hard-talking, tyrannical managers is over – both on and off the pitch. “Football, which I love and work in, is really bad at talking,” says Caulfield. “It does instructing and telling off but it doesn’t do talking and listening and empathy that well. It sounds a bit fluffy but that’s the world in which we now live, and the world in which these players have grown up.” Southgate, he says, realised early in his coaching career that instilling fear wasn’t going to work. “We all need a telling-off now and then – and he’s good at that, by the way – but you’ll get far more from putting your faith in people than you will anything else. People had this lazy opinion that he’s too ‘nice’ and they see kindness as weakness, but it’s the most unbelievable strength if you use it in the right way.”As for nerves, it is a mistake to think it is essential or even desirable to eliminate them – from sport or from life. Caulfield says they can be “wonderful. They keep you alive and make you realise something important is about to happen. If you discuss what the nerves mean to you and how you deal with them, then they don’t become a threat to you. They become this wonderful cortisol that runs through your veins and you deal with the problem, and then you rest afterwards.” With or without an inflatable unicorn.• Don’t fear failure. “Part of what it takes to be courageous is overcoming the constant battle between the desire for what we want and the fear of failure. Most of us don’t expose ourselves because we are fearful,” writes Grange.• Reframe emotions: you’re not “nervous”, you’re “excited” a penalty shootoutjob interviewimportant speech is not something to dread, it’s an “opportunity”.• Positive thinking is unhelpful if you’re simply fantasising about achieving an Oscarthe World Cupa fuller social life. Instead, focus – positively – on the steps that could get you to your goal.• Treat your employeeschildrencustomers as iniduals rather than a homogenous group. Different approaches will work for different people.• Kindness, listening and empathy will take you further than barking orders.

For Southgate and his players a moment of rare sporting crisis awaits.If the last few days have been marked by a feeling of gathering English hysteria, not to mention booze-sodden escapism as the rest of the country energetically falls to bits, then it is worth noting these moments don’t come around very often.The last time England got this far was Italia 90, when Margaret Thatcher was still in power, Jeremy Corbyn was in court for not paying the poll tax and England fans in Turin had to phone long distance from a call-box to have any idea what was going on back home.Should they get past Croatia Southgate’s players will return to Moscow on Sunday for what would be England’s first world Cup final since 1966 and all that: an event so jealously seared into popular culture – the Empire Stadium, Nobby dancing, Bobby Moore wiping his hands before shaking the Queen’s white glove – it seems almost an act of heresy to think about matching it.Win or lose the most remarkable part of England’s run in Russia is the sense of shared public affection. Through four weeks in Russia, from Volgograd to Samara, the players have emerged as a hugely likeable crew and a flattering reflection of the country at large – clever, diligent, funny, and agreeably erse in their backgrounds.Plus of course there is Southgate, who in the last few weeks has seemed at times like the only person left in charge of anything who looks like he actually knows what he’s doing.On Tuesday afternoon it was standing room only for the manager’s last public appearance before the final, the air in the Luzhniki press room thick with excitement, event-glamour and the effects of four weeks on the road with minimal laundry opportunities.Cameras whirred, necks craned. Somebody fell over at the back. And finally there he was, the great Gareth. And yes it is just Gareth now: role model, dreamboat and all-round sun king of Russia 2018. Gareth wasn’t wearing his waistcoat here, or his “sleeveless suit staple” as one newswire report put it at the weekend, ever-fearful of using the same word twice.With the sleeveless suit staple rested Gareth was casual in a black and blue sports top, drawing a hush as an urgent first question was posed from the floor about the rubber chicken England’s players had been pictured chucking around in training. “It was jut a bit of fun,” Gareth explained, as three hundred pairs of fingers whirred at his every prompt.Nobody expected any of this. Perhaps that’s why it feels so glorious. England weren’t supposed to win a penalty shootout or get to the last four of a World Cup. We weren’t supposed to adore the players, presented for so long as a coterie of gloweringly entitled star athletes. Southgate wasn’t even supposed to be England manager, stepping up from the youth teams when Sam Allardyce was sacked after a newspaper sting that revealed little of interest beyond the fact the England manager had sat in a restaurant drinking a pint of wine.Southgate was given a humiliating four-match trial period. His first public words in the job were an apology. And in his early days he still resembled a slightly doomed supply teacher who listens and makes the class like him but still gets home to find his pockets have been filled with custard.He has has a different kind of light around him now, all assured alpha energy and quiet charisma. Gareth made a mild joke about not remembering 1966. In the front row people tittered and flushed and held their hand to their throat.Finally Southgate said the stuff he says so well, about how there has been some ision at home but hopefully football can bring people together. And about how energised the players are by the sheer level of enthusiasm, joy – and let’s face it, slight mania – back home.The reaction in England can be a startling spectacle from the other end of the telescope. In Moscow there is little hysteria and few England fans at time of writing. You can walk for an hour now and not see any real sign of a World Cup taking place. This is a city that seethes with life, but which has a reserve about these things.England are probably favourites to make it to the final from here. Croatia have better players in many areas. Luka Modric is the classiest player left in the tournament, but he’s 32 now and has slogged through extra time in the two preceding rounds. England are fresh, energetic and a team in harmony with itself.There is a giddiness to all this, the feeling of uncharted territory in so many ways, not least a fear of when this is all over and it is necessary once again to return to the so-called real world. For now England in Moscow promises more of the same, more shared joy and agony, more beer in the air, the uplifting spectacle of a team and a manager for once punching up, achieving above the sum of its parts, and close now to a moment of genuinely rare sporting history."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1a44c24413a3af07f3bc5bfefb6731d82729e88f/0_29_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ea9990eca3019e088787387a9538b5a2","title":"why the nation fell for gareth southgate","story":"Pick a moment. There have been so many from which to choose in this unexpectedly joyous World Cup. Harry Kane’s stoppage-time winner against Tunisia. Jordan Pickford’s penalty save against Colombia. Eric Dier’s winning shootout spot kick moments later. Harry Maguire’s towering header in the quarter-final. Kyle Walker and Jesse Lingard dancing like idiots in front of the fans.But there is one that sticks out above all others. One so iconic it could be eclipsed only by Kane lifting the trophy in Moscow on Sunday. It came after England had just won its first ever penalty shootout in a World Cup. Having congratulated his own players, the England manager, Gareth Southgate, took the time to seek out Mateus Uribe, the Colombian player whose miss had set up the victory, and put an arm round him in consolation.This wasn’t just a random act of sensitivity and compassion – though these qualities are sufficiently uncommon, not just in English football but football the world over, to have made them remarkable in themselves. It was one of empathy. It was Southgate’s missed penalty against Germany that had been England’s downfall in the 1996 European Championship. He knew what it felt like to be the man to dash a nation’s dreams. To have been the man who ended up as the fall guy in a Pizza Hut advert. His arm round Uribe’s shoulder wasn’t a casual, passing gesture: it was one that spoke of a deep personal understanding.Even more than that, though, it was a moment of grace. Life is a messy business that offers few obvious chances at redemption. Failures and disappointments are generally rewritten or absorbed into lives that somehow muddle on as best they can. Southgate was granted a Hollywood sense of closure. The opportunity to channel his own experience of despair into one of triumph for his team, in front of a global audience of roughly a billion people. From zero to hero.As Dier’s penalty went in, England went noisily bonkers. What the country had learned from the 22 years of pain since last winning a penalty shootout (against Spain in Euro 96) was that the right reaction was to shout loudly, get pissed or drive around the streets leaning on the horn. What Southgate had learned from the whole experience was a basic sense of decency. That night he showed a nation how to behave. Small wonder that the few remaining people who weren’t already a bit in love with the England manager collapsed happily into his embrace at that moment.It was never intended to be this way, though. After all, it had been Sam Allardyce entrusted with the job of England manager after the country’s disastrous showing in the 2016 Euros. Then he was accused of offering businessmen advice on how to “get around” the rules on players’ transfers and using his role for financial advantage – Allardyce continues to deny the allegations. Given England’s performance in Russia, we should profoundly thank the Daily  for the investigation. Southgate, in charge of the England Under-21 team at the time, was a hastily appointed replacement and dismissively referred to as the “caretaker manager”.No one expected much of Southgate. Not even the Football Association, whose chairman Greg Dyke said in 2016 that English football was in such a desperate state that no one should dream of any real success until the 2022 World Cup, at the earliest. Southgate, notorious for missing a penalty and being sacked as manager of Middlesbrough, was just there as a stopgap. Expendable collateral damage in the seemingly futile search for English football’s lost soul.Even in the runup to this World Cup, the expectations remained at rock bottom. Normally in the buildup to a major tournament, the media quickly reaches fever pitch with unrealistic hype about how the team could finally end X years of hurt, only for the headlines to become increasingly bitter – with the manager and players turned into laughing stocks when the dreams go unrealised.This time, nothing. Nada. It was almost as if everyone was fed up with football. The manner in which Russia had become the host nation still stank, fans were advised to stay away due to threats of violence and Putin’s repressive regime and no one – even in jest – seriously expected England to have a prayer. After decades of lost hope, pragmatic despair had set in. This was a tournament to which we already knew the ending. England would do well to make it out of the group stages. And, if they did, they would lose on penalties in the first round of the knockout matches. It was written in the stars.All of which suited Southgate just fine. He had never been one of the headline-grabbing egomaniacs who have dominated football for much of the past 30 years. He knows there is more to life than the game and has created the space for himself to spend plenty of time with his wife, Alison, and their two children, Mia and Flynn. So, he was more than happy to slip under the radar and set about creating a team in his own image.In the past, England has seemed like a team in name only. A two-tier collection of so-called stars, such as David Beckham and Wayne Rooney, with random iniduals making up the numbers. No wonder they struggled. Southgate has made a virtue of a necessity – England is, thankfully, completely out of big-ego players right now – and picked a squad where Harry Kane is the only player to even be the biggest name at his Premier League club. And even he looks like someone who is simply thrilled to be part of the England setup and not someone who is doing his country a favour.Southgate is blessed with the rare gift – in football, especially – of emotional intelligence. That is what makes him emblematic of a modern, outward-looking man. He trusts his players. He encourages them to take responsibility for their own actions. He helps them to tell their own stories. To be known both to themselves and those around them.All year, left-back Danny Rose has been suffering from a depression which he had kept to himself after picking up an injury: Southgate helped him come to terms with it by going public (“England has been my salvation and I can’t thank the manager and the medical staff enough,” he told the press). It was as close to therapy as football gets. By acknowledging the possibility of failure, he has made success more likely. The ball of fear that had hung heavily over the English game has been lifted.Better still, Southgate leads by example. He doesn’t just talk the talk, he walks the walk. He believes in the importance of family and encouraged Fabian Delph to return home for the birth of his child. The player missed the team’s winning match against Colombia, but was back in time to come on as a subsitute in Saturday’s quarter-final against Sweden. A World Cup may come around again, but to be present at the birth of your child is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Southgate is an open book and takes responsibility for his own actions. Previous managers might have thrown a strop and blamed somebody else when a sheet of paper, which appeared to contain some tactical notes, found its way into the hands of the press before the Panama game. Southgate took the hit, said the media were just doing their job and moved on. What could have slipped into the familiar them-and-us siege mentality between the players and the outside world was instead instantly defused.Everyone in the squad knows their place and understands their role within it. Fielding a near-second-strength team for the group match against Belgium was an act of insight and inspiration. Not because losing guaranteed England a place in what looked to be the easier side of the draw, but because it offered clarity to the rest of the squad. They knew they had been given a chance to make their claim for a place in the regular starting 11, but they hadn’t been good enough to take it. Southgate had demonstrated his even-handedness and that he didn’t have favourites. Too often in tournaments, the reserve players can become disaffected and undermine the unity of the whole squad. Now, there is a genuine sense of togetherness. Success may breed its own success, but it was Southgate who lit the spark.And it’s not just a team that Southgate has inspired. It is England as a whole. At a time when the cabinet is fighting like rats in a sack, and trust in the political class to act in the best interests of the country rather than their own party is at an all-time low, Southgate has shown what it is to have integrity. To stand up and be counted.When a large number of people in the country are obsessed with who is cheating on whom on Love Island, he has demonstrated that you can act with humanity and decency towards others. He has shown us who we could be. A better us. A nation that can look triumph and disaster in the face and treat them both the same. (Though also a nation that is getting decidedly used to dealing with the triumph and would rather not have to think of the disaster for a while yet, thanks.) Football may be coming home, but Gareth and his team get to stay in Russia for another week yet."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/394208c73f62175435a748e76bb18df0f61ccfb4/5_253_2521_1512/master/2521.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ac879df37d69e5ca3792cbac04cf3637","title":"world cup semi final regrets trevor steven england 1990","story":"Trevor Steven is one of only 23 Englishmen to play in a World Cup semi-final and he paints a vivid picture of what Gareth Southgate’s side can expect against Croatia in Moscow on Wednesday night.“It’s like an out-of-body experience,” says Steven, who faced West Germany at Italia\u0026nbsp90 on 4\u0026nbspJuly in Turin. Bobby Robson’s men drew 1-1 but after extra time suffered the heartache of defeat on penalties to begin a dire sequence of three such exits in four World Cups, as England’s 1998 and 2006 tournaments ended this way.Southgate’s side broke the hoodoo in their last-16 win against Colombia and they are only the third England team to reach the last four of the tournament, with Sir Alf Ramsey’s 1966 victors the sole finalists.Steven says: “It’s an opportunity to reach a World Cup final, a dream for a football player. Everybody wanted to play, be a starter. Training was very intense, we had to try and treat it like another match but it’s very difficult to do that.”So, too, for Southgate’s team who will breach a 28-year gap to Robson’s vintage when walking out at the Luzhniki Stadium. Their five‑game run to this stage has taken\u0026nbspin 2-1 and\u0026nbsp6-1 wins against Tunisia and Panama respectively, plus a 1-0 defeat against Belgium in Group\u0026nbspG. After a 1-1 draw Colombia were defeated 4-3 on penalties. Then, in England’s finest display, Sweden were downed 2-0 to set up the semi‑final with Croatia.To reach their semi-final Robson’s team drew 1-1 with Republic of Ireland and 0-0 with the\u0026nbspNetherlands before beating Egypt 1-0 to top Group\u0026nbspF. Belgium were dispatched 1-0 in the last\u0026nbsp16 before Cameroon were knocked out 3-2, both of these ties being won in extra\u0026nbsptime.“Yet the mood was absolutely fantastic – a togetherness, just like the team has today, we were a more experienced group of players than the current group so that probably helped us. This group, though, they\u0026nbspdon’t have any fear at all, which\u0026nbspis\u0026nbspgreat.”Beasant highlights the potency of\u0026nbspteam spirit by referring to his time at Wimbledon, during which Liverpool were defeated in the 1988 FA\u0026nbspCup final and the team was branded the Crazy Gang.England faced West Germany at the now demolished Stadio delle Alpi. “It was huge, absolutely huge,” says Steven. “We had lots of family over – everybody wanted to be there. The atmosphere was electric. They were favourites to beat us because of\u0026nbspthe record books, plus they had such a strong side.“It’s an unbelievable experience to have the three lions on the shirt and represent your country – the whole country, the whole world, is watching. But you have to put all of those things to the back of your head, try and attain your personal\u0026nbsplevels.”Franz Beckenbauer’s team were led by Lothar Matthäus and featured Jürgen Klinsmann. Andreas Brehme’s deflected 60th-minute free-kick beat Peter Shilton before Gary Lineker’s equaliser 10 minutes from the end forced extra time and then the shootout.The misses by Stuart Pearce and Chris Waddle became embedded in English football conscience, a spectre that hovered until Eric Dier beat Colombia’s David Ospina at the Spartak\u0026nbspStadium last week for England’s first World Cup shootout victory.Steven, a career penalty taker, offers insight into what any player required to take one on Wednesday may go through. “The takers were guys who started,” says Steven of Lineker,\u0026nbspPeter Beardsley, David Platt, Pearce and Waddle. “I was getting to\u0026nbspthe point where it could have been\u0026nbspme next – Bobby had not made up his mind.“It was: ‘Oh God, this is such a pressurised situation, it could be you next up to that penalty spot – will I walk there or will I jog?’ It was surreal watching the guys one by one taking the penalties. I felt for them. You just don’t want to be the one who let’s their team down, their country. Anybody can miss.”Steven recalls the feeling of defeat. “On the field absolute devastation emotionally,” he says. “We felt so badly for who’d not scored. I don’t know how they must’ve felt to have that forever around their necks. When we got back into the dressing room, it was heartache, everybody consoling each other.“But what can you do? It’s gone. The moment has gone, you can’t get it back. It’s difficult to put a jar on the\u0026nbspemotions – we were so proud of what we’d done and yet one of the biggest regrets you can have as a player is not getting to the final. We could’ve won it and that would have been life-changing.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/18f0b34451486dec71bacee0433c8b14897fd9f4/0_141_3840_2304/master/3840.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b7394f67f58b64286e9a6dfcb16cc291","title":"france into the final as destiny calls for england world cup football daily","story":"Max and co discuss France becoming the first finalist of the 2018 World Cup, a Thibaut Courtois post-match meltdown, England’s hopes, dreams and fears, Cristiano Ronaldo’s move and Welsh nightmares."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/14729d5fb051983bcb2bb65b652c1d213da73609/0_0_3930_2359/master/3930.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=deef767f3e8396887b30d347bb1e3b30","title":"cristiano ronaldo 100m juventus real madrid transfer","story":"To pay such a sum for a player surely past his peak seems a risk but the Italian champions have not made many mistakes latelyCristiano Ronaldo described it in matter-of-fact terms as “the moment to begin a new cycle”. In Italy the headline writers went a little bigger as they hailed Juventus’s capture of the Portugal forward as “the deal of the century”.Even the club’s most optimistic supporters might not have dreamed such a thing possible at the start of this summer. A five-times Ballon d’Or winner coming to Turin? No Serie A player had even finished among the top three vote winners for that award since Kaká won it in 2007.So much has changed in the intervening years. The prestige of Spanish football waxed just as Italian football waned. When the Milan owner, Silvio Berlusconi, shared his “dream” of signing Ronaldo at the start of this decade, the player responded with a politician’s turn of phrase, saying that Serie A was “not the league I like the most”.Juventus were only just returning to the forefront of the domestic game. Dumped into Serie B in 2006 for their part in the Calciopoli scandal, they took six years to become champions of Italy once more. They have not looked back since, claiming seven consecutive league titles and four straight domestic doubles, as well as reaching the final of the Champions League in two of the past four years.Such sustained success is no accident. Juventus developed a business plan and followed through, from the construction of Serie A’s first modern, club-owned stadium in 2010 to their rebranding with a new, social media-friendly logo last year.Above all, though, they have made superlative moves in the transfer market. Year after year Juventus have found value where others missed it. Andrea Pirlo, Sami Khedira and Dani Alves joined on free transfers. Carlos Tevez cost an initial €9m. Paul Pogba was signed and then flipped back to Manchester United four years later for a roughly €70m profit (once Mino Raiola’s agent’s fees had been deducted).On the surface that might seem like an impossible indulgence for a club that is expected to report a small loss on its accounts for the past season. The reality might be the exact opposite.For all their impressive growth in recent years, the concern for Juventus has always been that they would be limited by the simple fact of competing in a league whose international brand continues to lag behind those of La Liga and the Premier League.Despite reaching the Champions League final in 2017 the club are still ranked only 10th in Deloitte’s Money League, with revenues less than two-thirds the size of Manchester United, Real Madrid or Barcelona.The signing of Ronaldo is designed to change that. You might even say that Juventus are taking a page out of Madrid’s own play book. There were plenty who scoffed at the Spanish club’s €37m outlay on David Beckham in the summer of 2003. Florentino Pérez knew he was getting a steal for a player who would bring far more than that into his club’s coffers.Ronaldo had already transformed Juventus’s finances before he even agreed terms. As rumours of his impending arrival increased in recent days, the club’s share price soared. The newspaper Secolo XIX noted on Thursday that the club’s market valuation had risen from €665m to €815m – enough (notionally) to cover the player’s transfer fee. After a dip, those numbers have continued to rise.And while Ronaldo is older now than Beckham was then, he is also a more impactful player. Ronaldo might be slowing down but he still scored 44 goals last season, including two goals and an assist against Juventus in their own stadium in the quarter-finals of the Champions League.Do we even need to ask how he will fit into this Juventus side? Massimiliano Allegri is an arch-pragmatist who has adapted his team countless times already during his four years in charge, maintaining his team’s domestic dominance through the departures of Tevez, Pogba, Leonardo Bonucci and many more besides."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/850496202e143d653932adaf09685e47c2857d37/0_111_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=67b90fb6d252debb2ea5cae07ad4c589","title":"bald tattoo scalp micropigmentation","story":" Advocates of ‘scalp micropigmentation’, a non-invasive treatment for people who are balding, say it has helped them regain confidenceWhile the Washington native still occasionally wears his beloved green and navy Seattle Mariners cap, he no longer feels uncomfortable taking it off or “getting a little sun on his head”. He also doesn’t need to throw on a beanie just to get the mail. In fact, sometimes when he goes out he doesn’t bring a hat at all.That’s because three months ago Russell underwent scalp micropigmentation, a cosmetic hair loss solution that started in England and is on the rise in the United States. Scalp micropigmentation is a non-invasive treatment for people who are balding, thinning or have receding hair. Using a specialized pigment and a digital permanent makeup machine equipped with a microneedle, scalp micropigmentation practitioners penetrate the skin and create tiny follicles in the scalp, essentially producing little dots to mimic the look of stubble. It’s a condition that Iulo knows all too well he, too, suffered hair loss at an early age before eventually finding solace in scalp micropigmentation. Iulo empathizes with his clients because he knows how one’s self-confidence tends to disappear with one’s hair. In the four years since opening his clinic, Iulo has had many conversations with men about their deepest insecurities.Iulo even recalls one man who, despite being religious, wouldn’t go to church. “He didn’t want people staring at his bald head,” Iulo says. “Hair can affect someone’s life in little ways, but it can really add up.”Hiding his hair loss was always a painstaking and time-consuming endeavour for Eric D’Appolonia, a 31-year-old New Jerseyan who received scalp micropigmentation in 2015. No matter where he was going, D’Appolonia took at least an hour to get ready, spending 45 of those minutes trying to make it look like he had more hair than he actually did. He used Caboki – a shake-on concealer made of plant-based fibers that cling to and fill in a person’s hair, plus hair sprays, glues and a hair dryer to put each hair in the perfect spot, making a mess of the bathroom in the process. Before leaving, he would ask his now wife: “Is the Caboki showing?” D’Appolonia avoided any activity where he might sweat too much, for fear the black ink from the Caboki would start dripping down his face. He says there were not only social but professional challenges as well: D’Appolonia is a physical education teacher. “It was constant that I’d have to run to the bathroom to make sure black stuff wasn’t all on my forehead.” D’Appolonia was about 18 when he started losing his hair. His once thick hair was transforming into what his friend coined a “mansion-head”: two entrances in the front, where the hairline was receding into a peninsula shape, and a pool at the back, where the hair was vanishing from his crown. “I know it sounds vain, but I didn’t feel as attractive, and I was losing a lot of confidence based on that,” D’Appolonia says. He didn’t talk about his struggle much with his friends or his family because he was a master at hiding it, he says, no one really knew what he was dealing with. Once while on a vacation at Hershey Park with his now in-laws, D’Appolonia and his wife left the park early so he could get ready for dinner without her family seeing his routine. D’Appolonia and Derek Russell both acknowledge that some might consider their actions vain or shallow, but both men say that’s not the point. Getting the procedure isn’t about what people think, they say – it’s about what makes them feel good.“The majority of the population is taking action to feel good about themselves, even if that means buying an outfit they think will look better,” D’Appolonia says. Still, the procedure isn’t for everyone. “I didn’t try to fight it in the beginning,” says 28-year-old Vinny Gallo, who starting completely shaving his head after he began to go bald almost a decade ago.When a friend underwent scalp micropigmentation last fall, Gallo tossed around the idea of getting the procedure done. As of now, he has decided not to being bald doesn’t bother him that much. In fact, he doesn’t think his shorn head looks that bad on him. It hasn’t limited his dating life in any way, he notes. Ultimately, though, Gallo wonders whether, for some people, it’s about more than the scalp micropigmentation.

Take a couple of whole mackerel, gutted and cleaned, but otherwise intact, and score through the skin and almost down to the bone. Make four or five slashes, depending on the size of your fish, 2 or 3cm apart. Lay the fish on a foil-lined grill pan. Leave plenty of space between them.Mix together 3 tbsp of olive oil and 2 tbsp of ground sumac. Season lightly with salt. Spoon the dressing over the fish, letting it trickle down into the flesh through the score lines.Place the fish under the grill, about 20cm from the heat, and leave to cook for about 8 minutes, watching carefully.Remove the peel and white pith from 2 oranges with a very sharp knife and slice the fruit thinly. Slice open a pomegranate and pull out the seeds, then toss them with the slices of orange and their juice. Tear 20 small mint leaves to pieces – or chop them roughly – then fold them through the fruit.When the mackerel is cooked, its skin a mixture of shining silver, burnished gold and black bits caught in the heat, remove it and serve with the orange and pomegranate salad. Serves 2.If you have time, let the mackerel sit for a while in the sumac dressing before you grill it. Keep an eye on the fish’s progress, basting it from time to time with any dressing that may trickle off the fish as it cooks. Be brave, let the skin blacken in places.

All companies were due to report by 4 April 2018.Commonly known as the average, the mean is calculated by adding up the wages of all employees and iding that figure by the number of employees. The mean gender pay gap is the difference between mean male pay and mean female pay.The median gap is the difference between the employee in the middle of the range of male wages and the employee in the middle of the range of female wages. Typically the median is the more representative figure, because the mean can be skewed by a handful of highly paid employees.On Wednesday, the BBC will reveal that the pay of its top stars will include more women and fewer men. In addition, it will publish an unprecedented level of detail about star salaries, increasing transparency by reporting pay in £10,000 bands. The corporation currently reports star pay in £50,000 pay bands.“The BBC already publishes more information than any other media organisation, but this year we will be going even further,” said a BBC source, before the publication of the corporation’s annual report for the year to March on Wednesday. “There will be more women in the list, and fewer men than the previous year.”The BBC will also publish details of which programmes’ stars work on to justify their salaries to “ensure that more informed comparisons can be made”.The corporation also intends to publish a table setting out levels of pay to its top male and female stars as a group – not iniduals – in its current financial year to show the “real progress” it has made in boosting underpaid female stars and big name male presenters and talent taking pay cuts.After the resignation of former China editor Carrie Gracie over unfair pay, some of the corporation’s best-paid male presenters – including John Humphrys, Jeremy Vine, Huw Edwards, Nick Robinson and Jon Sopel – agreed to salary cuts. Gracie settled her dispute with the corporation last month.“The job is not done, but we are making good progress,” said a BBC source.However, critics will argue that the BBC has, if anything, become less transparent since spinning off its TV production arm, which makes shows including EastEnders and Strictly Come Dancing and merging it with BBC Worldwide. Top earners including Claudia Winkleman, the corporation’s best paid female star, DIY SOS presenter Nick Knowles and actors from EastEnders, Casualty and Holby City will disappear from this year’s list.At least 35 of the 96 stars on last year’s list could fail to appear because programmes they were paid for in the past year are now produced by the new merged entity, BBC Studios, which is now classed as a commercial entity and will not have to publish how much it pays people.Last year’s list also caused criticism due to some of the high-profile names that were not included. The list only counted remuneration that the BBC determined had been paid directly from the BBC licence fee. This meant it does not include payments to staff through independent production companies that make programmes for the BBC, or payments from BBC Worldwide.As a result, the list still does not include stars such as Sherlock’s Benedict Cumberbatch, Question Time’s David Dimbleby, Have I Got News For You’s Ian Hislop, Sir David Attenborough or Alan Sugar."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d87a449d4b2537bcc243dd917f8606bbf0f3d4fc/42_16_3145_1888/master/3145.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=721c27be1c1a566d27b5bf89ceef1d31","title":"russia 2018 world cup england guardian support","story":"Our senior sports writer Barney Ronay explains how you can help keep the ’s football coverage in playHere we are then. Russia 2018 is already well under way: another impossibly exciting, complex, wild-looking Fifa World Cup. And in its shadow, here we are too.Welcome to another mob-handed, obsessively planned, lovingly curated effort to bring you the  and Observer’s World Cup coverage in every conceivable form, to your every conceivable screen. This is the best bit of covering sport. I’ve been going to tournaments for the  since 2008, and looking back I’m still amazed at the sheer amount of hard work and the sheer volume of content produced around these occasions. From minute-by-minute commentary sent directly to you from the vast pulsing brain of some insomniac footballing obsessive powered only by nicotine, chocolate and a haystack of empty energy drink cans. To on-the-scene reports and news from a band of reporters who write and travel and file and follow stories every day, returning to their families five weeks later hunched, unrecognisable figures unable to communicate on any subject beyond wifi quality, mixed zone ticket allocations and how to get to Salvador protea at 3am with a fair-to-decent chance of not being abducted. At the end of which comes the daily web presence and the pristine design and set of the paper itself. All of this arrives with you updated to the second, cobbled together from the corners of some sock-stinking press room, polished by endlessly patient whip-smart subs and made to look lovely by some sleep-deprived awkward genius of a layout designer. It’s no secret our industry is looking to find ways of continuing to do all this. The old way of selling bits of paper doesn’t seem to work. Advertising is a capricious business.

Read about our favourite 10 and subscribe to the playlistby  Ben Beaumont-Thomas and  Laura SnapesDue in part to some much-lampooned blanket promotion by Spotify, but mostly to his sheer pan-demographic popularity, the new Drake album Scorpion is one of the year’s biggest cultural events, coming at the height of his fame – and his infamy, having sired a child with a woman, he says on the album, he only met twice. As well as this fresh drama, Scorpion shuttles between the standard Drake poles of confected beef, self-aggrandisement and light-hearted croonery like all his albums, it’s too long but still contains plenty of future best-of material. In My Feelings is a highlight – some might see this and his other takes on New Orleans bounce (Child’s Play, Nice For What etc) as defanging the sharp attack of the style, but he cleverly pairs its propulsion with a much more romantic mood. It’ll have you dancing around in a pale pink tracksuit in no time.This month saw another two drops from the rapper’s upcoming album Queen, which she has been talking up as her greatest yet. The big single Bed, reuniting her with Ariana Grande, is a little underwhelming compared with their great ode to cervical bruising, Side to Side, but Rich Sex is richly satisfying. While Minaj is always remarkably on point at speed, it’s her slower flows, where she lets each word roll round her lips and slope off her tongue, that are among her best (think Beez in the Trap), and this is a classic example. Lil Wayne also turns up with a gross but gorgeously elastic guest verse.Adopting someone else’s persona in pop is tricky to pull off: unlike film and literature, you don’t see the narrative devices and simply have to trust what you hear. Sometimes it’s awful – see Lil Dicky – but sometimes, as on Ebony Bones’ first single in three years, it’s bold and daring. No Black in the Union Jack focuses on the overt racism and xenophobia legitimised by Brexit. It samples Enoch Powell’s “rivers of blood” speech and the sound of two neighbours laughing as they exchange racist epithets, while Bones adopts the racists’ mindset in her own lyrics: “Red, white and blue  Let ‘em in to smash the system now the country is screwed,” she raps coolly over a stark, looped beat that clatters and glowers. It’s not quite the British answer to Childish Gambino’s This Is America, but it’s close.Blawan has been a UK techno hero for years now – tracks like 2012’s wildly catchy Why They Hide Their Bodies Under My Garage? showcased his talent for pounding kicks and nagging melody, while his most famous moment remains his Brandy-sampling funky house cut Getting Me Down. He’s finally released his debut album Wet Will Always Dry: masterful minimal techno in the Nina Kraviz or Radio Slave mould, where unceasing 44 hauteur is brightened with mischievous licks. Tasser is a highlight: the core drum programming ticks along like a Roomba, but is menaced again and again by a magnificently amorphous cloud of static.When every X Factor contestant and their dog can do a full-tilt Whitney warble, there’s something even more impressive about the kind of singer who keeps their melisma skill hidden, playing it as their ace. To wit, LA synthpop artist Miya Folick’s latest single, where a soaring falsetto high enough to tickle God’s beard bursts unexpectedly from her brow-furrowed verses about feeling a bit drab. It takes Stock Image from subtle greys to blazing colour, while the tense euphoria of the drum machine earns its comparisons to peak Robyn.Another great discovery from the Awesome Tapes from Africa label, which has previously brought us Hailu Mergia, Ata Kak and more, Jess Sah Bi \u0026amp Peter One are a fairly unlikely proposition. A political cartoonist and a history teacher from the Ivory Coast, they made twanging country music from slide guitar, peppy strumming, and yearning vocals in three languages. They got stadium-level massive following the release of their 1985 debut, Our Garden Needs Its Flowers, and ended up moving to the US. Currently working on music separately, there are reunion plans for later this year once the album is back out.This Swedish classic rock band, now 10 years and four albums deep, are utterly, brilliantly preposterous. Powered by the same combination of riffs, synths and peacocking used by their compatriots Europe, and with a fixation on outer space, their tightly harmonised oeuvre begs to be hollered wearing a wolf’s pelt while riding a hoverboard. Speedwagon is glorious, nodding to its AOR namesake as well as Thin Lizzy, ELO, Hall and Oates, Bon Jovi and every glam metal band ever, all condensed into a hyper-melodic ball of hair and chrome. Rock song of the year?Still bashing out existential freakouts set to bourgeois garage rock, Interpol retain their uniquely anxious energy on their first new track in four years. The major label sheen that left some of their albums feeling genuinely empty rather than performatively so has gone, thankfully replaced with blown-out drums and scuzzy rhythm guitar Daniel Kessler’s pealing lead could have come from Obstacle 2 on their debut. As ever Paul Banks’s voice, delivering poetry that seems to yearn for sexual and spiritual uplift, is the last word in seedy NY cool.The Duluth trio aren’t short of menace at the best of times, but they’ve never exuded such a sickly, shuddering spirit as on the three taster tracks from their forthcoming 12th album, Double Negative. Dancing and Blood is the most song-like of these corrosive, ambient oozes: a beat that sounds like heavy steps through coal dust suggests total desolation, while tiny synth flickers conjure images of an abandoned building that still shudders with electric current. It is phenomenally chilling (and reminiscent of Burial at his most haunting) not least thanks to Mimi Parker’s unforgiving judgments echoing through the murk: “All that you gave wasn’t enough.” Highly recommended that you chase this with strawberry ice cream and a Love Island binge. One of last year’s most fascinating reissues was a collection of 1970s and 80s work by Carl Stone, an American electronic composer, touring the UK this week, who timestretches samples and live instrumentation into glitchy burbles or transcendent ambient passages. Just as his peer Laurie Spiegel accidentally invented techno around the same time as the earliest midwest electronic dance music, Stone was understanding the collaged power of sampling at the same time hip-hop was doing so in a completely different way. Now there’s a new compilation of four of his 80s and 90s pieces – all are amazing, but Mae Yao is almost unbearably beautiful. Over 23 minutes, what starts as choppy gamelan glitching gets smoothed out by a wondrous set of quavering, manipulated tones. Is it a voice, an instrument, the wind? The point is that Stone uncouples it from recognisable timbre, leaving it as pure, contextless sound – a staggering announcement of the universality of beauty."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4d5da4e881e28bb10ea993cdecb063d148022e1f/693_754_4307_2584/master/4307.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9b6d6ff27dc7341f47111be83b1c38e4","title":"the staggering rise of indias super rich","story":"India’s new billionaires have accumulated more money, more quickly, than plutocrats in almost any country in history. By  James CrabtreeOn 3 May, at around 4.45pm, a short, trim Indian man walked quickly down\u0026nbspLondon’s Old Compton Street, his head bowed as if trying not to be seen. From his seat by the window of\u0026nbspa\u0026nbspnearby noodle bar, Anuvab Pal recognised him instantly. “He is tiny, and his face had been all over every newspaper in India,” Pal recalled. “I knew it was him.”Few in Britain would have given the passing figure a\u0026nbspsecond look. And that, in a way, was the point. The man pacing through Soho on that Wednesday night was\u0026nbspNirav Modi: Indian jeweller, billionaire and international fugitive.In February, Modi had fled his home country after an\u0026nbspalleged $1.8bn fraud case in which the tycoon was accused of abusing a system that allowed his business to obtain cash advances illegally from one of India’s largest banks. Since then, his whereabouts had been a mystery. Indian newspapers speculated that he might be holed up in Hong Kong or New York. Indian courts issued warrants for his arrest, and the police tried, ineffectually, to track him down.It was only by chance that Pal spotted him. A standup comic normally based in Mumbai, he happened to be in London for a run of gigs. “My ritual was to go to the same noodle bar, have a meal, and then head to the theatre,” Pal said. “I\u0026nbspalways sat by the window. And then suddenly Modi\u0026nbspwalks past. He was unshaven, and had those Apple\u0026nbspearphones, the wireless ones. He looked like he\u0026nbspwas in\u0026nbspa\u0026nbsphurry.”It was another month before the press finally caught up with Modi, as reports of his whereabouts emerged in\u0026nbspJune, along with the suggestion that he was planning to\u0026nbspclaim political asylum in the UK. (Modi denies wrongdoing, and did not respond to requests for comment.) In the process, Modi also gained entry into one of London’s more notorious fraternities: the small club of Indian billionaires who seem to end up in the British capital following scandals back at home.The most prominent among these émigré moguls is\u0026nbspIndia’s “King of Good Times”, Vijay Mallya, the one-time aviation magnate and brewer, who transformed Kingfisher beer into a global brand. A few years ago, Mallya was one of India’s most celebrated industrialists, famous for his mullet haircut and flamboyant lifestyle. But in early 2016, Indian authorities filed charges relating to the collapse of his Kingfisher airline, which\u0026nbspwent bust in spectacular fashion in 2012, leaving behind mountainous debts and irate, unpaid staff. And so, facing allegations of financial irregularities and of refusing to repay outstanding loans, Mallya quietly boarded a plane for Britain, too.Like Modi, Mallya denies wrongdoing. Last month he\u0026nbspreleased a long statement accusing India’s government of conducting a witch-hunt against him. And to the extent that this claim has some merit, it is because Indian prime minister Narendra Modi (no relation to Nirav Modi) has of late been under great pressure to bring supposedly errant tycoons such as\u0026nbspMallya to book.Men like Mallya and Modi were members of India’s expanding billionaire class, of whom there are now 119 members, according to Forbes magazine. Last year their collective worth amounted to $440bn – more than in any other country, bar the US and China. By contrast, the average person in India earns barely $1,700 a year. Given its early stage of economic development, India’s new hyper-wealthy elite have accumulated more money, more quickly, than their plutocratic peers in almost any\u0026nbspcountry in history.Narendra Modi won an overwhelming election victory in 2014, having promised to put a stop to the spate of corruption scandals that had dogged India for\u0026nbspmuch of the previous decade. Many involved prominent industrialists – some directly accused of corruption, while others had simply mismanaged their\u0026nbspfinances and miraculously managed to escape the\u0026nbspconsequences. Voters turned to Narendra Modi, the\u0026nbspself-described son of a poor tea-seller, hoping he\u0026nbspwould deliver a new era of clean governance and rapid growth, ridding India of a growing reputation for\u0026nbspcrony capitalism.Narendra Modi pledged to end a situation in which the country’s ultra-wealthy – sometimes called “Bollygarchs” – appeared to live by one set of rules, while India’s 1.3 billion people operated by another. Yet\u0026nbspas they continue to hide out in cities like London, men like Mallya and Nirav Modi have come to be seen as representing the failure of that pledge the Indian authorities “have a\u0026nbsplong road ahead”, as one headline put it in the Hindustan Times last year, referring to a “long and arduous” future extradition process in Mallya’s case.And as Narendra Modi gears up for a tough re-election battle next year, he is fighting the perception that India is unable to bring such men to heel, and that it has been powerless to respond to the rise of this new moneyed elite and the scandals that have come with them. “This ongoing battle to get India’s\u0026nbspbig tycoons to play by the rules is one of the biggest challenges we face,” says Reuben Abraham, chief executive of the IDFC Institute, a Mumbai-based thinktank. “Getting it right is central to India’s economic\u0026nbspand political future.” India has long been a stratified society, marked by\u0026nbspisions of caste, race and religion. Prior to the country winning independence in 1947, its people were\u0026nbspsubjugated by imperial British administrators and myriad maharajas, and the feudal regional monarchies over which they presided. Even afterwards, India remained a grimly poor country, as its socialist leadership fashioned a notably inefficient state-planned economic model, closed off almost entirely from global trade. Over time, India grew more equal, if only in the\u0026nbsplimited sense that its elite remained poor by the standards of the industrialised west.But no longer: the last three decades have seen an extraordinary explosion of wealth at the top of Indian society. In the mid-1990s, just two Indians featured in the annual Forbes billionaire list, racking up around $3bn between them. But against a backdrop of the gradual economic re-opening that began in 1991, this has quickly changed. By 2016, India had 84 entries on the Forbes billionaire list. Its economy was then worth around $2.3tn, according to the World Bank. China reached that\u0026nbsplevel of GDP in 2006, but with just 10 billionaires to\u0026nbspshow for it. At the same stage of development, India had created eight times as many.In part, this wealth is to be welcomed. This year India will be the world’s fastest-growing major economy. During the last two decades, it has grown more quickly than at any point its history, a record of economic expansion that helped to lift hundreds of millions out of\u0026nbsppoverty.Put another way, India has created a model of development in which the proceeds of growth flow unusually quickly to the very top. Yet perhaps because Indian society has long been deeply stratified, this dramatic increase in inequality has not received as much\u0026nbspglobal attention as it deserves. For nearly a century\u0026nbspprior to independence, India was governed by\u0026nbspthe British Raj – a term taken from the Sanskrit rājya, meaning “rule”. For half a century after 1947, a system dominated by pernickety industrial rules emerged, often\u0026nbspknown as the Licence-Permit-Quota Raj, or Licence\u0026nbspRaj for short. Now a system has grown in their\u0026nbspplace once again: the billionaire Raj.The rise of India’s super-rich – the first and most obvious manifestation of the billionaire Raj – was propelled by domestic economic reforms. Starting slowly\u0026nbspin the 1980s, and then more dramatically against\u0026nbspthe backdrop of a wrenching financial crisis in\u0026nbsp1991, India\u0026nbspdismantled the dusty stockade of rules and\u0026nbsptariffs that made up the Licence Raj. Companies that had been cosseted under the old regime were cleared out\u0026nbspvia a mix of deregulation, foreign investment and heightened competition. In sector after sector, from airlines and banks to steel and telecoms, the ranks of India’s tycoons\u0026nbspbegan to swell.Nothing symbolises the power of this billionaire class more starkly than Antilia, the residential skyscraper built\u0026nbspin Mumbai by Mukesh Ambani, India’s richest man. Rising 173 metres above India’s financial capital, the steel-and-glass tower is rumoured to have cost more than $1bn to build, looming over a\u0026nbspcity\u0026nbspin which half the population still live in slums.Ambani owns Reliance Industries, an empire with interests stretching from petrochemicals to\u0026nbsptelecoms. (His father, Dhirubhai, from whom he inherited his company, was one of the main beneficiaries of the economic reforms of the 1980s.) At Antilia, Ambani entertains guests in a grand, chandeliered ballroom that takes up most of building’s ground floor. There are six storeys of parking for the family’s car collection, while the tower’s higher levels feature opulent apartments and hanging gardens. Further down, in sub-basement 2, the Ambanis keep a recreational floor, which includes an indoor football pitch. Antilia became an instant landmark upon its completion in 2010. The city had long been a place of stark isions, yet the Ambani’s home almost seemed to magnify this segregation. (A spokesman for\u0026nbspReliance did not respond to a request for comment.)Unsurprisingly, some feel resentful. “You walk around\u0026nbspthe streets of this city, and the rage at Antilia has\u0026nbspto be heard to be believed,” Meera Sanyal, a former international banker turned local anti-corruption campaigner, told me in 2014. Six years before that, in 2008, as the scale of India’s billionaire fortunes were becoming clear, Raghuram Rajan – an economist who would later become the head of India’s central bank – asked an even more pointed question about his country’s\u0026nbsptycoon class: “If Russia is an oligarchy, how\u0026nbsplong can we resist calling India one?”In spring 2017, I met Mallya at his London home, a\u0026nbspGrade I-listed town house a short walk from Baker Street tube station. A variety of Rolls-Royces and Bentleys were parked along the mews at the rear, alongside a fat silver Maybach with the number plate VJM 1, which idled outside Mallya’s back door. Inside, he\u0026nbspsheltered behind a grand wooden table, a gold lighter and two mobile phones lined up in front of him. At one point I asked to be excused to visit the toilet. A flunky ushered me into a golden bathroom, with a shiny gold seat to match its golden taps and loo-roll holder. The fluffy hand towels were white, but each one came embossed with\u0026nbspthe letters “VJM” in gold thread.On the surface, Mallya still seemed every bit the ebullient tycoon of old: a bulky man in a red polo shirt, with gold bracelets on each wrist and a chunky diamond ear stud. But by then he had been stuck in Britain for more than a year, and grew downbeat as the afternoon wound on and our conversation turned to his business troubles and the state of his homeland. “India has corruption running in its veins,” he said with a sigh. “And that’s not something one is going to change overnight.”With his shoulder-length hair and taste for bling, Mallya had long honed an image as the most piratical of India’s generation of entrepreneurs. A specially kitted-out Boeing 727, its bar well-stocked with his own Kingfisher beer, whisked him between parties and business meetings – a distinction that was, in any case, often hazy. “It was all a bit ridiculous,” one ex-board member at a Mallya company told me.Now marooned in London, Mallya had plenty of time to ponder his missteps. Once a member of the Rajya Sabha, the Indian upper house of parliament, his diplomatic passport has been cancelled. As a long-time UK resident, he was permitted to stay in the country, but\u0026nbspwithout travel documents he was unable to travel, curtailing his notorious jetsetting lifestyle almost entirely. Earlier this month, a UK court issued an order allowing authorities trying to recover debts to enter his\u0026nbspvarious British properties.In his pomp, Mallya seemed to represent a new India. In a country whose old commercial elite had been dominated by cautious, discreet industrialists, Mallya was different: rich, powerful and not inclined to hide it. Not all of India’s pioneers behaved in this way – its software and IT billionaires, for instance, were typically less flamboyant figures. But while Mallya continues to\u0026nbspdeny that he did anything wrong, he admits that he\u0026nbsphas become what he calls the “poster boy” for a moment of public anger against India’s rich, as many newly wealthy business figures found themselves mired\u0026nbspin allegations of wrongdoing.India’s old system created fertile ground for corruption, forcing citizens and businesses alike to pay\u0026nbspmyriad bribes for basic state services. But these humdrum problems were trivial compared with the grand scandals that emerged during the 2000s. Assets worth billions were gifted under the table to big\u0026nbsptycoons by senior politicians and bureaucrats in what\u0026nbspbecame known as the “season of scams”. Giant kickbacks helped businesses acquire land, bypass environmental rules and\u0026nbspwin infrastructure contracts. Headlines filled up with fresh outrages, from fraudulent public housing schemes to dodgy road-building projects.Many of those who backed India’s economic reforms hoped that a more free-market economy would lead to more honest government. Instead, crony capitalism infiltrated almost every area of national life. Hundreds of\u0026nbspbillions of dollars were siphoned away, according to some estimates, by a shadowy alliance of colluding politicians and business tycoons. India’s old system of\u0026nbspretail corruption went wholesale.Many politicians also became astoundingly rich, and would have made the Forbes list had their holdings not been hidden carefully in shell companies and foreign banks. Rapid economic growth increased the value of political power, and what could be extracted from it. Political parties had to raise more money, to fight elections and fund the patronage that kept them in\u0026nbspoffice. One estimate suggested that India’s 2014 election\u0026nbspcost close to $5bn, a huge increase over the cheap and cheerful polls of the pre-liberalisation era. Election experts believe most of this money is brought in\u0026nbspillegally from favoured tycoons, in exchange for unknown future favours.Politicians spend the money to fund campaigns, but\u0026nbspalso on handing out favours, jobs and cash to constituents. “It’s sort of an unholy nexus,” as Raghuram Rajan put it to me during his tenure as head of India’s central bank. “Poor public services? Politician fills the\u0026nbspgap politician gets the resources from the businessman politician gets re-elected by the electorate\u0026nbspfor whom he’s filling the gap.”This nexus between business and politics lies at the heart of the third problem of India’s billionaire Raj, namely the boom-and-bust cycle of its industrial economy. In recent decades, China went on the largest infrastructure building spree in history, but almost all of it was delivered by state-backed companies. By contrast, India’s mid-2000s boom was dominated almost exclusively by its private-sector tycoons, giving the industrialists and the conglomerates they run a position of outsized importance in India’s economic development.Bollygarchs borrowed huge sums from state-backed banks and invested with gleeful abandon, in one of the largest deployments of private capital since America built its railroad network 150 years earlier. But when India’s good times came to an end after the global financial crisis, the tycoons’ hubris was exposed, leaving their businesses over-stretched and struggling to repay their debts. In 2017, 10 years on from the crisis, India’s banks were still left holding at least $150bn of bad assets.Since taking office, Narendra Modi has tried, often ineffectually, to fix this corporate- and bank-debt crisis, alongside the related problems of cronyism and the super-rich that contributed to it. Watching developments such as these, some argue that the power of India’s tycoon class is fading. Yet India’s ultra-wealthy are still\u0026nbspthriving, while its ranks of billionaires keep swelling,\u0026nbspand will continue to do so.There is every reason to believe that on its current course, the country’s the gap between rich and poor will\u0026nbspwiden, too. Perversely, the closer India comes to its achieving its ambitions of Chinese-style double-digit levels of economic growth, the faster this will happen. On most measures, it should already be ranked alongside South Africa and Brazil as one of the world’s least-equal countries. Even more importantly, poor countries that start off with high levels of inequality often struggle to reverse that trend as they grow richer.Many experts believe India needs to act. “The main danger with extreme inequality is that if you don’t solve this through peaceful and democratic institutions then it will be solved in other ways … and that’s extremely frightening,” as French economist Thomas Piketty has said of India’s future, pointing to likely rising future tensions between the wealthy and the rest.India is now entering a new phase of development, as\u0026nbspit tries to follow Asian economies such as South Korea and Malaysia out of poverty and towards full “middle-income” status. There is no reason this cannot happen. But as we’ve seen in Latin America, the economies with the widest social ides have tended to be the\u0026nbspones that are most likely to get stuck in the “middle-income trap”, achieving moderate prosperity but failing to become rich. The more successful countries of east Asia, by contrast, grew prosperous while managing to stay egalitarian, partly by building basic social safety nets and ensuring that their wealthiest citizens paid their taxes. Of the two models, it seems clear which India should want to follow.Much the same is true of corruption. India’s old system of cronyism, with its political favours and risk-free bank loans, has came under intense scrutiny, but\u0026nbspthe battle against corruption is at best half-won. Kickbacks still dominate swathes of public life, from land purchase to municipal contracts. State and city governments are just as venal as ever. Surveys report that India remains Asia’s most bribe-ridden nation. “For\u0026nbspany society to lift itself out of absolute poverty, it needs to build three critical state institutions: taxation, law and security,” according to the economist Paul Collier. All three in India – the revenue service, the lower levels of the judiciary and the police – still suffer endemic corruption. Perhaps most importantly, the country’s under-the-table political funding system remains largely untouched.Progress in fixing India’s problems of corporate and bank debt has also been frustratingly slow. Modi has introduced some important measures, including a new bankruptcy law and a series of bank recapitalisations. But more radical options have been ignored, notably the\u0026nbspprivatisation of struggling public-sector lenders.India’s own Gilded Age is different in many ways, but it shares at least one characteristic – namely, that such a\u0026nbspperiod of early industrialisation is also a time of rapid political and economic change, in which it should be possible to invoke what the philosopher Richard Rorty once called the “romance of a national future”, the sense of hope that infuses powers on the rise.India is set to grow in economic might throughout this century, as America did during the 19th. By some accounts, it has already overtaken China as the world’s most populous nation in others, the baton will pass during the next decade or two. Whatever the case, the fate of a large slice of humanity depends on India getting its economic model right. Meanwhile, as democracy falters in the west, so its future in India has never been more critical. To make this transition, India’s billionaire Raj must become a passing phase, not a permanent condition. India’s ambition to lead the second half of the\u0026nbsp“Asian century” – and the world’s hopes for a fairer and more democratic future – depend on getting this transition right.

But he warned: “We need clarity for these negotiations to move forward for the time is very short.”Barnier said he had never been shown how Brexit provided added value when the world faced challenges from terrorism and climate change to migration, poverty and financial instability.“It will be clear, crystal clear at the end of this negotiation that the best situation, the best relationship with the EU, will be to remain a member,” he said.Barnier added: “No deal is the worst solution for everybody. It would be a huge economic problem for the UK and also for the EU. I’m not working for that deal, I’m working for a deal.”Barnier’s comments come after days of upheaval in the UK, since Theresa May’s attempt to bind her cabinet to an agreed approach to the Brexit negotiations triggered the resignations of the Brexit secretary, David Davis, and foreign secretary, Boris Johnson.Johnson used his resignation letter on Monday to claim that the UK was “headed for the status of a colony” under May’s soft Brexit plans, which would keep closer ties to the European Union than hardline Conservatives want.Asked if May’s weakened position put negotiations at risk, Barnier said: “To be sincere, I don’t want to make any comment on domestic and national policy in the UK. I have met many people with different views. I have listened to everyone and will continue to do so. But as EU negotiator I will negotiate only with the British government … so our next negotiations will be next Monday with the British delegation appointed by Mrs May.”He said the detailed UK proposals would be assessed in the light of the EU’s clear position on the inisible four freedoms of movement of people, goods, services and capital. The EU is ready to start negotiating on free trade and customs agreements with the UK, he said.“If it is well understood, these principles, which are the foundation of our union, we would start a constructive discussion, with the UK on two aspects of the negotiation, a free trade agreement and a customs arrangement. The solution will, however, have to be workable and realistic, it should not lead to red tape and cost for citizens and businesses.”A draft withdrawal agreement was signed in March, with several areas signed off including the Brexit bill most but not all issues relating to EU citizens and some issues relating to Ireland, including the common travel area. The UK leaves the EU on 29 March 2019. There is an October deadline to reach a withdrawal agreement and the latest round of negotiations is due to take place next week – with the new Brexit secretary, Dominic Raab, replacing Davis at the table.May is facing the risk of a confidence vote from rebellious Conservative MPs and the mood of political chaos will be further complicated by the arrival of Donald Trump in the UK on Thursday for a visit which will be punctuated by protests.Leaving the White House on Tuesday for his flight to Europe, Trump described Johnson as “a good friend” and said the UK was “in somewhat turmoil”.Trump is almost entirely avoiding London during his trip, which will include a Windsor Castle meeting with the Queen and talks with May at the Chequers retreat where, last week, she failed to unite her cabinet around her Brexit plan.During a trip to Scotland in 2016, Trump hailed the Brexit vote as a “great thing” and said the people of the UK had “taken back their country”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e1f3abf0859082dc5d4ca6d498405887ac13e3c3/477_378_4477_2686/master/4477.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cff4c2cae3b52d1cc79e6a672e3c3e74","title":"romans had whale industry archeological excavation suggests","story":"Ancient whale bones have been found on three Roman fish processing sites close to the Strait of GibraltarAncient bones found around the Strait of Gibraltar suggest that the Romans might have had a thriving whaling industry, researchers have claimed.The bones, dating to the first few centuries AD or earlier, belong to grey whales and North Atlantic right whales – coastal migratory species that are no longer found in European waters.Researchers say this not only suggests these whales might have been common around the entrance to the Mediterranean in Roman times, but that Romans might have hunted them. They add that Romans would not have had the technology to hunt whale species found in the region today - sperm or fin whales which live further out at sea - meaning evidence of whaling might not have been something archeologists and historians were looking out for.The right whale was once widespread in the North Atlantic, with breeding grounds off the northern coast of Spain and north west Africa, but was hunted by Medieval Basque whalers among others, and are now only found in the Western North Atlantic. Grey whales disappeared from the North Atlantic some time in the 18th century, and are now only found in the Pacific.Until the recent discoveries it was unclear whether the whales’ habitat had ever included the Mediterranean: the region is southerly enough for the animals to potentially calve there after feeding in more northerly areas. While there are a handful of historical reports of right whales cropping up in the Mediterranean, the only reliable grey whale sighting in the region was in 2010 and is thought to have been a misguided inidual that turned up from the Pacific.Writing in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B, Rodrigues and a team of archeologists and ecologists, describe how they set out to unpick the issue by examining 10 bones – thought to be from whales – collected during recent archeological digs or housed in museum collections. These bones came from five sites – four around the Strait of Gibraltar and one site on the coast of north-west Spain, three of which were linked to the Roman fish-salting and fish-sauce making industries.The team combined previous anatomical analysis with new analyses based both on DNA extracted from the bones and their collagen – a protein whose makeup differs between groups of species, and which degrades more slowly than DNA.While one of the bones was found to be from a dolphin and another from an elephant – possibly a war animal – three were identified as grey whales, and two as North Atlantic right whales with another also suspected of being from this latter species. All were found by carbon-dating as being from either Roman or pre-Roman times – findings backed up by dating based on information from the archeological sites.The team say the discovery suggests grey and North Atlantic right whales were common in the waters around the Strait of Gibraltar during Roman times, since whale bones rarely end up in the archeological record and they are not prized possessions. This theory is backed up by writings from the time: Pliny the Elder – a fervent naturalist who died down the coast from Pompeii during the volcanic disaster – appears to reference whales calving in the coastal waters off Cadiz in the winter in his Naturalis Historia. And if the whales were present, the team say, it is possible the Romans hunted them.The team say the location of the bones, and other evidence, suggests whales might even have entered further into the Mediterranean sea itself to calve.Dr Vicki Szabo, an expert in whaling history from Western Carolina University said the study offered a rare glimpse into the past habitats of the whales, and backed up ideas that industrial hunting might have happened far earlier than widely thought, although its scale is unclear. “Whales are considered archaeologically invisible because so few bones are transported from shore to site, so I think in that context this concentration of species that they have is meaningful,” she said.Mark Robinson, professor of environmental archaeology at the University of Oxford, said there have been suggestions for a decade that some Roman sites with fish vats in the region might have been linked to whaling. “The Greek author Oppian, writing in the 2nd century AD, describes whales being hunted in the Western Mediterranean by harpooning them on the surface, also using tridents and axes to kill them, lashing them to a boats and then dragging them to the shore.” However Dr Erica Rowan, a classicist at Royal Holloway, University of London, said while the study suggests the habitats of the whales probably extended to include the Gibraltar region, how common the whales were and whether the Romans industrially hunted them as they did fish such as tuna them remains unclear – not least because the study included just a handful of bones from a period ning several hundred years. “I think that if these whales were present in such numbers and were being caught on an industrial scale that we would have more evidence, perhaps not in the zoo archaeological record but in the ceramic record and in the literary sources,” she said. “The Romans ate and talked about an enormous variety of fish and seafood, and if whale was widely exploited and exported, then it is strangely absent from many discussions.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fe73444d5fb214c7d4c5c83984dc432ee6743cd6/0_120_2980_1788/master/2980.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=10d20e607833adf24478746a69b21399","title":"england women cricket odi series win new zealand derby","story":"England Women easily sealed their series win against New Zealand, winning the second one-day international by 123 runs to take an unassailable 2-0 lead in the three-match series.The player of the match Tammy Beaumont continued her incredible run of form, top-scoring with 67, while another clinical all-round performance from England’s bowlers ensured their opponents fell embarrassingly short of the target, bowled out for 118 in 38\u0026nbspovers as Sophie Ecclestone and Katie George finished with three wickets apiece.“It is really great to get the series win,” Beaumont said. “I’m having a lot\u0026nbspof fun – I think that’s why I’m batting well at the minute. Our bowling\u0026nbspunit\u0026nbsphas been exceptional the entire summer – we’ve played on some belting wickets for batting and\u0026nbspour bowlers have stepped up every\u0026nbspsingle time.”It was the 19-year-old left-armer George who set up the New Zealand collapse, removing Sophie Devine and Amy Satterthwaite in successive overs to leave New Zealand 26 for two in the fifth. While the full toss that Devine sent into the hands of Amy Jones at cover was not one for the highlights’ reel, the ball that got Satterthwaite certainly was, seaming into the left-hander to hit the top of her off stump.By the time George struck again in the 30th over, her off-cutter breaking through the defences of Lea Tahuhu, the game was all over bar the shouting. In between times the New Zealand batting line-up had looked frankly bewildered against the spinners, Ecclestone’s first six-over spell yielding two wickets for seven runs. Of all New Zealand’s batting collapses on what is turning into proving a miserable tour of England, this was probably the worst.The captain, Suzie Bates, said her side had “let themselves down”. She added: “We couldn’t get any partnerships together. We prepared well but there are no excuses for the way we have performed so far. We have to look at what we are doing and find a way to get better.”Earlier, England had themselves been wobbling at 57 for two before Beaumont took control of the innings, demonstrating impeccable footwork as she took on the spinners, sending Leigh Kasperek’s third delivery of the day over the top of the umpire’s head on her way to a 76-ball 67.Nat Sciver, with whom Beaumont shared a 57-run partnership, also continued her return to form with a half-century of her own, her first in ODIs since the World Cup final last July. “Nat and I put on a brilliant performance,” Beaumont said. “It is all about having a bit of a vibe with your partner.”Beaumont was eventually dismissed leg-before by Jess Watkin – a third umpire review to ascertain whether the off-spinner had overstepped failing to save the England batsman – while Sciver fell to a breathtaking one-handed catch from Bates, snatched out of mid-air at mid-off. But, while neither could push on to a big score, on a slow pitch their runs ultimately proved plenty."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c79aca8f085eb341ef409641d31854fc134ef465/0_360_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5d62b16e9f7c99f8254642060b04a424","title":"fernando gaviria wins tour de france stage four cycling","story":"Fernando Gaviria took his second win in the 2018 Tour de France, winning stage four from La Baule to Sarzeau in Brittany by outsprinting Peter Sagan at the climax of a four-kilometre straight leading to the line. The Colombian’s victory came in the home town of the local mayor and UCI president, David Lappartient, whose war of words with Team Sky’s principal, David Brailsford, escalated on Tuesday as Brailsford was accused of insulting France.On Sunday Brailsford told the  that Lappartient had the mentality of a “local French mayor” and to become more presidential the Frenchman had “got some work to do”.On Tuesday, asked to respond to Brailsford’s comments in the aftermath of the Chris Froome salbutamol case, the Frenchman initially said he “didn’t really want to reply” but quickly warmed to the task. “The last person who called me a ‘Breton mayor’ didn’t have much luck. It was Brian Cookson,” he said referring to the former UCI president he ousted in an election last autumn.On the road the atmosphere seemed less volatile, with Team Sky’s Geraint Thomas suggesting the fans were less hostile, before admitting that it was “hard to tell a ‘boo’ from a ‘Froome’.”If the booing has subsided, the crashes continue. A pile-up five kilometres from the finish split the bunch and left Rigoberto Urán, second in last year’s Tour, frantically chasing with his teammates, although Gaviria’s compatriot did eventually rejoin the main field.The day’s breakaway of four riders, two Frenchmen, Jérôme Cousin and Anthony Perez, and the Belgians Dimitri Claeys and Guillaume Van Keirsbulck mirrored the nationalities in the first World Cup semi-final. But as the foursome closed on the finish line in Sarzeau their chances of bringing a stage win home looked doomed.Fifty kilometres from the finish a crash among the pursuers stalled the peloton’s effort and allowed the quartet to move further ahead. However, once the Quickstep team of the sprinter Gaviria, who claimed the first yellow jersey of the 2018 Tour, moved to the front of the field their chances of staying away were over.For the first time Mark Cavendish was present at the stage finale but his hunt for stage wins goes on. In past years the straight, slightly uphill run to the line would have been ideally suited to the Manx rider but he failed to add to his stage victories.“So are we really surprised that we’re not lining up like the Quickstep team? Well, right now we can’t,” he added. “Then you hope for luck, but luck in the Tour comes and goes. But it’s wrong to say that Mark doesn’t have the form. Once we see him sprinting, then we can judge his form. We can’t judge it yet.”At the back of the peloton the American rider Lawson Craddock maintained his lonely progress, racing most of the stage 100 metres behind the main field, to guard against another fall on the broken scapula that is hampering his progress.Although the Texan has a black eye and intense pain in a shoulder he is continuing. “Two opinions matter,” his team manager, Jonathan Vaughters, said. “The doctor’s and the rider’s. If he’s safe to race, and the doctor says it’s OK, we leave it up to the rider.”Education First say Craddock is managing his pain with a combination or paracetamol and Ibuprofen. Asssuming their rider survives until Sunday, Craddock will then have to race over 21.7km of cracked and ruptured cobbled roads, known as the ‘Hell of the North’, in the stage to Roubaix. “That will be the hard one,” Vaughters added. “The pain will have had to subside a lot for him to be able to survive that day.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7b794827b3187e079b25bfda8598444b34d76858/187_0_5625_3375/master/5625.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2b54ac34cab3a15fbac75d59a61cd46b","title":"microsoft launches smaller cheaper surface go to rival the ipad","story":"New 10in Windows 10 tablet is half the cost of Surface Pro, aimed at Apple’s iPad and Google’s Chromebooks but running OfficeMicrosoft has unveiled its direct challenge to Apple’s iPad, the cheaper, smaller and lighter Surface Go 2-in-1 Windows 10 tablet.The Surface Go resembles other models of Microsoft’s successful Surface tablet range, but has a smaller 10in screen, is 8.3mm thick and only weighs 522g. But the biggest difference is the price: the Surface Go starts at £380 in the UK and $399 in the US, which is half the price of the cheapest Surface Pro tablet.Panos Panay, chief product officer for Microsoft, said: “Surface Go is small and mighty, giving you the performance you need to be productive.“When we designed this device, we had to ask ourselves what people want and need from a 10” Surface. The answers seem obvious – lightweight, productive, and accessible to more people.”Unlike the more powerful Surface Pro tablet, the Surface Go has Intel’s seventh-generation Intel Pentium Gold, which Microsoft says balances power consumption with performance, for a battery life of nine hours.The Surface Go has Microsoft’s high-resolution PixelSense screen technology, including support for the Surface Pen stylus, with its full 4,096 levels of pressure sensitivity and very low latency. The tablet also has its own version of the detachable keyboard from the Surface Pro, and the built-in kickstand that supports up to 165-degrees of angle.The new tablet is also the first to have both USB-C and Microsoft’s Surface Connector, following the introduction of USB-C to the Surface Book 2 in December. The Surface Go also has a microSD card slot, a headphone socket and Microsoft’s Windows Hello facial recognition camera for unlocking the device. It runs in Windows 10 S mode out of the box but can be switched to regular Windows 10 at any time.While questions remain around customer demand for a lower-power Windows machine from Microsoft, experts were broadly positive about the introduction of a cheaper Surface device, saying that it made Microsoft’s offerings more competitive with Apple’s iPad and Google’s Chromebooks, which have found success in the education market.“Microsoft is getting more aggressive with the Surface portfolio. It’s a logical move to make the Surface concept more accessible,” said Geoff Blaber, from CCS Insight. “There is a question mark on power and performance relative to the iPad. The Surface Go is a prime candidate for Arm-based chips from Qualcomm to provide an experience much closer to iPad in terms of battery life. While this design cycle missed that opportunity I’d fully expect future products to go down that road.” “The Surface Go is an excellent proposition. ‘Built for Office 365’ is a nice way of saying - it is not your mainstream laptop (and it shouldn’t be),” said Rushabh Doshi, mobility analyst at Canalys. “Definitely gunning for the value-conscious iPad Pro aspirers. And will be interesting to see if it can make a dent in education.”The Surface Go will be able to pre-order with either 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage or 8GB and 128GB from today in the UK, US and several other countries shipping on 6 August. A version with 4G LTE broadband will be available later in the year."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/856284cf29c77f652dfc7554a03585851b9c8c79/0_52_2040_1224/master/2040.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5d316911a0b6ea34f18768cfcb79d7dd","title":"bold as bauhaus how the legendary schools lost typefaces were recreated in pictures","story":"Experts have trawled the archives at the renowned German school of design, to create a series of fonts from fragments of typeface treasures by original Bauhaus students.

Yes, the show goes down easier with a healthy pour. But maybe not one memorialized with the white bonnet and “Of-insert-husband’s-name” formulations that viewers associate with torture and tyranny. Offred, played by Elisabeth Moss, is imagined as a pinot noir “so beguiling it seems almost forbidden to taste”. This is egregious on many levels, the first being that the grape from which pinot noir is cultivated is known for being thin-skinned, which is how someone who has never seen or read The Handmaid’s Tale would describe Offred. The description refers to both the wine and Offred as “seductive” before stating: “It’s useless to resist the wine’s smooth and appealingly earthy profile, so you may as well give in.” I can forgive the shoehorning in of the word “resist” the way one forgives a bad dad joke: the idea, however, that Offred has any kind of sexual agency in Gilead, that men are simply slaves to her charms, is about as close as you could get to an alt-right reading of the show.Moving on to Ofglen, who over two seasons has been subjected to a forced clitoridectomy and put out to pasture in a cesspool of nuclear waste. Her rebellious streak, according to Lot18’s website, “was the inspiration for this bold cabernet sauvignon – which, aptly, hails from the Rogue Valley”. A bottle of this wine, promising the kind of “pleasure and enjoyment” proscribed in Gilead, will cost you $20.And, finally, a bordeaux blanc in recognition of Serena Joy, the televangelist-turned-trophy-wife cut from the cloth of conservative ideologues like Phyllis Schlafly and Ann Coulter. In bordeaux form, though, Serena Joy is “sophisticated, traditional and austere”, a wine we are advised not to “judge too quickly” or we might miss out on “a sublime experience”. It’s true that as the show has developed we’ve seen more and more layers of Serena Joy, but this description made me think of Donald Trump’s remarks about “very fine people” at last year’s neo-Nazi rally in Charlottesville, which will kill even the best of buzzes.Lot18, unfortunately, is not the first company to merchandize a show about totalitarianism and ritualized sex slavery. It may not even be the most harebrained attempt: that distinction goes to sleepwear company Lunya, which last spring released a red lingerie silk set named after Offred. The Wing, a women-only social club and workspace in New York City, got flak for its line of Handmaid’s swag, too, which included notebooks and pens embossed with peppy dictums of female empowerment. Laura Bogart, writing for Vulture, noted that the sale of white bonnets, silk-screened T-shirts, and pink matchboxes “exemplifies this tonal disconnect between the rah-rah you-go-girl-ism of the marketing plan and the deeper meaning of the show it’s promoting”.By no fault of its own actors and writers, who make up one of television’s most formidable ensembles, The Handmaid’s Tale has continued to lend its iconography to products that fail to match up to its status. As just about everyone has noted in the last year, the show is especially resonant in today’s political wasteland.

Donald Trump has said he might ultimately impose tariffs on more than $500bn worth of Chinese goods – roughly the total amount of US imports from China last year. Some US business groups and senior lawmakers sharply criticised the latest action on Tuesday, with Senate finance committee chairman Orrin Hatch, a Republican, saying it “appears reckless and is not a targeted approach”.Chinese officials had promised to retaliate with tariffs on US imports, like soybeans, sorghum, autos, whiskey, and other products.\u0026nbspChinese policymakers promised the tariffs would have minimal impact, shaving 0.2 percentage points off of GDP. The ministry of commerce pledged to help affected Chinese companies.Chinese investors and businesses are nervous. Chinese exporters say they have already been hit by a strengthening yuan that has made their goods more expensive.\u0026nbspThe country’s main index, the Shanghai Composite Index, dipped to more than a two-year low in the week the first tariffs were implemented.Donald Trump has said he may ultimately impose tariffs on more than $500bn worth of Chinese goods – roughly the total amount of US imports from China in 2017.The US chamber of commerce, which has supported Trump’s tax cuts and efforts to reduce regulation of businesses, also criticised the administration’s move. “Tariffs are taxes, plain and simple. Imposing taxes on another $200bn worth of products will raise the costs of everyday goods for American families, farmers, ranchers, workers, and job creators. It will also result in retaliatory tariffs, further hurting American workers,” a chamber spokeswoman said. The Retail Industry Leaders Association, a lobby group representing the largest US retailers, said: “The president has broken his promise to bring maximum pain on China, minimum pain on consumers.” “American families are the ones being punished. Consumers, businesses and the American jobs dependent on trade, are left in the crosshairs of an escalating global trade war,” said Hun Quach, the head of international trade policy for the group."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a4f6d20c35c5df461a9f08a1b86884ff3000c55e/0_310_4998_3000/master/4998.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fc89ed7607117ff78cdbb0f205746567","title":"rump trudeau meeting nato summit tariffs clash","story":"Three-quarters of Canada’s trade and millions of jobs could be riding on the allies avoiding a repeat of their frosty G7 meetingThe last time the two North American leaders crossed paths, they started off with a warm handshake. But within hours Donald Trump had lashed out at Justin Trudeau, calling the Canadian prime minister “meek and mild” and accusing him of dishonesty. On Wednesday Trudeau and Trump will again meet at the Nato summit in Brussels, for the first time since the last month’s ill-tempered G7 gathering in Quebec.While they have spoken by phone since then, there’s little to suggest tensions have abated. This month, Canada launched tit-for-tat tariffs against the Americans in the first volley of a trade war between longstanding allies, while on Tuesday Trudeau asserted that Canada had no intention of meeting Trump’s demands that it meet Nato’s benchmark for defence spending.“We’ve got ourselves in a knife fight with a real estate billionaire and we’re not equipped for that,” said John Higginbotham, a senior fellow at Ottawa’s Carleton University and the Centre for International Governance Innovation. “Relations are at as negative a time as I have ever seen, and I’ve been involved in Canada-US relations for about 40 years.”Domestic politics is fuelling some of this confrontation, said Higginbotham, describing Trump’s attacks on Canada and Trudeau as “raw meat” for his Republican base.But Trudeau has also benefited from the clash, with a recent poll suggesting that the majority of Canadians approved of Trudeau’s assertion after the G7 that Canada “will not be pushed around” by the US on trade, despite Trump citing the remarks as the source of his anger. While the Brussels summit will focus on Nato, every interaction between Trump and Trudeau will be interpreted in the context of the tense renegotiations of Nafta, said Dan Ujczo, an Ohio-based trade lawyer with Dickinson Wright.“We can ill afford a bad moment at the Nato summit between Prime Minister Trudeau and President Trump,” said Ujczo. “We don’t need any awkward handshakes or snubs or anything like that.”When it comes to Nafta, much is at stake for Canada the agreement underpins the three-quarters of Canada’s exports that go to the US and roughly 2.5m Canadian jobs that depend on American trade. The Bank of Canada warned earlier this year that uncertainty over Nafta has dampened business investment in Canada.“I really hope Prime Minister Trudeau resists the temptation to join in with European allies and elsewhere to scold the United States,” said Ujczo. “Because we predict that this is going to be a pretty heated atmosphere.”Canada’s approach to the Trump administration to date has sought to strike a balance between pursuing a constructive approach to negotiations while also defending Canadian interests, said Roland Paris, a University of Ottawa professor who served as foreign policy adviser to Trudeau during the prime minister’s first months in office.“It’s obviously difficult with such an irascible partner in the White House, who can launch off on Twitter attacks seemingly without provocation,” he said. “I think that every country in the world is trying to figure out how to manage this unpredictable man.”Canada’s approach to the Trump administration, which has also included an outreach campaign to a wide-ranging network for political and industry contacts, continues to be the right one, he argued. “It’s not just a matter of a charm offensive and win him over and secure a deal – and then it hasn’t happened so it has failed – it’s a matter of managing a very complicated and difficult situation that is changing,” he said. “And the current situation is not good for Canada, but preventing it from getting worse should be the priority.” "},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"The first research excavations at the Co Meath site in more than 30 years have begunPatrick Freyne: Prince should feel at home here, given he looks like a John Hinde postcardOireachtas members begin co-ordinated efforts to field a rival presidential candidateCatherine Noone tweeted and then removed the claim after meeting the royal coupleHundreds of soccer fans, including ambassadors, gather in Dtwo for semi-final clashVaradkar asked about poll on deletion of role in the home article from ConstitutionShane Ross wants reform of selection process as he believes bench is marred by \u0026lsquocronyism\u0026rsquoOireachtas committee told Climate Emergency Measures Bill \u0026lsquolaudable but flawed\u0026rsquoMet \u0026Eacuteireann issues warning as Air Corps helicopters help douse Armagh gorse fireMinister for Health confirms abortion services \u0026lsquowill be provided on a universal basis\u0026rsquoCourt told member of Garda unit watched on as fake explosives delivery arrived at man\u0026rsquos homeDepartment official says demographic bulge will cause pressure \u0026lsquoacross all subject areas\u0026rsquoJim Warny, who lives and works in Ennis, helped set new Irish-British record for cavingBrian O\u0027Driscoll asks royal if football is \u0027coming home\u0027 as he and Meghan Markle attend garden partyThis weekend\u0026rsquos sailing to France cancelled to accommodate Dublin-Holyhead routeInquest told Anthony O\u0026rsquoSullivan suffered fractured skull in 40ft fall after rope snappedCould it ever be on a southerner\u0026rsquos bucket list of things to see?"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3559409.1531166658!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"irish breeder girls sent to australia during famine to be honoured","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe story of 110 teenage girls sent in 1848 from Skibbereen to Australia will be recalled in a bronze sculpture of 110 spoons by artist Toma McCullim. On leaving their famine-ravaged home town, each girl received two dresses, two petticoats, five pairs of stockings, two pairs of shoes, a bible, a bowl and a spoon.This summer, the poignant story of 110 teenage girls sent in 1848 from the devastation of a starving Skibbereen to Australia – where they were referred to as “breeders” – will be recalled in a bronze sculpture and a large piece of Australian sandstone in the West Cork town.“This is a story of bravery, the bravery of women it is a story of heroines,” says Skibbereen-based artist Toma McCullim. The girls from the Skibbereen Union Workhouse were despatched to Australia to provide labour, marry, have children and help colonise the sprawling continent.It’s uncertain how much choice, if any, they had in their departure, the artist says. At the time, 60 people a day were dying in the Skibbereen workhouse, which was rife with disease and hunger.The 110 were essentially “farmed”, says the artist with Uillinn, the West Cork Arts Centre, who has been the driving force behind the year-long 110 Skibbereen Girls public art project.In documentation she studied as part of her research through residencies at Uillinn, West Cork Arts Centre in Skibbereen and at the site of Skibbereen Workhouse, now Skibbereen Community Hospital Campus, the girls were referred to as “breeders”.The residencies allowed McCullim to carry out research and support a variety of tours, talks, film screenings and participatory workshops on the theme of the 110 girls and their journey to Australia.The 110 girls departed for Australia under the Earl Grey Famine Orphan Scheme, named after the colonial secretary who enacted it.This scheme had two aims: to reduce overcrowding in Irish workhouses through an assisted emigration scheme and to send female immigrants to settle in Australia where at the time there were nine men for every woman.The board of s in every union in Ireland put forward the names of suitable girls aged 14-18. An estimated 4,000 girls left the country under the scheme. Skibbereen Workhouse offered the most girls outside Dublin. There are believed to be in the region of 10,000 descendants of the young Skibbereen emigrants.Although the girls did not have to be orphans to be eligible for the scheme, it was stipulated that they were not to be living with their families, be of good character, unmarried and without children so that there would be no impediment to marrying Australian settlers.“Many of them did better in Australia than they could have done in the prevailing conditions in Ireland at the time,” says McCullim.At least two descendants are expected to make the journey to Skibbereen next month for a special ceremony honouring their ancestors’ story.One hundred and 10 bronze spoons have been cast by McCullim from beeswax moulds created by staff and residents at the Skibbereen Community Hospital complex, formerly the workhouse.Throughout this month, the spoons will be embedded in the archway above what used to be the workhouse’s Women’s Entrance, near the site’s famine burial ground.This piece of public art, which will be unveiled by the Australian ambassador on July 20th, will also include an installation of a piece of Australian sandstone, donated by the Australian embassy, which is expected to be placed in front of the archway.The ceremony will take place the day after the prestigious Coming Home: Art and the Great Hunger exhibition of historical and contemporary artwork from Ireland’s Great Hunger Museum, Quinnipiac University in the US state of Connecticut, opens in Uillinn, the West Cork Arts Centre in Skibbereen.The exhibition is on display in Dublin Castle"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3560662.1531257195!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"prince harry hails unique irish uk relationship during dublin visit","story":"Spectators waited for over an hour to get a glimpse of Meghan Markle and Prince Harry as they arrived at Government Buildings to meet Taoiseach Leo Varadkar.  \t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPrince Harry, the Duke of Sussex, meets  Brian O’Driscoll and  Ruby Walsh at a garden party in the British ambassador’s Dublin residence. Photograph: Julien Behal Photography. Prince Harry, the Duke of Sussex, hailed the “unique” relationship between Ireland and the UK when he spoke to guests at a garden party at the British ambassador’s residence in Dublin.In his only public remarks on a two-day visit - the first with his wife Meghan Markle, the Duchess of Sussex, since their May wedding - the prince struck both a serious and humorous tone in his four-minute speech to guests at Glencairn in Sandyford.He opened his remarks with a few words in Irish, addressing Tánaiste Simon Coveney, British ambassador Robin Barnett and “a dhaoine uaisle,” following up quickly with: “Did I get that right?”He did and guests cheered in response.“There are more rugby people than we originally thought,” he joked in response to the raucous cheer.He thanked everyone for the “warm welcome we’ve received since being in this beautiful country” and he thanked the Tánaiste for showing his father, Prince Charles, around Cork when he visited last month.“And it was also very nice to know that he didn’t bore you senseless,” he said of his father.The prince, sharing the podium with the Duchess, the Tánaiste and the ambassador, said his father and grandmother, Queen Elizabeth, had spoken warmly with him of the visits they enjoyed here in Ireland.He and his wife were “so pleased” to make Ireland their “first international visit together as a married couple” and hoped that it would be “the first of many”.“As each other’s closest neighbours, the UK and Ireland’s relationship is unique our shared history is long and complex. There have of course been challenging and at times tragic period of that relationship,” he said.He closed with President Michael D Higgins’s remarks on his visit to the UK in 2014: “We live in each other’s shadows we shield each other, and rely on each other for shelter.”The prince said that sentiment was “as apt now as it was then, as we draw strength from one another as neighbours, partners and above all friends”.The prince, wearing a navy suit, and the Duchess, in a black knee-length cocktail dress designed by Emilia Wickstead, chatted with guests that included former president Mary Robinson, former taoiseach Enda Kenny and members of the Cabinet including Simon Harris and Josepha Madigan.Among the guests were people from the worlds of sports and the arts, who assembled in “pods” on the lawn of the ambassador’s residence.The possibility of England winning the World Cup was an icebreaker in conversations with the Royal visitors.Former Leinster and Ireland rugby player Brian O’Driscoll said he asked the prince: “Is it coming home?” referring to whether England would win.“He didn’t jump at me immediately saying ‘yes it was’, so I am thinking there is either humility or he is not sure whether he is coming home or not,” said O’Driscoll.Actor and author Amy Huberman told the prince that she attended the royal wedding between Prince William and Kate Middleton on her own as O’Driscoll could not fulfill the invite as he was playing for Leinster. She referred to her husband’s circle on the greeting line as the “Bod pod.”Vicky Phelan, the Limerick woman whose case exposed the controversy around the CervicalCheck screening programme, said she was gobsmacked when the Duchess told her she had heard about her story.“She said: ‘I have been following your story you have been doing some great stuff’,” said a dumbfounded Phelan.Actor Barry Keoghan said he previously met the prince at the UK premiere of Dunkirk, the movie he starred in.“He’s cool, yeah. It was nice,” he said. “At the Dunkirk premiere it was a bit more serious with veterans there. With this, he stood and had his chat with us.”Introducing the Duke, Mr Coveney welcomed that “the new generation of the British Royal Family” were continuing to “nourish” Anglo-Irish ties as “the countries seek to navigate a shared and difficult history.”Remarking on England’s success in the World Cup, Mr Coveney said that it was the “first time I can remember that there are probably as many people cheering for England as against England”.There was, however, a hesitant and muted round of applause when he said he would like to see England win the World Cup."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3560472.1531257344!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"newgrange digs are expected to reveal an extraordinary find","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMatthew and Geraldine Stout lead the dig at Newgrange. Photograph: Seamus Farrelly The first research excavations at Newgrange, Co Meath in more than 30 years have begun, after a geophysical survey showed what could prove to be an “extraordinary monument”.The find at the world heritage site has been described as “the most definite, complex and ordered feature ever seen in a geophysical survey in Ireland”, according to DCU medieval historian and archaeologist Dr Matthew Stout who is leading the dig with his wife, Boyne Valley archaeologist Dr Geraldine Stout. The four-week excavations began last week and it may be another week before the team of 18 archaeologists uncover anything of real significance. “It was a lot deeper than we expected, about a metre down,” Dr Matthew Stout said. A survey conducted in 2015 by geophysicist Joanna Leigh, to investigate the feasibility of renovating the old tourist office at Newgrange, clearly identified the substantial site at the back of Newgrange Farm.It suggested numerous large pits, forming two parallel sets extending over 75m, indicating an ancient processional way to Newgrange. The entrance way and perpendicular pits form a passage or corridor, which ends precisely due south of the entrance to Newgrange passage tomb. “It is a huge monument,” said Dr Stout, suggesting “a Neolithic communal routeway”.Ms Leigh has speculated that the site is associated with the passage tombs and is ritual in nature. “It’s the most impressive geophysical underground site that I’ve ever seen,” said Dr Stout after the first week of excavations. “It shows four even rows of pits and ditches and is an extraordinary feature.”It’s the first set of excavations since the 1980s at Newgrange and has been funded with a grant from the Royal Irish Academy with the support of the Redhouse family land owners, the OPW, DCU and Notre Dame University in the US.

Video: Parliamentlive.tv\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTheresa May departs following a cabinet meeting at number 10 Downing Street in London on Tuesday. Photograph: Luke MacGregorBloombergBritish prime minister Theresa May moved to reassert her authority on Tuesday after two top cabinet members quit and launched broadsides against her Brexit plans, winning support from many of her ministers including a leading eurosceptic.Ms May said she had chaired a “productive” meeting of her government, unswayed by the resignations of foreign secretary Boris Johnson and Brexit negotiator David Davis that rocked the government on Monday.Among those rallying around the prime minister was environment minister Michael Gove - a prominent campaigner to exit the European Union alongside Johnson for the 2016 referendum - who said he would not follow suit by resigning.However, the vice-chairs of the Conservative Party, MPs Ben Bradley and Maria Caulfield, resigned their posts on Tuesday because of their opposition to Ms May’s current policy on Brexit.“I fully understand and appreciate the great many challenges you face in delivering on Brexit, not least the balancing act in the House of Commons that constrains your freedom,” Mr Bradley wrote in his resignation later. “However I have come to the conclusion that I cannot in good faith be a spokesman for the party or for Government on this issue, and I cannot with any sincerity defend this course to my electorate, 71 per cent of whom voted to leave the European Union.”With less than nine months until Britain is due to leave the bloc, Ms May is sticking to her plan for a “business friendly” Brexit.She looks set on facing down a rebellion in her Conservative Party, where hardline Brexit supporters are livid over her plans to negotiate “a free trade area for goods” with the EU. One described accepting EU rules as “the ultimate betrayal”.Above a picture of her cabinet, including her new foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt and Brexit minister Dominic Raab after a mini-reshuffle late on Monday, Ms May wrote on her twitter feed: “Productive Cabinet meeting this morning - looking ahead to a busy week.”Her spokesman said she had welcomed the new members of her cabinet and they had discussed the publication of a white paper policy document on Britain’s future ties with the EU and stepping up preparations for any no-deal outcome to the negotiations with Brussels. Other ministers described the meeting as “very good”.“I think it is right that the cabinet backs the prime minister and speaks with one voice and if people don’t do that then they have to go,” justice secretary David Gauke told BBC radio.Ms May must now move quickly to try to win the EU’s support for her Brexit proposal to unblock talks. These have all but stalled because of her reticence of show her cards until now for fear of angering one of the two main factions of her party.German chancellor Angela Merkel arrives in London later on Tuesday for a meeting with May and other leaders to discuss the Western Balkans.The British leader may have stilled the waters over a possible leadership contest, but some Conservative Brexit supporters are still incensed over what they see as her decision to break her promise for a clean break with the EU.“It is the ultimate betrayal of our democracy and people’s belief in it. It’s not even an accidental betrayal, it was planned and plotted well in advance,” said Conservative politician Andrew Bridgen.“Never have so many campaigned for so long and so hard for so little,” he said.But while many Brexit campaigners were still hoping for a vote of confidence to oust Ms May, it is unlikely that they have the numbers. They also are in a minority in parliament to try to change any deal that is agreed with the EU.At a meeting with Conservative politicians on Monday, she was cheered and applauded by many, having warned them that internal squabbling could pave the way for socialist opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn to take power instead.Ms May’s proposals for a future EU relationship after Britain departs from the bloc next March had taken two years of internal government wrangling to agree. But within 48 hours Davis had quit and Johnson followed. The Daily  newspaper ran a photograph on Tuesday of him, pen poised, resigning as foreign minister. Three junior ministers also quit their posts.“Brexit should be about opportunity and hope,” Mr Johnson said in a scathing resignation letter that was echoed in headlines in a number of Britain’s national newspapers. “That dream is dying, suffocated by needless self-doubt.”Meanwhile, US president Donald Trump has said the UK is in turmoil and suggested that his meeting with Russian president Vladimir Putin would be the easiest of his trip to Europe to see Nato leaders and Ms May.Speaking as he boarded Marine One, Mr Trump said: “It’s going to be an interesting time in the UK and an interesting time at Nato. We will work it out and all countries will be happy.“So I have Nato, I have the UK — that’s a situation with turmoil. And I have Putin. Frankly, Putin may be the easiest of all.”On his trip to Europe, he added: “It’s going to be an interesting time in the UK and an interesting time at Nato. We will work it out and all countries will be happy.“We do have a lot of allies. But we cannot be taken advantage of. We’re being taken advantage of by the European Union. We spend 75 per cent on Nato and frankly, it helps them more than it helps us.”–ReutersPress AssociationDeal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

storm chris could end british heatwave forecaster","story":"digitalservices@telegraphdigitalservices@telegraphThe UK has been basking in a record heatwave for weeks, but the end of the hot weather could be near as a tropical storm heads towards British shores.Tropical storm Chris is likely to become a hurricane as it crosses the Atlantic and could bring wind and rain to the UK by the weekend.Nicola Maxey, the Met Office spokesman, said that tropical storm Chris, which is currently gathering off the US east coast will influence the weather but we cannot tell what that influence will be at the moment because it is still developing.There is still uncertainty about the possible track the storm will take and, if it did hit the UK, it would no longer be at hurricane strength.June saw the hottest weather since 1940, and least rainfall in 23 yearsBritain has enjoyed temperatures more than ten degrees above the average so far this summer, and it was previously thought the warm and dry weather would continue until the end of July.However, gardeners and farmers will be pleased, as the dry weather has harmed crops and gardens, as well as depleting reservoirs and sparking water warnings from utilities companies.And while the much-needed rain could hit this weekend, warm weather is still expected for the next few days.Average summer temperatures are 19C (66F) but across the UK we have seen 10C above that, according to Ms Maxey.She said a blip in the current hot weather on Tuesday, that is not down to Chris, is seeing temperatures in the south east drop to around 23-25C (73-77F) and further north to 21-22C (69-71F) in Birmingham or 17-18C (62-64F) in Newcastle, but temperatures will increase a few degrees to the weekend.Ms Maxey said: Certainly next week after ex-hurricane Chris has passed through we are looking at weather that is more mobile or normal (for this time of year) but that is not to say that we will not have another hot spell of weather.US

The resolution ultimately passed but not before world health officials were shocked at the behaviour of the US delegation at the May UN World Health Assembley\u0026nbspin Geneva, the New York Times reported.\u0026nbspEcuadorians, facing having important military aid from the US rescinded on top of harsh sanctions on critical goods, backed down. But, the US did not threaten Russia in the same manner.\u0026nbspAn unnamed Russian delegate said the country stepped up to back and help pass the resolution because they felt\u0026nbsp “it is wrong when a big country tries to push around some very small countries, especially on an issue that is really important for the rest of the world.The delegation was also opposed to another section of the resolution which called on countries to curtail promotion of products that medical experts agreed could cause harm to children according to more than a dozen delegates to the health meeting, the majority of whom requested anonymity because they feared retaliation from the US, according to the newspaper.Though US\u0026nbspefforts were unsuccessful since the bulk of the original wording survived two whole days of procedural talks, language calling for “inappropriate promotion of foods for infants and young children to end was removed due to US efforts.\u0026nbspThe US mission to the UN nor the State Department responded to a request for comment.\u0026nbspIt appeared,\u0026nbsphowever, the US was asking to have the language removed as a sign of support for the $70bn\u0026nbspinfant formula industry which relies on mothers not exclusively breastfeeding. Baby food lobbyists were in attendance as observers to the meeting.The US also reportedly threatened to cut its contributions to the World Health Organisation - the US contributes almost 15 per cent of the agency\u0027s budget or $845m last year - if the resolution was introduced and passed.\u0026nbspIn light of the threat on Ecuador, other poorer countries in Latin America and Africa refused to introduce the resolution out of fear of American retaliation which left Russia to push it through.\u0026nbspBreastfeeding in public controversiesA woman has sparked a heated debate among parents after she revealed that she breastfeeds both her and her friend\u0027s son.

In an effort to stay one step ahead of its rivals, Snapchat\u0026nbsphas consistently pioneered new features for its messaging app, such as self-destructing messages, augmented reality capabilities and the Story format.Similar versions of these features have routinely been picked up by Snapchat\u0027s\u0026nbsprivals, with Facebook deploying several of the functionalities to its stable of messaging services and apps.Earlier this year, Snapchat\u0026nbspCEO Evan Spiegel spoke out about allegations that Facebook consistently copied the app\u0027s most popular features, saying he wished the internet giant would also copy his firm\u0027s values.\u0026nbspReferring to the data scandal surrounding Facebook, in which personal information of 87 million users was exploited by a third party for the purpose of political profiling, Mr Spiegel said:\u0026nbspWe would really appreciate it if they copied our data protection practices also.Snapchat above Times Square in New York March 12, 2015 (REUTERSLucas Jackson)Rumours of the unreleased feature come as Snapchat unveils Lens Explorer, a major new feature that allows users to search for thousands of augmented reality Lenses built by people through the\u0026nbspLens Studio app that was launched last year.The messaging app claims to have the world\u0027s most engaged and creative AR platform, with over 70 million Snapchat\u0026nbspusers engaging with them each day.We\u0027re excited by the loyalty, creativity, and variety of experiences we\u0027re seeing from the Lens Studio community to date and are committed to continuing to invest in the platform, making AR creation accessible to anyone and bringing more and more erse experiences to Snapchatters, a spokesperson for the firm said.\u0026nbspEnter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Conditions are such that detainees suffer mental health problems which sometimes lead to\u0026nbspsuicide attempts, according to the charity.Thousands of innocent asylum seekers –\u0026nbspoften fleeing war and torture – are detained each year and\u0026nbsplocked up indefinitely\u0026nbspwith no support, the charity warned.In the first intervention of its kind by a major charity, the Red Cross calls for significant reforms including a 28-day limit on detention. It found cases of asylum-seekers being detained for as long as two years and seven months.Home Office separating scores of children from parentsHome Office makes almost £100m profit from children\u0027s citizenship feesHome Office separating scores of children from parentsFive of the 26 detainees interviewed\u0026nbspfor the report had attempted suicide while they were detained, and\u0026nbspjust 25\u0026nbspof them\u0026nbspsaid they had been given no access to mental health\u0026nbspsupport services.Pregnant women continue to be “needlessly detained” in breach of the Home Office’s own guidance –\u0026nbspwith 47 pregnant women detained in the year to June 2017.The charity said the\u0026nbsp“overly onerous and traumatic” experience of attending immigration reporting centres\u0026nbsp– which many are required to do every every two weeks – should be overhauled by banning the practice of detaining people when they turn up.Mike Adamson, chief executive of the British Red Cross, said: “Most of the people in the UK asylum process have fled conflict or persecution to find a place of safety. They have already experienced more trauma and anguish than the rest of us could possibly imagine.“The threat of detention without notice hangs over many people going through the asylum process in the UK.\u0026nbspOur research shows that not knowing whether this week will be the week they are detained again, can make the process of having to report regularly extremely distressing.“This can exacerbate existing mental health issues and mean people never truly feel free.”Shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said the Red Cross report was a “damning indictment” of how the government treats migrants and refugees.“We know from the Windrush scandal that people are wrongly detained,” she said.\u0026nbsp“Some suffer indefinite detention without legal representation. The government needs to introduce some humanity into the immigration system,” she said.Figures obtained by the Red Cross through freedom of information requests show that of 14,733 asylum seekers who left detention in 2016, nearly half (42 per cent) had been detained for between 29 days and six months, with 10 per cent held for more than four months.The charity recommends that the Home Office allows people to live in their communities while their immigration cases are resolved by replacing the systems of detention and reporting with end-to-end, community-based alternatives.The Home Office told The Independent it had noted the recommendations from the report and was also carefully considering the contents of the Stephen Shaw review into the needs of vulnerable detainees, which is set to be published this month.The warnings come amid mounting criticism of the UK’s immigration detention system, which currently holds around 26,500 people each year and around 2,500 at any given time. Britain is the only EU country without a statutory time limit for the detention of migrants.Recent figures obtained by The Independent revealed at least one person a day needs medical treatment for self-harming in removal centres, while the prisons watchdog described conditions in the centres as “prison-like”.In May the Home Office came under fire\u0026nbspwhen it emerged that proven torture victims were also being detained.Inspectors from HMI Prisons joined growing calls for a time limit, warning of a “deep level of emotional distress” and rising number of suicides, and noting that 50 per cent of detainees were eventually “released back into the community”.UK news in picturesSerena Williams celebrates after winning against Camila Giorgi during their women\u0027s singles quarter-final match on the eighth day of Wimbledon.

It would be a huge economic problem for the UK and also for the EU. I’m not working for that deal, I’m working for a deal.”Brexit so far: in picturesBoris Johnson MP, Labour MP Gisela Stuart and UKIP MP Douglas Carswell address the people of Stafford in Market Square during the Vote Leave Brexit Battle Bus tour on 17 May 2016.

The tie had explosive potential. England would face the host nation of a tournament boycotted by its own government. Russia would face the declared enemy the focus of four\u0026nbspmonths of relentless propaganda on state TV. It would have been an existential showdown.\u0026nbspTwo missed penalties later, Wednesday’s semi-final tie was turned on its head. Russians had a new dilemma: Croatia\u0026nbspor England?\u0026nbspThe choice is not as straightforward as it might seem. Yes, Britain is not\u0026nbspflavour of the month. But Russia’s relations with their fellow Slavs are far from simple.\u0026nbspTheir complexity was underlined with a leaked video showing Croatian defender Domagoj Vida performing a populist, pro-Ukrainian greeting. That video earned him a FIFA censure.\u0026nbsp“The Vida incident has changed things for many Russians,” says Anton Prokudin, 21, a customer at the hipster Pivbar bar on the Garden Ring Road in central Moscow. “He should have kept quiet.”\u0026nbspThe student says some of his friends have switched from supporting Croatia. He has decided to stick to Modric and Co – a “footballing” decision. The Croats are “better, more determined” than the English they performed wonders against Argentina.\u0026nbspOthers in the bar said they would support England. Tensions were for politicians and the media, said Sergei Petrov, 32. He was a fan of all things English – the music, the football, the humour. “Sport should be outside of politics,” agrees his wife, Maria Petrova, 28.\u0026nbspEngland\u0027s route to the World Cup semi-finals16 England\u0027s route to the World Cup semi-finalsHere we take a look at the route that has taken Gareth Southgate\u0027s side to the last four.A Harry Kane double got England off to a winning start, although they needed an injury-time winner from the Tottenham front man. A strong start from England was rewarded by Kane\u0027s close-range finish from a corner after only 11 minutes, but Kyle Walker\u0027s handball gifted Ferjani Sassi the chance to equalise from the spot before half-time. England probed without success for the second 45 minutes until, a minute into added-time, Kane\u0027s far post header following another corner sealed victory.Southgate\u0027s side turned on the style against the ill-disciplined minnows, who were 5-0 down by half-time. Panama could not live with England\u0027s strength at set-pieces, which led to John Stones heading the opener and Kane adding number two with a penalty. Jesse Lingard curled in the best of the bunch for number three before another Stones header and another Kane penalty put England in dreamland. Kane completed his hat-trick with a deflection he knew nothing about before Felipe Baloy\u0027s late consolation.Both sides fielded second-string sides, having already qualified for the knockout stages and in the knowledge that finishing second in the group was likely to offer a more favourable route to the final.

They then recovered from conceding a last-gasp equaliser to Yerry Mina, and from Jordan Henderson missing first in the shootout, to win their first knockout game at a major tournament in 12 years.Southgate\u0027s side turned in their best performance of the tournament to see off a team who had kept three clean sheets in four games and contributed to Germany\u0027s early elimination. Harry Maguire\u0027s thumping first-half header got England up and running, with Dele Alli nodding home the second, but Pickford was again the star of the show with a couple of quite brilliant saves.16 England\u0027s route to the World Cup semi-finalsHere we take a look at the route that has taken Gareth Southgate\u0027s side to the last four.A Harry Kane double got England off to a winning start, although they needed an injury-time winner from the Tottenham front man.

A man in a tight black and brown laminated shirt answers only one question – “Croatia” – before returning to drink vodka with his friend.\u0026nbspOthers refused to give their full names.\u0026nbsp“The English are all clowns,” says “Alexander”, 63, a former submariner, who is drinking vodka and beer chasers with fellow military man Vladimir Afanasiev, 66.\u0026nbsp“And don’t get me going on Boris Johnson,” he says. “You won’t like it.”\u0026nbspHis friend Mr Afanasiev said England had never done Russia any favours: “You couldn’t call England a prostitute, that would be impolite. But they do go with whoever they want.” \u0026nbspBoth men would be supporting Croatia at Luzhniki stadium on Wednesday, they said. There was no contest.\u0026nbspThe Croats “may have been Nazis in the Second World War”, says Alexander, but they will always be “closer to the Russian spirit” than the English.From the moment Russia lost on penalties, nationalistic commentators have zoomed in on the Croatian Second World War stance. Some have even drawn a direct line from that to Vida’s pro-Ukrainian video.\u0026nbspBut it is another military campaign – the Yugoslavian wars of the 1990s – that will likely have a larger effect on Russian allegiances on Wednesday.\u0026nbspRussia’s ultras fostered close links with their Serbian counterparts during those years – and a corresponding animosity towards the Croats. T-shirts proclaiming “Kosovo je Srbija” are popular among the Russian ultras crowd. The Serbian question is one of few that unites the movement.\u0026nbsp“Eighty eight\u0026nbspper cent of Russians will be for England,” declares “Mikhail”, a barman at a central Moscow bar associated with footballs’ ultras. “No one is bothered about Skripal, Johnson or politics. The thing that really matters are the links we have with our Serbian friends.”He reveals a tattoo of Dinamo Moscow: “There’s room for only one Dinamo here. No Zagreb. Never.”\u0026nbspWhen Nato embarked on the 1998-9 Kosovo campaign, it was football fan groups who took the lead in organising aggressive pickets of Western embassies. The American embassy came under particular attack, pelted by paint and all kinds of projectiles over several days.Fan leader Alexander Shprygin, considered close to Russian ultras, was one one of the main organisers. He recalls how football fans would ring one another throughout the night to get the numbers together. They then joined forces with nationalist politician Vladimir Zhirinovsky.\u0026nbsp“It was a small, closed world, but somehow, there were enough of us to cause trouble,” he tells The Independent. “We went to every embassy: the French, the British, the Germans, and to the Americans.”\u0026nbspCome Wednesday, England may well find themselves the beneficiaries of additional support from the most unusual of places.\u0026nbsp“The Croats should be an opponent in principle, even if that means supporting the English for a match,” says Mr Shprygin.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Frontex runs an operation off the coast of Italy that works closely with the local coast guard.The EU missions have helped rescue thousands of refugees\u0026nbspat sea, all of whom were disembarked in Italy. Spokespeople at Frontex and Sophia did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Italy has so far refused to take back any migrants stopped at the German border.“Before receiving even one asylum seeker from another European country, we want to see a precise commitment – giving the timetable, costs, means, men and resources –\u0026nbspon how the EU plans to help us defend our external borders,” Mr Salvini said last week.Aid groups and United Nations’ agencies on Friday asked Italy open its ports to rescue ships because the policy could have a high human cost. More migrants could die at sea, or they could be trapped indefinitely in inhumane detention centres, they said.On Sunday, Mr Salvini said the previous government had agreed to welcome migrants rescued by ships participating in the EU sea missions.Mr Salvini said: “With our government, the music has changed and will change”.This comes after a rescue boat carrying 60 refugees arrived in Barcelona last week after being turned away by Italy and Malta.The mayor of Barcelona, Ada Colau, came to the ship’s rescue when she, with permission from the Spanish government, told the crew of the vessel that it could dock.\u0026nbspThe boat, which was said to have had five women, a nine-year-old and four teenagers on board, was turned away by Mr Salvini.He said the rescue boat “can forget about arriving in an Italian port” and then suggested the boat should dock in Malta which he claimed was the nearest port.Additional reporting by ReutersEnter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

All French parties are entitled to money in proportion to the number of votes it receives.The party, which recently changed its name from National Front to National Rally in an attempt to distance itself from racist and antisemitic associations, has long suffered from financial problems.In 2014 it took a loan from a Russian bank, saying it had been refused credit in France. Several banks, including France’s Société Générale and HSBC, refused to open accounts for the party last year.World news in picturesThe last four Thai Navy SEALs come out safely after completing the rescue mission inside a cave where 12 boys and their soccer coach have been trapped since June 23, in Mae Sai, Chiang Rai province, northern Thailand.

Here are the candidates most likely to take over, with odds from Ladbrokes.The Home Secretary is currently the favourite to replace Mrs May if her leadership crumbles.Mr Javid was appointed Home Secretary in the wake of the Windrush scandal and the resignation of Amber Rudd.A known eurosceptic, Mr Javid ended up backing Remain during the EU referendum but is popular amongst the Tory parliamentary party.The MP for Bromsgrove in Worcestershire is a former managing director from Deutsche Bank.Jacob Rees-Mogg, the Latin-fluent millionaire financier and MP for North East Somerset, has emerged as the leading Brexiteer on the backbenches.He has also has garnered a surprise following among many young Tories - including Jungle Queen Georgia Toffolo, who called him a sex god.Devout Catholic Rees-Mogg has made no secret of his socially conservative views, including being anti-abortion and against gay marriage.His plummy tones, double-breasted suits and traditional manner have earned him the nickname The Honourable Member for the Nineteenth Century.Jeremy Corbyn has emerged as the favourite among most bookies as the nations likely next PM.The Labour leader has had to fight constant opposition from his own MPs including a leadership contest after just a year.But the party has swung behind him after a much stronger than expected 2017 general election when Labour picked up 30 seats and Mrs May lost her majority.Despite a study showed the fabled youthquake of support from younger voters did not happen, he is enjoying strong support in opinion polls.He will be hoping Tory infighting over Europe leads to another election, which he has boasted he would win.Environment secretary has achieved a remarkable turnaround since knifing Boris Johnson.His support among party members dropped through the floor and it seemed his chances were gone forever.But Mr Gove, who played a key role in the 2016 EU referendum, has rebranded himself as an ecowarrior and green campaigner as Environment Secretary.Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson is still a hugely popular figure among Tory grassroots and the general public.But his support among fellow MPs seems to have evaporated in the EU referendum fallout.Mr Johnson infuriated David Cameron by using his huge public profile to campaign for Leave.His own leadership bid in 2016 was scuppered by his friend Michael Gove, severely damaging his electoral brand.BoJo has repeatedly pledged his support to Mrs May but has also angered Cabinet colleagues by trying to hijack Brexit talks and demanding extra cash for the NHS.His ambitions for the top job are well known and he is a proven winner, having been elected twice as Mayor of London in a city that heavily favours Labour.Now Foreign Secretary, Mr Hunt is the longest-serving Health Secretary in British history.He left the Department of Health after securing a £20bn funding increase for the NHS.Mr Hunt is known to have leadership aspirations and although he campaigned for Remain during the referendum he has since changed his mind and said he would now vote to Leave because of the arrogance of the EU.Thought an unlikely candidate at the time, the Brexit campaigner reached the final two of the 2016 leadership contest.She withdrew over ill-judged remarks about Theresa Mays childlessness.She is now Leader of the House, and survived in post despite reports Mrs May was planning to cut dead wood in her January reshuffle.Mrs Leadsom had a role in the downfall of Sir Michael Fallon after she accused him of lewd sexual comments.The new Brexit secretary is now in the running after taking Davis vacant spot.He played a prominent role in the Leave campaign and previously served as a Justice minister too.Before he went into politics he was a lawyer, working on EU and World Trade Organisation Law.His appointment has been welcomed by other Leave-backing MPs.But Labour MPs have been circulating a blog-post he wrote back in 2011 where he called for an end to feminist bigotry and said that men were getting a raw deal after new equality legislation.At one time, Ms Rudd was a leading contender to replace the PM but her odds have lengthened significantly following the Windrush scandal and her resignation after misleading Parliament over immigration targets.She has returned to the backbenches after being forced to resign as Home Secretary and is likely to push for a softer Brexit along with other former Cabinet members like Nicky Morgan and Justine Greening.Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond could make a bid for Number 10 after keeping a low profile during the general election.Mr Hammond is seen by supporters as a steady hand, but critics accuse him of trying to kibosh a clean-break Brexit by steering the PM towards keeping close ties.He is seen as one of the leading campaigners for a soft Brexit which often puts him at odds with Brexiteers like Liam Fox and David Davis.Mrs May was humiliated when her snap election backfired last June, costing the party its Commons majority.She also endured a series of mishaps during Octobers Tory Party conference and the fallout of the Pestminster scandal.A survey of Tory members in July showed more than 70 per cent want the PM to remain in post, but that fell to just 26 per cent in February 2018.If Mrs May was to resign there would be likely be a Tory leadership campaign, with the winner crowned PM.Alternatively, Mrs May could lose a vote of confidence, leading to the government falling.In theory, the Queen could ask the Labour leader to form a minority government, but the numbers in the Commons would make it impossible for him to govern.In this scenario, there could well be a fresh General Election with both major parties trying to secure a parliamentary majority.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Heres the latest.Water companies have the power to impose restrictions on how households can use water in times of serious shortage.Providers are meant to cut the following years bills by a reasonable amount to compensate for the limited supply during any ban.The shortages are almost always caused due to a below average amount of rainfall.A drought is when there is an exceptional period of low rainfall - causing reservoirs to run dry.Temporary bans can make it illegal for householders to water gardens or wash the car with a hosepipe.They can also ban people from filling swimming pools, ponds and fountains from the mains supply, and cleaning windows, paths and decking with a hose.Gardeners can still water the plants with a watering can.During hosepipe bans consumers are also urged to be considerate with their water usage.People are asked to have showers rather than baths and to make sure they dont leave taps running while they shave or brush their teeth.Utility firms are given the powers under the Flood and Water Management Act 2010, which extended previous laws.They can limit any or all of the activities, all the time or at set times of the day, for as long as they think necessary.Anyone found guilty of breaking a ban can be prosecuted in a criminal court and fined up to £1,000.While there is not a country-wide hosepipe ban, one has been activated in Northern Ireland - which came into effect at 6pm on Friday, June 29.NI Water chief executive Sara Venning said: We have maximised our water production and need customers help to reduce demand.We are asking customers to take heed of the hosepipe ban and stop non-essential water use - using hoses and sprinklers is causing demand to exceed the capacity to supply.Some water companies have already asked customers to cut back on their use although have stopped short of an official ban.On June 28, Southern Water asked people to spend no longer than four minutes in the shower.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Mass deportations of illegal immigrants? Jawohl!And don’t mention the #RefugeesWelcome hashtag.What a change of heart. Merkel’s solution to the refugee crisis of 2015 was to dismantle Germany’s borders.No elected politician in modern history has ever acted with such monumental, breath-taking arrogance.Merkel’s grandiose virtue signalling unleashed mass, mostly economic migration that continues to this day.More than a million refugees poured into Germany in 2015 alone. They were almost exclusively young men because the old, the sick and children — the most vulnerable refugees and those most deserving of a helping hand — can’t walk the length of the Balkans.Anyone who had doubts about promoting limitless uncontrolled migration was silenced by Merkel’s smug catchphrase, “Wir schaffen das!” — We can do this!But Germany, and Europe, will pay the price for Angela Merkel’s apocalyptic arrogance long after she is pushing up edelweiss.Merkel’s career is on its knees because she permanently changed Germany without ever consulting the German people to see if her policy of the unmanaged migration of one million-plus young males from a totally different culture was actually WHAT THEY WANTED.Merkel never even thought about the wishes of the German people. We hear a lot about the rise of “populism” everywhere from Trump’s America to the new, vehemently anti-EU coalition government in Italy.But there is no great mystery about the rise of anti- establishment sentiment. For decades haughty politicians have viewed their own people with unbridled, undisguised, unapologetic contempt.Now, all over the Western world, they are paying the price.Theresa May should carefully study the fall of Angela Merkel. Whatever the polls might say, few would weep to see May departing Downing Street.It seems increasingly likely, from what we’re hearing out of Chequers, that this prime minister would far prefer to cuddle up to the crumbling EU empire rather than break free and strike trade deals with the US, Australia, Canada, India and China.But if we can’t trade with the world then it is not a soft Brexit. It is no bloody Brexit at all.Her job is not to soften our departure from the EU to such a degree that it becomes meaningless.Whatever her personal preferences, Theresa May’s job, and the historic role that falls to her now, is to honour the referendum of 2016, the vote we were solemnly promised was final by our former prime minister, David Cameron.It is not complicated. Don’t do a Merkel.Theresa May has to respect democracy and the will of the British people.And if she doesn’t or she can’t, if May betrays the British people, if she castrates or buggers up Brexit, if she tells 17.4million that they are ignorant racist bigots who should never have had a vote in the first place, then we are going to need a new prime minister.In Merkel’s spectacular fall from power there is a lesson for every leader in the Western world, especially Theresa May.You are not our master. You are our servant. You do not know best. And you ignore the will of your people at your peril.THIS World Cup has been a revelation. Who knew we would still be working up a sweat long after Germany, Argentina, Brazil and Spain had flown home?Who knew that England could win a penalty shoot-out in a World Cup? Then cruise through a quarter-final?And who knew England could only ever really succeed again – and true success means having a team that we love and take pride in – if we returned to having English managers? All jaw-dropping stuff.Now Alicia Aylies – former Miss France and the girlfriend of France’s fleet-footed Kylian Mbappe – proudly poses in a zippy bralet.Seriously, who had ever heard of the zippy bralet until Russia 2018? The shocks just keep on coming.FOR two weeks every year, the British go crazy about tennis.The Australian Open, Roland-Garros in France and the US Open hardly merit a second glance from the British public but Wimbledon is an essential part of our calendar.Yet this year our attention has been distracted by another sporting event in a distant land. The men’s singles final will overlap with the World Cup Final.But quite frankly, who cares?This year we are lukewarm on Wimbledon.So you had to feel for British wildcard Katie Boulter, knocked out in the second round.There is still plenty of time for Henman Hill or Murray Mound to become Boulter’s Bulge or Katie’s Cusp.LONDON Mayor Sadiq Khan is allowing a Donald Trump blimp to float above London during the President’s visit to the UK.No news yet on if Khan has plans to do anything about the gun, knife and acid epidemic on the streets of London.With well over 1,000 stabbings this year, more than fifty of them fatal, crime in London is out of control.But at least we have that Trump balloon, Sadiq.DIEGO MARADONA was pictured grinning happily in an XXL Colombia shirt before their match with England but was apoplectic in defeat.“You have to denounce this,” fumed Maradona.“As the captain of legends, I have to tell Infantino (Fifa President) this cannot be left like this.“This is a fatal mistake for the whole country.”I’m sure it all sounds much better in translation.But you get the gist – “Our headbutting boys were robbed”.Fifa hands Maradona a reported £7,000 to turn up at every match and the fat man issued a grovelling apology for criticising the ref when he reflected that seven grand might possibly slip through his cheating hands.But you can hardly blame Diego Maradona for sticking up for those grappling, nasty, spiteful, penalty-spot-scuffing Colombians.After all, Diego has done his best to single-handedly prop up one of Colombia’s major exports. And that’s nothing to sniff at.YOUNG mum Claire Morrison, 28, was mortified when her six-year-old daughter Eve took her vibrator to school for show-and-tell because Eve thought it was a particularly interesting looking pen.Some parents might prefer to keep quiet about this mishap, but Claire has gone on Facebook to tell the “hilarious” story.“She just said it was her funny pink pen,” chuckles Claire, a hairdresser from Dundee. “Then she said, ‘It must talk because it needs batteries’. So her stepdad and I laughed that off and we have safely stored it away.”It has now been shared 6,000 times.The story. Not the vibrator. Obviously. That wouldn’t be very hygienic.WE can all understand why David and Victoria Beckham would want to put on a public display of loving solidarity on their wedding anniversary.But I can’t help wondering, does Victoria really need to tell David “I love you so much” via her Instagram account and its 21.3million followers? It seems so extravagantly public.Couldn’t she just give him a card?AFTER careful consideration, MEPs in the European Parliament have voted to keep their £3,900-a-month taxpayer-funded (and tax-free) expenses a secret.Blow me down. Nobody saw that one coming.The generous expenses, known as the general expenditure allowance, or GEA, are paid as a lump sum into the MEPs salary, with no records kept, no receipts required and no questions asked. MEPs can spend it all on prostitutes and Ferrero Rocher chocolates if they want.Nobody cares.The GEA costs around £35million a year.And our corrupt continental cousins wonder why we’re leaving.DAVID Cameron received £800,000 to write his memoirs, which have been unexpectedly delayed until next year.Cameron should tell us why he made it legally binding for this country to spend £13billion a year on foreign aid, why he bombed Libya into the failed state it is today and how he blew £9million of public money on his pro-EU leaflet. And still lost!It also transpires that it was Cameron who begged Barack Obama to say, “The UK is going to be in the back of the queue,” if we dared to leave the EU.You shouldn’t be writing your memoirs, Mr Cameron.You should be writing us a letter of apology.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Of course, our security interests don’t begin and end at our borders, or even at the edge of Europe.Whether it’s Russia, Syria, Afghanistan or beyond, threats continue to emerge and develop around the world.After we leave the EU we will be free to pursue a truly independent foreign policy but that does not mean we will isolate ourselves from our neighbours.Under our proposals, we will continue to consult and co-operate with our EU partners on global issues.We will work with the EU on sanctions like those recently imposed on Russia, including co-ordinating them where it’s in our interests to do so.Our joint work on defence capability and space will continue. And we will decide where our armed forces and foreign aid could be used alongside the EU.Brexit has never been about turning our backs on Europe, pulling down the shutters and keeping ourselves to ourselves.Since well before the EU existed we have traded with and fought alongside allies around the world, and that won’t end when we leave next March.There’s still a lot of negotiating to be done. But our ambitious, effective proposal for a smooth customs arrangement and continued security co-operation is a huge step forward.It’s a good deal for Europe, and a good deal for Britain.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And we’re only at the start of what will be no doubt stormy negotiations for months to come.There remain serious questions about not just the compromise that Theresa May has forced on her Cabinet but on the final deal she plans to sign with Brussels.One, does it genuinely give us the ability to sign free trade deals across the rest of the world, strengthening our links with emerging markets and with the Commonwealth?Two, does it genuinely end freedom of movement, or does the woolly language in Downing Street’s statement still give people the chance to come here on the off-chance they might find a job?Three, can a future Government genuinely seek to diverge further away from the EU in certain areas without Brussels blowing the whole deal up, or charging us a king’s ransom to do so?If the answer to any of those is no, then the Prime Minister will never be forgiven.Not by her party and, as we report today, not by the public either.IT is astonishing that £13,000 of taxpayers’ cash has been dished out to allow a man serving life for murder to indulge his musical passions by staging a rock opera in jail.That’s money taken from the pockets of working families who have to scrimp and save because the taxman milks them at the petrol pump, the checkout till and in their paycheque.Why did the Arts Council think it appropriate to give the fruits of their labour to a monster like Graham Coutts?The law-abiding public deserve so much better.ENGLAND in a World Cup semi-final.

It is a White Flag.We will have a “Common Rule Book” — written by the EU and imposed by the European Court of Justice.These rules will torpedo any trade deal outside the EU. Immigration continues under a scheme which by any other name means free movement.This is not even Brexit In Name Only. It is zombie EU membership — and the UK is the zombie with no say in rule-making and paying through the nose for rule-taking.Of course, we need to be realistic. Compromises are inevitable since we made no plans for No Deal.Thanks to Mrs May’s election horror, the sums do not add up for Brexit. Remainers rule in the Tory Party, the House of Commons and the Lords.Without a heavyweight leader, Brexit Tories know they cannot raise the numbers to oust Mrs May. A failed challenge would only boost her new-found confidence and authority.Michael Gove and others argue a future Brexit Prime Minister — Mr Gove, for instance — could finish the job once we are legally Out.In fact, Britain tends to keep its treaty ­promises.We can’t even count on EU bully Michel Barnier to stir up a revolt. He and German Chancellor Angela Merkel will probably accept Mrs May’s deal, with a few tweaks, because they are effectively its co-authors.The Rule Book will keep us in line — no ­separate trade deals, no sovereign control over our borders, no escaping the ECJ.Brexit Cabinet ministers must accept some of the blame. They failed to force Mrs May when they had a chance to prepare for a No Deal Brexit. That failure instantly handed victory to the Remainers and to Brussels.Should we one day choose to make a clean break, we will face harsh “consequences” — what Boris vividly calls “punishment beatings”.But the biggest punishment beating will come from voters.If the Tories don’t care about the 17.4million who want Brexit, they will be made to care.Constitutional lawyer Martin Howe, a Tory QC, warns we are entering “a worst-of-all-worlds black hole Brexit where Britain is stuck ­permanently as a vassal state.”The fragile Tory lead over Labour has just evaporated. Almost 40 per cent of voters think the PM has betrayed the 2016 referendum result.Tories might not switch directly to Labour, but they won’t forget.

If these then reach fresh water, they can hatch and the cycle begins again.While Schistosomiasis was previously linked to impoverished parts of South America, sub-Saharan Africa where water hygiene is limited, recent outbreaks were reported on the Mediterranean.In 2014,  six people were infected after swimming in the Cavu river, in Corsica.And, according to Professor Hoffmann, global travel and climate change could mean we see parasitic worms continuing to move into parts of Europe and North America.The long-term consequences of increased parasitic worm distributions are difficult to predict, but the harm that infection causes highlights the need for developing control strategies that can mitigate this 21st-century threat to global health.Hoffman and his team are looking into ways to treat and prevent the spread of  parasitic diseases.We’re not at the stage of drug development, but we hope that learning more about the disruption of these proteins could ultimately save lives across the world, he wrote.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

the Irish equivalent of 10 Downing Street.On arrival, the happy couple were shown a plaque laid by Harrys great, great, great grandfather King Edward VII in 1904.The pair were shown a inside where they viewed a stained glassed window representing the four provinces of Ireland - Leinster, Munster, Connaught and Ulster- which prompted a quick chat about the rugby.Former sports minister Mr Varadkar asked rugby fan Harry if he had watched the England versus Ireland game to which he replied: Which one?”The couple turned to wave at large crowds who had gathered behind a rope in a sealed off corridor to catch a coveted glimpse.They were then taken to Mr Varadkars private offices where they were introduced to a number of employees including 18-year-old intern Tabitha Owen, from London, who is on a short summer secondment before starting a PPE degree at Oxford in September.Despite being the newest member of the Royal household, Meghan seemed at ease with the agenda and remained her husband, it was: Time to sign the visitors book.After briefly discussing who should sign first Harry picked up the fountain pen.Signing simply Harry, the Duke joked: I never sign big enough. Then when Meghan - a former calligrapher - signed her name with a flourish, he added: Yours is much nicer than mine.The trip to Dublin is not the first time the Duke and Duchess have been away since their May 19 wedding, which fused tradition with modernity and diversity.The couple managed to slip away unnoticed for their honeymoon, of which the destination continues to remain a mystery.Just hours before setting off for Ireland, the couple stood on the Buckingham Palace balcony alongside the Monarch and other members of the Royal household for the RAF centenary celebrations.Meghan stood regally next to the 92-year-old Queen, as the newest Royal witnessed the biggest flypast in recent memory.The Royal Family this afternoon gathered on the famous balcony to watch as 100 aircraft took to the skies for the celebrations.The Queen particularly seemed delighted with the air show, smiling and clapping as the array of aircrafts, including Red Arrows and Hercules, flew over the palace."},{"url":null,"title":"mcdonalds burger fries ebay price bidders","story":"Dave Alexander wanted to know if the rumours that the chains products last for years without showing any sign of rotting.So on June 7 2012, the farmer, from Ontario, Canada, asked his daughter to pop down to the nearest McDonalds and order a burger and fries.Then he put the meal on a shelf and left it there.After six years Dave decided to put the meal on eBay, with a starting bid of £17.His post, which read ORIGINAL OWNER - Never eaten, is no longer live on the shopping site, but before it was taken down bidding is thought to have reached nearly £50.The farmer claimed on Twitter that the post was removed from eBay because no expiration date had been given for the food item”.Dave told CBC Radio the food looked surprisingly decent still.He added: It basically has petrified itself.

But in practice, how does that work given that most sexual encounters are one-on-one with no witnesses?She can still say yes at the time then later pretend she didn’t and falsely accuse him of rape.And equally, he could pretend she had consented when, in fact, she had screamed no.Perhaps we are moving to an era when all young people will feel compelled to temporarily stall a moment of passion so they can film the consenting “yes” on their mobile phones? Or failing that, perhaps have a solicitor present.ACTRESS Paula Williamson wed “Britain’s most violent prisoner” Charles Bronson last November and said she looked forward to him getting out so they could enjoy a normal marriage.Yet just two months later he allegedly attacked the deputy governor of HMP Wakefield and now, just before appearing via video link at Leeds magistrates court, he tried to take his guards hostage in his cell.Hmmmm. Something tells me that – after spending 42 years inside – 65-year-old Charlie boy has become institutionalised and doesn’t actually want to come out, hence the litany of violent episodes that keep him in trouble and constantly embarrass his trusting wife.It gives a whole new meaning to the term blushing bride.NEW research shows that the ability to ward off fear and unhappiness is a skill that improves markedly with age.An American neuroscientist says the reaction of the old and the young to, say, the imminent results of an election were significantly different.That’s because, when you’ve seen a few governments come and go, we of a certain age eventually realise they’re all as useless as each other and whatever we say or do to try to change that has no effect at all.But if it turns out to be a France v England final, I may be heading home sooner than expected.FORMER Radio 1 DJ “Diddy” David Hamilton has weighed in to the #MeToo debate with his recollection of his Seventies heyday, saying: “We didn’t go around forcing ourselves on women.“It sounds conceited to say it but we didn’t have to because a lot of women were forcing themselves on us.”Meanwhile, Kinks frontman Sir Ray Davies reveals: “A world-famous groupie once threw me out because I was too kind.”A reminder, if needed, that not all men are b******s and not all women are innocent victims.And if further proof is required, look no further than some of the predatory females stalking their male prey on Love Island each night.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The driver of the car was a local man in his 60s and we are speaking to him about what happened.It was fortunate the man on the motorbike was wearing a helmet as his head hit the windscreen which smashed.His wife Amal, 40, rushed to hospital to be at his side and he was discharged just two hours later.Firefighters were dispatched to the scene of the accident as a safety precaution.Clooney was pictured stepping off a private jet with wife Amal and twins, Alexander and Ella, in Sardinia at the end of last month.Even earlier in June, Clooney was seen zipping around the island on a scooter with Amal, 40, hugging him tightly.The A-list couple are believed to have brought their parents to the island to help care for the children while George works.Clooney has been working hard on Catch 22, a six-episode mini-series based on the novel by Joseph Heller.In April, the legendary thespian announced he was cutting down his acting role in the Hulu production so he could focus on directing.George and Amal met back in 2013 when Amal attended a party at the Oceans Eleven stars house in Lake Como, Italy.It was from that moment George made it his mission to land Amal, later taking her on their first date at a plush London restaurant.She explained in an interview with Vogue: I was 35 when I met him. It wasn’t obvious that it was going to happen for me. And I wasn’t willing or excited about the idea of getting married or having a family in the absence of that.

It’s about celebrities improving their image.”Oh, but what record-breaking names they’d assembled.Robbie, Adele, Elton, Ed Sheeran, Coldplay and Stormzy, were just a few of those who didn’t attend.Blue, Coleen Nolan, Amber Davies, from last year’s Love Island, UB40, Kimberley Walsh and Tony Hadley, on the other hand, were all involved, as was JLS’s Aston Merrygold, right, who said, on behalf of the NHS, he was: “Happy to clear my diary.”So we thank him and whoever covered the shift at Domino’s.Job demarcation, though, among the celebs, was a bit vague. A few just seemed to have backing track duties, like Kimberley Walsh who was given the line “What would you do if I sang out of tune?” (IF?)Some were enrolled for the full, record-breaking, Abbey Road finale, while others went on recruitment drives at UK hospitals, where Tony unearthed “the singing ambulanceman”, and Sara set her sights on Debbie “who’s pouring custard on a spotted Dick” — in the staff canteen, rather than the Infectious Diseases Unit.Eulogies to the great NHS god, though, were compulsory and delivered with a glassy-eyed, lip-quivering intensity that has become a very familiar sight these past few months.Good intentions, as we know, though, pave the road to hell. And so it proved with Wednesday’s Big Singalong Live, which kicked off with a parp of a klaxon, from Ashley, and Sara screaming: “Can we now please break that record.”Perhaps we can put what followed down to the swirling p***storm, in North London, or the lack of practice time — they only had six weeks — but, dear Lord in heaven — Russell Crowe didn’t unleash this much hell in Gladiator.Missed cues, frozen screens, flat voices, Tony Hadley giving it the big ’un, on the Abbey Road zebra crossing, with his “woh-oh ohhhs”.Seven thousand drunk Millwall fans chanting: “You’re going home in a London ambulance” could not have been much less unco-ordinated, but would undoubtedly have delivered an equally powerful message about the NHS.Salvation, though, was on hand in the form of Sara Cox.“The results are in and . . . (drum roll).“We almost made it, but it looks like the weather may have rained on our parade. We didn’t break the record.” A MASTERCLASS in scheduling, editing and continuity, from Channel 5, on Thursday night, that began with the very chirpy announcement: “We’ll find out What Happened to Josef Fritzl after brand new Nando’s, A PERi PERi Big Success . . . ”Which isn’t the first thing I associate Josef with, to be perfectly honest with you.

He also took \u0026pound5,000 from the director of a private nursing firm which supplies agency workers to the health service. The donations will raise questions about the 39-year-old’s commitment to the NHS and could embroil him in a conflict of interest row. Theresa May promoted Mr Hancock from Culture Secretary to Health Secretary on Monday after predecessor Jeremy Hunt replaced Boris Johnson as Foreign Secretary. Shadow Health Minister Justin Madders said: “The NHS is our national treasure so it’s a disgrace that Theresa May has appointed a health secretary with links to organisations that want to break it up and sell it off.” Mr Hancock has accepted nine donations worth \u0026pound32,000 from Neil Record, chairman of the Institute of Economic Affairs, official records show. Mr Record, 65, was appointed chair in 2015 after seven years on its board.  The IEA’s head of health and welfare, Dr Kristian Niemietz, has called for the NHS to be privatised and replaced with a private insurance-based system.  Last week, on the 70th birthday of the NHS, the IEA described the service as an “international laggard”, adding that “it  is time to look to the social health insurance systems in Europe”.  Mr Hancock also accepted \u0026pound5,000 in March 2015 from Gurdev Dadral, the director of private nursing agency Swiis, a Mirror investigation found. Mr Dadral could not be reached for comment. There is no suggestion Mr Hancock has broken any rules. But Mr Madders said: “The new Health Secretary must urgently explain whether he still has links with private healthcare firms. “Our NHS is not for sale.” The Department of Health declined to comment tonight. A Government source did not deny the donations had been made but said any suggestion Mr Hancock was contemplating privatising or abolishing the NHS was “wholly wrong”.

We missed Harry Maguire’s opening goal, but we made it back in time to see Dele Alli head us into tomorrow night’s semi-final in Moscow.  The boys were so happy I thought they would burst. They were screaming, jumping on the sofas and hugging each other so much anyone would have thought they were in the winning team. What made the moment so poignant for me was the fact that Joshua’s friends are all from such diverse backgrounds – Ghana, India, Ireland, Spain, Portugal, England –and they were all united behind the national team. I was surprised to get WhatsApp messages from family in America telling me they are backing England all the way. And later that evening driving past an England fan waving a huge St George’s Flag in South London, my aunty insisted on rolling down the car window and shouting, “Come on, England” in her loudest Accra accent and beeping my car horn. “Yeah!” he screamed back.   This talented England team under manager Gareth Southgate have brought the country together in a way I’ve never seen before.  It made me think back to when I was my son’s age. Would I, aged 12, in the late 1980s ever have sat down with my friends to cheer on the England football team? No I wouldn’t.  Growing up in South London, I feared English football fans and the English flag they brandished so menacingly. The St George’s Cross was hijacked by extreme nationalist groups such as the BNP and National Front which used it as their emblem.  For me, my family and friends it signified that, to many people in this country, we weren’t welcome. My memory of English fans then was as drunken, rampaging yobs who felt it was acceptable to hurl vile racist abuse at their own players.  John Barnes has spoken about the abuse he faced on the pitch. The former England player, who had a banana thrown at him during a 1988 FA Cup tie at Everton, said: “Any black player of my generation had it.

Spain is widely known to be a safe country to enjoy a summer trip to. But while most visits are problem free, recently there have been a few incidents that could cause tourists to worry. Football fans have committed public order offences during the World Cup and there was a recent shooting in Benidorm, reports the Liverpool Echo . Here is a list of things the Government is warning people to look out for to ensure a safe trip. Street crime Holiday goers should be alert to the existence of street crime, especially thieves using distraction techniques. Thieves often work in teams of two or more people and tend to target money and passports.  Don’t carry all your valuables in one place, and remember to keep a photocopy or scanned copy of your passport somewhere safe. Many people have their passports stolen while passing through airports, either on arrival in or departure from Spain. Take extra care to guard passports, money and personal belongings when collecting or checking in luggage at the airport, and while arranging car hire. There has been an increase in the number of thefts from hire cars. Remove all valuables from the vehicle when you park or store items out of sight. In some city centres and resorts, thieves posing as police officers may approach tourists and ask to see their wallets for identification purposes. If this happens to you, establish that the officers are genuine and if necessary show some other form of ID.  Genuine police officers don’t ask to see wallets or purses. In any emergency, call 112. To report a crime, including stolen property and lost or stolen passports, visit the nearest Policia Nacional, regional police (Ertzaintza in the Basque Country, Mossos d’Esquadra in Catalonia, and Policia Foral in Navarre) or Guardia Civil Station to file a police report (denuncia). While in Spain, you can also call a dedicated English-speaking police line on +34 90 210 2112.  World Cup Following public order incidents after televised England matches in Benidorm, fans watching England\u0027s semi final clash with Croatia are being advised to xercise caution around the vicinity of Rinc\u0026oacuten Loix. If you’re in the area, you should follow the instructions and advice of the local authorities strict controls on drinking alcohol in the street are in force and anti-social behaviour may lead to prosecution. Attacks Personal attacks, including sexual assaults, are rare but they do occur, and are often carried out by other British nationals. Be alert to the possibility of ‘date rape’ drugs and other drugs including ‘GHB’ and liquid ecstasy. Buy your own drinks and keep sight of them at all times to make sure they aren’t spiked.  Burglaries There has been an increase in reports of burglaries in areas with holiday accommodation and residential areas in major cities. Make sure your accommodation has adequate security measures in place and lock all doors and windows at night or when you aren’t in.  Driving When driving, be wary of approaches by bogus police officers in plain clothes travelling in unmarked cars. In all traffic-related matters, police officers will be in uniform, and all police officers, including those in plain clothes, carry official ID. Unmarked police vehicles have a flashing electronic sign on the rear window which reads Polic\u0026iacutea (Police) or Guardia Civil (Civil Guard), and normally have blue flashing lights. Genuine police officers will only ask you to show them your documents and will not ask for your bag or wallet/purse. If in any doubt, you should talk through the car window and contact the Civil Guard on 062 or Police on 112 and ask them to confirm that the registration number of the vehicle corresponds to an official police vehicle.  Also be aware of ‘highway pirates’ who target foreign-registered and hire cars, especially those towing caravans. Some will (forcefully) try to make you stop, claiming there is something wrong with your car or that you have damaged theirs. If you decide to stop to check the condition of your/their vehicle, stop in a public area with lights like a service station, and be extremely wary of anyone offering help. Only use officially registered or licensed taxis. Lottery scams There have been reports of lottery scams in Spain. A person receives what appears to be official notification from the Spanish Inland Revenue office (Hacienda) that they’ve won the Spanish lottery and should deposit money in a bank account to receive their winnings. It’s likely to be a scam if you haven’t entered a lottery, you’re asked to pay anything up-front and the contact telephone number is for a mobile phone.  Balcony falls There have been a number of very serious accidents (some fatal) as a result of falls from balconies. Many of these incidents have involved British nationals under the influence of drink or drugs. Your travel insurance may not cover you for incidents that take place while you’re under the influence of drink or drugs. Some local councils will impose fines to those caught behaving irresponsibly on balconies or practising ‘balconing’.  Outdoor activities Take care when swimming in the sea as some beaches, especially around Spanish Islands, may have strong undercurrents. Most of them have a flag system but before swimming, make sure you understand the system and follow any warnings (a red flag means you mustn’t enter the water). You should take extra care if there are no life-guards, flags or signs and follow local advice if jellyfish are present. You should avoid swimming at beaches that are close to rivers and don’t dive into unknown water as hidden rocks or shallow depths can cause serious injury or death. Take care when walking along unmanned beaches close to the water’s edge as some waves can be of an unpredictable size and come in further than expected with strong undertows. Further tips can be found on ABTA’s swim safe pages.  Take extra care when planning a hike or walk to check local weather reports for warnings of extreme heat or cold temperatures. The Catalonia region has started billing negligent climbers, skiers and other adventurers who have to be rescued. Crossing between Spain and Gibraltar Spanish border checks can cause delays when crossing between Spain and Gibraltar. There is no charge to enter or leave Gibraltar. Don’t hand over money if you’re approached by anyone claiming that there is a charge. Road travel Driving rules and customs are different from those in the UK and the accident rate is higher, especially on motorways. You must carry two red warning triangles which should be placed, in the event of an accident or breakdown, in front of and behind the vehicle. You must have a spare wheel and the tools to change it. If at any time you have to leave your vehicle due to an accident or breakdown or while waiting for the arrival of the emergency services, you must wear a reflective vest or you may face a heavy fine.

And according to a study, 42% of us have also slept with bedroom windows wide open during the last two weeks. The study was carried out by a British mattress brand, in a bid to discover more about the UK’s sleeping habits during this unusual stretch of warm tempreatures. The poll found that most people have switched their duvet for something lighter for a more comfortable night’s rest and one in five have slept apart from their partner at least once to try and stay cool.  www.Ergoflex asked a total of 2,133 about their sleep patterns since the June 25 when the heatwave really began. The overwhelming majority, 88%, of the people taking part in the survey said that they had lost sleep due to the heatwave. And when asked to estimate how much they had lost since the start of June, the average answer was revealed to be 45 minutes per night, per person 10 hours and 30 minutes in total. More than two fifths of the respondents taking part in the poll confessed that they had slept with their bedroom windows wide open for the majority of nights over the past two weeks, posing a risk to home security. Steve Willis from www.Ergoflex said: “As much as we all love the fact that we’re actually getting a proper summer for a change, there’s no hiding the fact that this country just isn’t cut out for lasting hot weather and it’s clear that our sleep suffers badly as a result.

The nightmare homes are being featured now after the sordid conditions that Catherine Purcell, 68, was kept in became public for the first time.  Shocking photos showing how Ms Purcell lived were part of a trial against her husband and daughter.  The court heard how Catherine died in a cesspit of her own faeces and bodily fluid which chemically destroyed her mattress and bed base, reports the Liverpool Echo.  Husband John Purcell, 72, and daughter Catherine Purcell junior, 35, were cleared of her manslaughter on July 5, at Liverpool Crown Court.  However they were found guilty of neglecting the disabled great-gran, who died while being eaten alive. A High Court judge handed him 18 months in prison, and Catherine Purcell jnr 12 months in prison, both suspended for two years. Graphic images showed the conditions of her home in the Merseyside town of Kirkby. But the Purcell\u0027s rancid property is just one of a number of house of horrors on Merseyside. Here is a look inside six other Merseyside homes and what officials were met with when their doors were opened.  Children forced to live in squalor  These graphic photos reveal a Wirral house of horrors where two children were forced to live in squalor. The alcoholic parents of the children, aged just three and six, were convicted of neglect in 2015 after police uncovered the faeces-littered hovel. The graphic photos reveal soiled linen, pillows and mattresses, dirty dishes piled high in the grubby kitchen and floors covered in rubbish.  Police were appalled after finding a bucket of stale urine in the kitchen, as well as what appeared to be faeces in an upstairs bedroom. Soiled nappies were left lying around the house and stale food had created a haven for germs to breed. The children were taken away from their parents, who cannot be named, after the intervention of social services. Describing the home as filthy and appalling, Judge Dennis Watson, QC, said: This was not something that occurred over night. This was something that developed and became the norm over a period of some months.  Real life Shameless family  This is the home of Ormskirk\u0027s real-life Shameless family who used their bath as a toilet. David Fyles was booted out of his council home in Lea Crescent in 2016 after town hall officers uncovered the house of horrors.  A bath was being used as a makeshift lavatory, because the actual toilet was blocked up with rubbish and mouldy food and piles of rubbish were strewn throughout the three-bedroom home. Doors were smashed off their hinges and neighbours reported how foul smells from the property emanated across the town\u0027s Scott Estate.  Rotting corpse found upstairs  A rotting corpse was discovered in a squalid Merseyside home from hell by health officers who joked: Have you got a dead body upstairs? Police and council officials were called to the house in Knowsley after locals raised concerns because the windows were covered in dead flies. They entered the rancid home to be confronted by an overbearing stench and saw an upstairs doorway surrounded by thousands of the insects.  The body of a man, the son of the homeowners, was found upstairs. Police arrested his sister and his parents on suspicion of concealing a body but charges were never brought. His sister, a mum-of-two, was later convicted of neglect as her two young children frequently stayed at her parents’ hovel home and were“exposed to risk of illness”. The woman was handed an 18-month community order.  Judge Stephen Everett said the punishment would have been sterner had police delays not impeded the case. He added: We will never know in the days or weeks following your brother’s death why nobody did anything.    Terrified dogs left in \u0027unbelievable conditions\u0027   Four dogs, one with a broken leg, were found in a sweltering property in Upton. Woody along with his brother, Duncan, and parents, Patch and Lucy, were found in conditions RSCPA inspector Anthony Joynes described as a house of horrors. The dogs were seized by the RSPCA after concerns were raised over their welfare.    The house had oil heaters turned on full blast, had no carpets, holes in the floor and was cluttered with piles of clothing.   Playground for rats and flies  A Toxteth man hoarded so much junk that his house became a playground for rats and flies. Bill Berry, 55, could not move around his house which was filled to the brim with years of takeaway boxes, newspapers and rubbish. He was eventually unable to get upstairs so ended up sleeping on the sofa. Bill told the ECHO about his ordeal after beating his disorder with help from Liverpool Housing Trust (LHT). He told how his hoarding began after he suffered with depression from being bullied and unhappy at work.   Dogs left to die in agony  Owner Andrew Davies failed to tell anyone her ‘Labradoodle’ cross-breeds, named Koda and Hachi, were in her former property, in Walton, after she moved in with her mum and sister. RSPCA Inspector Helen Smith, called to the house by the landlord on August 8, 2016, was confronted by a grim scene. She found the bodies of the dogs, who were brothers, decomposing in the kitchen of the filthy property – next to empty water bowls.

He was moaning about Britain\u0027s racially diverse society before stating the England football team \u0027doesn\u0027t represent him\u0027. He told the Daily Mirror\u0027s Associate Editor Kevin Maguire, who was hosting the talk show, In fact, it represents everything I\u0027m against.  Shockingly the man said: When you are talking about the subject of race, it goes a lot deeper than skin colour. If you turn the average black man instantly white, you\u0027d still be able to recognise him as a black man. That\u0027s about race, not colour. But Kevin was not standing for the man\u0027s rant.  What\u0027s wrong with you? he asked. So do you want England to lose today? And after Ian replied yes, Kevin added: What, because you\u0027re so obsessed by race and your bigotry, and your prejudice is so poisonous you want England to lose? I just hate seeing my country destroyed by multiracialism and anything that represents multiracialism, Ian replied.  Kevin gave Ian some advice before ending the conversation. I\u0027d just go and make yourself a nice cup of tea, take it into a darkened room, get a bag of frozen peas from the freezer and put them on your head, and just reflect on what you\u0027re saying.

And to the Taoiseach, a special thank you. \u0026#x201CAs some of you may know, he showed my father around his home city of Cork just a couple of weeks ago. So we are very grateful for you for joining us here this evening as well. And also very nice to know he didn\u0026#x2019t bore you senseless. \u0026#x201CMy father was telling us just last week how much he had enjoyed his recent visit and said that each of his visits over the years holds a special place in his memory. \u0026#x201CMy grandmother the Queen also spoke of her own visit in 2011 and the fantastic welcome that she too received. \u0026#x201CStanding here with you on this beautiful evening, it is easy to see why Ireland has such a special place in the hearts of my family and indeed all those who come here. \u0026#x201CWe are so pleased to be here for our first official international visit together as a married couple and we hope it will be the first of many. \u0026#x201CAs each other\u0026#x2019s closest neighbours, the UK and Ireland\u0026#x2019s relationship is unique.

Addressing those gathered, Harry received a number of chuckles, especially when there was a raucous cheer as he began his speech. He joked: There are more rugby people in here than we originally thought. During his speech his also praised Ireland and told how special the country is to his family. He said: “Good evening and thank you for the warm welcome that we have received since being in this beautiful country.  “Meghan and I are delighted to be here in Dublin and in the beautiful gardens of Glencairn.

Our shared history is long and complex. “There have of course been challenging, and at times, tragic periods of that relationship. “Tomorrow we hope to have the opportunity to reflect on some of those difficult passages in our history when we visit Croke Park and the famine memorial. “On this visit we will also celebrate just how much unites us. This is a very special relationship between two proud sovereign countries.  “We share common values, culture, business links, family ties and possibly a similar sense of humour. “Our relationship is of course informed by our history but it is also one which is now dynamic and forward-looking. “This evening, we are extremely fortunate to be joined by many of those who are shaping future of Ireland. You embody the energy which characterises this amazing country. “I have the greatest confidence the friendship, collaboration and mutual understanding that our two countries have built up over the years will endure and it will grow. “I will finish by drawing on the words of President Higgins during his extraordinarily successful visit to the UK in 2014 for which we still remember with admiration.

But it\u0027s not the first time the former actress has visited the area - and in 2013 she appeared to enjoy quite the trip to promote \u0026pound1.77 drinks. Five years ago, when Meghan and Harry were not even aware of each other\u0027s existence, she was starring in the American drama series, Suits, as character Rachel Zane. And along with pals she visited Dublin\u0027s Dicey\u0027s Garden, which describes itself as the most popular venue this side of town, and boasts drinks for just €2 (\u0026pound1.77). She posted to her fans: Dublin, you are beyond lovely. Having the best day and excited for a night @diceysgarden and @krystlenightclub xoxo.  The now Duchess of Sussex then continued the evening at Krystle nightclub, overlooking Dicey\u0027s Garden. But it\u0027s probably very different to where Meghan will be visiting during this week\u0027s trip. Dicey\u0027s Garden has mixed reviews, as well as a 3.5 rating on Trip Advisor, with 35 per cent rating it \u0027excellent\u0027, while 23 per cent branding it \u0027terrible.\u0027 I would recommend to wear shoes you don’t mind getting ruined as you stick to the floor, one reviewer wrote last month. Another added two weeks ago: The state of bathrooms was horrific, all blocked and staff didn’t seem to care when I complained about it. Most toilets blocked throughout the whole evening despite receptionist’s promises that maintenance staff was on the way.  However, in contrast one woman said: Great place! The place was amazing, great vibe and very nice architecture. Music not too bad either! Ps. They have drinks for 2€ and free entry before 7pm. And back in 2013 Meghan seemed to be in agreement. Following her trip this week the tweet has resurfaced and fans are loving it. Meghan has since deleted her Twitter account, but a number of replies to the original tweet are still on the social media platform, which seemingly verify it as genuine. One fan said: Can we all take a moment for the fact that the last time Meghan Markle was in Dublin she was slinging €2 drinks in Diceys. Never forget. Will Meghan take Harry back to reminisce with a €2 cocktail? Probably not if their packed agenda is anything to go by.  The trip signals the start of their first overseas trip as a married couple, and the Duchess emerged wearing an outfit by her designer of the moment, Givenchy. Waiting to greet the royal couple today were Britain\u0027s Ambassador to Ireland Robin Barnett and his partner Agnieszka Kepka. The newlyweds will get a taste of Irish life and learn more about Ireland\u0027s rich history. They will also attend a summer garden party at the British Ambassador Robin Barnett\u0027s residence, where they will meet people from across Ireland\u0027s arts, sports, military and social enterprise sectors.  Their Royal Highnesses will attend the Gaelic sports festival at the Gaelic Athletic Association\u0027s home of Croke Park and head to Trinity College, where they will see the Book of Kells, one of Ireland\u0027s greatest cultural treasures - not to mention it\u0027s tipped as one of the best things to see and do in Dublin .

Like distraught dad Kevin Webster, I too had never heard of the deadly disease until my daughter Lola developed the condition at just two days old, and our world was turned upside down. I’d had the perfect pregnancy and everything seemed to be going to plan, including going into labour on my due date. The hospital I was supposed to have her at was full, so in a no-room-at-the-inn-style drama, my midwife had to ring round to find a hospital that could take us. We made it to the delivery suite at Fairfield General Hospital in Bury, Greater Manchester with only 30 minutes to spare before Lola arrived into the world – a perfectly healthy 7lb 1oz bundle of joy. But two days later, I knew there was something terribly wrong with my baby.  She was burning up and yelped in pain like a little cat when I picked her up. Worried, I asked one of the doctors to look at her, but he tried to reassure me saying I had probably just over-wrapped her and she had colic. But, as a second-time mum, I knew instinctively he was wrong. My one-year-old, Gracie (now 13) had suffered from colic, and this was different. Lola wasn’t too hot because I had her wrapped up – she definitely had a temperature.  So, when a junior doctor popped into our room, I told her my fears and demanded a second opinion. Thank God I did. She got a more senior doctor to take a look and he immediately ordered a lumbar puncture. I remember asking him if he thought my baby had meningitis , and the horror when he said yes. It was like someone had stabbed me in the heart. They scooped my baby from my arms and took her away for the painful procedure to see what was making her ill. At that age, babies are too young for pain relief. Instead, a nurse drip-fed her sugar water to distract her as a doctor drew fluid from her spinal column to test for infection.  I was alone on the maternity ward, desperately trying to phone my husband while listening to other mums coo over their healthy babies. It was the longest hour of my life. Lola was admitted to the special care baby unit, where doctors pumped her tiny veins with antibiotics and antiviral drugs to fight the infection, while they desperately tried to pinpoint what it was. Some of the drugs were so strong I had to sign consent forms and was warned that they may leave her with permanent hearing problems. But I didn’t care – I wanted them to do whatever it took to save my baby’s life. Test after test came back negative – the doctors couldn’t find out what was making Lola so sick. So they just continued with the drugs, as I spent every waking hour at her bedside. As the veins in her tiny hands gave up, they started using the veins in her feet. When they had used all those, they then wanted to use the veins in her head. I refused, and sat for hours holding the tiny cannula into her foot to deliver the last scraps of antibiotic. When they wanted to put another needle into her stomach to take a urine sample, I held her over a tiny potty for hours until she passed water. I didn’t want my baby to have any more needles put into her unless it was really necessary. Our priest came to the hospital to bless Lola. He offered to christen her there and then in case she didn’t make it but we declined, refusing to believe that our baby would die.

He thanked the newlyweds for making the trip to Ireland as their first official overseas trip, adding: “We thank you. Perhaps there is romance in our summer air.”  The trip is the latest in a series of foreign visits the royal family have made to EU member states in the wake of Brexit , as part of a “charm offensive” to renew relationships with countries as Britain prepares for Brexit.   Glencairn House is the official residence of the British Ambassador to Ireland and has been the home to successive ambassadors since the 1950s.

According to authorities, the blaze, which started around 2pm local time, began near the landmark facility in the the southeastern section of Griffith Park at the edge of the observatory grounds. It quickly spread, burning down more than two acres of chaparral and grass, which were dried out after a gruelling weekend heat wave. Thankfully no injuries were reported.  City fire department spokesman Brian Humphrey reported that the blaze posed no immediate threat to the historic observatory building, which is located on the southern slope of Mount Hollywood, nor to any nearby homes.

There\u0027s a ring to be bought, lots of planning involved and of course the pre-proposal jitters. Will they say yes? Will they think you\u0027ve done a good job? There\u0027s also a lot that can go wrong. And we\u0027re not just talking about rejection. Timing can be messed up, people can interrupt - and as one woman discovered, the ring can get stuck inside you. The story of a woman who wanted to give her boyfriend a \u0027Kinder Surprise\u0027 has been shared in a new book by former junior doctor Adam Kay.   Called This Is Going To Hurt: Confessions Of A Junior Doctor, the book provides a novelisation of Adam\u0027s time on the front line for the NHS .  Nestled among the pages is the bizarre story of a proposal gone horribly wrong. The woman, who for obvious reasons remains anonymous, is said to have decided to take advantage of the leap year tradition, that sees women propose to their partners on February 29. For her \u0027romantic\u0027 proposal, she chose to buy an engagement ring, put it inside a Kinder Egg and then insert it into her vagina. The plan was simple - she would suggest some finger-work to her partner, he would discover it, retrieve it and then she would drop down on one knee.  Equal parts unexpected, disgusting and I suppose, romantic, writes Adam. However what the lady hadn\u0027t anticipated, was that the Kinder Egg would get stuck. The egg had been inserted vertically but later turned horizontal inside her vagina. No amount of shoogling from either of them would get this particular goose to lay her golden egg, explained Adam. He added: Remarkably, she was so keen to maintain the surprise she wouldn\u0027t tell him what she\u0027d done or why.

Bernd Grotsch, 47, was found dead at his home in the heart of the jungle on the notorious island of Koh Tao on June 17. The German had recently returned to the island \u0027to tie up some loose ends\u0027 with his 20-year-old motorbike rental business. His family, who described him as \u0027fit\u0027 and \u0027healthy\u0027, claim authorities told them he died of “heart failure” or had been “bitten by a snake”. But they say they haven\u0027t received an autopsy report and believe there is something more sinister behind his death.  The family, from Ingolstadt, Germany, have also complained about his body being sent to the same Bangkok hospital that carried out botched reports on the bodies of Hannah Witheridge and David Miller. The pair were murdered on the same island in 2014. Experts across the world slammed the DNA testing done by the hospital at the time - amid claims it was tampered with in order to scapegoat two Burmese workers currently on death row over the killings. Mr Grotsch\u0027s cousin Christina told The Sun the were no explanation for the death of the dad at his home in Mae Haad. She said: He was fit, healthy and happy. We do not trust the authorities in Thailand, especially since there are some oddities.  To date, no autopsy results have been obtained, only vague explanations and conjectures about an alleged deadly bite by a poisonous snake. Or heart and circulatory failure, without further evidence. Christina claimed the family were initially told Mr Grotsch\u0027s body had been returned to the mainland in Surat Thani. But when they checked again it was still in a temple on Koh Tao. They allegedly put pressure on the German Embassy in Bangkok, and eventually the body was moved three days later. They family had wanted forensic scientist Dr Pornthip Rojanasunand to perform the autopsy as she is seen worldwide as a respected independent forensic physician, according to the newspaper.  However, his body was instead taken to the Institute of Forensic Medicine, which is where the bodies of Miss Witheridge and Mr Miller were taken. Wealthy entrepreneur Mr Grotsch had moved to the island two decades ago, but left in 2016. He started another business on the island of Koh Phayam, before returning earlier this year to tie up loose ends. He had recently split from wife and Koh Tao native, Oey, with whom he has a seven-year-old daughter, Bene. Mr Grotsch is the tenth known foreigner to die in suspicious circumstances on the \u0027death island\u0027 in just six years. Below, we look at the previous cases. 2012 Brit Ben Harrington , 32, died on the island after his motorbike apparently crashed into an electricity pylon.  His mother Pat Harrington did not accept the explanation by Thai police and has spent years fighting for information from the Thai authorities about her son\u0027s death, including submitting Freedom of Information requests to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. Mrs Harrington said she is suspicious of the explanation and had to fight to prevent his body being quickly cremated: [Thai authorities] wanted to cremate Ben the next day, but I screamed and shouted and it was stopped. I had awful problems getting anyone on the phone at first. 2014 Brits Hannah Witheridge and David Miller were murdered as they walked back to their hotel rooms in September 2014. Hannah, 23, from Hemsby, Norfolk, and David Miller, 24, from Jersey, were found dead on Koh Tao on September 15.  Post-mortem examinations showed that the young backpackers, who had met on the island while staying at the same hotel, both suffered head wounds and that Hannah had been raped. Zaw Lin and Wai Phyo were sentenced to death for the killings. But although David\u0027s family called the verdict \u0027justice\u0027, the trial of the two Burmese migrant workers was plagued by accusations of human rights abuses. Nick Pearson , 25, from Derby, was found floating in the sea on New Year\u0027s Day 2014.  His parents believe he was murdered - despite police claims he fell 50ft and drowned. The 25-year-old\u0027s mum Tracey told a documentary about the island she would warn parents not to allow their children to travel to the island. 2015 Christina Annesley , 23, died on the island in January 2015 after apparently mixing antibiotics she was taking for a chest infection with alcohol. But the British holidaymaker\u0027s parents slammed Thai authorities for failing to investigate the death.  Christina, from Orpington, South East London, died shortly after arriving on Koh Tao. Her dad Boyne said a toxicology report was not carried out. Frenchman Dimitri Povse , 29, was found hanged in a bungalow on the island on New Year\u0027s Day 2015 and his death was ruled as suicide despite his hands being tied behind his back. Associate Professor Charnkanit Krittiya Suriyamanee, a criminologist and lecturer at the faculty of social science and humanities of Mahidol University, said he doubted the suicide theory citing some irrelevant evidences, according to Chiangrai Times .  He said that the victim had been drunk to the extent that he was unable to control himself, he would not have been able to tie himself up so tightly that he died of suffocation. He also noted several other odd finds. 2016 Luke Miller, a bricklayer from the Isle of Wight, was found dead in a swimming pool at the Sunset Bar at Sairee Beach on January 8 2016, with an inquest earlier this month finding no evidence he was murdered. He was discovered floating in the water by a member of hotel staff, with his death coming just days after a tragic final Facebook post on New Year\u0027s Eve, in which he said: Can honestly say this new year I am living the dream.  Thai police said a post-mortem examination showed he drowned. But, his sister Maria and the family told the BBC they would not rely on what Thai police said as there was still speculation over the circumstances surrounding the death - and that they had received \u0027different versions\u0027 of what might have happened. 2017 Belgian Elise Dallemagne was found dead and half-eaten by lizards having apparently hanged herself on the island - an explanation rejected by her family. The young backpacker had been living at a yoga and tantra retreat, which neighboured the party island of Koh Phangan, in between travelling round Asia, for two years. She was part of the sect of the Sathya Sai Baba cult movement, and lived with a self-proclaimed guru, and left Koh Phangan on April 17 to return home.  Elise then used a fake name of Elise Dubuis to check into the Triple B Bungalows next to Mae Head Pier on Koh Tao as she travelled via the island on a ferry bound for Chumphon province on her route back to capital Bangkok. But an unexplained fire that evening burned down three bamboo huts - including the one Elise had been staying in. Elise fled 2.5km to through the jungle to Tanote Bay and took a room at the Poseidon Resort where she booked another ticket for Bangkok leaving on April 24. Eight days later when locals living near the island\u0027s idyllic Tanote Bay became suspicious of a monitor lizard going back and fourth into the jungle they discovered Elise\u0027s half-eaten body on May 27 among rocks behind the Tanote Family Bay Resort.

The Duchess of Sussex and husband Prince Harry are in Dublin for their first foreign trip as a married couple.  But just hours into their two-day visit they ran into a spot of bother.  Irish politician Catherine Noone posted on Facebook suggesting Meghan had agreed with the country\u0027s recent referendum result in favour of legalising abortion.  The senator said: A pleasure to meet Prince Harry and the Duchess of Sussex at the British Ambassador\u0027s Residence this evening. The Duchess and I had a chat about the recent referendum result - she watched with interest and was pleased to see the result.  The comments suggest that Meghan may have broken royal protocol by expressing political opinon. Since the 17th century, members of the British monarchy have been banned from doing just that, which includes voting. From an early age, former Suits star Meghan was politically active. Aged just 11 she successfully campaigned to have a washing detergent advert\u0027s sexist language changed. She also said in 2016 she would move to Canada if misogynistic Donald Trump was elected US president.    Senator Noone\u0027s comments were quickly removed and a later tweet simply read: A pleasure to meet Prince Harry \u0026amp the Duchess of Sussex at the British Ambassador\u0027s Residence this evening. Posting a screenshot of her first post, Luke Silke tweeted: The Queen will be cross! He added that Prince Harry is in for an almighty dressing down when they go home.  Daily Mirror royal correspondent Russell Myers tweeted: Astonishing candidness from @  senatornoone  The senator, who chaired the parliamentary committee on abortion, replied: I clarified - it was a very benign chat, she expressed no political opinion. She was interested and charming.

Sara Zagidullina, 17, was attacked by Aleksandra Dulesova and three other young women when they discovered she was seeing a boy identified only as “Igor”, according to police. The shocking ordeal began when the perpetrators broke into Sara\u0027s home, reportedly shaving her head, then forcing her to perform oral sex on them before taking turns urinating on her. After dragging the naked young woman to the bathroom, they allegedly turned the water as hot as possible, inserting the shower hose into her vagina.  Shakira Pellow: \u0027Awful\u0027 final picture of schoolgirl in hospital bed her family want you to see   Police say the ordeal, which lasted for hours, could have killed Sara, who was left in agony on the bathroom floor, while the attackers ransacked her home, stealing money, a laptop and a mobile phone as well as other valuables. Using her last bit of strength, the victim managed to raise the alarm, and was rushed to hospital. There, doctors sadly confirmed that her womb had been badly damaged by the hot water and that she was now sterile.  The incident happened in central Russia\u0027s Perm Krai region in the town of Gubakha after Igor allegedly dumped 17-year-old Aleksandra after she told him she was pregnant. He is then believed to have started a new relationship with Sara, who knew nothing about his past until she was confronted by the angry ex. Aleksandra reportedly warned her victim with the ominous phrase: Leave us alone or I will kill and bury you!  She then gathered her friends Kristina Poyarkova, 16, Maria Sheputaeva, 16, and Anastasia Voronchikhina, 20, allegedly bursting into the victim’s at where they subjected her to the terrifying torture ordeal. Three of the attackers have been arrested and taken into custody, while Aleksandra is under house arrest due to her pregnancy. The four suspects filmed Sara\u0027s torture on their phones and police have found the video, according to reports. All have been charged with sexual abuse and torture of a minor committed by a gang and could face up to 15 years in prison if found guilty.

He was always the same nice lad.“I think that was one of the strengths of the Dundee team that won the championship – we were all good friends. There were no cliques in the dressing-room and none of us let our success go to our heads.“I remember when Alan was at Spurs and I was manager at Hearts, we played them in a friendly. He was a big star, but he was exactly the same as he was when we were at Dens.”“Gillie” scored a club record 169 goals in 190 appearances in dark blue and, after leaving for London in 1964, went on to earn similar legendary status at White Hart Lane, where he formed lethal striking partnerships with Jimmy Greaves and Martin Chivers. None of that came as a surprise to Seith, who rates him as one of the best ever.He said: “Alan was exceptional and a great header of the ball. His timing in the air was the thing and when he jumped he seemed to hang in the air. We knew that if we could get the ball to his head he would score goals.“At Dundee he had a fine partnership with Alan Cousin and he would have been the first to say Alan Cousin’s donkey work was responsible for him scoring as many goals as he did.“With Alan, though, it was not just about his heading, he had two very good feet as well. In fact, I was never sure whether he was left or right-footed.“He had the knack of being in the right place at the right time. He always seems to know where to be, that’s why he scored so many goals.”Former Dundee director and long-time friend, Dave Forbes, also paid tribute. Organiser of a number of events down the years to honour the 1961/62 team, he knew Gillie well.He said: “I knew he wasn’t well and I’m just glad it all seems to have been quite quick and he didn’t suffer for too long.”Particularly after spending 10 years in the limelight at Spurs, where he was dubbed the King of White Hart Lane, Gilzean was famous for valuing his privacy.For a long time after he retired, the native of Coupar Angus did not make many public appearances but, over the past decade or so, was a familiar figure at White Hart Lane on match days and made regular visits back to Dundee.“Gillie was a private man, but he was a gentleman.“I remember when we were organising Dundee’s centenary celebrations he was a big help,” added Forbes.“I am proud, honoured and privileged to have known him as a good friend.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"crossing for busy dundee road welcomed by locals","story":"\t\t\t\t\tResidents on a busy Dundee street have hailed the decision to install a pedestrian crossing.The project will involve closing Fountainbleau Drive, in the Linlathen area of the city, from Pitkerro Drive to Rowantree Crescent from July 23 for five days.Road safety measures will be put in place and the crossing will be installed.People living near the road backed the plan.Brian Cunningham, 48, a domestic worker, said: “The speed that some people go on the road is scary \u0026#8211 it is a long straight street and that is exactly what the boy racers want.“I think it’s a brilliant idea \u0026#8211 it’s been needed for a long time.”Jane Murray, 48, a support worker who has lived on the street for 24 years, said it was a “great idea”.She said: “The road is really busy. “Sometimes when I am trying to get across with my dog, I can be standing there for 10 minutes.“I definitely back the plan.

treats for students, party-goers and shift workers at all times of the day.A student survey has now named the West End favourite as the best place to get “drunk food” in Scotland and sixth best in the UK.The website mystudenthalls said it established the rankings by awarding points based on three main criteria.The first involved the proximity to the area’s university campus or student union.Other measures were opening hours and how much the eatery’s most popular dish costs against the price of a McDonald’s Big Mac medium meal.Dan Bunce, operations manager at Clark’s, said it was wonderful to have been given such a high rating.He said: “This is excellent news.“We have always been popular with students and shift workers as one of the UK’s only all-night bakeries, but we have really noticed

important to that the shop stocks local, independent products.“The owners Kevin and Tracey also make some of their own products which we sell. I love being able to tell the customer that the owners actually made the gift they are buying.”When it comes to working in retail Hannah says the most important thing is how you communicate with customers.She said: “The whole concept of the shop is to give customers that personal touch.“The most important part of that is how we interact with our customers.“The first thing you learn when you start work in the shop is everything else stops when a customer comes in and they become the most important thing.“We always say the staff in here love a chat but there is nothing better than a customer saying they have had a great experience in your store.“I really enjoying being able to serve someone well as that is what they will go and tell friends and family about and recommend the store to them.“You have to be approachable when working in retail and confident and comfortable speaking to people.“Confidence is something I have had to work on throughout my career, but it is something I would urge anyone interested in retail to work on too.”Although Hannah climbed up the retail ladder through working in several shops, there are many courses on offer in Dundee.Dundee and Angus College offer several in both retail and retail management.These include Introduction to Fashion Retailing where students get hands-on experience working within the college’s gift shop.HNC Retail sees students gaining a broad knowledge of the retail industry and the skills and qualities required for a diverse range of careers.The college also offers HND Retail Management where students have the opportunity to gain work experience managing and promoting the colleges pop-up shop, Tempus.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/07/5b434705bb1d3-846x564.jpg ","title":"locals vehemently against plans to withdraw concierge services from dundee multis","story":"\t\t\t\t\tCommunity groups are fighting back against plans to replace caretakers at Dundee’s multis.Hilltown and Lochee residents are calling on Dundee City Council to reconsider plans to centralise the caretakers with a “rapid response” team.Lochee’s Save Our High Street group, Phoenix Residents Group in Whorterbank and the Dundee Pensioners Forum are now set to take to the streets to petition fellow residents – claiming safety is being put at risk.Jayne Kelly, from Save Our High Street, said: “Everybody I have spoken to has been vehemently opposed to it.“For a lot of people, the caretakers are the first point of contact, so we want the council to reconsider this.“There’s a difference between consulting with us and allaying fears on a decision that’s already been made.”The new unit would be based out of Dundee West Housing Office in Lochee and would respond to incidents that are either called in or spotted on council CCTV.

described the loss of the store from the city centre as a blow.A spokeswoman for Argos confirmed its Eastgate Centre would close this month although she declined to specify the reasons behind the closure.\"All colleagues were offered the opportunity to redeploy to our other store in Inverness, which is less than a mile away,\" she said.It is understood the store will close its doors on July 10 (Tuesday).Stewart Nicol, chief executive of Inverness Chamber of Commerce, recalled the retailer had moved several times in the city centre before settling into the Eastgate unit.\"It\u0027 an undoubted blow to the city centre in that it is closing,\" he said. \"It is good that it is staying in the city but it is that whole debate about out-of-town versus the city centre.\"It is quite clear that all High Streets and even shopping centres are under extreme pressure because of internet shopping and the way people choose to shop. There are consequences of the way we shop.\"I think the challenge is to maintain a city centre which is an attractive place to visit and socialise and purchase things.\"Mr Nicol said \"an awful lot of hard work\" remained.\"It is a hard task but I think if the public and private sector work together we can do that,\" he said. \"We need to maximise all the opportunities that there are and the Reinvent The City Centre campaign has highlighted that over many months.\"It is about making the city centre a really positive place to visit whether it is for the shops or socialising or meeting

store","story":"\u0026nbspTHOUSANDS of customers are being contacted following the sudden closure of an Inverness store specialising in mobility aids ranging from wheelchairs to stairlifts.Ableworld has cited an \"exploding\" glass panel and immigration hurdles for the American franchise owner as the reasons behind the closure of its Highland Mobility (Ableworld Inverness) branch in Harbour Road.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThe Cheshire-based company, which is the UK\u0027 largest mobility retailer with more than 30 stores, is now making efforts to contact about 3000 customers, pledging no one will lose out on deposits or delivery of orders. It also aims to guarantee that all commitments to suppliers are fulfilled.The Inverness franchise has been held for about the last two years by American Jack Alldredge who is understood to be from Florida.The company\u0027 managing director Mike Williams said Mr Alldredge had hoped to settle in the UK after visiting the country.\"He loved the idea of living here and fell in love with Inverness,\" Mr Williams said.\"But he has had immigration issues. Sometimes we make it difficult for people to invest in this country. It is a shame.\"For the past 18 months, Mr Alldredge has tried to manage the store from America but the shattering of a glass panel in the building \u0026ndash understood to be leased \u0026ndash was the final straw at the beginning of June.\"Fortunately, no one was hurt,\" Mr Williams said.\u0026nbsp\"In our 18-year history, we have never closed a store apart from relocation so it is sad that after the roof \u0026lsquoexploded\u0026rsquo \u0026ndash which was a glass entrance, leaving a very dangerous situation with other panels \u0026ndash Jack decided to call it a day.\"\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspMr Williams said he was disappointed for Mr Alldredge as well as the store\u0027 three employees including a manager.As the store was operated as a franchise, Ableworld is not obliged to step in but it is aiming to honour commitments to suppliers and customers.\"Although saddened by the situation, Ableworld will ensure that all suppliers of stock to the company will not lose out and either Highland Mobility (Ableworld Inverness) will settle all accounts or Ableworld UK will satisfy all the suppliers,\" Mr Williams said.\"Also no customer will lose out on their present deposits or product delivery of orders.\"Ableworld will be setting up support networks for past customers of products and writing to customers explaining the situation.\"Too many businesses in our industry and others pull the plug and leave their customers and suppliers high and dry which is something we will not do.\"He also revealed the company was actively looking to open another franchise in the Inverness area.Inverness MP Drew Hendry said the store\u0027 closure would be a great loss to many disabled people. Citing the high-profile case of city guesthouse owners Russell and Ellen Felber who are fighting deportation to America, Mr Hendry said this was another example of how immigration policies were not working.\u0026nbsp\"I am already working with countless other local families facing a similar fate, including the Felbers whose ongoing battle to stay in Inverness is utterly heart-breaking,\" Mr Hendry said.Inverness disability rights campaigner David Sansum said there were few mobility aid suppliers in the city while the next nearest store was about 40 miles away in Forres.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\"I\u0026rsquom sure the closure of Ableworld will leave a big gap,\" he said. \"It is shame.\"\u0026nbspIn recent months, there have been a spate of incidents at Inverness retail parks where glass panels have fallen from overhead canopies.In March, Highland Council urged building owners with glazed canopies to check adequate inspection and maintenance arrangements were in place while Inverness South councillor Ken Gowans called for glass panels to be removed from canopies at all the city\u0027 retail parks.Wednesday 11 Jul 2018 4:35

dignity and include prayers for the dead led by Father Maximilian Nwosu of St Mary\u0027 RC Church in Beauly. Her son will also play a lament on Lovat Fraser pipes.But Mrs Fraser acknowledged the mystery surrounding the headless skeleton remained as they still did not know who the woman was or why she was missing her head.\"That is life,\" she reflected. \"How many things in life get closure?

But with the finishing touches applied to the new ground, Moorhouse says it’s “great” that their plans have finally come to fruition.He said: “It feels great and that is the overriding feeling – we feel proud of what we’ve managed to achieve.“We feel relieved because we’ve been so long without our own home and that’s not a nice feeling for anybody.“Contrary to popular belief, it costs an absolute fortune not to have your own ground.“I’ve heard so many things about how we’ve managed to save a fortune and invest it in the team and nothing could be further from the truth.“Playing every game away from home is a costly affair but we now have a place we can call home and we’re proud of it. It looks amazing.“Hopefully it allows us to fulfil our ambitions to play in the Scottish League and that’s not going to stop until we get there.“This year we’ll be equally determined and some of the changes to the squad will hopefully reflect the ambitions of the board, the club and the management team.“This is the platform for us to move on from where we are.“The Highland League is a great league to play in and we have a lot of friends in the Highland League, and they will remain friends. But we need to kick on because we’re an ambitious club.”Cove have encountered several problems over the last three years.Moorhouse added: “We’ve had a number of major obstacles. None of them we could see when we started on this journey.“When we closed Allan Park in April 2015 against Fort William, we didn’t think for one minute it would take three years to get in here.“We had initial issues around the sale of the first ground, to do with the bids that came in, and we lost nine months with that process. The next problem was access to the site. We lost a load of time with that and then we had issues with the weather.“But the design team and professional team that we brought on board to do the construction were first class and here we are now.“But we lost about a year and a half and because of that, it costs you extra money.”Now that the new ground has been built Moorhouse also hopes Cove can attract more fans from the area.He said: “You’ve got to feel sorry for our fans. They probably feel like they have been forgotten about and that’s never been the case on our part.“It’s been difficult to cater for them because we have been using other teams’ facilities and they’ve had to travel to every single game.“The guys who followed us through thick and thin I think have enjoyed themselves because the team have kicked on and played well. They’ve seen good football.“Playing in our area, the people who used to watch us at Allan Park will hopefully come back and, at the same time, we’ll want to create a new group of Cove fans because it’s three years since we last played in Cove.“The laddies who used to come and watch and run after the footballs when they were kicked outside the ground, they are grown men now.“Things have moved on in that period of time and we need to capture a new group of Cove fans.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"brushes with greatness for sick children as their art is shown at successful event","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAn exhibition showcasing the artistic talents of sick children in Aberdeen has been hailed.Grampian Hospital Art Trust (GHAT) and Belvidere Gallery teamed up to display the art of the young people, who are patients at Royal Aberdeen Children’s Hospital (RACH).Each painting was created during the hospital’s art room sessions – a patient-centred project led by trained artists.The artwork has been on show at the Belvidere Gallery, in Rosemount, since the beginning of June.It is the first time the gallery has worked with the hospital trust, having previously engaged with schools and other organisations over the years.At a special event held on Saturday, their work was celebrated with the children receiving their paintings back framed and a certificate from co-leader of Aberdeen City Council Jenny Laing.Jo Hastie, artroom co-ordinator at the hospital, said they were delighted with how the project had gone.She said: “It was a lovely day, it was so great to see the kids looking happy and pleased with themselves and getting their artwork.“They had a lovely day being spoiled, a lot of them have been through quite a difficult time and it was really nice making a big fuss of them.“For me it was nice to see our artists rewarded for the work that they do.“I loved it, even though it can be quite stressful to organise as you do wonder if anything will go wrong but it is worth all the effort.”Jo thanked the staff at the gallery for all their help during the project.Artroom is designed to give children a respite from medical routines and relax them and boost their self-esteem.GHAT has been running the project for more than 10 years and is based on a model first introduced at Roxburghe House.Mrs Laing said: “It was a lovely event and gave the children and their parents the opportunity to come and see all the hard work that has gone into this.“The Belvidere Gallery should be commended for all the community work it does and has done throughout the years with different schools and the hospital.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2018/07/5b444d1b4ab85-e1531211073203-684x564.jpg ","title":"man says sorry for kicking puppy and yanking it by its lead on aberdeen street1","story":"\t\t\t\t\tThe man at the centre of a video in which a dog is kicked and pulled by its lead has said he is “sorry” for what he did.Footage recorded on Portland Street in Aberdeen showed a black cocker spaniel puppy being yanked by his lead and lifted off the ground.The clip, which was posted on social media, was shared and viewed thousands of times before being taken down.Chris Gainer, 39, the man in the video, was warned about his actions by the Scottish SPCA after the video came to light last week.He told how he had since received a number of messages, including some threatening assault.Chris, who says he was diagnosed with bipolar disorder in 2012, said: “I lost my composure in the moment captured after months of toilet and obedience training and it was not acceptable.“The video almost went viral and gave rise to a great deal of emotion without any other context. Unfortunately, it does not show the 99% of the time where I had tried with the best of my knowledge to keep him entertained, involved and cared for.”Chris, who has since moved away from the city, said: “Like so many who are bipolar, I’ve devastated the life I had, been uncharacteristically mean to my dog, putting those close to me at extreme risk, and managed to cause widespread outrage, hurt and anxiety.“All I can do now is apologise to all affected. I am no longer with my partner.

Now scientists from the University of Aberdeen have added a third species to the mix \u0026#8211 the European pine marten. These native squirrel predators are recolonising Britain after years of persecution, and so the scientists set out to uncover the impact of this on red and grey squirrel populations.Three study sites in Scotland were in the Highlands (marten recolonisation for over 45 years, no grey squirrels), Central Scotland (marten recolonisation for 8-14 years, grey squirrels since 1945) and the Borders (early stages of marten recolonization, grey squirrels since 1980).Populations were monitored for five months using cameras and multi-species feeders \u0026#8211 the latter with glue strips on the underside of the lid to obtain visitor hair samples. This material provided DNA to determine visitor species and identify individual martens.The results showed that while red squirrels avoided feeders used by martens, greys were equally likely to use feeders whether frequented by martens or not. So grey squirrel numbers were reduced where exposure to pine martens was high, whereas numbers of red squirrels increased – unequivocal evidence that recovering marten numbers affect competition between red and grey squirrels.This finding is likely explained by the fact that reds, having co-evolved with martens, instinctively avoid areas used by martens but invasive greys, having no such instincts, showed no avoidance behaviour at all.Since pine martens’ range is increasing and extending southwards, scientists are optimistic that this will control the invasive grey squirrel species.As they say in the title to their report, in this case ‘the enemy of my enemy is my friend’.PIC:The native grey squirrel may have an unlikely ally.

We simply don\u0026#8217t have enough children playing shinty in each school to make up separate clubs.Surely, in 2018, this shouldn\u0026#8217t be allowed to happen?It is only three clubs that are being affected by this, and they\u0026#8217re all in the south of Scotland,  half way through a season, leaving all our kids devastated at the though of losing their chosen sport.My son has been playing shinty since Primary One. He is now heading into Primary Four and is even more passionate about the sport. He enjoys quality team time, striving to be the best he can and just loving playing the game.It\u0026#8217s very difficult to explain something like this to an eight-year-old child, never mind the Primary One children we have in our club.One quote from a child was: \u0026#8216Everyone is going to be so sad if we don\u0026#8217t have shinty. Why would shinty people do this to us?\u0026#8217It\u0026#8217s a very sad day indeed for the children of Argyll and Bute who are simply being punished for what school they go to and where they live.

Surely the association knows this is a mistake that needs rectified immediately.Personally, Kilmory and Dunadd children\u0026#8217s club has inspired our son and daughter to get involved with the sport and to grow in confidence amongst other like-minded children.Stuart and Simone Charnock, LochgilpheadSir,My son has trained with Kilmory/Dunadd shinty club since he was in Primary One. The club has always treated the kids equally and welcomed all kids to participate.After years of hard work, the team was progressing well and was worthy of competing at national level.In his last year before high school, to be told he is no longer allowed to play is not only devastating to my son but greatly confusing and he is left wondering what he has done wrong.I fail to see how this can be classed as progress by the Camanachd Association. This needs to be readdressed to allow kids to compete in the game they love.Susan Jackson, LochgilpheadI was very angry to hear from local residents in Portnahaven that their recycling bins have been used by numerous motorhomes for disposing of general waste, including food waste.I have visited the recycling bins site in Portnahaven and spoken to my constituents in person about this and I can confirm that unfortunately Portnahaven\u0026#8217s recycling bins are full of general waste.This is as unacceptable as it is disrespectful. I have contacted the appropriate department with the council and asked for an investigation to be done. I also asked for some addition signage for the bins area.I made it very clear that my constituents should not lose their recycling facilities as a result of their bins being misused by someone else.I will continue to monitor this situation and provide an update as soon as I have more information.Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,It is fitting to mark this Diabetes Week (June 11-17) for Scotland’s 30,000 adults and children living with type one diabetes by noting that life-changing monitors are now available on the NHS.A child diagnosed with type one diabetes at five faces 50,000 finger prick blood glucose tests by the time they are 18.Each painful finger prick is part of a daily routine which also includes calculating carbohydrate intake and frequent insulin injections, all to prevent life-threatening hypoglycaemia and long term complications.But since November last year, a \u0026#8216flash glucose monitoring\u0026#8217 system called the Freestyle Libre can be prescribed by local GPs, offering an alternative to such intensive finger-pricking.The roll out of flash glucose monitoring, which gives a reading via a simple sensor, however, is not consistent across all local health boards. So, our message for Diabetes Week is to call for health boards in Scotland to speed up prescription policies and step up much needed prescriptions.As someone who has lived with type one diabetes for 21 years, new technology, such as the FreeStyle Libre, makes a world of difference.Type one diabetes cannot be prevented and until we find the cure for it, research and technology are vital.Holly Davies, development manager, Aberdeen\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"exciting shinty at the macaulay sixes","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 22/06/18, 8:15 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowNo fewer than 29 youth shinty teams travelled to Oban\u0026#8217s Mossfield Park for the annual Macaulay six-a-side competition.The winners of the main competition for P7 and under were Inverlochy, who defeated Taynuilt 1-0 in the final with Taynuilt taking the Oban Celtic Shield.The Alastair Campbell Shield for P5 and under was won by Braxi Boys from Inverlochy who defeated Bute in a very exciting final after extra time by one penalty to nil.The Macaulay Development trophy was won by Rockfield Rapids.

This could threaten future trade deals, environmental standards and food safety.The Tories think they can do whatever they want to Scotland and get away with it.The SNP tabled amendments to the EU Withdrawal Bill to safeguard the Scottish Parliament from the threat of constraints on existing powers.This is something which Holyrood refused consent for last month by an overwhelming majority including all parties, except the Scottish Conservatives.It would simply be a democratic outrage and it would fly in the face of the fundamental principles of devolution. This Conservative government seems determined to destroy the founding principles of devolution and Labour and the Lib Dems must join us in defending it.Brendan O’Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.Sir,It seems that almost every day I\u0026#8217m contacted by farmers in my constituency with concerns about their future.This is hardly surprising as farmers are borrowing more and having to pay staff less, according to figures released by the Scottish Government.According to ‘Agricultural Facts and Figures’ published recently, agricultural borrowing has doubled in the last 10 years, capital investment has stayed the same and agricultural workers are earning £1,560 less on average compared to last year.The figures show farm borrowing has almost doubled from £1.38 billion to £2.28 billion between 2007 to 2017, while capital investment has stayed the same at £210 million.This demonstrates that farmers are investing much less in their machinery and equipment while still having to borrow ever-increasing sums to remain viable.This is on top of the fact farmers are still struggling with debts they incurred as a result the CAP payment fiasco caused by the SNP Government several years ago.Time and time again the separatists have shown complete disregard to the plight that our hard pressed farmers are facing. It seems our agricultural industry is just one more sector that is ignored by the separatists in their relentless push for a second independence referendum.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Claims by Theresa May that a so-called ‘Brexit dividend’ will help pay for a boost to NHS spending in England worth £20 billion a year within five years are highly disingenuous.The UK will continue to pay into the EU through the transition until the end of 2020 and will pay £20 billion of the \u0026#8216divorce bill\u0026#8217 through to 2028. In addition, the UK Government has committed to keep EU funding for agricultural subsidies, research and development and other key areas at the same level in the short-term.These are set figures so it will be at least 10 years before any so-called ‘Brexit dividend’, if it were ever to materialise, is to be realised. Add to that, if the Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts are accurate, public finances are set to be £15 billion a year worse off by 2021, equivalent to £300 million a week.Interestingly, if taxes are set to rise, which they will clearly have to, it is staggering hypocrisy for the Tories to have attacked the Scottish Government’s boosting of the NHS in Scotland through progressive tax changes and then look to hike taxes themselves.Alex Orr, Edinburgh.Sir,Local government spending cuts have left councils in Scotland unable to meet the needs of local communities and, in some cases, are putting the public at risk.A survey of more than 2,000 local government employees working across all services reveals almost eight in 10 council workers have no confidence in the future of local services and half are thinking of leaving their jobs for less stressful work elsewhere.While local authorities have protected spending on statutory service areas such as adult and children’s social care, the amount they spend on other areas including parks and libraries has fallen sharply.Local authorities have had to cut so many vital services that they have now reached a point where vulnerable children and the elderly struggle to get the help that they need, entire communities are suffering and the public is being put at risk.There have been cuts to road and bridge maintenance, potholes in roads are left unfilled and bridges are at risk of crumbling. Crematoriums are not maintained, streetlights stay broken and parks are in disrepair as councils don’t have the equipment or the staff to adequately maintain them.There are now more than one million people with an unmet need for social care because councils do not have the resources to support them. Now is the time to reverse these cuts and invest in local government once more or the fabric of our society will come unstuck.Mark Ferguson, chairman, UNISON Scotland local government committee.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 25","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 24/06/18, 3:39 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.There is no denying Lochgilphead could benefit from a wash and brush up.

However, the away team were really up against it from the start. The Ardnamurchan ladies were clearly also up for the game and had a full squad to choose from. With some key players out and one new player making her debut, the nine player squad from Dunadd started strongly. They had several early chances but just couldn\u0026#8217t find the back of the net.There were some crunching tackles and tasty challenges in the first half the Ardnamurchan ladies were keen to neutralise the strength of Dunadd defender Iona McCulloch, often doubling up on her. Referee Beth MacDonald had her work cut out trying to contain tempers as tensions ran high both on and off the pitch.The first half ended 0-0 and Dunadd left the field feeling like they hadn\u0026#8217t performed to their usual high standards. After a rousing half time team talk, Dunadd were keen to get an early goal in the second half to help settle them and to perhaps go on and build from there.And that is exactly what they did. Straight from the throw up, Grace Drummond caught the ball cleanly, sending it sailing over the defence\u0026#8217s heads. Leone Airlie ran on to it and struck it smoothly, low beyond the keeper.However, the home team responded positively and had Dunadd pinned back in their own half for the next five minutes. On 40 minutes, a fortunate strike from wide left bounced past a few players and found it\u0026#8217s way into the corner of the Dunadd net, 1-1.Dunadd were not despondent and regrouped to press again. However, minutes later Ardnamurchan broke and finished well making it 2-1.Again the referee had to step in to break up some fierce challenges as Ardnamurchan continued to goad McCulloch. However, the young Dunadd defender answered the contentious tackles in the best possible way. In the 51st minute she collected a loose ball and broke away from her marker. After dodging past three players she shot high and scored a certain goal of the season contender, pinging it sweetly into the top corner.The remainder of the game saw both teams coming close to winners. Ellie Hetherington making some crucial blocks and tackles, clearing the ball to safety time and time again. Dunadd held on to grind out the result and retain their unbeaten record and hold on to top spot in south division two.After a summer break, Dunadd will travel to third placed GMA on Sunday August 5 in another crucial game as they search to get back to winning ways.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"scrum for burgers","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 30/06/18, 7:47 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe Mid Argyll Rugby Club had its annual end-of-season barbeque and awards ceremony at the Ropework park on Sunday June 24.The kids from P4/5 and P6/7 that played a big part in winning the league and runners up in P4/5 also received medals.Of the primary six and sevens, player of the year went to Murray MacDonald, most improved player of the year went to Aileen Barr, the coaches award went to Campbell Shaw and best newcomer went to Rhys Coffield.Of the younger kids of primary four and five, the player of the year award went to Arran Martin most improved player of the year went to Fergus Bennet the coaches award went to Jorja and Jemma MacDonald and best newcomer went to Logan Cinnamond.On top of their awards, all the kids were also given a new training top sponsored by Jewsons.The players also clubbed together to get all the coaches a gift each.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"inverarays sale of the summer gets underway","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 02/07/18, 6:37 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe famous Inveraray summer sale has started.On Monday June 25, Inveraray’s parish church hall opened its doors, brimming with exquisite odds and ends.Ornaments, sports equipment and anything else you can think of can be found at the church for a fair price.Volunteer Wilma Wood said: \u0026#8216Anyone looking for something in particular can give us a shout.

The pair were steady, neat and quick all day and broke the timing beam on stage eight, Bishop\u0026#8217s Glen, to complete the rally in 23rd overall and third in class four.Everything finally came together and the car and crew got the result they deserve. The collective sigh of relief could be heard in body shops and garages all across the land, with annual leave in  most of them on hold until Douglas\u0026#8217s result came in.Duncan MacLean and Ian Parker were out in the mighty Peugeot 106 once more and were having a decent day, with a few hairy moments when the intercom wasn\u0026#8217t working (or so Duncan tells it) and unfortunately breaking a gearbox mount which, though fixed between stages, saw them over their time limit and out of the rally.Mull ace Ally Currie and his Oban co-driver Grant MacNiven continued to chase the bigger more powerful machinery in his 150bhp Fiesta and was sitting third in the 2WD section when a problem that they had been experiencing for most of the day became worse \u0026#8211 and the passenger side front wheel decided to part company on the approach to the start line of stage seven.The family duo of Cara and Donald MacNeill made a welcome return to the stages, in new machinery this time, debuting their Subaru Impreza and bringing it home in one piece in 31st overall and second in class nine.Mull\u0026#8217s James Campbell and Claire Tilley also got their Mitsubishi Evo to the finish and will be happy with the result.The event was won by Kilmarnock\u0026#8217s Andrew Gallagher with Jane Nicol on the notes in the CobbleShop Ford Focus WRC.The next rally action for Argyll is the Mach 1 Stages on the weekend of July 14/15 at Machrihanish.\u0026nbspPICS:Photographs by West Coast PhotosAlly Currie and Grant MacNiven blasted it while their Fiesta was still on four wheels. no_a27ArgyllRally01no_a27ArgyllRally02Overall Winners Andrew Gallagher and Jane Nicol in their Ford Focus. no_a27ArgyllRally03Donald MacNeill from Furnace and Cara MacNeill, Glasgow, make light work of the hairpin in their Subaru.  no_a27ArgyllRally04James Campbell and Claire Tilley from Mull in their Mitsubishi. no_a27ArgyllRally05Kicking up dust in their Peogeot 106 are Lochgilphead team Duncan MacLean and Ian Parker. no_a27ArgyllRally06\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"tv company seeks argyll adventurers","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 06/07/18, 11:20 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowCould you travel to The Far East without stepping on a plane?If so, a television production company is looking for you.Studio Lambert, the company behind Gogglebox, is seeking folk from Argyll to take part in a trans-global race for a cash prize.Flightless is described as an \u0026#8216ambitious real-world adventure series\u0026#8217.

I am still receiving many justifiable complaints about the terrible condition of Mansefield Road in Port Ellen and the hospital road in Bowmore. With long overdue road works going on across Islay and the rest of the Kintyre and Islands ward, it\u0026#8217s only fair these roads are not ignored.The poor condition of the Bruichladdich toilets continues to be raised by local residents.Since contacting the appropriate department I have been informed repairs and maintenance are planned for them.While checking on the progress of pothole repairs I had previously requested, I noticed some of the recent street light repairs leave a lot to be desired. While a quick fix is better than nothing, many of these short-term fixes need to be looked at again.I have been speaking to the BT Openreach staff across Islay who are expanding our island\u0026#8217s internet capabilities. I have contacted BT to make sure recent issues with phone lines in some local households are not a result of the broadband upgrades.There has been progress with local housing associations after pointing out many of their tenants are having trouble with mould in their housing. Measures are now being implemented to to rectify the problem. I was happy to hear Argyll Community Housing Association has fixed gate latches on four of its houses at Cnoc Na Faire in Port Ellen after I raised this with them a few weeks ago.I met with environment, development and infrastructure committee member councillor Gary Mulvaney about Kintyre and Islands\u0026#8217 crumbling infrastructure, alongside our growing industrial output with the success of distilleries on Islay and Jura.Later that day I spoke directly to my constituents in Tarbert after a number of locals \u0026#8211 some business owners \u0026#8211 contacted me about the recent flood of sewage on Harbour Street as a result of blocked drains. Scottish Water were coming under fire from locals because of its slow progress on the matter.I made my anger about the poor conditions in Tarbert very clear when I contacted Scottish Water. A long-term solution to needs to be put in place.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Scottish Water is asking customers to use water wisely in their daily activities to help maintain supplies during the current hot summer weather.Following a sustained dry period without any significant rainfall, customer use has increased significantly.In some areas, there has been a 30 per cent increase in demand for water and an additional 140 million litres are currently being produced and pushed through the system every day.The situation is being monitored closely to manage supplies across the country.This includes deploying additional resources to move water between distribution areas and tankering water to supplement local networks.Average reservoir levels are generally normal for this time of year but the current level of use and continuing dry weather means stocks of stored water available for use are reducing.Try to reduce use wherever possible.Businesses are also being asked to consider their use and how they can use water more efficiently.Simple, practical steps include: taking shorter showers, using a watering can rather than a hose to water plants, using a bucket rather than a hose to wash vehicles only washing windscreens/lights instead of the whole vehicle, turning off taps whenever possible and use washing machines and dishwashers fully loaded.More advice on using water wisely is online at www.scottishwater/savewaterscotland or call 0800 0778778.Peter Farrer, Chief Operating Officer, Scottish Water.\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"riverside fun day sparkles in the sun","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 06/07/18, 9:44 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe sun shone on the Riverside in Lochgilphead for a day of fun.Mid Argyll Community Pool and Riverside Rascals nursery hosted the family day on Sunday July 1, featuring a variety of colourful craft and charity stalls.The unmistakeable aroma of barbecue wafted across the car park from Riverside Rascals nursery, which opened its doors to the public for the occasion, complete with children\u0026#8217s activities.MACPool lifeguards were on hand to keep an eye on the youngsters in the pedal boats while the sunshine glistened across the splashing fun.PICS:Four-year-old Kaiden Abel from Lochgilphead has fun splashing in the inflatable outdoor pool. 06_a27RiversideFun01Kyra Robertson, aged 11, from Cairnbaan, tries to hook a duck on the MS centre stand \u0026#8211 and it\u0026#8217s not as easy as it looks. 06_a27RiversideFun04On the MS Centre Mid Argyll stall were Maggie Dodd and centre manager Karen McCurry. 06_a27RiversideFun07Mary Stewart of the Loch Awe Pottery helps sisters Abby and Chloe McCallum, from Glasgow, to decorate their pottery. 06_a27RiversideFun08Cathleen MacDonald was there with her Woolly Bobbins textile-base crafts. 06_a27RiversideFun09Alongside Cathleen was her mum Margaret Davidson, who creates soft toys under the name Twisted Yarn.

The Honest Men were relegated at the first time of asking in the second tier in the 2016/17 season when they finished bottom with 33 points. But former Ayr hitman and manager, Roberts, reckons being part-time was what held them back. Marko, who played second tier football with Ayr under Brian Reid, said: “I think Ayr will be fine, I really do. “Being full-time in that league is a massive thing. “The last few times Ayr have been in that league it has been very difficult to compete with the full-time teams. “But the fact they have got that now will make a big difference and I don’t think they will have any issues staying in the league. “When I was there under Brian Reid, being part-time was what held us back. “You didn’t have enough time to go and work on things on a daily basis but Ayr will have that now.  “You can beat any team in a one-off game but over the course of a season of 36 games it’s difficult to compete. “But the fans should be excited this time as there should be no problem – Ayr can even start looking up rather than looking down.” Roberts, who hit the net 43 times for Ayr, was more than impressed with Ayr’s impressive goal-scoring form last season as they topped League One, pipping Raith on the final game of the season. He said: “I thought they were really good to watch. “You always thought they were going to score every game they played. “And I don’t mean just scoring one, you always thought they’d grab three or four. “Sometimes they were left open all over the park – but they had too much quality up front and that’s the reason they went up. “Fair play to them as they had three really good strikers in Shankland, Moore and Moffat.” Roberts added: “The way the league was won was certainly a bit of a way to win it.  “I’ve been in teams that have won titles and been promoted with five or six games to go, which gives you a great feeling of accomplishment, but there’s nothing more exciting than winning the title in the last 10 minutes of the season. “Both teams had the chance to run away with it but kept faltering.” Roberts managed Ayr for three years before getting sacked, He then had a player/coach role at Clyde for a season. He has now gone back to playing at Junior Cup finalists Hurlford United. But he insists that his managing days aren’t over.  He said: “I won’t give up on it, I just wanted to play again for now. The best days of your life are when you’re kicking a ball and I am still fit enough.  “Any manager who tells you they prefer coaching is talking rubbish. When you’re out there playing it’s  just great.  “I do want to get back to managing eventually though, but it’s all about finding the right club and what suits my life at the minute.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12468674.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/emp_ayp_240218grant_07JPG.jpg","title":"maybole super school one step","story":"NewsMaybole super-school is one step closer to being builtCouncillors have approved the results of a public consultation in the town that will see a 1400-pupil campus erected at Carrick Academy.\u0026nbspShareByStuart Wilson15:27, 10 JUL 2018NewsNew Carrick Academy artist impression (Image: Copyright Unknown)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA \u0026pound42million super-school has taken a step closer to being built in Maybole.

Plans will see Cairn and Gardenrose Primaries merge to become a new school located at the purpose-built campus. Nurseries for both schools would also merge to be ready for August 2021. St Cuthbert’s Primary – where parents responding to the consultation issued a rejection of the move – would also relocate but operate as a stand-alone school. A bid for funding will now be made to the Scottish Government.

Nicola, 28-year-old classical singer married 30-year-old shipbuilding engineer John Hunter. The pair now live in Shawlands, Glasgow, but were both originally from Ayr. One Friday night back in 2009 John walked in to Harley’s Pub in Ayr to wish his cousin a happy birthday, and his sister told him to say hello to Nicola – her workmate at the time. “Nobody knows if it was the brown eyes, the sweet perfume or the six pints, three vodkas and the shot of Midori that caused him to steal my cardigan but steal it he did,” joked Nicola. She added: “A few days later, cardigan in hand, John returned it to H Samuel where I worked at the time. And that moment was the beginning of something special.” Since then both have enjoyed years of happiness and in October 2016 – seven years after meeting – John asked Nicola to marry him at Loch Lomond.  John and Nicola tied the knot on Thursday, June 7, at The Cruin at Loch Lomond. The couple said: “It was relaxing, elegant and absolutely perfect. “We can’t thank the staff enough. The weather, setting and scenery were breath-taking.” The bride wore a Vera Wang dress from David’s Bridal, Braehead, the bridesmaids also wearing gowns from David’s Bridal. The kilts were the Spirit of Lochearn tartan from Kilts 4 U. The wedding party consisted of Best man Mark Cosgrove, Groomsmen Niall Carney, Paddy McCurdie and Ryan Glass (nephew, aged 8), Maid of honour sister Jennifer Cassells, Bridesmaids Laura Dickson, Heather Armstrong and Aimee Trainer, Groom’s parents John Hunter and Hazel Hunter and the Bride’s parents Brian Cassells and Julie Cassells. The pair are currently celebrating being newlyweds in Bangkok, Thailand, and will be heading to Koh Samui, Thailand, then on to the Atlantis in Dubai.  3D Cakes created the couples wedding cake. The couple said: “We were inspired by the Scottish theme and used the same tartan ribbon that was on the kilts.” Kev Moulds Photography captured Nicola and John’s big day, leaving them with fond memories to look back on. The bouquets were arranged by Narcissus Flowers by Susan Hair and make-up was styled and created by Anna Wade (hair) and Lynn Brown (make-up).

Bids of \u0026pound1.5million are being sought for Enterkine House, perched above Annbank. The luxury four-star retreat, which boasts 74 acres of land, employs around 50 staff. Kirk House and Steading, a six-bedroom farmhouse currently used as overspill accommodation for the hotel, is also included.

It follows a long-running noise battle at the hotel which saw bosses spend \u0026pound80,000 soundproofing their wedding marquee. Council chiefs were told that slapping an 11pm curfew on party bands could put the hotel out of business.  But they finally got the all-clear earlier this year and revealed plans to build a permanent structure. However, the hotel is now being offered to the market. Bob Cherry, a partner with Galbraith, said: “The purchaser of Enterkine would find it relatively straightforward to continue the current business, which is well-established, and there are further opportunities for diversification or expansion of the tourism and events facilities on the estate, subject to the necessary consents. “This is a beautiful estate with a thriving hotel business and potential for further development.” Brian Sheldon, of Christie \u0026amp Co, added: “The market for country house hotels such as Enterkine House has vastly improved in recent years. “Its location in South Ayrshire and within such an enviable estate and countryside will attract local, regional and potentially international operators. “Whilst the business is trading well, there is certainly scope for further growth.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"royal troon golf club make","story":"NewsRoyal Troon golf club make generous donation to hospital unitIt follows a charity 18-hole golf event with Troon Portland and Troon Ladies, writes Charlene Bennie.\u0026nbspShareByAyrshire Post15:39, 10 JUL 2018News\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailRoyal Troon Golf Club has made the generous donation of \u0026pound1k to Crosshouse Hospital’s Acute Stroke Unit.

Steve the Seagull sneakily snatches a bag of crisps from bakery giant Greggs in Ayr. The sly bird checks to see if the coast is clear and grabs a packet of Walkers if staff are busy – and he’s tried every flavour. Greggs team member Charley Cooper said: “He could be in three times a day. He always goes for the crisps on the bottom shelf. He also took a pack of yum-yums recently. “He is like a thief in the night. He stalks this place. I shout ‘Steve’ and he flys off.” Hilariously the staff have dubbed the winged bandit ‘Steve Segal’ after the action movie actor.  Charley said the popular pest has been causing a flap for about two years. Air traffic controller Steve McNamara made a video of the bird in action last Tuesday. The dad-of-three said: “It was so funny. It landed outside Greggs, walked straight to the crisps stand inside, got a pack of ready salted and headed back out to the pavement. “ It then whacked the packet with its beak and devoured them. It only stopped to let out a cry of joy in the middle of its feast. “A few other people saw it and were incredulous. I had a feeling the bird wasn’t a first offender and it looked like it knew exactly what it was doing. It was a snatch theft.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article3294074.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/JS33570090.jpg","title":"up your game face boot","story":"NewsUp your game or face the boot - shock SNP ultimatum to South Ayrshire Council leaderIt comes as rival camps “fight like rats” to wrestle the council’s power base back on track.\u0026nbspShareByStuart Wilson15:21, 10 JUL 2018NewsCouncil leader Douglas Campbell (Image: Ayrshire Post)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailUp your game or face the boot. That’s the shock ultimatum delivered by warring SNP councillors to their embattled leader. Douglas Campbell has been ordered to regain control of his split ranks during the council’s summer break. It comes as rival camps “fight like rats” to wrestle the council’s power base back on track. A racism storm and failed coup on Councillor Campbell has plunged the SNP into crisis. And the Post understands another plot to oust the leader is now brewing. It follows all SNP group members signing a declaration of support for their under-fire boss just two weeks ago. But a party insider has revealed growing disquiet is threatening to tear the group apart.  Within hours of the public show of support, Cllr Campbell was being placed under increasing pressure to step down of his own accord, rather than face another bruising challenge from within, the Post has learned. A senior source said: “People agreed to fall in line and sign the declaration for the sake of the bigger picture. “But it’s widely accepted that a change is required and this can’t go on. “The group is in a position where people will fight like rats to get what they want. “However, the even bigger concern is trying to keep the administration intact.” Worries over a potential walkout from Labour colleagues has, until now, ensured enough SNP support behind Cllr Campbell. A potential change in the their leadership is thought that have strained relations with administration partners, who have indicated they are happier working with Cllr Campbell.  But the Post understands that Cllr Campbell’s Labour past is forming a big part of the problem for the SNP leader as he battles factions within his new party. And a new warning – issued as councillors left for their summer break – stressed that he must crack the whip among his troubled ranks. The source added: “It was made very clear that if he doesn’t, the matter will be taken out of his hands. “The party is being crucified every week and it cannot be allowed to continue. “Some see Douglas as being far too close to Labour and that is undoubtedly a big issue for him. “Either way, he’s been given the message in clear terms that he needs to get everyone behind him and on the same page.” When asked about the warning, the group’s depute leader, William Grant, insisted: “This is news to me.” Cllr Campbell added: “Cllr Grant responded to your enquiry that ‘This is news to me’ and I have nothing to add.” "},{"url":null,"title":"unpaid-work-for-teenager-who-broke-mans-jaw-after-earlston-7s","story":"A TEENAGER broke a man\u0027s jaw with a punch during an argument after Earlston Rugby Sevens.\nThe victim had arrived at a party in Station Road to pick someone up on the night of May 6.\nHis vehicle was approached by 18-year-old Nathan Rice of Glenburn Avenue, Newtown St Boswells, who started acting in an aggressive manner and tried to get into the vehicle where a woman was sitting.\nThe car owner was returning to the vehicle and told Rice to go away and the pair squared up to each other.\nSelkirk Sheriff Court was told that the pair were pushing each other and then Rice connected with a punch to the left hand side of the face.\nThe pair were swinging punches that were not connecting and eventually they were split up.\nThe court heard that the victim woke up at 11.30am and could not close his mouth, and on attending hospital found he had a broken jaw.\nDefence lawyer Mark Harrower said the hotel worker felt bad about what happened and had not intended to inflict such an injury.\nHe added: \"He is a young man of good character and has learned a valuable lesson of what the consequences can be.\"\nRice pleaded guilty to charges of behavingin a threatening or abusive manner and assault to severe injury.\nSheriff Mark Thorley said: \"No doubt drink played a part in this but at lease you have shown remorse for your actions.\"\nHe was given a 12-months Copmmunity Pay Back order involving 160 hours of unpaid work.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"up-to-50-jobs-created-with-new-home-bargains-store-in-galashiels","story":"UP to 50 jobs are being created with the opening of a new \u0026pound4million Home Bargains store in Galashiels this weekend.\nThe Stirling Street outlet, which is due to be opened on Saturday at 8am, replaces the smaller Channel Street store which closes the day before.\nJoe Morris, operations director at Home Bargains, told the Border : \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore thrilled to be launching this flagship store in Galashiels and look forward to welcoming customers through the doors.\nThe 25,000 sq ft store, which has previously been a Co-Op and B\u0026ampM, will offer shoppers a range of products, including homewares, health and beauty essentials, sweets, snacks and drinks, as well as fresh and frozen food.\nJoe added: \u0026ldquoStirling Street will be a great location for us and we\u0026rsquore proud to be able to offer local people top-branded goods at exceptionally low prices.\nWith more than four million customers each week, Home Bargains is one of the country\u0026rsquos best-loved discount retailers, stocking top-quality branded goods at low prices.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"feature-peebles-pupils-meditate-their-way-to-mindfulness","story":"IT\u0027S a typical weekday, high school students are lying on the floor of their classroom, eyes closed, listening to the soothing sounds of tranquil music, gently guided by their teacher as they breathe deeply, exhaling all worries away and their minds drift off\u0026hellip\nNow, I know you must be wondering, what on earth are they teaching at Peebles High School? What about prelims, exams, studying, grades?\nBut what do all these pressures bring to the fragile mind of a young person, and how do they process the stress to ensure their mental wellbeing?\nIn steps Suzi Gibson, who has been running mindful meditation sessions with Peebles High pupils as part of Health Week for the past five years.\nAnd so a group of pupils dropped their pencils, calculators and chemistry tools and walked through the doors of a more unique classroom setting, kicking off their school shoes and leaving their cares behind them as the lay in the comfort of Space 108 in Peebles.\nCan mindfulness meditation really help pupils concentrate amid the distractions of 21st century living?\nI decided to experience for myself the sessions offered freely to the pupils by Suzi, who guided sessions at the high school before opening her studio at Greenside, Peebles, in January 2016.\nAdmittedly I had always been a bit sceptical about meditation. I mean seriously, how can sitting on a floor in the lotus position, inhaling the pleasant oil aroma while the ambient sounds of dolphins singing and ocean waves crash, bring me peace of mind?\nI\u0026rsquom a wife, mother, writer, and like most people, my life is busy and my head is bursting with thoughts from which there\u0026rsquos no escape.\nBut I entered the beautiful airy studio with an open-mind and intrigued about the experiences of the pupils.\nOn this particular afternoon, I feel like I\u0026rsquove got the weight of the world on my shoulders. Thoughts are racing through my head like a train out of control. But immediately I feel a sense of calmness speaking to Suzi, as she explains the techniques she is using and gently guides me through the smooth ride to a quiet mind\u0026hellipand I am, going, going, gone\u0026hellip\nI am in a state of deep peace and the mind is calm, so much so, when I hear Suzi\u0026rsquos soft instruction to open my eyes \u0026ndash I don\u0026rsquot want to. I love it here.\nSo now I can see why meditation could potentially tackle a myriad of problems suffered by young students, including mental health. This is a growing problem in the Scottish Borders, with evidence suggesting almost 2,000 children and young people in the region will experience mental ill health at some point in their lives.\nThe sessions are offered to groups of pupils from S1 to S3, who arrive at the studio giggling with excitement and anticipation for their new experience.\nSuzi explained: \"There are some nerves and awareness of peers, especially if there is a mix of ages. The great thing is, once they close their eyes, it becomes completely about their own experience. Fidgeting and chatting stops, there is a sense of calm, and some sleep which is great because they perhaps need it.\"\nEach group is given an insight into the benefits of meditation, as well as exploring how stress becomes unhealthy, warning signs, and how to build resilience through practical techniques that can help reduce anxiety.\nThe meditation guru shared skills with the pupils which, if put into practice daily, can be life-changing.\nSuzi said: \"They are all very relaxed and quite amazed at the experience. I hope they leave with the knowledge that they have the ability to create calmness within themselves using some of the techniques they have learned, leading to greater concentration, focus, creativity and well rested teens.\"\nThe visible difference in the pupils during the session at Space 108 has astounded school staff. \"Some of the teachers and staff who have attended over the years can\u0026rsquot quite believe the quiet and calm that begins to settle in the room. I\u0026rsquove had a few parents afterwards tell me how much their kids enjoyed it,\" said Suzi.\n\"There is a lot of anxiety and tension in our kids today, sometimes a feeling of being relaxed is a little alien to them, then they experience it. That\u0026rsquos the important bit, they have an experience of relaxation and calm, not an intellectual understanding that it is good for them, but an actual experience.\"\nResearch has proven that mindfulness and meditation is very beneficial to a person\u0026rsquos mental health, and many schools are incorporating it into their classrooms, teaching philosophies, and disciplinary programs.\nIn fact, some schools are choosing to replace detention with meditation with it even being used as behavioural therapy in classrooms.\nWhether this trend will catch on remains to be seen, as there are many parents who still prefer traditional discipline, with youngsters being given their marching orders to the principal\u0026rsquos office for unruly behaviour.\nBut one thing is certain, the pupils of Peebles High School reaped the benefits of their mindful meditation sessions with Suzi during Health Week last month.\nPrincipal teacher of pastoral care Kirsteen Robertson, said: \"The studio is beautiful, the students immediately notice how soothing the space is, the lovely smell and lighting. The sessions give our students strategies to relax, think calmly, reducing stress and anxiety and improve sleep. It\u0026rsquos just amazing to see how some of them react.\"\nHaving embraced meditation and its healing benefits, I leave the studio feeling renewed, carefree and a little lighter on my feet. The everyday worries and thoughts I described like a train racing out of control?

Chinese tactics, the administration says, include outright cybertheft and forcing US companies to hand over technology in exchange for access to the Chinese market.\nThe initial US tariff list focused on Chinese industrial products in an attempt to limit the impact on American consumers. By expanding the list, the administration is beginning to hit products that US households buy, including such things as electric lamps and fish sticks.\n\u0026ldquoTariffs on 200 billion dollars in Chinese products amounts to another multibillion-dollar tax on American businesses and families, said Scott Lincicome, a trade lawyer and senior policy analyst for the group Republicans Fighting Tariffs.\n\u0026ldquoGiven China\u0026rsquos likelihood of retaliation, it\u0026rsquos also billions worth of new tariffs on American exporters.\nMembers of Congress are increasingly questioning Trump\u0026rsquos aggressive trade policies, warning that tariffs on imports raise prices for consumers and expose U.S. farmers and manufacturers to retaliation abroad.\n\u0026ldquoTonight\u0026rsquos announcement appears reckless and is not a targeted approach, Senate Finance Chairman Orrin Hatch said in a statement.\n\u0026ldquoWe cannot turn a blind eye to China\u0026rsquos mercantilist trade practices, but this action falls short of a strategy that will give the administration negotiating leverage with China while maintaining the long-term health and prosperity of the American

school summer holidays are here and it’s easy for health routines to go out of the window as children relax, enjoy the outdoors and get stuck into their favourite hobbies.Asthma UK is launching a campaign urging parents of children with asthma to make sure they take their usual preventer medicine and keep up a routine over the school break.The medicine builds up over time so will help to protect their child from an asthma attack during the summer holiday and once they return to school.Every 10 seconds someone has a potentially life-threatening asthma attack in the UK and three people die from an asthma attack every day.In September, children are nearly three times more likely to be admitted to hospital because of an asthma attack than in August, partly due to seasonal triggers such as cold and flu viruses.If a child hasn’t kept up their preventer medicine routine over the school holidays, they will be at greater risk of reacting to these triggers.The good news is that by taking a few simple steps, parents can help their child to avoid asthma attacks and enjoy the summer as much as anyone else:Keep up your child’s usual preventer medicine routine, usually a brown inhaler.Make sure your child has an up-to-date written asthma action plan, which you can download from Asthma UK’s website, and share this with anyone who will be looking after them as using one means they’re less likely to end up in hospital for their asthma.Track your child’s asthma symptoms using a diary or a symptom calendar.Prepare for going back to school by arranging for your child to have an asthma review with their GP or asthma nurse to check your child’s medicines and make sure your child has spare, in-date reliever inhalers to take into school.Parents whose children have asthma can access support through our nurse helpline.Last year we helped nearly 1,000 parents who called on behalf of their child with asthma.For information and support on how to manage your child’s asthma during the summer or to download a written asthma action plan visit www.asthma.org.uk/safersummerDr Andy Whittamore, Practicing GP, Clinical Lead at Asthma UK.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"2012s

The Aqualibrium is not where most people want to cross.\u0026#8216People going to and from the Co-op and Tesco want to cross at the junction between them.\u0026#8216Likewise, people going to the harbour from the town centre want to cross at the Royal Hotel.\u0026#8216As it is, as a driver I was unaware the town had any crossings, apart from the pelican crossing in the Main Street. None are marked for drivers.\u0026#8216Is there any point in having them if drivers do not know they are there?\u0026#8216If they are indeed crossings, mark them. All road users need to know what they are in the interest of safety.\u0026#8217Mark Sutherland: \u0026#8216I have on several occasions crossed the road near the Co-op, and due to the speed of some inconsiderate drivers have had narrow misses. As for reporting to the police, this is ridiculous as the police would not really be interested as they have enough to do.\u0026#8216It is obvious if you stand there long enough that several people try to cross and give up or take a chance.\u0026#8216A crossing is required, especially for the elderly and infirm, as they can not make it across as quickly.\u0026#8216Common sense needs to be implemented by the right authorities to ensure that pedestrians can cross safely.\u0026#8217\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"pedestrian crossings","story":"There are also no traditional pedestrian pelican crossings.

supplies during the current period of hot summer weather.Following a sustained dry period without any significant rainfall, customer usage has increased significantly.With the current weather conditions forecast to continue people should take simple but important steps to conserve public water supplies.In some areas there has been a 30 per cent increase in demand for water during the summer and an additional 140 million litres are currently being produced and pushed through the system every day.The situation is being monitored closely and  to manage supplies across the country.This includes deploying additional resources to move water between distribution areas and tankering water to supplement local networks.Some water treatment works and distribution networks are working at near capacity to meet demand.Average reservoir levels are generally normal for this time of year but the current level of usage and continuing dry weather means stocks of stored water available for use are reducing.Try to reduce usage wherever possible.Businesses are also being asked to consider their usage and how they can use water more efficiently.Simple, practical steps include: taking shorter showers, using a watering can rather than a hose to water plants, using a bucket rather than a hose to wash vehicles only washing windscreens/lights instead of the whole vehicle, turning off taps whenever possible, use washing machines and dishwashers fully loaded.Scotland’s public water supply is the lifeblood of the country, for household and business customers and more than 1.3 billion litres is used per day.There is a strong and resilient water distribution network but everyone will need to play their part as Scotland enjoys its hottest and driest summer in many years.To help customers use water wisely, advice is at www.scottishwater/savewaterscotland or by calling 0800 0778778.Peter Farrer,Chief Operating Officer,Scottish

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.  After filming, a surprise screening of The Silent Child was organised by Rachel at Maisie\u0026rsquos school, Red Oaks Primary, in August.  Maisie then flew with her proud parents, Elizabeth, who is also deaf,\u0026nbspand Gilson, who is partially deaf, to the film\u0026rsquos international premiere in Rhode Island \u0026ndash her first visit to the US, and her first time on a plane.  The film was given its first public screening in Swindon last month at the Swindon Arts Centre. Gilson, who spoke before and after the showing, said: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a great pleasure to be able to finally show this in Swindon.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a film to be appreciated, and to spread a message. Let people know what you\u0026rsquove seen and the emotions you\u0026rsquove felt.      \"Millions of children all over the world live in silence.\"    \u0027The Silent Child\u0027 screenwriter and star Rachel Shenton signed her #Oscars acceptance speech for Best Live Action Short Film. https://t.co/t3Dtf4Uy3c pic.twitter/PYB0M7gRNs"},{"url":null,"title":"tesco-customers-waving-at-us-say-residents-of-new-musselburgh-housing","story":"  They say they are being overlooked by customers at the supermarket car park who can see through the fence into the communal garden area in front of their ground-floor properties at Mill House on Eskmills Road, which is managed by Dunedin Canmore Housing Association.  Margaret and Keith Morris moved from a Dunedin Canmore property in Bathgate last September into the phase two of Mill House \u0026ndash an amenity housing development for residents aged 55 and over.  Mrs Morris said: \u0026ldquoThere is no privacy whatsoever.  \u0026ldquoPeople who park in the car park have been waving in.  \u0026ldquoThere were two young guys in a van and I was hanging out my washing and one was nudging the other.  I thought \u0026lsquoI\u0026rsquom not having this\u0026rsquo \u0026ndash it\u0026rsquos ridiculous.  \u0026ldquoIt was Keith\u0026rsquos birthday recently and we had a barbecue. They were sitting lined up in their cars looking to see what was going on.  \u0026ldquoI have sat outside with my breakfast some mornings and have had to lift my bowl of cereal and walk back in the house.  Mrs Morris said that although there were some trees along the boundary, they shed their leaves in the autumn, leaving the area bare.  She claimed that she and her husband had called on the housing association for permission to fill in the gaps in the fence to allow more privacy but claimed they had been told they couldn\u0026rsquot as another resident liked it that way.  \u0026ldquoWe wanted to get these slats which are only 94p. We would pay for them and fill in the spaces, she added.  She said they also called for a fence to be installed to stop people using an area past their flats as a shortcut to Tesco, claiming they were dumping rubbish including cans and bottles en route.  Neighbour Fiona Wilson said that motorists ate and slept in their vehicles and let their dogs out of cars.  \u0026ldquoWe are entitled to some sort of privacy, she added.  \u0026ldquoWe can\u0026rsquot go out \u0026ndash everybody\u0026rsquos looking at us.  \u0026ldquoMy bedroom is also to the front.  Another resident, who declined to be named agreed, saying: \u0026ldquoWe are getting no privacy and I can\u0026rsquot even sit out in the back garden for people looking in.  Alan Glasgow, Dunedin Canmore housing director, said: \u0026ldquoWe are aware there are a small number of residents at Eskmills Road who have concerns about the garden fence.  \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquoll continue to work with the community and local partners to see what can be done to help further increase privacy when people are using the nearby car park.  Dunedin Canmore stated that the pathway being used as a shortcut was the responsibility of East Lothian Council."},{"url":null,"title":"giant-mussel-sculpture-installed-in-musselburgh","story":"  The operation at the site off Edinburgh Road took place last Thursday.  Sculptor Michael Johnson\u0026rsquos work, called \u0026lsquoMemory and Reflection\u0026rsquo, is 12ft high and 6ft feet wide.  The stainless steel sculpture depicts aspects of Musselburgh\u0026rsquos history with images of agriculture, people, connections to the sea, the river and the Romans. The face of the sculpture is mirror polished and reflects whatever stands before it.  Mr Johnson, from Nottinghamshire, sees these two aspects of the shell, the memory and reflection, as metaphors for a work which interprets the history of the town and offers a reflection of how the town is viewed now.  A working group made up of community representatives selected the mussel shell for the commission. Mr Johnson undertook activities with local groups and schoolchildren to create designs for bronze inserts incorporated onto the main sculpture.  The fisherfolk stone sculpture at Murdoch Green will be moved to a seating area in front of the Shell petrol station, also off Edinburgh Road.  The mussel shell is one of two works of art funded by Tesco at a cost of \u0026pound76,000 as part of the council\u0026rsquos Percent for Art policy, which was a condition of planning consent for the company\u0026rsquos present store.  The other is an archer planned for the banks of the River Esk, with its installation expected to be next week.

The Musselburgh installation follows Iceland\u0026rsquos industry-first trial in London last month.  The six-month trials are designed to help the company better understand consumer perceptions and appetite for plastics-recycling technology across the UK.

The trials will help Iceland to provide government and industry with insights that might support the creation of a national scheme.  Environment Secretary Roseanna Cunningham MSP said: \u0026ldquoThis reverse vending machine will provide valuable evidence on how to help reduce single-use plastic waste and encourage customers to change their own behaviour as we look to end Scotland\u0026rsquos throwaway culture.  \u0026ldquoI would urge all manufactures and retailers to follow Iceland\u0026rsquos example and consider what action they can take to reduce the use of single-use plastics.  \u0026ldquoIn the coming months the Scottish Government will be consulting on a new deposit return scheme for drinks containers that will be one step to increase recycling rates right across Scotland.  \u0026ldquoAs part of our action to reduce the blight of waste littering our communities and polluting our seas we are also consulting on proposals to ban the manufacture and sale of plastic-stemmed cotton buds and have appointed an expert panel to consider what further steps can be taken on items like plastic straws and disposable cups."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7959630.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"future-of-the-hollies-day-centre-safeguarded","story":"  It has been confirmed that the much-loved facility for older people will continue as it is in its High Street home.  Fears were raised back in 2016 that the day centre might be forced to relocate or even cease to exist in its present form because a new day centre facility could not be accommodated within the current building.  East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership needed to provide at least 18 places of registered day care for people with complex care needs in Musselburgh given that it was the largest town in East Lothian. This was in line with need identified as part of a wider review of older people\u0026rsquos day centres.  This led to the partnership and the Hollies exploring the options available, which ranged from potentially adapting the current building to accommodate 18 people through to looking at possible other buildings if the Hollies couldn\u0026rsquot be adapted.  After nearly two years of talks, and Care Inspectorate and architects\u0026rsquo input, it was found that, in order to adapt the Hollies premises, the lunch club and public cafe would be lost at the expense of more than 100 users.  A joint decision remains to be made about the eight day care places already in existence at the Hollies current premises but, at present, there is agreement that these places will continue.  The health and social care partnership is now looking for somewhere else in Musselburgh to accommodate the other 10 places.  Following a meeting this month, the Hollies trustees have confirmed that agreement has been reached with the health and social care partnership that the status quo will remain at the day centre.  In a joint statement, the trustees said: \u0026ldquoThe Hollies distributed a consultation paper to service users and had 271 responses completed in two weeks. The overwhelming consensus of the people consulted is for the Hollies to continue providing the service it does now for the people of Musselburgh and surrounding areas. We have also received positive feedback on our proposed expansion of activities in the hall in the afternoons.  \u0026ldquoWe have agreed with the health and social care partnership that the Hollies should remain as it is. We are looking forward to continuing to work as before and to embark on exciting new projects to meet the wishes of all those who attend the Hollies.  Liz Shannon, centre manager, said: \u0026ldquoFunding is a constant battle for us all at the Hollies and we have been in limbo whilst these talks were taking place and have been unable to approach funders as we were unclear what funding we were asking for.  \u0026ldquoThe health and social care partnership has assured us they will continue to give funding at the current level for this financial year which is \u0026pound82,000 to continue to fund the eight registered places which we are grateful for in this transition period. However, that is less than a third of what it costs to run all our services and maintain the building.  \u0026ldquoThings are going to be very tight for the near future while we submit funding applications to funders like the lottery however, we are very excited at the prospect of moving forward and very grateful for the support from the people of Musselburgh and beyond.  Councillor Fiona O\u0026rsquoDonnell, health and social care spokesperson, said: \u0026ldquoI am pleased that the Hollies will continue to provide a wide range of services in Musselburgh.  \u0026ldquoThis was a really positive meeting and the plans to provide more activities in the Hollies are good news for local people.  \u0026ldquoThe health and social care partnership will continue its work to increase the amount of day support in Musselburgh for older people with complex care needs."},{"url":null,"title":"flag-ceremony-held-to-mark-armed-forces-day","story":"  The ceremony marked the start of a week of celebrations across Scotland to mark the contribution members of the armed forces make.

He told those in attendance: \"Today is an opportunity to recognise the enormous contribution made by service personnel - past and present - and pay tribute to those who very sadly paid the ultimate sacrifice.  \"This November marks a century since the end of the First World War. A large number of residents left East Lothian in service of their country \u0026ndash many of whom, tragically, would never return.  \"Sadly, in the 100 years since, the world has seen all too many conflicts \u0026ndash some on a large scale, others more confined. In war, and in peacetime, our armed forces have promoted peace and security, confronted terrorism, and delivered aid to those in need.  \"That\u0026rsquos why, as Provost of East Lothian, I value occasions such as Armed Forces Day. A chance to give thanks, remember, reflect and look ahead.\"  Mr McMillan also paid tribute to the role of women in the military and in times of conflict, noting that 2018 was also the 100th anniversary of the first women being given the vote.  He said: \"Women played a significant role in the war effort, taking on work such as farming, transport and munition production, and the perseverance of Suffrage activity subsequently led to women being given the right to vote.  \"For a number of years now women have deservedly been playing a full and active role in our Armed Forces \u0026ndash reflective of the increasingly inclusive society in which we all live and are so keen to protect.\"  Veterans who attended the ceremony on Monday were invited to enjoy refreshments after the event."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7979931.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"scotlands-best-black-pudding-made-in-east-lothian","story":"  When the final of this year\u0026rsquos Scottish Black Pudding Championship was held earlier this month at the Edinburgh New Town Cook School, it was Anderson\u0027s Quality Butchers who came out on top.

Among the issues highlighted at the public meeting were long waits to get through to the surgery by telephone failure of repeat prescriptions poor communication with patients very long waiting times to see a named GP lack of continuity of care and treatment difficulties with NHS 24 and test results not being given out by doctors.  Concerns were also raised about GP training and recruitment, the area\u0026rsquos growing population causing additional pressures on local health services, the cost of calling the surgery and the idea of an online booking system.  Last Wednesday, Ms Dugdale asked the Scottish Government what discussions it has had with NHS Lothian regarding general practitioner services in Musselburgh.  Shona Robison, who was Cabinet Secretary for Health and Sport at the time, said: \u0026ldquoNHS 24 is delivering a pilot at the Riverside GP practice in Musselburgh whereby it is triaging patients who have requested same-day GP appointments. Where appropriate, NHS 24 will signpost patients to areas of the primary care system that are better placed to meet their needs, often more swiftly. \u0026ldquoIndications are that the pilot is working well, with a number of patients signposted to more appropriate support, freeing up GPs to deal with patients with more complex needs. A full evaluation is underway with a report due in the coming weeks, which will be shared with health boards and integration authorities.  Ms Dugdale commented: \u0026ldquoEarlier this month, 200 angry Musselburgh residents turned out at a public meeting because they have had real and persistent difficulties in accessing GPs locally. They do not think that the pilot is working that well. Many of the problems are caused by a GP shortage - a point that the practice and the British Medical Association have acknowledged. Can the cabinet secretary explain to my constituents why they have to phone NHS 24 to see their GP and when she expects Scotland\u0026rsquos GP shortage to be resolved?  Ms Robison said: \u0026ldquoThe pilot that NHS 24 is running is a system that has worked well elsewhere and that has had strong evaluation, so I urge Kezia Dugdale to wait for the formal evaluation of the pilot. I am happy for her to be furnished with the evaluation if she would be interested in that.  \u0026ldquoWith regard to the way forward for general practice, she will be aware of the new contract that has been put in place with substantial resources to back it up. In this financial year, we will invest \u0026pound100 million to support the new contract, and we also have the ambition to increase the number of GPs by at least 800 over the next 10 years. In addition, the multidisciplinary team will make sure that we can reduce the workload of GPs.  Mr Whitfield told the Courier: \u0026ldquoAt the recent GP public meeting, Kezia and I agreed to take the concerns raised back to the practice, but also to NHS Lothian and the Scottish Government. Kezia has acted swiftly to challenge the Health Secretary on the issue and demand she does more to alleviate the problems experienced in Musselburgh.  \u0026ldquoWe have also passed on the issues and questions highlighted at the meeting to the practice. Once we receive a response we will share it with those who attended. We will also keep up the pressure locally and nationally for further action to help patients here receive the service they need.  Mr Dugdale later said the appropriate steps needed to be taken to support \u0026ldquostruggling GP practices and prevent further closures.  Miles Briggs, Lothian Conservative MSP, who also took part in the Holyrood debate, later said: \u0026ldquoThe Health Secretary\u0026rsquos assurance that the pilot is working well in Musselburgh is totally at odds with the experience of many local patients who have expressed very real concerns about delays in getting through and arranging a routine GP appointment.  \u0026ldquoMinisters and NHS Lothian need to respond to what are genuine issues being experienced by local residents and to take urgent action to address these."},{"url":null,"title":"harry-potter-stars-are-heading-to-musselburgh-this-summer","story":"  Stars of the movies will be taking part in the summer event which is being held at Loretto School and raising funds for Children\u0026rsquos Hospices Across Scotland (CHAS).

Searching for frog spawn and wee tadpoles is often a key childhood memory. But there are things we know about without really knowing about them.  This thought came to me as I searched for tadpoles and wee frogs in a pond last weekend with a group of parents and their children.  I love nature and believe it is a powerful part of all of us, which is why going to the woods or the beach, or just the general \u0026lsquocountryside\u0026rsquo, is an antidote for the stress of life.  But the truth is we don\u0026rsquot really have to go far to reach nature it\u0026rsquos all around us.  The spider\u0026rsquos web on the hedge, the birds on the roof that wake us in the mornings, the self-seeded flowers which grow in places all around our towns, the trees which blossom then turn our streets green, the wee beasties in our garden soil, the list goes on and on.  Yet it is so easy to rush past all the magic which is just on our doorstep.  And as I watched the wee frogs swimming in the pond last week, I discovered just how much I don\u0026rsquot know and have missed.  That\u0026rsquos the joy of having young children, I think: they are a passport for you as a \u0026lsquogrown-up\u0026rsquo to explore the world with a sense of fascination that we all once had, and can be rekindled.  You see, I\u0026rsquod never actually thought about how a tadpole changes into a frog.  In the day-to-day living of life I suppose it\u0026rsquos understandable it is not an issue we will spend too much time thinking about.  But as I watched the wee frogs come up from the mud to the surface to breathe, then swim down again, I realised we were looking down on a simple but fascinating miracle of nature.  Then a wee frog literally jumped from a stone onto my son\u0026rsquos hand.  He could have squashed it or even been frightened by it, but instead he said \u0026ldquowow.  The wee creature jumped from his hand onto mine, obviously looking for a way back to the safety of the water.  Carefully, and a bit reluctantly, he helped the wee \u0026lsquobaby frog\u0026rsquo back into the water where it swam back down to the mud.  That\u0026rsquos when I realised I knew about the process without knowing about it.  There were some frogs which looked like late developers compared to their cousins, for they seemed to be more tadpole than frog, still swimming about with a tail between their developing frog legs.  The whole spectacle was, honestly, fascinating. I found myself being in awe at the process that we all know about but don\u0026rsquot really know about.  And so as summer has reached us, I am determined to make it a Safari of Discovery on our doorstep.  I will share this journey with you the places, stories and folklore attached to them. And while I cannot claim to be an expert on nature, I know its spiritual importance and I think that is a good beginning.  My first port of call will be the wood of what my kids call the \u0026ldquoserpent trees.  Where is that? You\u0026rsquoll find out next week!  In the meantime, I will have to keep this week\u0026rsquos page short as it is my daughter Manja\u0026rsquos ninth birthday and I have mermaid tails to connect. . ."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7697530.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"council-calls-for-rejection-of-substation-plans","story":"  East Lothian Council will submit its formal objection to the proposals to a Scottish Government reporter after officials were given the unanimous support of elected councillors at a meeting of the local authority on Tuesday.  A planning application for the substation by Inch Cape Offshore Limited (ICOL) was called in by Scottish Ministers in a controversial move in April and will now be decided by the reporter instead of the council.  ICOL wants to bring offshore energy from a planned windfarm off the Angus coast onto land at Cockenzie by building the substation on the footprint of the former power station.  A previous planning application siting the substation further inland had been given planning permission but that permission lapsed instead of renewing it, ICOL decided to pursue a new site.  In its argument to Scottish Ministers, the council will state that the substation is \u0026ldquonot the best use of the land and point out that planning permission had been given at another site.  Councillor Norman Hampshire said: \u0026ldquoBecause of the location, we have to recommend it should be refused. We have done a lot of work to move this proposal forward and this action jeopardises that.  \u0026ldquoI think if everybody had worked together we could have got a development on a site the council, developers and communities could have supported.  Earlier this month, representatives of ICOL were challenged by Prestonpans Community Council to name any independent party that support the planned location of the substation.  Brian Weddell, community council chairman, told the ICOL representatives that there had been no public consultation about the new site.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe are against it, Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council are against it, East Lothian Council and Scottish Natural Heritage are against it.  \u0026ldquoShow us anyone, apart from Inch Cape, who think it is a good site.  Ian Johnson, ICOL project manager, said: \u0026ldquoWe are naturally disappointed that East Lothian Council officers have recommended refusal to the application on the grounds that it could prejudice future development of the area. ICOL have been and will continue to work with the council to look at options to reduce the footprint of the site and ensure that other potential future developments can co-exist next to the substation.  However, he made it clear there were no plans to consider an alternative site, telling the Courier: \u0026ldquoWe have no intention of moving the proposed site of the onshore transmission works again.  The reporter is due to visit Cockenzie on Monday as part of her investigation into the application."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7994954.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"glory-days-of-golf-remembered","story":"  Musselburgh Museum on High Street is hosting an exhibition called \u0026lsquoMusselburgh \u0026ndash Cradle of Golf\u0026rsquo which is aimed at reasserting the Honest Toun\u0026rsquos importance in the sport\u0026rsquos rich heritage.  Boasting one of the oldest golf courses in the world \u0026ndash Musselburgh Links, The Old Course \u0026ndash the town was once home to the Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers, who now play at Muirfield, near Gullane.  The Honourable Company brought other Edinburgh clubs to the town such as Royal Burgess, Bruntsfield and the Warrender.  The exhibition celebrates the days from 1836 to the early 20th century when Musselburgh was at the forefront of the game\u0026rsquos development.  It not only celebrates the golf clubs which played in the town over the years but also the many golf club and ball makers, and professional players, who made their living in the town between 1836 and 1900 \u0026ndash a period of dramatic growth in the game.  The display has been organised by Musselburgh Museum and Heritage Group in partnership with Mungo Park, whose great-grandfather Willie Park Senior, from Wallyford, won the first Open Championship at Prestwick in 1860 and went on to be a four-time Open champion.  Willie\u0026rsquos brother Mungo and son Willie Junior were also Open champions at Musselburgh Links.  Two other local men \u0026ndash Bob Ferguson, who won a hat-trick of Open Championships, and David Brown \u0026ndash complete the town\u0026rsquos five Open champions, with 11 wins between them.  Support for the exhibition has also been received from East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos economic development and strategic investment department and Musselburgh Common Good Fund.  The exhibition, which runs from July 6 to September 1, is to be officially opened by Lord Wemyss, whose family has been involved with golf since the early 18th century.  On display are a large number of golf items and memorabilia donated by golf clubs that were formerly located at Musselburgh Links. Artefacts from the British Golf Museum and private collections can also be viewed.  The exhibition includes significant artefacts that have not been seen publicly in Scotland for decades, among them Charles Lees\u0026rsquo famous painting A Summer Evening on the Musselburgh Links: Golfers, which recently sold at Bonhams.  Organisers say the display shows Musselburgh\u0026rsquos leadership in developing golf and exporting it.

The land had previously been owned by Sainsbury\u0026rsquos who had permission for a new supermarket there but their long-stalled plans were finally ditched when they sold the land earlier this year.  A public exhibition took place at the town\u0026rsquos John Gray Centre last Tuesday where those behind the plans were on hand to answer local residents\u0026rsquo questions.  Alex Mitchell, director of Zander Planning, admitted there had been a \u0026ldquomixed reaction from the people who turned up.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe have had a great turnout \u0026ndash some people have been supportive and think that it will be of benefit to the town but others are worried about what it will do to the town centre.  Alastair Dickie, development director at Ediston Real Estate, which are behind the plans, added: \u0026ldquoI think there have been a lot of valid comments.  The names of the businesses looking to move into the site have not yet been revealed but it is hoped that their identities will become public by the time a planning application is submitted to East Lothian Council.  Mr Mitchell hopes a detailed planning application will be lodged before the end of the summer. He said: \u0026ldquoIf we can get an application in by about September then we\u0026rsquore probably looking at six months for planning [approval]. If we get [that] we could be on-site in spring 2019.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom sure retailers would want to be open before Christmas but that is probably a bit tight so we\u0026rsquod be looking at early 2020.  Mr Mitchell also attempted to allay fears over the volume of traffic on the road by adding: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore looking to create a filter lane so people coming in [to the new retail park] would not cause queues for people getting into the town.  Paul Darling, one of the planning liaison officers at the town\u0026rsquos community council, attended the exhibition.  He said the buildings proposed were \u0026ldquougly but added: \u0026ldquoI am not against the plans, I just think the buildings have to be more in-keeping with the rest of the town.  \u0026ldquoI think that it could actually bring people to the town but it is a bit of a worry what could happen to the shops in the town centre.  The site had long been earmarked for Sainsbury\u0026rsquos after it won a lengthy battle with Tesco to build on the site in 2013."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8009220.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"dunbar-student-heading-off-to-the-olympics-of-tech","story":"  A games development team, made up of students from Abertay University, will take on the best in the world at the Microsoft Imagine Cup in Seattle.

Among those representing the Dundee university is Emily Peterson, from Dunbar.  She said: \u0026ldquoThey are sending the first and second place teams out to Seattle for the competition, which is in the last week in July.  \u0026ldquoIt is quite exciting, I\u0026rsquom just the artist on the team.  \u0026ldquoI do the models and particular effects and textures.  The team, who make up Blacklight Games, created Firepoint \u0026ndash a first-person mixed reality simulator which aims to bring a new level of realism to firefighter training.  Using HoloLens and Windows Mixed Reality technology, the game allows trainees to see through the eyes of a firefighter as they make their way through a multi-storey training ground tackling a variety of different issues.  It is hoped the simulator can eventually be used at open days or recruitment fairs.  The former Dunbar Grammar School pupil told the Courier the idea had evolved over time before resulting in the final product.  Originally, proposals looked at creating a game involving a maze.  However, a discussion with a firefighter saw the focus of the project, which is the work of eight third year students, change.  Emily said: \u0026ldquoMatthew McAuley, from our team, had a friend who worked for the fire service.  \u0026ldquoI think he got the initial from there and said why don\u0026rsquot we come up with that.  \u0026ldquoWe had been making the initial concept like a maze and it is something you can still see in the final build of the game.  In April, the team from Abertay University took part in the UK finals of the Microsoft Imagine Cup in London.  A team from Manchester University was crowned the overall UK winner with Abertay finishing as the runner-up.  Now, both universities will send teams to the final.

Mrs Paul said that, while she was not against giving young people a place of their own, she felt the shelter \u0026ndash which sits to the rear of the home the couple have lived in for 18 years \u0026ndash was not the right location.

The spokesman added: \u0026ldquoThe recent warm weather is ideal for beach barbecues but we would urge people to take care.  \u0026ldquoEven when a barbecue has cooled the heat of the sand underneath can be considerable, as this man\u0026rsquos injuries demonstrated."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8024011.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"university-delight-for-inspirational-paul","story":"  Paul Hannigan was just 12 years old when doctors discovered three tumours on his brain, called a multifocal germinoma, which were affecting his sight.  They also found five secondary tumours at the top of his spine.  By the age of 13, the brave teenager had completed a high dose of radiotherapy to his brain and spinal cord following a biopsy.  Despite his health challenges, Paul, who is now 30, received a Bachelor of Engineering with Honours in Computer Systems and Networks degree at a graduation ceremony at the Usher Hall last week.  His family, including mum Angela, 52, and sisters Laura, 34, and Aleigh, 21, were filled with pride to see him receive his degree.  He was also awarded the Rob Kemmer Prize, receiving \u0026pound100 in recognition of his \u0026ldquooutstanding achievements on his individual programme of study.  Paul, of Burns Wynd, is now planning to return to Napier after the summer to complete his Master\u0026rsquos Degree.  Angela, who has been Paul\u0026rsquos full-time carer, said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom incredibly proud of Paul.  \u0026ldquoDespite his challenges he just gets on with things and has achieved his degree.  \u0026ldquoHe has had a tough life but he does not give up and is an incredibly caring young man.  \u0026ldquoNothing is going to stop Paul.  Angela revealed that Paul was a pupil at Musselburgh Grammar School when his condition was first diagnosed.  She said: \u0026ldquoPaul was having trouble with his eyesight and the school contacted me to say they thought it was getting worse.  \u0026ldquoIt was when he was referred to the Eye Pavilion in Edinburgh they discovered the tumours were the cause of it.  \u0026ldquoHe had multifocal germinoma tumours and secondary cancer caused the spinal lesions.  Although the radiotherapy cured his tumour, it had other detrimental effects.  Paul is registered blind as a result of the radiotherapy to his visual nerves and also has a curvature of the spine.  The pituitary gland in his brain has failed completely, so he needs to take hormone replacements and he also finds it difficult to open his jaw, which is thought to be due to scar tissue following radiotherapy.  It was when he was working as a volunteer at Musselburgh Citizens Advice Bureau that Paul first became interested in developing his computer skills, attending both Edinburgh College and Napier for four years.  Angela said: \u0026ldquoPaul doesn\u0026rsquot have an assistant at Napier and he travels there independently.  \u0026ldquoHe has some vision out of the side of one eye and the centre of the other.  \u0026ldquoThe university helped with extra large screens for him and giving him more time his teachers are all delighted for him.  Paul hopes that his achievement will inspire others with illness and disabilities to follow their dreams and aspirations.  He said: \u0026ldquoTo graduate with a degree is massive. It took a while to get here from secondary school.  \u0026ldquoI am looking forward to returning to Napier for a year to do my Master\u0026rsquos Degree. They have given huge support.  Paul is hoping to get a job based in computer security once he finishes his studies."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8024055.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"couple-get-permission-to-turn-old-bar-back-into-pub","story":"  Michael and Wendy Peters took over the Gardeners Arms in Haddington in 2011 when its licence had come under review because of problems experienced by previous management.  A meeting of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos licensing board last Thursday heard that since the Peters took charge of the pub there had not been a single complaint about it.  Now the couple have applied for permission to turn the building next door \u0026ndash which currently operates as Jo\u0026rsquos Kitchen \u0026ndash into a pub which they plan to name the New Pheasant.  The name is a reference to the building\u0026rsquos previous history as The Pheasant pub before it shut in 2009.  Mr and Mrs Peters\u0026rsquo agent highlighted articles in the Courier to the licensing board that showed the problems at the Gardeners Arms before the couple took it over.  He said: \u0026ldquoBefore they took over there were some interesting Courier articles which described the pub as a disgrace.  \u0026ldquoSince they took over, the Courier articles were about a disgraced pub being turned around.  Applying for a major variation to the current licence held by Jo\u0026rsquos Kitchen, the agent said that the Peters\u0026rsquo current role managing the Gardeners Arms was coming to an end next month and they were keen to move on to their own establishment.  The board heard two objections had been received, along with two letters of support, all from neighbouring residents.  Both objections raised concerns about noise, as well as pointing out that there were already three pubs in the town with \u0026lsquoto let\u0026rsquo signs up. But the board was told the fact other pubs were available to let was not relevant.  Rudy Fruzynski, East Lothian licensing standards officer, told the board he was happy to support the application, confirming that there had been no complaints about the operation of the Gardeners Arms since the Peters took over.  He added: \u0026ldquoIn recent times, the anti-social behaviour team has received a substantial complaint made by a resident in the area complaining about late-evening noise with persons congregating on Market Street and using nearby Cross Lane as a thoroughfare from High Street.  \u0026ldquoThis problem cannot be directly attributed to licensed premises on Market Street. It is more likely to be related to the make-up of the area as a whole, being a focal point for persons seeking the services of many different types of business that are open in the evenings, particularly at weekends.  The board unanimously approved the application, with a request from Police Scotland agreed for children under the age of 15 to vacate the new premises by 8pm and 16 and 17-year-olds to leave by 10pm.  A request from Police Scotland for outdoor drinking hours to be reduced from 9pm to 8pm was not supported by the licensing board as it conflicted with the current hours for the Gardeners Arms."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/6802523.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"earwigs-eat-into-coastal-car-park-profits","story":"  Calls have been made for a detailed review of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos parking charges policy at the county\u0026rsquos coastal car parks amid claims by opponents that once the costs had been taken away the entire scheme only made a profit of about \u0026pound6,000 in its second year.  And council official admitted that while the income from the charges was increasing year on year, it was not expected to come close to the \u0026pound300,000 included in the administration\u0026rsquos budget for this financial year, with an estimated gross income of \u0026pound238,000 predicted.  It was also revealed at a meeting of the council\u0026rsquos policy and performance review committee that the council pays the Earl of Wemyss one third of the income from Longniddry Bents car parks No 1, No 2 and No 3, on top of a \u0026pound10,000 lease, as the car parks are part of the Wemyss and March Estate.  Since the introduction of the charges in 2015, those three car parks have brought in just under \u0026pound75,000 in income.  In total, the money collected from the 10 coastal car park sites which charge since it was introduced has been \u0026pound343,212.45.  However, the cost of the scheme was questioned at the meeting.  East Lothian Council introduced a \u0026pound2-a-day charge for using the three Longniddry Bents car parks and those at Barn Ness, Gullane Bents, John Muir Country Park, Shore Road at Belhaven, Tyninghame Links, Whitesands and Yellowcraig in 2015.  The initial cost of introducing the scheme, which included ticketing machines, signs and introducing double yellow lines at various locations, was about \u0026pound900,000.  A further \u0026pound425,000 is earmarked to be invested this year in improving toilet facilities at the Longniddry car parks.  Season passes are available for \u0026pound40 a year and just under 3,000 are currently being used.  A report on the income from the car parks revealed that in its first year the scheme brought in \u0026pound98,795 with costs of \u0026pound4,977.  However, it said in its second year the gross income was just over \u0026pound169,000 while costs rose substantially to nearly \u0026pound94,000.  In the last financial year, gross income grew to \u0026pound188,000 while the costs were at about \u0026pound83,000.  Among the reasons given for the rise in costs were \u0026pound55,000 which is paid towards East Lothian\u0026rsquos private parking attendants and the cost of replacing machines which had been vandalised by people trying to break into them, as well as rental fees for the Longniddry car parks and payment to a private company which collects the money from the machines and provides IT access so they can be monitored.  Peter Forsyth, service manager with the council, said the cost of replacing four machines last year had been \u0026pound25,000 and he revealed there was an unusual bug problem.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe have been affected by equipment failure due to bugs, earwigs and such, who like to nest in the equipment. They are not covered by our warranty.  Councillor Paul McLennan, who is part of the SNP Group which has opposed the car park fees from the start, said he estimated that, between costs of the scheme and interest generated from the initial loans, in its second year it would have made just \u0026pound6,000 profit.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe business case is not stacking up.  However, Jim Lamond, the council\u0026rsquos head of finance, said the scheme was never intended to make profits.  He said: \u0026ldquoIt is not in the budget as an income-generating activity. It is in there for improving the coastal car parks and ultimately that has been done.  Councillor Jeremy Findlay (Con) said people in his ward in Gullane did not feel they were seeing improvement in facilities at their car park. He said: \u0026ldquoIt was sold to people as a way to invest in facilities and they are not seeing it.  However, Councillor John McMillan (Lab), cabinet spokesperson for economic development, said a review would have to take in the bigger picture.  He said: \u0026ldquoIt needs to look at the impact on economic development and benefits it is bringing into East Lothian as well.  The committee agreed to ask for a detailed review of the scheme."},{"url":null,"title":"delve-into-haddingtons-history-this-summer","story":"  An exhibition of the history of Haddington opened its doors at the John Gray Centre last week in the town as it celebrates 700 years since King Robert The Bruce awarded it a Royal Charter.  The collection looks at seven centuries of life in the town and was officially opened by Provost John McMillan who brought along a portrait of his grandfather, who shared his name and joined the army in 1918 as one of many underage young men keen to defend their country.  Mr McMillan said he hoped the exhibition would encourage people to explore their own family history and look into their ancestry.  The Bruce Charter, which is the oldest document held in the John Gray archives, is not on display during the exhibition because it has to be kept in conservation conditions, but people can view it during the archive\u0027s opening hours.  Some of the less ancient items were on display at the Haddington Show at the weekend when archivists from the centre set up a stall in the crafts tent.  There they displayed some old images from shows gone by and a book of the show\u0027s records from 1820.  Interestingly some of the family names in the nearly 200-year-old records were still well know in the communities.  Exploring themes such as royalty, religion, health, education, wartime and crime and punishment, the exhibition aims to bring stories from the archives to life.  Haddington was one of the most important towns in medieval Scotland, and even had a royal palace, the birthplace of King Alexander II.  One of the items on display is a sick note from Mary Queen of Scots \u0026ndash the Queen asks the burgh to excuse Philip Gibson from military service because he was too corpulent to ride his horse!  Other characters featured include Agnes Blaik and Elizabeth Golight, two ladies of ill repute who were accused of entertaining dragoons. Both were convicted \u0026ndash Elizabeth Golight in particular was named a \u0026lsquovicious strumpet\u0026rsquo by the court. They were sentenced to stand at the market cross with a paper announcing their crime attached to their clothes, and thereafter they were to be drummed out of the town.  In medieval Haddington crime certainly did not pay and punishments were harsh. Criminals could be sentenced to death and the burgh account books include costs for building the gallows and the purchase of ropes for executions.  Gallows Green (where Bellevue House stands) gets its name from being the place the gallows were situated, and there is evidence that hangings also took place from the Nungate bridge.  Punishments for lesser crimes were harsh and cruel \u0026ndash those caught stealing could be sentenced to a whipping by the hangman, banished from the burgh, branded with the town key, or have an ear nailed to the pillory post!  While much of the exhibition concentrates on the medieval period more modern topics including the Glasgow Overspill are featured.  In 1958 Haddington signed the first Overspill Agreement in Scotland with Glasgow which was bursting at the seams with a post war housing crisis while other parts of the country were sparse. Haddington Town Council agreed to provide 250 houses for Glasgow families, increasing the town\u0027s population by 20 per cent.  which would result in a 20% increase in population. The original Overspill Agreement is on display in the exhibition.  This exhibition offers a glimpse into the lives of the townspeople of the past, and tries to demonstrate the central role Haddington played in events of national significance. Seven Centuries of Haddington is on display until the end of September and is well worth a visit."},{"url":null,"title":"new-life-coming-for-pub","story":"  Officers were called to the Masons Arms on Belhaven High Street at 6.50am on March 31 following an undisclosed incident.

In April, Police Scotland asked East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos licensing board to review the pub\u0026rsquos licence and that of its manager Christopher Darling.  However, at a meeting last week, the board was told that Mr Darling had parted company with the pub owners and the premises was currently closed.  James Hughes, who currently runs Dunbar Golf Club, asked the board to consider transferring the licence to him as he revealed ambitious plans to invest \u0026pound50,000 in the business with a view to eventually taking ownership of the property.  Mr Hughes told the board that he was preparing to sign a five-year-lease of the pub with its current owner in a deal which would allow him to buy it at the end of the lease.  He said that there were plans to renovate the building to open it up more and make it a family-friendly site.  Mr Hughes told the meeting: \u0026ldquoWe plan to make it a good country food and beer premises.  \u0026ldquoIt is in an area steeped in history with [Belhaven] Brewery and a popular tourism area, and we want to turn it into a good welcoming family pub.  Mr Hughes, who has been at Dunbar Golf Club for several years, told the board he had more than 23 years of experience in the licensed trade and had worked in Edinburgh before moving to East Lothian.  He said that if given approval to go ahead the pub could re-open early next year.

Assembly host Bryden McKinnie, told the Courier, he received news from the Food Assembly UK operators on Friday afternoon that they were no longer operating in the UK.  The assemblies, which started in France, have been operating across the UK for five years.  They provide local hosts with the support to set up a website where local producers can offer their goods for sale and customers can browse online filling a \"shopping basket\" with products from a number of different companies.  They then collect all their shopping at one place on a set evening of the week.  The Haddington Assembly has held weekly collections at the Maitlandfield House Hotel since it began, with a wide range of local suppliers.  More than 1250 people have become members of the assembly in East Lothian but host Bryden said one of the issues to faced was building regular customers to make it sustainable.  He said of the 100 plus members only around 50 shop with any regularity and if the assembly was to continue in another form it was important to understand what stopped the other members from using it.  He said: \"It is difficult to sustain when you do not have a lot of regular shoppers, and this is a common thread among all the UK food assemblies.  \"We are talking to each other and looking at whether we can come up with a new way of operating, the announcement from the Food Assembly came as a shock and has really rocked everyone, but we are looking to the future.\"  The Haddington Food Assembly will stop at the end of this month.  However Mr McKinnie said alternatives would be looked at if it received a boost in its support.  He said: \"During the summer months orders can fall as low as 10 a week which is not sustainable. It really is a case of \"use it or lose it\".\"  A spokesperson for the Food Assembly said no public statement on the withdrawal was being made before the end of August.

Proud mum Juliet told the Courier it had been an eventful period from the audition to finding out that Clara had been successful.  She said: \u0026ldquoShe went to the National Piping Centre in Glasgow and she did her audition and she came out and said \u0026lsquoI did so badly, I messed up\u0026rsquo.  \u0026ldquoShe was so disappointed and I said to her that she was very young.  \u0026ldquoShe was terribly disappointed but I said \u0026lsquonever mind, you are young and will get another chance another year\u0026rsquo.  \u0026ldquoShe had been in tears and she felt she let herself down.  \u0026ldquoWe forgot all about it and then suddenly emails were coming through to her and myself.  \u0026ldquoShe came tearing down the stairs screaming at the top of her voice that she got into the development band.  \u0026ldquoShe was running round the house, up and down the stairs screaming with joy.

The company, which provides a link to many of the Scottish islands from the mainland, dates back to 1851 and has become famous for the red and black funnel, complete with the Lion Rampant, on its ships.  Kit said: \u0026ldquoWe self-published it the first time and having, finally, persuaded him to write down all the stories I found a way of getting it published.  \u0026ldquoWe printed about 400 copies and the punchline is, despite him giving a few away, we got enough money back to cover the publication cost.  \u0026ldquoAs far as I know it is sold out \u0026ndash I have got a copy and so do both my sons but I think that is about it.  \u0026ldquoThe reason we published it in the first place was, certainly to us, the highly entertaining stories about MacBrayne.  \u0026ldquoThere was a lot in it about his army service and, after coming back to it after all those years, the reason for publishing it again was just to make sure those reflections on a way of life long gone did not die with him.

The dad-of-three said: \u0026ldquoThe TV course has been a brilliant journey.  \u0026ldquoColleagues often ask where I find my energy, and sometimes I have to ask myself the same thing, especially at 4am when I have forgotten to go to bed. Perhaps my endurance and resilience comes from my 12 years as a commando.  \u0026ldquoThere have been sacrifices, the biggest of them being to have had no social life throughout this time, but I am passionate about television and I am now talking to production companies and hoping to make my mark in the documentary genre.

The artwork will be completed with a series of stainless steel arrows installed at different locations around Musselburgh. They are expected to be installed later this summer and will form a trail around the town to areas of cultural, historical, natural and community significance, supported by a Global Treasure App organised by Musselburgh Area Partnership.  Councillor Jim Goodfellow, cabinet spokesperson for community wellbeing, said: \u0026ldquoThis is a striking piece of art that represents so many aspects of local history.

She was medically discharged in 1995 and now works at Leuchie House.  The new president explained why she joined the rotary club.  Liz said: \"I wanted to get really involved in my local community and do something at the same time where I could have a lot of fun.  \"I had heard that Rotarians were prepared to give their time and effort to help people in need locally and abroad. So, I approached a Rotarian, who was collecting at Tesco, and was told that the club did not have any women members but would love some!  \"I went to a meeting and was made so welcome that I decided to stay!  \"The members are such wonderful people and we have a lot of fun in what we do, as well as through the active social side.

And spirits were high in central Moscow as fans sang and cheered late into the night on the eve of the biggest game in nearly three decades \u0026ndash a first World Cup semi-final since Italia 90.  The immortal line from the Baddiel and Skinner and the Lightning Seeds\u0026rsquo Three Lions (Football\u0026rsquos Coming Home) has moved beyond a social media trend to become a mantra for fans who are desperate to see an end to the years of hurt.  Across the UK, pubs, bars, gardens and public parks are getting ready to host huge World Cup parties \u0026ndash with police warning fans not to \u0026ldquooverstep the line with any celebrations in light of the excesses following Saturday\u0026rsquos quarter-final victory.  Around 30,000 people are expected in London\u0026rsquos Hyde Park, where a special screening has been organised.  In Moscow, police estimated between 8,000 to 10,000 England fans may arrive in the Russian capital.  Supporters who arrived without tickets faced a day of haggling with black marketeers and private sellers in order to get into the Luzhniki Stadium for kick-off at 9pm local time (7pm UK).  Among them were Will Carr and Dale Goulding, who made the decision to book flights last Thursday before progress was guaranteed.  Mr Goulding, 27, from Clapham Junction, south London, said the plan was to get to the ticket office early and pick up any tickets being resold through official channels, and failing that they would play the touts at their own game.  \u0026ldquoWhat the touts are doing is getting people coming to the Fifa ticket office and saying I\u0026rsquoll give you \u0026pound50 more, knowing they can sell it to and England fan for \u0026pound150 more, he said.  \u0026ldquoWe are going to turn up in our England tops \u0026ndash we\u0026rsquore genuine.

The office will accept public comments and hold hearings on the plan between August 20-23 before reaching a decision after August 31, according to a senior administration official.  Last Friday, the US imposed 25%t tariffs on 34 billion dollars (\u0026pound25 billion) in Chinese products, and Beijing responded by hitting the same amount of US imports.  The administration said the new levies are a response to China\u0026rsquos decision to retaliate against the first round of US tariffs.  President Donald Trump has threatened to tax as much as 550 billion dollars (\u0026pound414 billion) in Chinese products \u0026ndash an amount that exceeds America\u0026rsquos total imports from China last year.  The United States complains that China uses predatory practices in a push to challenge American technological dominance. Chinese tactics, the administration says, include outright cybertheft and forcing US companies to hand over technology in exchange for access to the Chinese market.  The initial US tariff list focused on Chinese industrial products in an attempt to limit the impact on American consumers. By expanding the list, the administration is beginning to hit products that US households buy, including such things as electric lamps and fish sticks.  \u0026ldquoTariffs on 200 billion dollars in Chinese products amounts to another multibillion-dollar tax on American businesses and families, said Scott Lincicome, a trade lawyer and senior policy analyst for the group Republicans Fighting Tariffs.  \u0026ldquoGiven China\u0026rsquos likelihood of retaliation, it\u0026rsquos also billions worth of new tariffs on American exporters.  Members of Congress are increasingly questioning Trump\u0026rsquos aggressive trade policies, warning that tariffs on imports raise prices for consumers and expose U.S. farmers and manufacturers to retaliation abroad.  \u0026ldquoTonight\u0026rsquos announcement appears reckless and is not a targeted approach, Senate Finance Chairman Orrin Hatch said in a statement.  \u0026ldquoWe cannot turn a blind eye to China\u0026rsquos mercantilist trade practices, but this action falls short of a strategy that will give the administration negotiating leverage with China while maintaining the long-term health and prosperity of the American economy."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7697530.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc2 martini-tablet-src=/resources/images/7697530.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc3 martini-desktop-src=/resources/images/7697530.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"glasgow-resident-blasts-vengaboys-over-orange-walk","story":"  The joker played the Vengaboys\u0027 We Like To Party (The Vengabus) from his Argyle Street flat as the flute and drum procession passed through the City Centre yesterday morning.                         .bc-player-rkgvgWjWCG_default .vjs-tech { position: static !important }                       .bc-player-rkgvgWjWCG_default { height: auto !important width: 100% !important}                       .vjs-playlist-description { display: none }                       .vjs-big-play-button { top: 0pxleft: 0pxright: 0pxbottom: 0pxmargin: auto }                       .vjs-mouse.vjs-playlist { background-color: #f7f4f1color: #000min-width: auto }                       .vjs-playlist cite { overflow: initialtext-overflow: initialwhite-space: initialfont-weight: 600font-size: 16px }                       .vjs-mouse.vjs-playlist time { color: #fff }                       cite.vjs-playlist-name { text-align: left }                       .story-credits { margin-top: 20px }                       #liveMultiHide .vjs-dock-description { display: none }                       .vjs-playlist-thumbnail { margin-right: 10px !IMPORTANT }                        /* Style the overlay */                        /* Hide the overlay */                        .hide-countdown {                            display: none                        }                        .hide-overlay {                            display: none                        }                        /* Style the overlay */                        .vjs-overlay,                        .vjs-overlay.vjs-overlay-top {                            position: absolute                            top: 0px                            left: 0px                        }                        .vjs-overlay p {                            width: 100px                            background-color: #000000                            color: #fff                            padding: 10px                            margin: 0                            margin-bottom: 0                            border-radius: 0px                            text-align: left                        }                        .popout-player {                            position: relative                            width: 340px                            margin-bottom: 50px                            transition-property: all                            transition-duration: 100ms                            transition-timing-function: ease-in-out                        }                                                           width=\"100%\"                data-account=\"64298557001\"                data-player=\"rkgvgWjWCG\"                data-embed=\"default\"                data-video-id=\"5806735548001\"                class=\"video-js\"                playsinline                data-random-id=\"1153879886\"                                controls  On Twitter, neighbour Euan posted a video of the caper, stating: \"Haha no way did someone get his speakers out and blast Vengaboys over the Orange Walk.\"  Read more:\u0026nbspPolice investigating claims priest spat on during Glasgow Orange Walk"},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8046268.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"orange-walk-in-glasgow-thousands-sign-petition-to-ban-parade","story":"  It cames as Police Scotland appealled\u0026nbspto members of an Orange Walk for witnesses to an attack on a Catholic priest as the parade passed his church on Saturday.

Pupils at Wick High could also miss out on extracurricular activities, it was stated.At present, Stagecoach runs a service to Gills Bay three times a day, Monday to Saturday, but from next month it will operate twice a day, Monday to Friday. There are additional journeys between Wick and John O\u0026rsquoGroats but they vary according to school hours.A Stagecoach spokeswoman said the company recognised the feedback from the community over its plans. \u0026ldquoThe revised proposals represent a significant investment by Stagecoach, and work will continue to promote these links to encourage a sustainable level of demand. A review will take place 12 months after the start of the new timetable in order to establish the long term future of the bus service to Gills Bay.Trudy Morris, who chairs the Caithness Transport Forum, said: \u0026ldquoWe are very pleased to see that Stagecoach has listened to the local community and agreed to secure the bus link to Gills Bay for a further 12 months. Not only will this bring benefit to local bus users, who would otherwise be isolated in their communities, but it also has potential to benefit the tourist market, providing services to link with the Gills Bay ferry.However, she is concerned about the review in 12 months time and said: \u0026ldquoWe will be working with Stagecoach and the local community to see what can be done to promote usage of the route, and will also be discussing with public sector partners such as Highland Council to see what might be done to secure the route on a non-commercial basis in future.Bill Mowat, the chairman of Gills Harbour Ltd, claimed public pressure had an impact on Stagecoach and pointed out there was strong opposition to the plan.Wednesday 11 Jul 2018 4:38 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"July 10, 2018 at 4:27 pmThe story of a little girl from Orkney who lost her teddy bear has inspired Loganair to launch their own cuddly companions.

This could run into millions of pounds and put at risk the future viability of the business.The company have also met with local Orkney MSP, Liam McArthur, to express their concerns about the delay.As the start of this month, as Mr Matheson stepped into the shoes of the previous minister for transport Humza Yousaf, it was announced that lack of agreement between the Scottish Government and Pentland Ferries had led to no discounted fares being introduced in Pentland Firth ferry routes, by the Government\u0026#8217s self-set deadline of the end of last month.Andrew Banks, Managing Director and Owner of Pentland Ferries said: “We want these passenger subsidies implemented as soon as possible but we need to be 100 per cent sure that the scheme complies with state aid rules.  We have never had any subsidy from the government and even though this scheme gives money to the passenger, not the operator, the minister has told us that we would be liable for any repayment if at a future date the scheme is deemed illegal. This could run into the millions and could finish us off.“We cannot take that risk and we have a responsibility to our staff, our community and family to make sure the scheme works for everyone. We want to work with the Minister and his team to discuss a way forward so that we can all benefit from reduced fares. This scheme will be fantastic for our business, attracting more visitors to the islands and making it cheaper to travel to the mainland for residents. So we want this unlocked as soon as possible. We welcome the Minister’s willingness to gain a full understanding of the detail and very much hope to be able to meet him in Orkney soon.”The minister, Mr Matheson, was asked for a response to the comments from Pentland Ferries and Mr Banks. At the time he replied, Transport Scotland said the invitation had not yet been received so the minister could not comment.However, Mr Matheson did say: “The Scottish Government remains committed to delivering reduced ferry fares to the Northern Isles. I am conscious that there is a great deal of interest in this issue amongst users of the services. As I begin my new role as Transport Secretary, I want to ensure that I gain a full understanding of the detail — it is already very clear to me that planning to introduce reduced fares on the Northern Isles network has been a complex and challenging piece of work.“As a first step, we will cut fares on the Aberdeen-Lerwick and Kirkwall-Lerwick services from June 30. These reductions will be around 20 per cent for both passengers and cars.“On routes to Orkney, it has been necessary to engage with commercial operators on the Pentland Firth. We set out a very fair and reasonable proposal that would maintain competition, enabling them to protect their existing market share. Unfortunately, not all the commercial operators have felt able to agree to our proposals. This means we cannot currently implement reduced fares on any of the routes to and from Orkney without the risk of legal challenge.“This is both disappointing and frustrating, but I am determined to work through the issue to see what more can be done. I have asked Transport Scotland to undertake some further work to see what measures, if any, we can take. As part of that, we are willing to reopen talks with commercial operators.  I will provide a further update to stakeholders and to Parliament as soon as I can, with a view to bringing the full benefits of the scheme to the people of Orkney and Shetland.”\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This will help reduce the initial barrier of connection for a defined period of time.Two events are planned at the St Magnus Centre in Kirkwall, from 6pm to 8pm on Wednesday July 11 then from 10am to 12pm on Thursday July 12 with a further event at the Doubletree by Hilton, Glasgow Central, from 10.30am to 12.30noon on Friday July 13 and finally, a webinar will take place on Tuesday July 17 from 10am to 12pm.Registration is required for the Alternative Approach consultations via the following link: https://www.ssen-transmission/news-views/articles/2018/6/solving-orkney-s-catch-22/Commenting on the Alternative Approach consultation events, Lauren Milligan, commercial policy manager, said: “As a customer-driven initiative, stakeholder engagement has shaped the Alternative Approach proposal to date.“We want to ensure that we develop a solution that not only works for network companies but also the wider industry and other connection customers and would therefore encourage anyone with an interest in our proposed Alternative Approach trial to register for one of our consultation events.”The final stage of consultation is planned to take place in Autumn on the various components of the transmission reinforcement project in advance of submitting planning applications to the relevant planning authorities, the Scottish Government, Marine Scotland and Orkney Islands Council.The progression of the project is subject to all necessary planning consents and securing regulatory approval from industry regulator Ofgem, with the Alternative Approach trial also subject to regulatory approval.For more information on the proposed Orkney transmission reinforcement, including links to both consultation documents, click here.\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Each of the three winding barrels will have a small motor fitted, and a sensor, which will automatically detect when the clock has wound down to a certain level. In addition, the clock will also be fitted with a pendulum regulator, which will ensure the clock time is more accurate.Cathedral custodian Fran Hollinrake said: \u0026#8220It is the end of an era. It was always a great workout climbing the tower stairs and manually winding the clock, but it was just becoming too impractical with all our other duties. The clock will still be the clock, it will just have a couple of new bits added on.\u0026#8221The previous clock on St Magnus Cathedral dated from 1761, and was made by Hugh Gordon, a clockmaker in Aberdeen. But during the early 20th century, as part of the Sheriff Thoms bequest, a new timepiece was commissioned that would see the cathedral through the 20th century and beyond. The present clock was made when the world was at war, in 1915, although it was not actually installed until 1919, the same week that the Treaty of Versailles was signed that ended the First World War.James Ritchie and Son (Clockmakers) was founded in 1809, and the company specialised in large steeple and public clocks, both making and restoring. If you are familiar with Princes Street Gardens in Edinburgh, you will know the world-famous Floral Clock, not far from Waverley Station. It was made in 1903 by Ritchie\u0026#8217s, and was the first of its kind in the world.\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Mrs Foster\u0026rsquos nieces and nephews from as far afield as the Canary Islands, Edinburgh, Liverpool and Sussex headed north for the event.Her birthday cake, baked by a relative, was shaped as an artist\u0026rsquos palette to represent one of her great passions in life.Mrs Foster was born in Surrey and spent her childhood with her three siblings in Kent, where her father had a grocery business.She started her working life in an office at a department store and then worked as a secretary mainly with legal firms, in England and Edinburgh.Mrs Foster said she and her husband Tony had been \"gradually moving up the country\" before settling in their cottage in Muir of Ord. Her husband passed away in January 2012.Asked the secret of her long life, she said: \"I\u0026rsquove been asked this before and I always say \u0026lsquopure living\u0026rsquo, but of course it\u0026rsquos not!

What you’ll need:              • 500g Canadian strong white bread flour (or a flour with a high gluten content, i.e. at least 14 per cent) • 30g lard or vegetable shortening • 10g sugar • 10g salt • 5g fast action yeast             • 400ml cold water For the Coating • 50g plain flour • 50g rice cones/flourView our STEP BY STEP GALLERY HERE            Method: 1 Rub the fat into the flour in a large mixing bowl. Stir in the sugar, salt and yeast. 2 Now pour in the water and mix until it is all incorporated. This is a wet dough but when you are using bread flour with such a high gluten content it can easily take that much water without becoming sloppy. 3 Remove the dough from the bowl and knead it for 1 minute until the dough has just become smooth with all the ingredients thoroughly combined. 4 With such a long ferment you don’t need to knead it too much. Put the dough back into the bowl and cover loosely with cling film. Put the bowl in the refrigerator to leave it to ferment for 12 – 16 hours.             5 The next morning combine the rice cones and plain flour for the coating. Take a large baking sheet and dust it liberally with the coating mixture (make sure to leave enough to coat the rolls). 6 Empty the dough on to a work surface which has been liberally dusted with the rice/flour coating mixture. This is where a large silicone spatula or scraper is useful. 7 Now using a dough scraper divide the dough into 8 pieces. Don’t worry if it is sticky or messy as these rolls aren’t supposed to look perfect. 8 Dust your fingers with the coating mixture and take each piece of dough, one at a time, and dip it into the coating mixture and place it on the baking sheet. They don’t need to be in the shape of a roll but try to keep in the air that is inside the dough. 9 Do this with each piece, placing them near to each other so that when they rise they will bake together. Despite the stickiness of this dough the coating mixture works wonders for stopping the dough from sticking to everything. Leave them to rise for 1 – 2 hours or until doubled in size. 10 Bake in a 250˚C preheated oven on a high shelf for 15 – 20 minutes or until the tops are dark. The rolls should be well fired for the right flavour.• Recipe submitted by Fraser Wright Read more: The history of morning rolls, including a recipe for making your ownRead more: A history of the square sausage, including a recipe for making your own"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4766362.1531165163!/image/image.jpg","title":"nicola sturgeon keen to create scottish public owned energy firm","story":"        The feasibility of a Scottish state-owned energy company is set to be examined.

Theresa May has betrayed those 17.4 million who voted for Brexit with her latest plan, writes Brian Monteith                Well, does Brexit now mean Brexit? Does the Prime Minister’s Cabinet agreement on a negotiating position – more than two years after the British people voted to leave the European Union – amount to a craven capitulation or a triumph of pragmatism in the face of the EU’s intransigence?             The test must surely be to examine the proposal against what Theresa May has repeatedly told us, namely we shall be leaving the EU’s single market and customs union, we shall be controlling our own borders and we shall be free from the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice. In other words, by regaining full sovereignty the UK will take back control.            The press statement that summarised the Prime Minister’s proposal, which will form the basis of a White Paper, has been examined by barrister Martin Howe, QC, a respected specialist in European law and adviser to Lawyers for Britain – and it has been found seriously wanting.His 18-page advice can be found at their website and is well worth a read but the telling phrase is this: “These proposals [therefore] lead directly to a worst-of-all-worlds ‘Black Hole’ Brexit where the UK is stuck permanently as a vassal state in the EU’s legal and regulatory tar pit, still has to obey EU laws and ECJ rulings across vast areas, cannot develop an effective international trade policy or adapt our economy to take advantage of the freedom of Brexit, and has lost its vote and treaty veto rights as an EU member state.”• READ MORE: David Davis resignation plunges government into crisisTo achieve unanimity around her proposal, the Prime Minister connived against her colleagues who have repeatedly given her the benefit of the doubt only to find that decisions taken in good faith on issues such as the single market and customs union are consistently reopened to be debated again.Consider this: Mrs May flew to Germany to reveal her proposal to Chancellor Angela Merkel before she had presented it to her own Cabinet in an attempt to obtain pre-approval. It is generally held that the EU was also given wind of what she was proposing and was asked not to dismiss it out of hand before any negotiations.             The Cabinet members were then given the 120-page document to read individually only two hours before their meeting started and had their phones and watches taken off them so they could not communicate details of the contents or the meeting. Meanwhile, civil servants behind the plan were leaking details of the proceedings as if they were commenting gleefully on Eurovision Song Contest entries.That a Prime Minister should seek to cut a deal behind the backs of her own Cabinet betrays that she is not negotiating for the best deal from the EU but on the contrary, is negotiating together with the EU against Brexiteers in the Cabinet who represent the 17.4 million that voted Leave. If that is not treachery I don’t know what is. What we are heading for is not a soft Brexit, as its supporters are portraying it, but a soft Remain that will in time become a hard Remain – for it will undoubtedly result in further concessions. The Prime Minister’s Chequers agreement is only her opening gambit and, by the example of her performance thus far, must mean further concessions along the way.To consider what May has done let us look at it from a Scottish context. Imagine Scotland voted to leave the UK in a second independence referendum, but in the negotiations for a new relationship with the UK the SNP Cabinet is divided because some fear a soft Indyref will tie Scotland forever to decisions by UK institutions such as Westminster, the Bank of England and UK Supreme Court. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon quietly jets down to London, meets the UK Prime Minister of the day and reveals the plans she will present to her Scottish Cabinet before they are able to read it and agree to it. Sturgeon, with the promise of no more than murmurings from the UK that it is only a good starting-point, comes home and threatens the collapse of the government and an early election if she doesn’t get her way.            That is what May has done, and it is nothing short of treacherous to the decision that was taken on 23 June, 2016 by the British people – and it is not even the final settlement. No matter how sweet-sounding its initial reaction, the EU will bargain for more.  One has to conclude that if May had shown as much cunning and sharp practice towards the EU and Michel Barnier as she has shown to her Cabinet members then she would have undoubtedly have won greater support and loyalty from those who have put their faith in her, only to be betrayed.As is the way of politics I doubt we have heard the last of this shameful episode in the Conservative Party’s history. Too many are looking to their ministerial careers, their superannuated pensions, their limousine lifestyle and ambitions. David Davis was meant to be the minister for exiting the European Union but has become the doormat for the Prime Minister’s kitten heels. On Friday she trod all over him, again. Boris Johnson fires off smart-ass one-liners like torpedoes, but they have ultimately turned back and sunk him, for he is finished as an alternative to May if he can’t do a Heseltine and storm out. Meanwhile, Liam Fox is on a mission to irrelevance who will want to discuss trade deals in any serious fashion with him now? Michael Gove was apparently the first Leaver in Cabinet to support May’s plan if true then he has excelled himself as the most duplicitous of all having stabbed Boris Johnson in the back during the Tory leadership election on the basis he would not have delivered Brexit, he has now knifed the Brexit movement completely.            Left isolated, Andrea Leadsom, Penny Mordaunt and Esther McVey have capitulated with their colleagues. Only a number of backbenchers, certainly too few if Labour backs May’s proposal, are wisening up to what it means.A Survation poll, carried out since the announcement, suddenly puts Labour ahead with the Tories dropping three points. It is only the beginning. The Cabinet may be united for the moment, but are all holding hands as they jump off an electoral cliff into that dark tarry black hole they are being warned about.• Brian Monteith is a director of Global Britain"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4766338.1531203441!/image/image.jpg","title":"tommy sheppard mp the uk is not a democratic country","story":"        It\u0026#8217s time the UK as a whole caught up with Scotland, Wales, and for that matter most of the developed world, by ditching its outdated voting system, writes Tommy Sheppard MP.                We need to talk about democracy in the UK. The UK Government recently hosted its first “National Democracy Week” – with no sense of irony. We absolutely should be celebrating the 90th anniversary of the equalisation of voting ages for men and women. Nobody would argue with that.            But we should celebrate that achievement precisely because it shattered an unjust status quo. And we still have an unjust status quo – a broken system that the Tories seem hell-bent on defending. The pomp and ceremony of Westminster may seem quaint to some, but its democratic system is as outdated as its traditions. Even putting aside the fact that most of the legislators are unelected Lords, the elected House of Commons uses, in first-past-the-post, a voting system to elect MPs that doesn’t even reflect the votes cast by the electorate.            The majority of seats shared by the Conservatives and the DUP was won with just 43 per cent of the vote. In fact we have had governments elected by a minority of voters for almost all of the time since World War II, while millions of voters are excluded at every election.READ MORE: Euan McColm: Proportional representation gets my voteThe same goes for local councils across England, where you find one-party fiefdoms without a single opposition councillor and absurd results like Plymouth and Wandsworth, where the party that lost the election won the most seats. I’m not pretending that elections in Scotland are perfect but at least the Scottish Parliament, with its proportional electoral system, reflects the votes cast. Our local elections also use a form of PR so that seats match votes and councils reflect the people they serve. And you can vote from the age of 16 allowing young people to get, and stay, involved in politics.The fact that we have managed to reach this point – of having democratic institutions that reflect the people – is worth celebrating, particularly given the vociferousness of opposition to this simple principle by politicians elsewhere in the UK.Proportional representation of voters is absolutely central to any modern democratic society – and it’s abhorrent that no Westminster government has ever genuinely asked the electorate whether they’d actually like Parliament to reflect the way they vote. Instead, the people were fobbed off in 2011 with a choice between the status quo and a system that is often even less proportional: the alternative vote.            Two-thirds of people believe that seats should match votes at Westminster, according to recent polling, and for as long as Scotland remains a part of the UK, the SNP will champion any moves towards making this a reality.READ MORE: Labour could win ‘more votes but fewer seats’ than Tories in ScotlandFirst-past-the-post governments elected on around 40 per cent of the vote are simply not democratic. It’s time the UK as a whole caught up with Scotland, Wales, and for that matter most of the developed world.Westminster would finally see governments that not only look like the people who voted for them, but that represent the views of the majority. That’s why the hundreds of volunteers from Make Votes Matter who took part in Demand Democracy Day on 30 June shouldn’t be ignored. You’ve got to admire their spirit. They organised around 60 street stalls across the UK – from Dover to Dundee – and invited members of the public to sign the new petition for proportional representation which calls on MPs to support it. If you really want to help celebrate democracy, sign the petition to Make Votes Matter and let’s get proportional representation for Westminster.

The Nationalist leader at Westminster said his party would “welcome” another election if the Prime Minister’s proposals for exiting the EU failed to protect Scotland’s interests.            Mrs May is due to publish a Government white paper on her Brexit plans next week, despite the turmoil caused by the resignations of David Davis and Boris Johnson.            The agreement reached at Chequers last Friday includes plans for a free trade area for industrial and agricultural goods, based on a “common rule book” and a “combined customs territory”.However, there will be different arrangements for trade in services including financial products, with the UK recognising neither side will enjoy “current levels of access” to each other’s markets.READ MORE: Nicola Sturgeon: SNP will press for single market membershipMr Blackford said if Mrs May did not alter her plans to bring them closer to this position, the SNP would “relish” the chance to fight another election.“If we’re talking about a situation where the Scottish economy is going to be threatened and if there’s an opportunity for us to have a debate with the people of Scotland, then of course I would welcome that,” he told the broadcaster.            “My focus in the short term, my party’s focus…is about protecting the interests of the Scottish people. That’s about making sure that we stay in the single market and the customs union.“If we faced an election as we go through that process then so be it, it’s something I would relish and something I would look forward to. I believe the SNP would come out of that in a strengthened position.”Challenged over the result of last year’s snap general election, which saw the SNP lose 21 seats in Scotland including those of Alex Salmond and Angus Robertson, Mr Blackford was defiant.“The SNP are still the dominant voice, the dominant party in Scotland. We’ve been the government party in Scotland for the last 11 years,” he said.            “I would firmly believe that if we had to put ourselves in front of the electorate again, we’d get the overwhelming backing of the people of Scotland.”"},{"url":null,"title":"watch aerial footage new eric gray centre ","story":"The long-awaited Eric Gray Centre is nearing completion – as shown by aerial footage recently published by contractors DITT Construction.\n\nThe project, costing around £6 million, marks the culmination of years of planning with a feasibility study taking place in 2006.

It has been a long journey for some and a hard fight to gain the ground and then keep it  for the new building.

It’s manufacture uses up valuable natural resources but this is a result of human exploitation. This begs the question, why are humans capable of natural behaviour and unnatural behaviour in what seems to be equal measure?  Is it normal and natural to drive cars, fly in ‘planes, build tower blocks, dig for coal, aim to fly to distant planet ? The list is endless. According to the experts, global warming and ice ages have occurred many times and certainly before life as we know it existed.

Despite a brave and thrilling attempt, resulting in an 11-point victory, realistically the overall result was never really in doubt.\n The Shetland swimmers, led by triple record-breaker Jasmin Smith, once again defeated their hosts by nearly 20 points.\nSuperiority in the water is now a regular occurrence in inter-counties, and the days when Orkney maintained a stranglehold on that event have been confined to distant memory.\nPart of the reason for the continued success could well be the number of swimming clubs around the isles, with Shetland, Lerwick, Delting, South Mainland, Whalsay and the West Side all competing for honours.\nRegular events in Shetland could be just as important as the trips to the mainland, as it helps to forge the competitive element necessary in the inter-county.\nThe only disciplines in which Orkney were successful this year were hockey and netball, where apart from school tournaments in the latter there is no recognised league structure here.\nHuge credit is due to the swimmers and their coaches, and also the many others who put in so much time and effort at the other sports involved in the Stuart Cup.\nHere’s hoping that the hockey and netball contestants will not have long to wait for their own success.\n: : : : : : : :\nOn the subject of hockey, mention needs to be made of former goalkeeper Sarah Couper who is now a qualified A grade umpire.\nShe travelled away last weekend to take charge of two international matches and is off to Swansea today to umpire a home international masters game.\nThis is the pinnacle of officiating in hockey and should be seen as a fine achievement both Couper and the sport in Shetland, which faces the perennial battle for getting a new playing surface.\n: : : : : : : :\nCongratulations are due to the Lerwick Spurs football team which is now through to the fourth round of the Highland Amateur Cup.\nSpurs defeated Ness from the Western Isles 3-0 at Dornoch on Saturday and now face Caithness side Staxigoe in the last-16 clash.\nIt was the first of two successes against a team with the same name in three days and no hangovers were obvious as they returned and picked up an important victory over Ness United in the local premier league on Monday.\nThe other Ness may not mean much to the average Shetland football follower, but some may know it was the club that Angus Murray represented for a long time.\nMurray, who played for Lerwick Thistle for a couple of seasons in the mid-1980s while working at the town’s Co-op, commented on Facebook this week that it was the “wrong half of Lerwick but well done Spurs”.\nHe continued: “The competition is in the doldrums and in need of new talent. It would be quite something if a Shetland team could win it given the logistics. I’ll be watching with interest.”\nPressed on his Shetland connections, Murray went on: “The Spurs of my era were formidable \u0026#8230 Watt Bros, Leask Bros, B Williamson, K Malcolmson et al. I must say I had not heard of Jim Peterson’s passing. A scholar, gentleman and Spurs stalwart, we had many a chat in the Lounge Bar.\n“How removed we are at times. He wrote the The History of Shetland Football 1887-1987, a copy of which I have, one of his many accomplishments I’m sure. All the best in the next games. The competition does islands no favours on balance.”\nMurray, much like the way he used to play, is bang on target here. The tournament organisers do little to help the furthest travelled teams, and Jim Peterson is indeed a massive loss.\nWith the anniversary of the Milne Cup now under two months away, and a competition running (see above) to name Shetland’s greatest team, Murray’s name may be on the minds of a few selectors.\nAnd we could hope that Peterson, although this column is not normally the place for religious connotations, may be looking down and having a dram when the big event happens on 28th July.\n: : : : : : : :\nProfessional footballers, especially in the modern era, obviously have a lot of time on their hands.\nThat could explain why they indulge so much in the absurd tattoos and haircuts which are now commonplace.\nThe latest to make the news is Manchester City’s Raheem Sterling, who has gone and had the image of an AK-47 assault rifle inked on his lower leg.\nSterling, rather bafflingly, claimed the idea was a tribute to his father who was gunned down by a gang in Jamaica when he was just a toddler.\nNot surprisingly Sterling has been criticised by anti-gun campaigners, who demanded he remove the tattoo or be dropped from the England squad.\nRichard Taylor, whose 10-year-old son Damilola died after being attacked by a gang in London, has also accused Sterling of setting a terrible example to fans.\nThe player has now explained that he would never touch a gun and that the tattoo is “unfinished”. Maybe he intends to have a deletion mark added on top of the offending image?\nApparently, Gary Lineker of all people has jumped to Sterling’s defence, claiming it is “weird, unpatriotic and sad” for him to be criticised by the media in such a way prior to the World Cup.\nI’m sorry, but it’s not the fault of newspapers that Sterling appears to be lacking in grey cells. I’ve never been a fan of Lineker, but did think he would show more common sense than this.\nTaylor is correct. It’s a crass act by Sterling and just as daft a move by those who support him.\n: : : : : : : :\nTo end on a more postitive note, surely cyclist Chris Froome has to be one of the UK’s best ever sports performers.\nThe way he destroyed the field to secure the recent Giro d’Italia, the third Grand Tour title he currently holds along with the Tour de France and the Vuelta a España, was incredible.\nSadly this country has not really taken to Froome, otherwise he would have surely already been a recipient of the BBC Sports Personality of the Year award.\nIf he wins another Tour de France this year, which would be his fifth victory, it would be a travesty if he didn’t receive the personality trophy.\nBarring Harry Kane scoring a hat trick in the final and lifting the World Cup for England next month, which I can’t really see happening, hopefully this will be Froome’s year at last.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"kia pro ceed ","story":"3dr Kia pro-ceed sr7, 4 year warranty remaining, one owner, full Kia service history, VGC inside \u0026amp out\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 20 ","story":"As I write this all the teams have played at least one match at the World Cup, with hosts Russia and Uruguay becoming first to qualify for the last 16 from group A.\nOn the whole it has been a decent tournament so far, helped by a few shocks along the way and some memorable goals, although perhaps the less said about the commentary and punditry the better.\nFew would have expected Germany to lose to Mexico, or Argentina to be held by Iceland. One of the most remarkable performances in the latter game came from Kari Arnason, recently deemed not good enough by Aberdeen but still able to do a pretty fair job on shackling Lionel Messi.\nThe introduction the Video Assistant Referee system, or VAR as it is commonly known, has caused a few talking points. There was the decision to allow Diego Costa’s first goal for Spain against Portugal, and also to award penalties to France and Sweden against Australia and South Korea respectively.\nThese “assistants” are apparently not even at the game. They are sitting in a office somewhere in Moscow, but bizarrely kitted out in full referees’ uniform!\nWhy on earth they didn’t disallow Switzerland’s equaliser against Brazil is beyond me, however. Everyone seemed to notice Steven Zuber’s push on his marker before making room for himself to head the ball home.\nEveryone that is except the boys in black in Moscow. The ITV panellists were unanimous in their opinion that the goal should have been ruled out. Even Roy Keane, who used to think decapitation was just about permissable, appeared to agree with the others.\nOkay, so we will mention the commentary and punditry. Apart from Keane and Slaven Bilic – I loved it when he said he couldn’t really care less about whether the Swiss leveller should have been allowed or not – there is really no-one who comes with an opinion which makes you think.\nMost of the time they are prattling on about how far England are likely to go, even when the focus is on an entirely different group. And surely it is high time Gary Lineker was pensioned off. His pathetic attempts at puns, which could have been written by a five-year-old, had their day a long time ago.\nMeanwhile in our office “World Cup Sweepstake”, which requires the entrant to basically predict the results all the way through the competition, things aren’t going too badly. Despite obviously getting the Argentina/Iceland and Germany/Mexico games wrong, plus a few others, I remain in contention on the leaderboard.\nSo what about the last 16? I will still stick with the Germans and Argentinians as surely they must improve. My line-up is: Russia v Portugal, Spain v Uruguay, France v Argentina, Croatia v Denmark, Brazil v Sweden, Belgium v Japan, Germany v Switzerland and Senegal v England.\n: : : : : : : :\nThere has already been a healthy entry for our competition to name Shetland’s greatest football team of the past 60 years, but potential selectors still have a week and a half to make their minds up.\nThe main prize, a return trip for two people with car and cabin courtesy of NorthLink Ferries, is definitely not to be sneezed at.

The cricketer with roots connected to these parts was none other than the man of the match himself – batsman Callum MacLeod whose magnificent 140 not out was largely responsible for Scotland’s thrilling win.\nMacLeod’s father Donald attended the Anderson High School in the late 1960s and early 70s. He was a goalkeeper himself, playing for the Ness United team in the Shetland under-18 competitions.\nHe went on to make somewhat of a name for himself as a photographer, working for The Press and Journal and The Scotsman at times before establishing his own business.\nMacLeod (junior) has obviously usurped any success attained by his old man, however. Even before his recent moment of glory he has been an established international batsman, making several centuries at one-day level.\nHe has been good enough to play grade cricket in Sydney, which is no mean feat, has had stints at English counties Warwickshire and Durham and has just signed a contract with Derbyshire.\nIt is going on half a century since I last saw Donald MacLeod, but I know a certain former Whitedale goalkeeper who keeps in touch. If he happens to read this he’ll maybe pass on congratulations from me, and I’m sure a few others, to the family.\n: : : : : : : :\nTwo weeks ago I suggested that having clubs competing in a local league structure could be of great benefit to preparation for junior inter-county sports such as hockey and netball.\nWhile there is no regular junior league set-up in the isles for hockey, it has been pointed out that in netball this exists for primary school-aged players upwards.\nThe sport appears to be thriving at the various age levels, with under-13 and under-17 squads regularly competing on the mainland with success.\nThe Anderson High School team has also regularly sent a team to compete in the Scottish Schools Open competition, where they have performed with distinction over the past few years.\nThe AHS team also plays in division one of the senior netball leagues, while a feeder team called “Hotfooters” was created to provide easier access for youngsters to join the league.\nAccording to the organisers there have been over 1,000 competitive matches in Shetland and 32 competitive matches away from the isles for juniors this season in various leagues and tournaments.\nCoach Sanna Aitken says: “Of course it is disappointing that we lost the junior inter-county this year \u0026#8230 the girls were really gutted.\n“As a coach, I am delighted that the netball continues to be really competitive [with] an incredibly high standard of match demonstrating the hard work and success of the sport and junior set-up in both isles.\n“I am confident when saying the loss was nothing to do with any weaknesses in the local league structure. It just didn’t go our way on the day. Only two years ago it went Shetland’s way where we won on Orkney’s home turf. It’s always a great competitive game.”\nI am happy to set the record straight on this.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"watch viking bus station to get new graffiti mural ","story":"\n\nMarc Delaye, now based in Inverness, will oversee the graffiti project in August.

There is no doubt the English are cute enough to take full advantage of the introduction of VAR system with three penalty kicks so far despatched by captain Harry Kane.\nPenalising defenders for holding at corners and other set pieces is, I have to say, a major step forward. This has been going on for far too long in most levels of football, and thankfully the days of pundits uttering the words “part and parcel of the game” will now be over.\nGrabbing someone in a bear hug is not football – never has been and never will be. I recall a European match some years ago when Glasgow Celtic should have had about six penalties but the referee gave none.\nWhat this needs now is for officials to be in accordance with one another. But sadly, and I can envisage a few whistlers spluttering over their cornflakes at this, the words “consistent” and “referees” are an oxymoron as far as I\u0026#8217m concerned.\nOn the subject of the English progression in the tournament, it has once again thrown up the perennial question of whether Scottish people should support their oldest rivals.\nThere are no doubt many north of the border who would find the prospect of England winning the World Cup a terrifying one. They could even be in the majority. A recent poll suggested that only 15 per cent of Scots would support the English while 28 per cent would back anyone playing against them.\nThe same survey found that only two per cent of Scottish National Party voters would get behind England, although I actually find that figure quite high.\nIt does appear to be the case that Scottish football followers have nothing against English players, many of whom they actually admire, but it is those in the press and the media who they reserve their anger for.\nI sincerely hope that England do go all the way. I have always supported them when Scotland are not involved, and in recent years that has become the norm.\nA few issues do bother me, such as the constant gormless look on Kane’s face and the insistence of manager Gareth Southgate on dressing as if he was taking part in the World Snooker Championships. Someone should tell him that waistcoats are the most pointless item of clothing known to man.\nBut hey, most of it is good. I particularly enjoy the ITV panel and even Ian Wright is growing on me!\n: : : : : : : :\nIt is just over a month since the tragic death of former Aberdeen footballer Neale Cooper and I would like to add my own tribute to the many which have been paid to such a popular man.\nThe late Neale Cooper made a memorable trip to Shetland.\nAt just 19 he was the youngest member of the 1983 European Cup Winners Cup side which defeated Real Madrid in the final at Gothenburg in Sweden.\nAlong with that memorable triumph he was in the team which won two Scottish league titles, four Scottish Cups, a league cup and the European Super Cup, all achieved before he was 24.\nHe later played for Aston Villa, Rangers, Reading, Dunfermline and Ross County, where he later became manager.\nIt was in the summer of 1999, when Ross County were invited to Shetland as guests for Scalloway’s centenary celebrations, that I had the privilege of meeting Cooper.\nThere was a gala dinner in the village hall after the friendly match where County defeated Scalloway 8-2, and he agreed to give me time for a short interview. But not until after his speech, he said, which he was dreading as he hated speaking at formal events.\nSadly the evening dragged on somewhat, with various Scalloway luminaries spending rather more time on stage than was really necessary, and it was approaching 1am when Cooper eventually got his turn.\nI decided to give up on the interview that night, and maybe catch him the following day after a game against a Shetland XI in Lerwick.\nAs I was wandering along the embankment at Gilbertson Park prior to the match I heard someone calling my name, and was surprised to see Cooper running towards me.\nHe was full of apologies about the previous evening, although he had no justification, and he said he would speak to me immediately after the game.\nThe match ended 2-2 and Cooper was generous in his praise for the opposition. Shetland were “as good as any top Highland League side”, he said.\nThe two-day visit had been excellent both from a football point of view and a social one, he added. “It’s been fantastic. We had a great welcome from Scalloway and it was an honour to be invited to their centenary celebrations. I’ve never been to Shetland before and I only found out last week that my mother had been here 40 years ago.”\nFollowing Cooper’s untimely death, and the loss of the first of the Gothenburg greats, there have been many kind words. Colleagues, writers and others have pointed out what a humble, friendly and likeable character he was.\nThey are absolutely correct. I’ve meet a few well-known footballers over the years but I have no difficulty in stating that Neil Cooper was the nicest one of them all.\n: : : : : : : :\nCyclist Chris Froome is now free to go for a record-equalling fifth Tour de France win after his anti-doping case was sensibly dropped.\nThe Team Sky rider had been under investigation by the sport’s world governing body Union Cycliste Internationale but proceedings were closed on Monday.\nFroome, who is bidding to move level with Eddy Merckx, Bernard Hinault, Jacques Anquetil and Miguel Indurain as the only five-time winners of the tour, has been under intense pressure since an amount of the asthma treatment salbutamol was found in his system.\nGet off this guy’s back and give him a break, I say. Just because he’s the best cyclist in the world does not mean he’s benefiting from a performance-enhancing drug.\n: : : : : : : :\nWith all the buzz of the World Cup an annual competition in southwest London has almost been forgotten about.\nYes, Wimbledon is in full flow once again and the British competitors are as usual struggling to make it into the second week.\nAndy Murray was probably sensible to withdraw, citing that he was not quite ready for five-set matches after his hip operation. There were signs at Queens and Eastbourne, however, that he may be able to scale the heights once more.\nThere is of course a capable replacement in Kyle Edmund, who is seeded having reached the Australian Open semi-finals earlier this year.\nEdmund’s half of the draw looks fairly open, and he could well still be involved come Monday.

in the eye of storm in Tornado Alley","story":"Nicole Webber\n\u0026nbsp\nA storm chaser from Newtonmore had to run for cover from some of the world\u0027s most extreme weather in Tornado Alley.\nScott Duncan (24), a former Kingussie High School pupil, has just returned from his dream adventure to the United States with a team of fellow meteorologists.\nHe got up close and personal with several tornadoes and massive electric storms during the trip of a lifetime which started on May 19, with the quartet returning on Saturday.\nThe daredevil and talented photographer captured breathtaking snaps of the huge storms as they crossed Nebraska, Kansas, Colorado and Texas.\nScott told the Strathy: \"The four of us flew out to Tornado Valley in the hope to witness some of the planet\u0027s most extreme weather.\n\"We decided to put our meteorological skills together and chase the storms ourselves.\"\nThe group of Reading University graduates rented a car and travelled 7000 miles over the course of the three weeks.\n\"We do it for the buzz as we all have a passion for extreme weather and it is also a great way to hit the open road and explore new states,\" he added.\nHe agreed that it can be a dangerous hobby but not for the reasons you would think.\n\"People often think tornadoes are the main concern but lightning, giant hail stones and flash flooding are often the hazards that prove most deadly,\" he said.\n\"Careful planning before and during a storm chase is absolutely essential.\"\n\u0026nbsp\nScott now works for MetDesk, a UK-wide weather service, and he took those skills across the Pond with him.\nThe friends used the latest weather model data, satellite and radar observations and invested in a portable internet device to ensure they had the best chance of remaining connected to signal while on the move.\nScott said it is incredibly important that the driver can access accurate directions quickly when faced with dangerous and often changing conditions.\nAlthough they had a few close calls, they managed to avoid getting themselves into \"major trouble\" by knowing when to back off and take shelter.\nThe Newtonmore man explained: \"We avoided driving through storms with tennis ball sized hail stones and 70mph straight line winds.\n\"But at one point we did have to take shelter in a gas station freezer room \u0026ndash the strongest room in the building \u0026ndash due to a tornado with confirmed flying debris just upwind of us.\"\nScott admitted that storm chasing is not for the faint-hearted but that \"it is an experience\" and in the US it is becoming an increasingly popular attraction.\nBecause the adventurers did not know where they would end up at the end of the day, accommodation had to often be found late and in an obscure towns in the middle of nowhere\nScott, who is now safely back in Hertfordshire where the weather is rather less dramatic, added: \"That alone makes the trip more exciting as it holds an incredible depth of freedom.\"\nTornado Alley is the name of the area in the United States where tornadoes are most frequent.\nThe term was coined in 1952 as the title of a research project to study severe weather in areas of Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, South Dakota, Iowa, Illinois, Missouri, Nebraska, Colorado, North Dakota, and Minnesota.\nWednesday 11 Jul 2018 4:40

Even with the introduction of new flights our air connections remain some of the most fragile across these isles.\n\u0026ldquoThe Smith Commission was very clear when it stated that: \u0026lsquothe power to charge tax on air passengers leaving Scottish airports will be devolved to the Scottish Parliament. The Scottish Government will be free to make its own arrangements regarding the design and collection of any replacement tax\u0026rsquo, yet, as we have seen time and time again with this Government, the arrangements on offer, limits the ability of the Scottish Government to make changes to benefit the Scottish economy.\u0026nbsp\nIn his response to the Highland MP, Mr Jenrick confirmed that his department was willing to work closer with the Scottish Government to find a solution to the problem, recognising the commitment outlined in the Smith Commission.\nResponding after the debate, Mr Hendry said: \u0026ldquoI am glad that the UK Government recognises it has failed to hand over APD in a workable way, and that Airport Departure Tax cannot be implemented by the Scottish Government without a solution to this problem.\n\u0026ldquoI hope that the assurances from Mr Jenrick today, are followed up by meaningful action from the UK Government, to enable the Scottish Government to introduce its reduced Airport Departure Tax, while protecting the Highlands and Islands exemption.\"\nWednesday 11 Jul 2018 4:40 AM\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/PROFILE-KAI-WESTWELL-2.jpg","title":"former sabhal mor ostaig chairman","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\nFormer Sabhal Mòr Ostaig chair Duncan MacQuarrie was celebrated this week with the first road in the new Kilbeg Village development, Rathad MhicGuaire (MacQuarrie Road) named in his honour during an official ceremony held on Monday.\nThe ceremony was carried out by Kate Forbes MSP and recognised the key role which Mr MacQuarrie has played in the college\u0026#8217s development over many years. Sabhal Mòr Ostaig principal Prof Boyd Robertson said, \u0026#8220This is a richly-deserved honour for Duncan which recognises the hugely important contribution he has made to the development of the college over many years and the vital contribution he has made to the development of the Gaelic language and culture and to the advancement of Gaelic and Gaelic-medium education, both as a teacher and as a former HM Inspector.”\n“Duncan\u0026#8217s critical input to Sabhal Mòr Ostaig’s development in its challenging formative years was marked by his steady stewardship, as a former chairman and his pioneering work, alongside that of his fellow trustees, demonstrated an exemplary vision and commitment without which what is now the National Centre for the Gaelic Language and Culture would not have existed.”\n“For that, all who have benefited from this wonderful and inspiring place, over the intervening years, owe him a great debt of gratitude and it is for that reason we celebrate with him here today. It is fitting therefore that his name will forever be associated with Sabhal Mòr Ostaig and with the development of Kilbeg village, a new sustainable Highland community which places Gaelic language and culture very much at its heart.”\nMs Forbes, extending her own congratulations to Mr McQuarrie, said: “This recognition of Duncan MacQuarrie is well deserved for his years of commitment to the Gaelic language and Sabhal Mòr Ostaig. The opportunities afforded to a new generation of Gaelic speakers are thanks to people like Duncan MacQuarrie who had the sheer determination, vision and love for the language to persevere. \u0026#8220Today, the education, employment and cultural opportunities enable Gaelic speakers to live and work in their preferred language in a way that would not have been possible without Mr MacQuarrie\u0026#8217s efforts.\u0026#8221\nPlans for the next phase of the affordable housing site \u0026#8211 which will soon be submitted for full planning consents \u0026#8211 will be delivered through a creative partnership involving Sabhal Mòr Ostaig the Highland Small Communities Housing Trust, the Highland Council and the private sector and will see the creation of up to 31 units of housing on the site.\nThe units will comprise a range of models and types of tenure, including rent to buy, self-build, housing for the elderly and, affordable for-rent housing.

The change came when my grandmother remarried, and so then the family name became Davis.”\nFor 37 years “MacKenzie country” has been his base, and these days it’s fishing rather than football which is his passion. Yet before making the move north with wife Vi to build the Craigmore Hotel in Gairloch, Harry Davis had enjoyed a remarkable sporting life — recovering from multiple bullet wounds in the Korean War to carve out a glittering football career with Rangers.\nTalk about “dual contracts” may have loomed large over Scottish football in recent months, but here was one ex-professional who really knew what it was like to serve two paymasters.\nA native Fifer, but brought up in Perth, Harry was an emerging talent with East Fife when he signed up as part of his national service to join the Black Watch. He soon found himself in the thick of the bloody, but often forgotten, Korean War where in the midst of conflict he suffered injuries from which it would take him over two years to recover.\nRemarkably, not only did he return to full health, he resumed his football career with gusto — signing for Rangers in 1956. He would enjoy a memorable eight-year spell with the Ibrox club, winning three league titles, two league cups and a Scottish Cup, as well as playing in the first Scottish side to reach a European final.\nA fearsome defender known as the “Iron Man”, he was never one to shirk a tackle on the pitch, and he’s not afraid to offer an opinion off it either — as he documents in a compelling autobiography which recently hit the bookshelves.\nHis is a tale far removed from the anodyne offerings served up by today’s breed of pampered millionaires. Having witnessed and experienced what he did on the battlefield, it’s hardly surprising that Davis had little time for those less appreciative of their sporting talents.\nTake, for example, the Rangers and Scotland great Jim Baxter.\n“I don’t dispute Baxter’s talent — he was a class player, but he wasted it,” he says ruefully. “He got privileges no one else got and it upset a lot of players in the team. He only turned it on once every three games and for the rest of the time, when your backs were to the wall, Baxter was nowhere to be seen.”\nHe describes Willie Waddell, the man who led Rangers to their only European trophy, as a “lucky manager” who had used his position as a sportswriter to undermine predecessor David White — a man Harry Davis had returned to Ibrox to assist.\n\nIT SEEMS CLEAR that wartime experience — and the discipline and work ethic it instilled — would leave a lasting imprint on everything Harry Davis did thereafter. But, ironically, his prowess on the football field might actually have spared him from active service altogether.\nHis military call came just after he had broken into East Fife’s excellent post-war team under Scott Symon — the man who would later bring him to Ibrox. And he adds: “I had a couple of opportunities, one to be a PTI in the army, and the other to take an airborne course.\n“It was all a scam to get you to play in the army team and I turned them all down. I was quite happy to go and thought it was all a bit of an adventure.”\nThat sense of wide-eyed wonder would soon give way to the full-blooded horrors of war, as he found himself fighting off Chinese forces intent on advancing further south on the Korean peninsula.\nHe remembers that many caught in the thick of the fighting were simple conscripts — scarcely prepared for the brutality they would encounter. Indelibly marked in his memory is the image of one desperate soldier running deliberately into enemy fire and to his death.\n“He was away with the birds,” he added. “I tried to stop him, but just at that moment a shell landed on top of our trench — all the hairs on the back of my hand were singed, but we were sheltered and escaped the full impact. But by the time I got up he was off again, and disappeared.\n“I couldn’t do anything about it, but that stayed with me. You can’t blame the guy — he was just a conscript as well.\n“There was always a little bit of ill feeling in that these conscripts were shipped out to the battlefield, yet regular, more experienced soldiers from the Black Watch were left behind in Germany.”\nHarry’s contribution to the war effort ended in the spring of 1953, though to this day he has no idea where the bullets which left him wounded actually came from. Years later, a former colleague contacted him to say he believed he had been responsible.\n“I said to him it might have been him, it might not have been. Who knows? But everyone was in a state of panic, and again we go back to conscripts. I certainly wouldn’t place any blame on him.”\nThe stray bullets had caught him on the back of the foot — fracturing his heel, but mercifully just missing the Achilles tendon. Having also suffered abdominal damage, Harry Davis would spend months recuperating in a Japanese hospital before returning to the UK to continue a slow road to recovery.\nIn the far east a nursing sister from Stornoway would become something of an inspiration, but it is Harry’s biggest regret that on leaving Japan he would never see the woman again.\n“She was marvellous and encouraged me so much through all the operations, the bad nights and bad days,” he added. “I made a point that I would go and see her, and when I built the hotel up here I thought I’d be able to find her. I only knew her as Sister MacKenzie, but she was from Stornoway and I believe she had something to do with the Post Office over there.\n“But then I did hear from one source that she had died — I never got to make contact with her. It’s one of the great disappointments of my lifetime.”\nON HARRY’S RETURN HOME doctors gave him little hope of ever playing top-level football again — sometimes in fairly graphic terms.\n“One doctor at the military hospital in London told me that my only hope was that my bowels were in such a state, defenders were likely to slip on what would come out! It didn’t look very encouraging.”\nYet after being helped back to fitness by David Kinnear — a physiotherapist and former Ibrox player — Harry Davis would eventually get his career back on track.\nHe resumed action for East Fife, and in 1956 got the call from Symon to follow him to Ibrox.\nIn Glasgow, he initially learned the ropes in the reserve side — one of his memorable early encounters bringing him into direct contact with the Celtic legend Charlie Tully, who by this time was at the opposite stage of his career.\nBefore too long Davis would join a first-team pool that included vintage names likes George Young, George Niven, Sammy Baird and Alex Scott, and Rangers lifted the league at the end of his first full season in 1957.\nIn something of a golden era for the Scottish game, Davis regularly played in front of crowds topping the 100,000 mark, and he remembers a vibrant and competitive league where in his first few years the main challenge came from a Hearts team which claimed two league titles.\n“If we had fewer than 40,000 at a game it was a disaster,” he said. “But regularly the crowds were 60-70,000 and for big games the 100,000-mark wasn’t unusual.”\nA degree of European success followed, as Rangers reached the European Cup Winners Cup Final in 1961. There they would be outclassed by a fine Fiorentina side, and tellingly Harry feels the Scots simply refused to heed their continental lesson. Half a century on, and the same basic mistakes continue to be made.\n“They were ahead of us,” he said. “Scott Symon was a great manager, no question, but he didn’t keep up with modern techniques. He still said get the ball to the winger, get the winger up the field and cross it and get the centre forward to head it into the net. That worked in the old days, but it didn’t work when you played these continental teams.”\nAfter winding down his playing career with a season at Partick Thistle, Harry took the manager’s job at the grand old institution of Queens Park. It was a time he enjoyed immensely, though the lure of Ibrox once again tempted him back across the city — this time to hook up with White.\nThat spell in the dugout was to prove less successful than his playing days, with Rangers then in the shadow of Jock Stein’s great Celtic side. Yet some redemption would arrive at Dundee where White and Davis led the Dens Park club to a memorable league cup final triumph over Celtic in 1973. A few months later the pair gained revenge over their old nemesis Waddell, dumping Rangers out of the Scottish Cup at Ibrox.\nDundee would prove to be Harry’s last staging post in football — and thereafter he set his sights on the quiet life in the north west Highlands.\nTHESE DAYS his football involvement is limited to appearing alongside former team-mates at charity fundraisers for the Erskine Trust, for which he is also to donate most of the proceeds from his book. However, he still keeps one eye on developments at Ibrox, even if he struggles to comprehend the team’s recent high-profile fall from grace.\n“The honest answer is that I just don’t know what to make of it all,” he said. “One conclusion is reached one week, and a week later it’s turned around again. But I do believe a number of teams were quite happy to get rid of them because they were strong competition. I don’t think that was right.”\nAsked for his personal highlights in the game, his answer is a simple one.  He just reels off a list of the players he played with, and it reads like a who’s who of greats for fans of the Ibrox club.\n“I joined Rangers and played with George Young, George Niven, Baird, Billy Simpson, Bobby Shearer, Alex Scott, Jim McColl — a great team. And then by the end I had also played with John Greig, Ronnie MacKinnon, Ian MacMillan, Millar, Brand, Baxter and Wilson. How many people can say that?”\nA Scotland cap may have proved elusive — “in those days they only picked 11” — with a place on the reserve list as close as he got to pulling on the dark blue.\nNevertheless, Harry Davis had long since proved his mettle on the international stage — and he still has the scars to prove it.\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/7s.jpg","title":"comhairle must replace barra housing","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\nComhairle nan Eilean Siar must replace land they gave away for housing in Castlebay, Barra, because it was meant to be kept in perpetuity for recreational use.\nLast month, Housing Minister Kevin Stewart cut the turf on the Corran Ciosmul development at Horve. However, the six houses are to be built on what was a King George V Playing Field, which was set aside and protected in 1962.\nFor anyone to build on this land they must notify and obtain the consent of Fields in Trust, a charity that acts to protect all KGV land. Even though the comhairle took over the management of the land in 1984 they must still obtain the trust’s consent.\nThe Barra Sports Forum have been pressing the comhairle for years to transfer a piece of derelict land near the Co-op, which is adjacent to the KGV area, for use as an all-weather pitch.\nA spokesman said: “The sports forum urge the comhairle to fulfil their legal and moral obligations to the people of Barra and Vatersay to protect the sports and recreation land in Horve by righting this wrong: firstly, by filing for a change of land use to Fields in Trust from ‘sports and recreation’ to ‘housing’ and secondly, by transferring an equivalent area of land to the KGV playing field in compensation for land lost to housing. Only by doing this will the comhairle avoid the danger of stalling the desperately needed new housing that helps secure the future of our islands.”\nRichard McKeever of Fields in Trust the charity recognised that that “sometimes it may be necessary” to change the use of recreational land.\nHe added: “As part of our protection, we have a responsibility to ensure the local owners and managers of these spaces seek our consent to undertake any changes regarding land ownership, land transactions, erection of buildings and structures \u0026#8211 and that proposed changes fit with the purpose of the protected space and benefit its recreational use. We are currently in constructive dialogue with the council and await their proposals for replacement recreational land of an equal or better standard which will be protected for the local community to enjoy in perpetuity.”\nThe housing development at Corran Ciosmul is being undertaken by the Hebridean Housing Partnership, which has owned the land since 2006.\nKatrina Rowlands, HHP development manager, said: “Due to the nature of how the titles were transferred to HHP, the burden in relation to the Fields in Trust was not recorded therefore the responsibility to meet the Fields in Trust conditions remains with the comhairle. We are aware that the comhairle’s legal team are in discussions with Fields In Trust to resolve the matter.”\nA spokesman for the comhairle said discussion with Fields in Trust were continuing.\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n"}]
