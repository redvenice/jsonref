At least one of the singer\u0027s attorneys says he urged her repeatedly over the years to draft one.\u0027I tried to convince her that she should do not just a will but a trust while she was still alive,\u0027 says Don Wilson, a Los Angeles lawyer who worked on entertainment matters for Franklin for nearly 30 years. \u0027She never told me, \u0027No, I don\u0027t want to do one.\u0027 She understood the need. It just didn\u0027t seem to be something she got around to.\u0027Laura Zwicker, an attorney who specializes in estate planning but is not affiliated with the Franklin estate, says she sees it happen all too often in her work.\u0027People don\u0027t like to face their own mortality,\u0027 Zwicker says. \u0027I had a client who had a $70 million real estate portfolio who had had end-stage diabetes. He had plenty of conversations with me about estate planning but would not sign the documents.\u0027  She was not married and left four sons, ages 48 to 63: Clarence Franklin, Edward Franklin (pictured), Kecalf Franklin and Ted White Jr. Clarence, Aretha\u0027s eldest, is incapacitated and is represented by a guardianPapers filed in Michigan\u0027s Oakland County court last week by David J. Bennett, the lawyer who worked most closely with Franklin, lay out the few known basics:She was not married and left four sons, ages 48 to 63: Clarence Franklin, Edward Franklin, Kecalf Franklin and Ted White Jr. Clarence, Aretha\u0027s eldest, is incapacitated and is represented by a guardian. And a niece of hers has accepted the role of executor.  Family members embrace at Franklin\u0027s funeral. A niece of hers has accepted the role of executor Under Michigan law, as in most states, the sons will equally ide their mother\u0027s assets in the absence of a will, and so far no signs of conflict have emerged among family members. Bennett did not respond to phone and email messages seeking comment.Aretha Franklin\u0027s friend Ron Moten, a Michigan businessman, gave the four sons some guidance in his speech at Friday\u0027s funeral.\u0027Remember your family, and friends that have been with you for years,\u0027 Moten told the men. \u0027Because you are about to meet a lot of people who will now want to be your new best friend. You will also meet some people that will have the best investments in the world for you. My advice? Go slow, be careful and be smart.\u0027The documents make no mention of the value of Franklin\u0027s estate. The figure almost certainly runs into the tens of millions, but there will probably be widely varying estimates as her attorneys seek to downplay her wealth for tax purposes and the IRS tries to maximize the amount for its own reasons.Franklin maintained ownership of the songs she wrote and did well by them, Wilson says, though of her major hits, \u0027Think\u0027 is the only one that\u0027s her own composition. She also wrote some lesser hits, such as \u0027Rock Steady.\u0027  Jordan Franklin, left, pauses alongside his sister Victorie Franklin while speaking about their grandmother, Aretha Franklin. Documents make no mention of the value of Franklin\u0027s estateThough her records were played millions of times, she earned little in radio royalties from smashes like 1967\u0027s \u0027Respect\u0027 because such payments go overwhelmingly to the song\u0027s author, not the performer. In the case of \u0027Respect,\u0027 the royalties go to the estate of Otis Redding, even though the song owes nearly all its popularity to Franklin.\u0027I would imagine she probably felt she was entitled to more, but probably received more than a lot of artists from the time, especially African-American artists,\u0027 Wilson says.Among Franklin\u0027s more tangible assets are several pieces of property in the Detroit area that according to tax assessors\u0027 estimates are worth at least $2 million, with a market value that could easily be twice that.Star of Marvel\u0027s Luke Cage apologizes after appearing to...Bill Clinton is VERY impressed with mini-dress wearing...Share this article    Some heirs, like Franklin\u0027s son Clarence, may need more than others, and that can be a difficult and touchy decision for a parent   \u0027One arrangement may be fitting for one child, where other people need more help,\u0027 lawyer Laura Zwicker said. \u0027To accept that and put it on paper can be hard for a parent\u0027Once the value is established - a process that could take years - the IRS will take any back taxes Franklin owed, then will tax her estate at 40 percent for any assets beyond $11.2 million.Kenneth Abdo, an attorney who specializes in probate law and has worked on the estate of Prince, who also died without a will, says the IRS will conduct an audit of her holdings.Wilson, her entertainment attorney, says she would not have wanted to see her finances publicly aired: \u0027She was a private person.\u0027As for why some clients don\u0027t make out a will, Zwicker said some heirs, like Franklin\u0027s son Clarence, may need more than others, and that can be a difficult and touchy decision for a parent.\u0027One arrangement may be fitting for one child, where other people need more help,\u0027 Zwicker said. \u0027To accept that and put it on paper can be hard for a parent.\u0027"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/01/18/4F9AF90200000578-6122003-The_37_year_old_royal_was_at_the_event_in_her_role_as_a_Land_Rov-a-5_1535822579443.jpg","title":"Zara Tindall uses Land Rover hose ensure no mucky pups Burghley Horse Trials","story":"    Zara Tindall was pictured alongside Gethin Jones as they washed mucky pups at the Burghley Horse Trials in Stamford, Lincolnshire, earlier today          The 37-year-old royal was at the event in her role as a Land Rover ambassador          Zara gave birth to baby daughter Lena on June 18 but has already jumped back into her role as an ambassador for the brandMonarch of the Glens: The Queen beams with joy in elegant...Monaco\u0027s royal twins aged three steal the show with...Share this articleZara, who is married to former rugby star Mike Tindall, 39, has since said  she hasn\u0027t ruled out a second Olympics.The royal won a silver medal with the GB equestrian team at London 2012 and said the desire to compete at the highest level is still strong. Speaking in a new video interview as a Land Rover ambassador this week, Zara shared how childbirth had affected her: \u0027The first time around my body was in so much shock.

She previously defended her £7.1million pay package in 2015 by saying: ‘Anyone who says they don’t want money is talking b*******’.The former Saturday girl at Marks \u0026amp Spencer has also shown little sympathy with the idea that women are discriminated against in the workplace.She once said she was ‘very cynical’ about the existence of ‘glass ceilings’ – a term describing the reluctance by companies to give top jobs to women. In an interview two years ago she said: ‘If you get up and do a good day’s work, you are respected for it.’During her first full-time job at a car rental desk in Kennington, South London, she realised she was good at selling and that the job was ‘all about up-selling everything’. ‘Upselling’ means persuading customers to buy extras or more expensive items.          On top of her £29million bonus, linked to the company’s share price, Avril Palmer-Baunack also received an 8 per cent rise in her basic salary to £525,000.British Car Auctions has defended her remuneration, arguing it needs to pay a ‘competitive rate’ to attract top people. But MPs are likely to take a dim view. Theresa May has published a public register to name and shame firms which have faced a revolt from shareholders over high pay.More than a fifth of Britain’s FTSE listed-firms appear on the list, including Burberry, Sports Direct and Sky.Earlier this year the chief executive of housebuilder Persimmon announced he would hand back £25million of his £100million pay package, to pacify shareholders.The award for Jeff Fairburn was generated by a 2012 long-term incentive plan.

Today, he describes how he and his BBC cameraman went in search of the rarest animal of all . . . Our footsteps echoed with embarrassing loudness on the hotel lobby’s polished wooden floor. There seemed to be nobody about. We coughed apologetically and waited.My cameraman colleague, Geoff Mulligan, and I had been warned that hardly anybody stayed at this hotel — why would they, situated as it was deep in the inhospitable forests of eastern Madagascar? But it seemed the perfect place to base ourselves in our search for one of the island’s most elusive creatures: its largest lemur, the indri.After several minutes a door at the far end of the hall opened to reveal, to our astonishment, an extremely glamorous woman. Her lips were heavily reddened and her lashes blackened with mascara, and she wore a chic but flimsy silk housecoat that barely succeeded in covering her ample figure.She was not yet fully awake, though it was by then almost midday. As she tottered towards us on stylish high heels, she was blinking sleepily and doing her best to rearrange her upswept coiffure.Jeanine, as we were to discover later, was no ordinary hotel boss — she had once been a model and the proprietor of a fashionable bar in Madagascar’s capital, Tananarive, which she had been forced to leave because of what she darkly referred to as ‘un grand scandale’.She required a great deal of reassurance that we had not come to the area by mistake, but were hoping to book rooms for a fortnight or so. When we at last convinced her, we unloaded our belongings and went to meet the local forestry officer, an elderly Frenchman.Our conversation was not profitable as he was lacking his dentures, and my French is passable at best. But he kindly offered us the services of a deputy, Michel, to show us the areas most likely to harbour the rare, mysterious and beautiful indri.I had read as much as I possibly could about this extraordinary animal before I left Britain, and established that it is around 3ft tall, is coloured black or black-and-white and has huge hands, six times as long as they are broad.What intrigued me most was the resemblance it bore to ancient drawings of a creature known to early explorers as the ‘dog-headed man’ peculiar to the area. It was always depicted as standing upright, with a shaggy coat and enormous, human-like hands and feet. Its body was tail-less and proportioned like a human being’s, but with a face and a snout like a dog’s.Could the ‘dog-headed man’ be the indri?There were few eyewitness accounts — the one attempt to study it in captivity 20 years before had failed dismally. A group of indris sent to a Paris zoo all died within a month, the keepers having been unable to replicate their highly specialised diet of leaves.Now here we were, with the chance to see one for ourselves. To watch and film one would, for me, be a glittering prize well worth all the effort and anticipation.As Geoff and I followed Michel into the twilight of the rainforest, our spirits sank.This was the thickest bush we had encountered so far. Not only was it very dark, but the vegetation was so dense that unless we were lucky it would be impossible to get a filmable view of any creature more than a few feet away.But the forest was extremely rich in animal life. From a small stream nearby came the honk of frogs, while from overhead came a confused chorus of birdsong.As I stood trying to unravel this cacophony, the birdsong was suddenly drowned out by a chorus of spine-chilling, unearthly howls.          Indri (pictured), also called the babakoto, is the largest lemurs of Madagascar‘Babakoto,’ said Michel, triumphantly — the local word for the indri. The noise was deafening — and eerily like the sound of a crying human child. But nothing could have prepared me for the volume. Even a gang of the noisiest children could not have produced a tenth of these decibels.Desperately, we peered through the palisades of trunks and leafy curtains. But we could see nothing — not the tiniest patch of black fur, nor the flash of an eye.Then, as abruptly as the wailing had begun, it stopped and the crickets, frogs and parrots took over once again. We were jubilant — the indris were really here.‘Always they sing at the same time,’ said Michel. ‘They will be here again tomorrow. If they don’t sing, then call to them with their voice, and often they will reply.’We turned up the next day with all our equipment, and the next, and the next. But of the indris there was neither sight nor sound. Hour after hour we waited, doing our best to imitate their calls. But no reply came back from the trees. There seemed nothing else to do but be patient.After a week, I was beginning to lose faith in the possibility of ever seeing an indri. Had they moved on? We decided to try a different part of the bush.Our first foray provided almost immediately a minor success, albeit not the one we had anticipated. Looking down to see where I was putting my feet, I noticed I was about to step into the middle of a collection of shiny olive-green objects the size of golf balls.When I picked one up, a split opened on one side to reveal that it was in fact a huge insect with around 20 pairs of frantically waving legs. The creature straightened itself out, unfurled a pair of knobbly antennae and began walking determinedly up my arm.I identified it as one of a strange species of millipede and I was sure they would make a wonderful display in London Zoo’s insect house. We filled our pockets and took 100 or so back to the hotel.The millipedes were not our only acquisition. A few days later, the elderly forestry officer drew up at the hotel in his smart saloon car.He was on his way to a meeting, but en-route had met some men carrying a newly-caught tailless tenrec — a comical, spiny creature looking like a cross between a hedgehog and an anteater.Remembering us, he had given the men a few francs for the animal and, as he had no cage or sack handy, had put it loose in the boot of his car. It was, he said, extremely lively and ferocious.Mindful of this, we assembled gloves, sacks and an empty cage, and the forestry officer cautiously lifted the boot lid an inch. I peered inside but could see nothing.He widened the crack two inches, then, warning us to pounce swiftly, threw open the lid. Geoff and I lunged. But there was absolutely nothing upon which to pounce. The boot was empty!Gingerly we removed the tool-bag, the jack and the spare wheel. Again, nothing. As we wondered what to do next, we heard a scrabbling deep inside the chassis somewhere between the front and back mudguards.\u0027We didn’t know we were playing with the clothes of Dad’s...Share this articleBy this time we had drawn a crowd of curious onlookers, and there was no lack of helping hands when I suggested that unscrewing the panels lining the interior was the only way to reach our quarry.The invisible tenrec spurred us on by rattling about in his metallic cavern.The forestry officer was starting to weary of the sight of his car being dismantled, and proposed driving on to his meeting.I pointed out that this would be most unwise, as the poor creature would almost certainly die — and if it did the smell would make his car unusable for at least a week.A far better plan would be to shut the lid, join us for coffee and see if the tenrec would clamber out of its uncomfortable refuge in the chassis and return to the relative spaciousness of the boot.Two hours later, we quietly opened the lid again. The tenrec was sitting at the back nonchalantly washing himself. He was the size of a large guinea pig, with an absurdly long tapering nose, immense whiskers, beady eyes and enormous hindquarters.We pounced and seconds later he was in one of our travelling cages.By the time we got him back to London and handed him over to the Zoo he had grown tremendously, increasing in both girth and length. But he never lost his passion for trying to cram his paunchy body down even the smallest suspicion of a hole.My hotel room was now well stocked. Chameleons sat goggling at one another on the curtain rail. A frilled gecko hung upside down on a piece of bark in a cage next to the tenrec. The millipedes slumbered in a box in one corner and three boa constrictors occupied a slowly moving sack in the other.          David with cameraman Geoff MulliganEvery day we discovered fresh creatures to fascinate us: moths, beetles, snakes, lizards, black parrots, strange frogs — but we still had not found the indri.An Ornithologist friend had asked us to record the song of the Madagascan magpie robin — a sound he considered to be among the finest produced by any bird.Geoff and I made our first attempt one day soon after dawn. When we arrived we found one, a handsome cock bird, singing heartily. Quickly, I plugged in the microphone and aimed it at him.For several minutes the tape moved steadily. Then, suddenly, a deafening eerie wail pealed out from the trees beyond, so loud that the recorder needle thrashed against the stop pin of the dial and clung there shuddering. It was the indri. But this time it was louder and closer.Geoff snatched his camera and I frantically searched the trees, but we could see nothing. The calls stopped, and I caught a momentary glimpse of a body sailing through the air. The indri had gone. Once more, we had failed.‘Well,’ said Geoff as we trudged back for breakfast. ‘At least we have a recording to prove it does exist, and that once upon a time we were within a few yards of one.’Then I thought of a trick used by ornithologists to locate a bird they wish to study — playing a recording of its song to attract others. I didn’t have much confidence, but we had tried everything else.For the next few days we played Geoff’s recording in several parts of the forest with no luck. Then, one morning I was about to pack up when the sound of the tape was suddenly drowned out by a series of trumpeting hoots.They were unlike any animal sound I’d ever heard, and I couldn’t imagine what was making them.I looked up and saw one of the hooting creatures in a tree in a small dell nearby — a big, furry black-and-white lemur, sitting on a branch 30ft from the ground.His chest, forearms and legs below the knee were white and he appeared to have a black cape round his shoulders, a pure white cap and black socks and gloves.‘It’s a ruffed lemur,’ I whispered to Geoff. ‘We can get shots of them in Tananarive Zoo.’ Nonetheless, we started filming, for he was a most beautiful creature.Our tape recorder continued its indri wails. The lemur glared indignantly at us with bright yellow eyes. Once more he hooted his irritation, and another trumpeting sound came from a tree on the left. I turned and saw two more of the animals sitting with their necks craned forward, staring at us in puzzlement.The first one reached up and pulled himself upright on to the branch above. I made a mental note that his movements were not like those of other lemurs, which are all four-footed. Then, as the animal sat down once more, I blinked in surprise.‘Where’s he put his tail?’ I muttered. ‘He should have a very long, black one.’‘Perhaps it’s curled up between his legs,’ said Geoff.The animal raised a long hind leg and grasped the tree trunk. He did not have a tail. Stupidly, it took me a few seconds to reach the only possible conclusion. ‘Geoff,’ I said quietly, ‘that is an indri.’There was no doubt. There is only one tailless lemur. We were jubilant. We had found them — and Geoff had already shot a full 400ft of film.Cautiously, he moved nearer to get shots from a different angle, but it was too much for the indris. With a gigantic bound, the first one leapt away, springing from trunk to trunk so rapidly that he seemed to ricochet from one tree to the other. The other two followed and within seconds were out of sight.Before dawn we returned and there they were again, just as Michel had said they would be. Every day for a week we watched this little family: the big male, his mate and a younger pair, slowly getting to know their habits, routine and personalities.The old male was of a sedate disposition, often sitting on a branch with his back against the main trunk and his long legs outstretched in a comically human-like position. Although he could leap huge distances, he spent most of his time clambering happily from branch to branch in search of the most succulent young leaves.The two youngsters were an extremely affectionate couple, and spent hours each day caressing one another. The position they chose in which to practise their endearments, crouching on a high horizontal bough, seemed perilous, like a pair of circus acrobats nonchalantly enacting episodes of their daily lives on a high wire.The fourth member of the group, the older female, we seldom saw. Only after several days did we learn the reason for her reticence. Clinging to her back was small, black-faced baby with hairy ears and bright eyes, barely a foot long.He was an enchanting creature, sometimes riding on her back, sometimes clambering round to suckle. His mother behaved with endearing tenderness, licking him gently from time to time.Our detailed knowledge of the family’s daily routine made our task of filming them easy. We photographed them feeding, dozing and caressing one another, but one shot we lacked — we had not secured any good pictures of them leaping, for when they moved off they always jumped away from us.If we were to get the film we wanted before we left, we urgently needed a new approach.We knew the location of the tree where they sang at lunchtime, and that they moved to an area further away to sing in the late afternoon. To get from one to the other, the indris would have to cross one of the area’s few wide roads.Retracing their movements, we worked out that at only one place was the road narrow enough for them to leap comfortably across. A simple calculation was enough to show that they must make the crossing at between three and four o’clock in the afternoon.Accordingly, at half-past two, Geoff and I set up our cameras a little west of the trees we judged they would use for their leap.Prompt at half past three, the old male duly appeared in the take-off tree. The young couple joined him, then the mother and baby emerged from the forest behind to sit on one of the branches overhanging the road.As soon as they were assembled, the old male climbed leisurely to the most outstretched branch. Geoff began filming.The male poised himself, then made a single, soaring jump right across the road to the tree the other side. One by one the rest followed him and disappeared.Geoff switched off his camera, beaming. After weeks of hope and crushing disappointment, our film of the private life of the indris was complete at last.Were the creatures we had filmed really the origin of the dog-headed man? It was impossible to know. But of one thing I was certain. Of all the strange and wonderful creatures we had filmed in Madagascar, this was the rarest, the least documented and the most endearing.  Aware of the BBC’s team’s disappointment at not being permitted to catch any lemurs, the Madagascar Scientific Institute presented them with two ring-tails and a ruffed lemur from its own collection. Their descendants thrived at London Zoo for decades.The indri remains in critical danger of extinction, with a 2015 report revealing that no zoo has yet worked out the complexities of its diet, and that it is unable to breed in captivity.Adapted from Journeys To The Other Side Of The World: Further Adventures Of A Young Naturalist by Sir David Attenborough, published by Two Roads on September 6 at £25. © David Attenborough 2018.

Today, he describes how he and his BBC cameraman went in search of the rarest animal of all . . . Our footsteps echoed with embarrassing loudness on the hotel lobby’s polished wooden floor. There seemed to be nobody about. We coughed apologetically and waited.My cameraman colleague, Geoff Mulligan, and I had been warned that hardly anybody stayed at this hotel — why would they, situated as it was deep in the inhospitable forests of eastern Madagascar? But it seemed the perfect place to base ourselves in our search for one of the island’s most elusive creatures: its largest lemur, the indri.After several minutes a door at the far end of the hall opened to reveal, to our astonishment, an extremely glamorous woman. Her lips were heavily reddened and her lashes blackened with mascara, and she wore a chic but flimsy silk housecoat that barely succeeded in covering her ample figure.She was not yet fully awake, though it was by then almost midday. As she tottered towards us on stylish high heels, she was blinking sleepily and doing her best to rearrange her upswept coiffure.Jeanine, as we were to discover later, was no ordinary hotel boss — she had once been a model and the proprietor of a fashionable bar in Madagascar’s capital, Tananarive, which she had been forced to leave because of what she darkly referred to as ‘un grand scandale’.She required a great deal of reassurance that we had not come to the area by mistake, but were hoping to book rooms for a fortnight or so. When we at last convinced her, we unloaded our belongings and went to meet the local forestry officer, an elderly Frenchman.Our conversation was not profitable as he was lacking his dentures, and my French is passable at best. But he kindly offered us the services of a deputy, Michel, to show us the areas most likely to harbour the rare, mysterious and beautiful indri.I had read as much as I possibly could about this extraordinary animal before I left Britain, and established that it is around 3ft tall, is coloured black or black-and-white and has huge hands, six times as long as they are broad.What intrigued me most was the resemblance it bore to ancient drawings of a creature known to early explorers as the ‘dog-headed man’ peculiar to the area. It was always depicted as standing upright, with a shaggy coat and enormous, human-like hands and feet. Its body was tail-less and proportioned like a human being’s, but with a face and a snout like a dog’s.Could the ‘dog-headed man’ be the indri?There were few eyewitness accounts — the one attempt to study it in captivity 20 years before had failed dismally. A group of indris sent to a Paris zoo all died within a month, the keepers having been unable to replicate their highly specialised diet of leaves.Now here we were, with the chance to see one for ourselves. To watch and film one would, for me, be a glittering prize well worth all the effort and anticipation.As Geoff and I followed Michel into the twilight of the rainforest, our spirits sank.This was the thickest bush we had encountered so far. Not only was it very dark, but the vegetation was so dense that unless we were lucky it would be impossible to get a filmable view of any creature more than a few feet away.But the forest was extremely rich in animal life. From a small stream nearby came the honk of frogs, while from overhead came a confused chorus of birdsong.As I stood trying to unravel this cacophony, the birdsong was suddenly drowned out by a chorus of spine-chilling, unearthly howls.          Indri (pictured), also called the babakoto, is the largest lemurs of Madagascar‘Babakoto,’ said Michel, triumphantly — the local word for the indri. The noise was deafening — and eerily like the sound of a crying human child. But nothing could have prepared me for the volume. Even a gang of the noisiest children could not have produced a tenth of these decibels.Desperately, we peered through the palisades of trunks and leafy curtains. But we could see nothing — not the tiniest patch of black fur, nor the flash of an eye.Then, as abruptly as the wailing had begun, it stopped and the crickets, frogs and parrots took over once again. We were jubilant — the indris were really here.‘Always they sing at the same time,’ said Michel. ‘They will be here again tomorrow. If they don’t sing, then call to them with their voice, and often they will reply.’We turned up the next day with all our equipment, and the next, and the next. But of the indris there was neither sight nor sound. Hour after hour we waited, doing our best to imitate their calls. But no reply came back from the trees. There seemed nothing else to do but be patient.After a week, I was beginning to lose faith in the possibility of ever seeing an indri. Had they moved on? We decided to try a different part of the bush.Our first foray provided almost immediately a minor success, albeit not the one we had anticipated. Looking down to see where I was putting my feet, I noticed I was about to step into the middle of a collection of shiny olive-green objects the size of golf balls.When I picked one up, a split opened on one side to reveal that it was in fact a huge insect with around 20 pairs of frantically waving legs. The creature straightened itself out, unfurled a pair of knobbly antennae and began walking determinedly up my arm.I identified it as one of a strange species of millipede and I was sure they would make a wonderful display in London Zoo’s insect house. We filled our pockets and took 100 or so back to the hotel.The millipedes were not our only acquisition. A few days later, the elderly forestry officer drew up at the hotel in his smart saloon car.He was on his way to a meeting, but en-route had met some men carrying a newly-caught tailless tenrec — a comical, spiny creature looking like a cross between a hedgehog and an anteater.Remembering us, he had given the men a few francs for the animal and, as he had no cage or sack handy, had put it loose in the boot of his car. It was, he said, extremely lively and ferocious.Mindful of this, we assembled gloves, sacks and an empty cage, and the forestry officer cautiously lifted the boot lid an inch. I peered inside but could see nothing.He widened the crack two inches, then, warning us to pounce swiftly, threw open the lid. Geoff and I lunged. But there was absolutely nothing upon which to pounce. The boot was empty!Gingerly we removed the tool-bag, the jack and the spare wheel. Again, nothing. As we wondered what to do next, we heard a scrabbling deep inside the chassis somewhere between the front and back mudguards.\u0027We didn’t know we were playing with the clothes of Dad’s...Share this articleBy this time we had drawn a crowd of curious onlookers, and there was no lack of helping hands when I suggested that unscrewing the panels lining the interior was the only way to reach our quarry.The invisible tenrec spurred us on by rattling about in his metallic cavern.The forestry officer was starting to weary of the sight of his car being dismantled, and proposed driving on to his meeting.I pointed out that this would be most unwise, as the poor creature would almost certainly die — and if it did the smell would make his car unusable for at least a week.A far better plan would be to shut the lid, join us for coffee and see if the tenrec would clamber out of its uncomfortable refuge in the chassis and return to the relative spaciousness of the boot.Two hours later, we quietly opened the lid again. The tenrec was sitting at the back nonchalantly washing himself. He was the size of a large guinea pig, with an absurdly long tapering nose, immense whiskers, beady eyes and enormous hindquarters.We pounced and seconds later he was in one of our travelling cages.By the time we got him back to London and handed him over to the Zoo he had grown tremendously, increasing in both girth and length. But he never lost his passion for trying to cram his paunchy body down even the smallest suspicion of a hole.My hotel room was now well stocked. Chameleons sat goggling at one another on the curtain rail. A frilled gecko hung upside down on a piece of bark in a cage next to the tenrec. The millipedes slumbered in a box in one corner and three boa constrictors occupied a slowly moving sack in the other.          David with cameraman Geoff MulliganEvery day we discovered fresh creatures to fascinate us: moths, beetles, snakes, lizards, black parrots, strange frogs — but we still had not found the indri.An Ornithologist friend had asked us to record the song of the Madagascan magpie robin — a sound he considered to be among the finest produced by any bird.Geoff and I made our first attempt one day soon after dawn. When we arrived we found one, a handsome cock bird, singing heartily. Quickly, I plugged in the microphone and aimed it at him.For several minutes the tape moved steadily. Then, suddenly, a deafening eerie wail pealed out from the trees beyond, so loud that the recorder needle thrashed against the stop pin of the dial and clung there shuddering. It was the indri. But this time it was louder and closer.Geoff snatched his camera and I frantically searched the trees, but we could see nothing. The calls stopped, and I caught a momentary glimpse of a body sailing through the air. The indri had gone. Once more, we had failed.‘Well,’ said Geoff as we trudged back for breakfast. ‘At least we have a recording to prove it does exist, and that once upon a time we were within a few yards of one.’Then I thought of a trick used by ornithologists to locate a bird they wish to study — playing a recording of its song to attract others. I didn’t have much confidence, but we had tried everything else.For the next few days we played Geoff’s recording in several parts of the forest with no luck. Then, one morning I was about to pack up when the sound of the tape was suddenly drowned out by a series of trumpeting hoots.They were unlike any animal sound I’d ever heard, and I couldn’t imagine what was making them.I looked up and saw one of the hooting creatures in a tree in a small dell nearby — a big, furry black-and-white lemur, sitting on a branch 30ft from the ground.His chest, forearms and legs below the knee were white and he appeared to have a black cape round his shoulders, a pure white cap and black socks and gloves.‘It’s a ruffed lemur,’ I whispered to Geoff. ‘We can get shots of them in Tananarive Zoo.’ Nonetheless, we started filming, for he was a most beautiful creature.Our tape recorder continued its indri wails. The lemur glared indignantly at us with bright yellow eyes. Once more he hooted his irritation, and another trumpeting sound came from a tree on the left. I turned and saw two more of the animals sitting with their necks craned forward, staring at us in puzzlement.The first one reached up and pulled himself upright on to the branch above. I made a mental note that his movements were not like those of other lemurs, which are all four-footed. Then, as the animal sat down once more, I blinked in surprise.‘Where’s he put his tail?’ I muttered. ‘He should have a very long, black one.’‘Perhaps it’s curled up between his legs,’ said Geoff.The animal raised a long hind leg and grasped the tree trunk. He did not have a tail. Stupidly, it took me a few seconds to reach the only possible conclusion. ‘Geoff,’ I said quietly, ‘that is an indri.’There was no doubt. There is only one tailless lemur. We were jubilant. We had found them — and Geoff had already shot a full 400ft of film.Cautiously, he moved nearer to get shots from a different angle, but it was too much for the indris. With a gigantic bound, the first one leapt away, springing from trunk to trunk so rapidly that he seemed to ricochet from one tree to the other. The other two followed and within seconds were out of sight.Before dawn we returned and there they were again, just as Michel had said they would be. Every day for a week we watched this little family: the big male, his mate and a younger pair, slowly getting to know their habits, routine and personalities.The old male was of a sedate disposition, often sitting on a branch with his back against the main trunk and his long legs outstretched in a comically human-like position. Although he could leap huge distances, he spent most of his time clambering happily from branch to branch in search of the most succulent young leaves.The two youngsters were an extremely affectionate couple, and spent hours each day caressing one another. The position they chose in which to practise their endearments, crouching on a high horizontal bough, seemed perilous, like a pair of circus acrobats nonchalantly enacting episodes of their daily lives on a high wire.The fourth member of the group, the older female, we seldom saw. Only after several days did we learn the reason for her reticence. Clinging to her back was small, black-faced baby with hairy ears and bright eyes, barely a foot long.He was an enchanting creature, sometimes riding on her back, sometimes clambering round to suckle. His mother behaved with endearing tenderness, licking him gently from time to time.Our detailed knowledge of the family’s daily routine made our task of filming them easy. We photographed them feeding, dozing and caressing one another, but one shot we lacked — we had not secured any good pictures of them leaping, for when they moved off they always jumped away from us.If we were to get the film we wanted before we left, we urgently needed a new approach.We knew the location of the tree where they sang at lunchtime, and that they moved to an area further away to sing in the late afternoon. To get from one to the other, the indris would have to cross one of the area’s few wide roads.Retracing their movements, we worked out that at only one place was the road narrow enough for them to leap comfortably across. A simple calculation was enough to show that they must make the crossing at between three and four o’clock in the afternoon.Accordingly, at half-past two, Geoff and I set up our cameras a little west of the trees we judged they would use for their leap.Prompt at half past three, the old male duly appeared in the take-off tree. The young couple joined him, then the mother and baby emerged from the forest behind to sit on one of the branches overhanging the road.As soon as they were assembled, the old male climbed leisurely to the most outstretched branch. Geoff began filming.The male poised himself, then made a single, soaring jump right across the road to the tree the other side. One by one the rest followed him and disappeared.Geoff switched off his camera, beaming. After weeks of hope and crushing disappointment, our film of the private life of the indris was complete at last.Were the creatures we had filmed really the origin of the dog-headed man? It was impossible to know. But of one thing I was certain. Of all the strange and wonderful creatures we had filmed in Madagascar, this was the rarest, the least documented and the most endearing.  Aware of the BBC’s team’s disappointment at not being permitted to catch any lemurs, the Madagascar Scientific Institute presented them with two ring-tails and a ruffed lemur from its own collection. Their descendants thrived at London Zoo for decades.The indri remains in critical danger of extinction, with a 2015 report revealing that no zoo has yet worked out the complexities of its diet, and that it is unable to breed in captivity.Adapted from Journeys To The Other Side Of The World: Further Adventures Of A Young Naturalist by Sir David Attenborough, published by Two Roads on September 6 at £25. © David Attenborough 2018.

They were once part of a migrating community of reindeer herders but today, in their old age, they spend most of their days in the village of Yar-Sale, cut off from their nomadic relatives and friends.Though the men are encouraged to stay within the wandering community as they grow older, the women often find themselves facing the struggles of ageing in isolation.Life in the village might seem more comfortable than life as a migrating elder in the wild tundra, but it comes at the cost of great loneliness and a loss of purpose. In the past, each woman held an essential role in her community. Pudani, for example, was a leading herder, while Liliya was the only person in her tribe who knew how to read. Over many cups of tea, these women shared their life stories. They told me about magical snowy landscapes, lost parents and partners.  I asked each woman for permission to take their portrait in the natural light of their homes and wearing a precious item from their past. Using their stories as a guide, I also documented the wild landscapes they once wandered.Autipana Audi (born 1941). During her lifetime, Autipana experienced many sad losses. She lost her husband, son and daughter to diseases, and a few years ago her entire reindeer herd perished to starvation during a cold wave. Almost unable to walk, she spends her days mostly limited to her bed. Autipana, who was born in the tundra, says that “walking in the snow” is what she longs for most.Necla Audi (born 1928). Although Necla was 89 when this portrait was taken, she still wishes to live with the migrating community. “I was born in the tundra and spent all my life there, it’s the only way of living I know.” At the far left of her bed is a picture of her two sons taken when they were young. Now, both of them are herders in the tundra.Angelina Serotetto (born 1942). Angelina was part of a family of shaman women and her mother taught her to read the future using sacred objects from nature. “Yes! I miss those days in the past,” she says. “But I try to remain optimistic. I view everything with a loving eye. I think you learn it as you get older”. Vaynoto Vera (born 1967). Having living in nature throughout her entire life, Vaynoto’s daughters rented her a small apartment in the village of Yar-Sale so that she could live in comfort. They come to visit her whenever possible but as they are obliged to return to their herds and migrating journeys, Vaynoto is often left alone.Zinaida Evay (born 1946) and her cat Persik (“peach” in Russian). Zinaida was married for many years, and she shared with me that she had a beautiful and loving bond with her husband, right to his last day. Now that he has passed away she is living in a small apartment alone, with their mutual cats, with almost no friends to come and visit. “All that is left are the lullabies I sing to myself.” Liliya Yamkina (born 1944). As a child she was the only one in her clan who knew how to read. She said she still remembers how important she felt when she read everyone their letters and formal documents. However, the importance of her reading skills to the clan was also the reason that her father prevented her from going to college and that caused many conflicts between them. Now, in her apartment, she writes love songs about the Tundra and her dream is to publish them in a magazine. “I did not fully understand the importance of tradition and family when I was young. I argued so much with my parents. I wanted to escape from my roots.” But, she adds: “I remember how much I liked it when they told me folk tales around the bonfire. I miss them so much.”Pudani Audi (born 1948). Like her ancestors who have wandered the frozen landscape of northern Siberia for thousands of years, Pudani was born in the tundra and roamed since birth. During her adulthood, she was a leading herder, leading the precious herd through one of the most extreme environments on earth. She told me that she is still hoping to return to wander, but without her community’s support it is clear that this longing will never be realised. In this portrait, she is wearing a fur hat, the sole object she was left with from her wandering days."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1517087c31da8ded0b42052b77589aef9ced41d5/0_3_5090_3055/master/5090.jpg?width=880\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8dfafa26ee50e5f1ee8c68f69d2e40eb 880w","title":"childrens picture books of the month","story":"Mini Rabbit will stop at nothing for cake. Off he goes, bouncing over mountains and meadows, hollering “caaaaake!”, in search of berries to finish off his mum’s latest creation. With his colourful debut picture book, Mini Rabbit Not Lost (6 Sept, HarperCollins, £12.99), and its teeny, wide-eyed star, author-illustrator John Bond brilliantly captures the single-mindedness of small children and how everyday desires can spark epic quests for them. It’s also very witty, both pictorially (look closely and almost every page has berries missed by Mini Rabbit) and with the punchline, once he’s home and offered cake: “No, thank you,” he says. “Can I have some ice cream?” HarperCollins has signed Bond up for a three-book deal and after this helping little readers will certainly want seconds.A celebration of all the grannies who have looked after their grandchildren this summer comes from the award-winning Benji Davies. Grandma Bird (18 Oct, Simon \u0026amp Schuster, paperback £6.99) features the characters from Davies’s beloved first book The Storm Whale, little Noi and his fisherman dad, and more gorgeous seaside settings, but this time Noi’s off to spend the holidays with his granny. Imagine The Incredibles’ fashion designer Edna Mode if she’d gone grey, discovered meditation and become a recluse on a tiny Moominesque island. Noi isn’t sure about her. She serves up seaweed soup and snores like a walrus. But after they rescue some windswept birds together, they’re bonded for life. The picture of them spooning soup to rows of birds at the fireside in granny’s cabin will melt hearts.Another entertaining retiree comes in the form of Dave the Lonely Monster, from Anna Kemp (words) and Sara Ogilvie (pictures) of Dogs Don’t Do Ballet fame (4 Oct, Simon \u0026amp Schuster, paperback £6.99). Dave’s a purple ogre with a pink electric guitar who is forced out of the solitude of his cave, with its knitting, poetry and band poster for the Grrrs, by a six-year-old knight on a hobby horse. Soon they’re friends and persuading the local townsfolk not to recommence their old habit of bashing monsters with rotten veg. Set in medieval times but with modern gear, it’s a call for love not war, dancing not fighting, with Dave saying to the braying townsfolk: “‘...put away the salad bar  and let me fetch my bass guitar!’ And so they went down to the cave ...and had themselves a monster rave.”Iranian author Anahita Teymorian also appeals for peace in There’s Room for Everyone (21 Sept, £12.99), the first book in a new “Hope in a Scary World” series from independent children’s picture book publisher Tiny Owl. Her narrator recalls comprehending as a child that there was enough room for the stars in the sky and books in the library, but human beings are constantly fighting over space. Teymorian plays beautifully with the physical boundaries of the page, her impossibly lanky-limbed characters stooping beneath the paper’s edges to illustrate, for example, that their house is getting too small. She had the idea for the tale while shouting at the TV news, but the tone isn’t angry – it’s wise and warm.Authors are getting increasingly creative with the physical possibilities of picture books – from cut-outs and flaps to pullout pages – and nonfiction title The Skies Above My Eyes by Charlotte Guillain, illustrated by Yuval Zommer (out now, Words \u0026amp Pictures, £14.99), literally stretches its potential. The follow-up to The Street Beneath My Feet, it has the same concertina format, folding out to 2.5 metres,\u0026nbspand explores what’s above us, from skyscrapers to – the more you fold out – the solar system.

Berkeley’s shares have soared on the back of the profits, creating a fortune for the company’s senior executives, who since 2008 have been given shares worth £610m. Pidgley himself holds an additional 4.4m shares, worth £163m. The shares have more than trebled in value over the past decade.Although the company has restricted future bonus payouts following shareholder anger, the top six executives could still collect another £127m over the next four years. Pidgley, who has amassed a £310m fortune according to the Sunday Times rich list, is set for up to £48m. The Liberal Democrat leader, Vince Cable, said Pidgley and other housebuilders have a duty to the nation to build more affordable housing especially if they are personally making “vast fortunes” from building expensive homes. “Tony Pidgley is rightly regarded as a sage of the housebuilding industry, with an impressive record of calling the housing market correctly. That explains why he is well-paid,” Cable said. “But housebuilders who are making these vast fortunes must also understand that they have a social responsibility to make sure the country has the homes we so desperately need. Shareholders must make sure that executives are not rewarded for a poor record on affordable housing, because that does not encourage them to do the right thing and make sure we have a sustainable housing market.” Some of Berkeley’s biggest investors are expected to raise concerns about the vast pay packages at the company’s annual meeting next week. In one example, Land Registry data indicates Berkeley Group sold 71 homes in its Ebury Square development in Belgravia, central London, for a total of £358m. The company told Westminster council that as the development was refurbishing an existing building that contained 60 units, only 11 additional homes would be generated. This meant, under Westminster planning rules, that Berkeley was obliged to build only one affordable home. But instead of building it on site, Berkeley made a payment to the council of £1.6m towards low-cost housing elsewhere in the borough. Freedom of information disclosures show that Berkeley bought the Ebury Square site – a former police house – from the politan Police for £23.6m in 2009. The profit on this single development is thought to be in excess of £200m.Building those units, Berkeley stated in a planning agreement, would mean the scheme would be £24.6m in deficit. Berkeley told Hounslow that house sales would generate £132m. Berkeley did agree to make an extra payment to Hounslow capped at £8.3m in the event of the scheme performing well. Land Registry data suggest that the scheme generated close to £250m, with one apartment selling for £4.55m.“Last year alone, Berkeley contributed more than £400m of subsidy for affordable housing and wider community and infrastructure projects, which has helped us be recognised as London and the south-east’s leading place-maker. Sales utilising Help to Buy are a very small part of Berkeley’s sales.”Berkeley’s profits mark it out as the most successful builder in a sector that has reaped huge rewards in recent years. ’s research shows the top nine quoted builders collectively have amassed £16.9bn in pre-tax profits since 2010. Just last year, nine of Britain’s biggest builders’ profits topped £4.56bn.Greg Beales, director of campaigns at the housing charity Shelter, said: “We’re in the grip of a worsening housing crisis, so it’s vital that developers build their fair share of affordable homes rather than making up endless excuses while turning over huge profits.“Thankfully, the government’s recent changes to planning rules have made it harder for housebuilders to wriggle out of their obligations. If they’re enforced properly by councils, these reforms should increase the number of affordable homes that get built. So we’ll be watching closely to make sure developers are held to account.”Affordable housing targets set by councils are based on local demand and supply, the costs of housing locally and local wages. The targets are usually expressed as a percentage of new housing supply.

Given it could influence the allocation of the next round of environment funding under the EU’s Life programme, it is deeply disturbing to see such a report, based on wholly discredited science, wending its way down the corridors of Brussels.Some of the claims made by the report’s author, the Ukip MEP Stuart Agnew, are, frankly, pretty hair-raising. For instance, he claims that the effect of CO2 levels on our climate is “negligible”, and that it is “one of agriculture’s greatest friends”. Agnew claims there is a lack of concentration of CO2 and as a result there is no problem for the EU to solve.So how could it be that someone with a track record of shameful ignorance of the science of climate change ends up being assigned the task of compiling this report?Unbelievably, the decision to appoint Agnew was met with support from Christian Democrat, Conservative and Liberal members of the European parliament’s agriculture committee, while the Socialists and Democrats, supported by the Greens, attempted to challenge the decision to give Agnew the leading role.What this fiasco reveals is the huge threat to rational climate action posed by the rise of the far right. It also shows the risks from Brexit, as the links between climate denial and Brexit are well documented. For example,the long-standing supporter of Brexit and arch-neoliberal Nigel Lawson founded the Global Warming Policy Foundation to oppose climate change mitigation policies. He labelled the Kyoto protocol “wrongheaded”, and has called for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change to be shut down.Lawson may be considered an irrelevant dinosaur, though he still manages to platform his nonsense at regular intervals on the BBC. But the man who Conservative MP Anna Soubry declared was now running the country, the hardline Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg, has blamed high energy prices on “climate alarmism” and has said it was unrealistic for scientists to project future climate changes, just as it was difficult for meteorologists to correctly predict the weather. Meanwhile, Nigel Farage, adding to a litany of ill-informed comments on climate change, earlier this year declared that the “beast from the east” was proof that global warming wasn’t real. And of course, favouring supposed “alternative facts” on climate change is a prejudice shared by other far-right groups, most notably Donald Trump’s circle.Given the dangers posed by the far right and the very real threat of a significant bloc of populist, climate change-denying MEPs after next year’s European elections, it is time for those of us who back the overwhelming scientific consensus on climate change to take back control. That is why I joined other politicians, scientists, academics and campaigners in signing a letter pledging we would refuse to debate those who deny that human-caused climate change is real. We can no longer give voice to the pseudo-science of climate change deniers we must urgently move the debate on to how we address the causes and effects of dangerous climate breakdown.The large right and centre-right groups in the European parliament could and should have blocked Ukip from taking charge of a report on climate change. We can only hope that the mainstream groups in parliament – right, left and centre – that are likely to continue to control the majorities will show a greater degree of responsibility in future.• Molly Scott Cato is the Green MEP for the south-west of England"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/782cc2cd9230f77d5a17aab4e1689143d56864cf/0_95_3200_1920/master/3200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dd73648da0b67f39f2eb75667d198da3","title":"fracking england tories lancashire council government","story":"Lancastrians protested against it, the council rejected it, the health impacts are shocking. But this government doesn’t careOne day soon, in a field by the A583 in sight of Blackpool Tower, fracking for shale gas will resume in the UK. The first attempt to kickstart this dangerous and disruptive industry had to be abruptly halted, after fracking at a nearby site in 2011 by the same company, Cuadrilla, set off earth tremors. For nearly two years, local people have maintained a round-the-clock vigil on the roadside. Their presence reflects the overwhelming opposition of residents to the forced intrusion of fracking into this green and tranquil corner of Lancashire. Passing motorists toot support.The people of Lancashire could have been forgiven for thinking that they had seen off the threat of being turned into the UK’s shale gas guinea pigs. In 2015, responding to their well-evidenced concerns, the county council refused permission for Cuadrilla to frack in the very same field, and in the nearby secluded village of Roseacre. But, taking advantage of planning rules the coalition government had put in place to favour fracking, Cuadrilla appealed. In 2016, Sajid Javid, then communities secretary, duly overturned Lancashire council’s decision. This July, the government gave final consent for Cuadrilla to begin.The only justification for forcing an industry with no social licence on to a community that finds it repugnant arises when there is an overriding national interest. In the case of fracking, there is no such interest. Quite the contrary. Shale gas does not, as Cuadrilla claims, offer the UK a low-carbon alternative to coal. Long before it will ever flow in significant volumes, coal will have dropped out of our energy system.UK gas demand is falling, from its 2004 peak. Plentiful, affordable gas will remain available from the North Sea and on the international market at least for the limited period in which it is still needed in our decarbonising economy. Industry leaders accept that domestic fracking cannot bring down our energy bills.A fully developed UK fracking industry would industrialise our countryside on a scale that few yet appreciate. It would lock in infrastructure and supply chains, and ert investment, policy and regulatory capacity away from where they are really needed. It would certainly slow down the transition now under way to a modern, low-carbon economy based on renewables, energy efficiency, and real-time digital balancing of the power supply. Not only is that transition essential in response to climate change. It is also the route to lower energy bills for households and businesses, and to higher productivity across a more innovative economy. Our overriding national interest is to speed it up, as our competitors are doing, not delay it.As if that wasn’t enough, fracking is not nearly as safe as its advocates say. In England, the only official report was by Public Health England in 2014, and its scope was deliberately partial. Most of what is now known is from subsequent studies. These point overwhelmingly in one direction. A group of independent professionals recently wrote to Sarah Wollaston MP, chair of the social care committee, saying: “There is now convincing evidence that fracking is a danger to the health and wellbeing of people living near well sites, with several studies pointing to an increase in premature births, miscarriages, birth defects, cancer, heart attacks, migraines, childhood asthma and a variety of other lung and skin diseases.” They cited the conclusion of US colleagues that “emerging data continue to reveal a plethora of recurring problems and harms that cannot be sufficiently averted through regulatory frameworks”.These are among the considerations that have led Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland, the Republic of Ireland, France, the Netherlands and Germany to reject fracking. In this part of the world, only in England is there still any prospect of widespread fracking. The current government could have slammed the brake on the shale gas bandwagon set in motion by its predecessor. Instead, it is pressing the accelerator.For exploratory drilling, it now proposes to exempt the industry from the need to apply for planning permission at all, by extending to shale gas rules originally designed to make it easier for homeowners to build sheds and conservatories. Once fracking wells are ready to produce gas, the government intends to designate them “nationally significant infrastructure”, giving unelected planning inspectors instead of local authorities the power of approval, and making a mockery of local democracy. Moreover, while trying to force fracking on to communities against their will, it also continues to block the progress of new onshore wind projects, even where they would be locally welcome.This is exactly the kind of cynical incoherence, driven\u0026nbspby lobbies and cronies against the wishes and interests of everyone else, that has turned so many people off politics and politicians. Our government says it wants to be part of the solution on climate, to clean up our dirty air, to protect our environment. It cannot expect any of these claims to be taken seriously as long as it keeps trying to force open the door to wholesale fracking. Our government says it wants to give local people more control over their lives. This too will sound\u0026nbsprisible as long as it rides roughshod over local democratic processes and institutions.The Conservatives are said to be concerned about the party’s inability to attract young people. But it is the young who will pay the highest price for the mistakes we make now.

While the world habitually follows the twists and turns of the presidency, legislators on Capitol Hill are only known to the most avid of politicos on the other side of the Atlantic.But this June things changed. In New York’s 14th congressional district, a 28-year-old community organiser and part-time bartender defeated one of the country’s most senior politicians and became the Democratic candidate in this year’s Congressional elections. It was America’s biggest political upset since the election of Donald Trump, and the world was introduced to Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.Ocasio-Cortez embodies the movement-led, popular politics Momentum was born to promote in the UK. And with Labour surging to more than half a million members, there is no doubt we have many of our own like Ocasio-Cortez just waiting for their chance. But despite the wealth of talent in our movement, and the potential to enliven our parliamentary benches with fresh energy and passion, a new generation of Labour MPs are being shut out by Labour’s restrictive, outdated rulebook.Unlike the primary system that operates in the US, it is notoriously difficult to challenge a sitting Labour MP. Instead of being able to run in an open contest on a positive and propositional platform as Ocasio-Cortez did, Labour has a built-in mechanism that forces local party members to mount a negative campaign against their sitting MP just to instigate a race.Despite obsessional reporting in some parts of the press, most local Labour members are far more interested in fighting the Tories than one another. Such a isive selections process puts off many would-be candidates, and has left Labour with only a handful of open contests in Labour-held seats in nearly 30 years. Ocasio-Cortez would never have been elected if she had been subject to Labour’s restrictive rulebook, and as things stand many of our most talented members will never get a shot at becoming an MP.The lack of democracy is striking, and we’re hoping the Labour party conference will ditch this outdated practice. We want to see a process that gives a fair chance to all candidates and improves the atmosphere in local parties by doing away with the negative, isive stage of campaigning and making it an open contest from the start. This means, in all constituencies, local members and the sitting MP would be free to compete for the Labour party’s backing at the general election – and able to run positive, vibrant campaigns talking about the issues voters actually care about in order to become the Labour candidate. Not only will this open the door to a new generation of MPs, it will bring current Labour MPs closer to the members, help them stay in tune with the needs of their constituencies and ensure the deep, collective knowledge of our half a million members – who live and work in every kind of community across Britain – is properly utilised.Of course, calls of “purge” will emanate from the usual minority within the party, and will be seized upon by a certain section of the press. But instead of crying foul, those who back the status quo should actually defend it and present a positive case for the current rules. Ours is a party on the verge of government, and we must foster a culture where the big issues – including workings of our party – are up for discussion and open to change.Without an open door to would-be MPs and a chance for members to have their say the enthusiasm and energy will quickly ebb away. More democracy rather than less is how we will empower our half a million members, build a social movement-style party and win the next election. More democracy is also, incidentally, a core Labour value, with commitments to democratise the economy and society at the heart of our plan for government. As a party, it might be time to begin practising what we preach."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3b5393cb718b0cccd00ca14d40f26dc4ec0c1451/19_0_922_553/master/922.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8ac1288eaa6fbec97bad1d3ebce37e2a","title":"summer blues doctors daytime tv","story":"Doctors is a daytime TV institution, and for us devotees, it’s been a long summer while it’s been off air. Thank God it’s backThe first Monday of September signals the end of the summer and throws a bucket of cold misery squarely in your face. It’s back to school and back to work with shorter days, more crowded commutes and the sunniest days behind us. But there is one redeeming feature on the horizon – the return of Doctors.This lunchtime soap opera is simply the best thing on TV. Devout fans like me have been champing at the bit all summer while the show was taken off air to make room for sports tosh like Wimbledon and some football tournament involving a man in a waistcoat. But finally, today, at 1.45pm on BBC One, our friends at Letherbridge’s Mill Health Centre will open their doors again.The first thing to love about Doctors is that … it isn’t about doctors at all. Yes, the show revolves around a “busy Midlands practice”, but you won’t find any “scalpel please” Holby City moments. Instead you’ll discover a kaleidoscope of rich, three-dimensional characters, and storylines taken from real life, ranging from the dramatic, such as the smashing of a paedophile ring, to the hilarious – normally involving the eccentric receptionist Valerie.How does this soap earn its place as the best in the world? To start with, the writers are on the ball. They have tackled big issues such as immigration and under-age sex by bringing these down to an inidual’s story and dealing with them in sensitive and insightful ways. The show took on an emotional upskirting plot long before a Tory MP got the chance to vote against the making it a criminal offence. There were special weeks on mental health and homelessness, based on real-life tales. But surprisingly there have also been weeks with programmes themed around Jane Austen, William Shakespeare, – even a Waiting for Godot parody (Waiting for Gordon).Another joy of Doctors is its lunchtime transmission, allowing for a 30-minute sneaky sit-down or the start of a full-on afternoon sofa veg-out. But for most of the stalwart devotees, it’s recorded daily to be devoured later before being discussed and dissected in a fan group (who is behind Tark’s hit-and-run murder? Is the rumour of another death founded? And – since 27 June – how many more sleeps until the show returns?).Unlike most other soaps, every episode can be enjoyed as a standalone without having to know the ins-and-outs of the pub’s landlady’s pet dog’s cousin. And also unlike other soaps, the characters look ordinary – and that’s a good thing. They’re not all lipstick and Lycra. Their homes and lifestyles are realistic. They even wear the same clothes in different episodes.Of course the show has its faults. Letherbridge seems to be the only place in the UK where patients can rock up and get an appointment to see a GP on the same day the staff always seem to be able to manage a leisurely lunch break out of the office every day and the surgery still appears to operate with paper patients’ records.So why isn’t Doctors more celebrated? Even though it’s been running since March 2000, it always seems to be treated as the bridesmaid, never the bride. Maybe some viewers are switched off by the idea of a daytime show, imagining a lame Doc Martin-style setup, only in Brum. Some people might never have given Doctors a go after being put off soaps by others which seem to often resort to lairy shoutfests. Perhaps people aren’t aware of the show’s humorous side – actor Ian Midlane won the best comedy performance at the British Soap awards this year for his role as Dr Al Haskey. But if you’re still not convinced that the show is the best soap opera yet, give it a watch – in this sad end-of-summer season you might find Doctors is the perfect tonic.• Kathryn Hearn is an assistant production editor at the "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/26705d8eedc91aff0420e75e0e2565b265132e7f/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4670de45e11553a1016b74ad8caeace7","title":"turkey west erdogan democracy civil rights","story":"Growing up in Turkey, every weekend I\u0026nbspwould gather with friends and family to watch a western. John Wayne spoke fluent Turkish back then, Clint\u0026nbspEastwood uttered his laconic replies in an Istanbul dialect. Those cowboy towns with their bleak landscapes might just as well have been somewhere in Anatolia, they were so familiar. When the US television series Dallas first came to Turkey\u0026nbspit created a ripple of excitement that lasted for years. There would be no one on the streets in the evenings when it was being screened. We were a nation hooked on the saga of the Ewing family. My grandmother put a curse on JR, the scheming, sneaky oil tycoon – we all hated him with a passion. But we never saw him as an “American” or a “westerner”.And that’s what strikes me most when I look back: the absence of anti-western, anti-European sentiment. Part of that is because Turkey, unlike Algeria or Morocco, has not been colonised. We have no collective memory of colonialism. In fact back then, Turks generally thought we were part of the west, part of Europe, even though most Europeans had yet to acknowledge it. That naive and optimistic Turkey does not exist any more.The jingoistic hysteria is not shared by all Turkish citizens – these showy examples taking to the streets are clearly in the minority. But in a country where the opposition is censored and suppressed, it is people burning things and changing names who are covered by the media. Anyone who openly refuses to take part in the spectacle is called a traitor.A massive cultural change is taking place, and it manifests itself in small everyday details. We are being pushed into an artificial tribalism and we are being told that ethnically, religiously and historically, we are completely distinct from the west. We will never be one of them. Culture has become the new battleground. Secularism fades as the number of religious schools rises evolution has been purged from the new school curriculum education has been reshaped along religious and nationalistic lines. Erdoğan has been explicit: he wants “to raise a pious generation”.The French president, Emmanuel Macron, brands\u0026nbspTurkey anti-European. “President Erdoğan’s Turkey is not President Mustafa Kemal Atatürk’s Turkey any more,” he said. But Turkey’s slide into anti-westernism will have negative consequences for “us” and “them” alike. That is the challenge for European politicians – it does not only concern Turkey, but the increasing number of countries where democracy is either wobbly\u0026nbspor wounded.There has to be a new approach that is openly and unwaveringly critical of all authoritarian governments and their shameful record on human rights, democracy and freedom of speech. But at the same time we all must\u0026nbspembrace the civil societies of those countries where people are struggling under the direst circumstances. For as much as Erdoğan and his ilk present themselves as mere spokespeople for the will of their people, we need to see the difference between the elite and the general population in undemocratic countries. Isolating these lands and pushing them away from western norms will only play into the hands of isolationists. The Islamists and nationalists in Turkey do not want the country to be part of the European Union – they only benefit from escalating tension.And while this international drama plays out, Turkey’s journalists, human rights activists and civic leaders are put on trial, exiled or imprisoned. Osman Kavala, well-respected and known for his work for peaceful coexistence, is still in jail on baseless charges. Likewise the opposition leader Selahattin Demirtaş remains unlawfully imprisoned. Novelist and columnist Ahmet Altan has been sentenced to life without parole. Turkey has become the world’s biggest jailer of journalists, surpassing even China’s sad record.On 25 August, the mothers’ vigil, a peaceful demonstration that has been organised every weekend for more than a decade to remind the nation of the hundreds of citizens who have “disappeared” under police custody, was dispersed by brutal police force. More than 20 people were detained. The Kurdish-majority HDP party co-chair Pervin Buldan said: “They created a country that is afraid of mother’s silent cries.”Turkey is changing, sliding backwards in every way. Led by an undercurrent of government-sponsored chauvinism and xenophobia, it is sailing away from the west and away from Europe. But still, civil society resists. There are countless citizens in Turkey – women, students, minorities – whose voices we do not hear, yet they continue to passionately support and defend pluralistic democracy. They are still there. We are still there. This is what “the west” should not fail to see.• Elif Shafak is an award-winning novelist and political scientist"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/66740be7187f44bad4ee4e6c012d5cbd2024fcc3/0_3_3044_1827/master/3044.jpg?width=645\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=51c115d367e78bba63ddc06042c94fda 645w","title":"nasser hussain in the nets how a local cricket club got a first class makeover","story":"When Ilford Cricket Club won a community cricket honour, its facilities were soon transformed – shortly followed by league success and coaching sessions from stars of the game“Come on, keep those balls coming – otherwise we’re just people standing in a shed!”Nasser Hussain is not here to muck about. The former England captain is putting kids through their paces in the indoor nets of Ilford Cricket School. Famed in his pomp for a feisty batting style, he’s much the same as a teacher. Former England seamer, Sajid Mahmood, is in the adjoining net, teaching bowling.The kids can hardly believe their luck. They lap up the attention of both legends, grab selfies and get their bats signed. Proud parents film on their phones. Balls whizz through the air, and shrieks of excitement bounce off the walls. At the end of the class, a tiny youngster bowls out Hussain. The roof nearly lifts off the hall.Just an hour earlier, poor weather threatened to derail a much-anticipated day. ESPNcricinfo had been booked to give the full match day treatment to Ilford Cricket Club’s tie against rivals Ilford Town, courtesy of NatWest. Hussain and Mahmood were due to give a pre-match masterclass on the pitch.But after weeks of sunny, sweltering conditions, the day began with improbably grey skies, bucketing rain and heavy winds. As everyone sheltered in the clubhouse, the only sign of life outside was a cagouled woman, bravely walking her springer iel through the bluster.Then Hussain arrived, bouncing in with a chirpy: “Turned out nice again.” He was followed by the towering presence of Mahmood. As the energy began to shift, their masterclasses were moved indoors and a weather app suggested that a truncated match could be played in mid-afternoon. It was game on.Speaking after the classes, Hussain explained his pugnacious approach. “Look, cricket can be a dull game if you don’t get on with it,” he says. “I hate coaching sessions when all you hear is the coach – when you have an hour and the coach has spoken for 40 minutes and the kids are standing there bored.”In fact, the kids had been electrified and impressive in both the classes. Mahmood says: “I was really amazed by the number that turned out and the level of talent. Their technique was very, very good.” Hussain agreed, adding: “There’s a strong British-Asian community here and they pick up things very quickly because they follow the game so passionately.”Back at the clubhouse, Ilford chairman Maz Malik’s cheery energy was helping keep the day on track, despite the weather. “We’ve been having sub-continental conditions for six weeks, but today it’s back to the reality of English summer,” he laughed.A cricket fanatic – he says he’d get up to watch the Seychelles play the Bahamas at 3am – he has been part of the club since 1980, when he joined as a nine-year-old. As we speak, the razzmatazz of the day carries on around us: ESPN commentates on the match and NatWest’s virtual reality tent thrills kids. A barbecue sizzles away. Hussain, who cut his teeth here in the 1980s, and Mahmood chat with locals.“It’s been an exceptional day – we were very honoured to get selected,” says Malik. He describes the masterclasses as an “aspirational experience” for local kids. “It brings stars into reality. The kids see that these are human beings and that they can follow in their footsteps.”Gesturing to the NatWest “Cricket has no boundaries” banner, he talks about the “huge” changes he has seen in the sport. “Things have become less stuffy,” he says. “There has been less of the old boys’ network shirts, ties and collars. It’s become more accessible. We’re open for all – people of all abilities and backgrounds.”There are plans to host a “tape-ball” cricket tournament in August to attract those from south Asia and those who find the entry cost to full cricket prohibitive. The club has already subsidised some local youngsters who were referred by local authorities because of difficult circumstances.Members of the club, which was founded in 1879, say the atmosphere and relations across the board are much tighter since the involvement of CricketForce. Everyone has a new spring in their step. The first team recently topped the Essex Premier League for the first time in over 20 years. “I don’t see that as a coincidence,” says Malik.Captain Theeban Tavarasa, 31, has been involved with the club for 18 years, since his talent was spotted one day by Nasser Hussain’s father, Jawad, in the nets of Ilford Cricket School. “We are a very multicultural club, we have people from all walks of life: Indians, Pakistanis, Bangladeshis, Sri Lankans, English, Irish – we’ve got such a good society here,” says Tavarasa.“I believe this local community needs a cricket club like this. When you hear about so much crime and discord in London, a club like ours can help the community with cohesion. We can set a shining example.”Summing up the occasion, Sajid Mahmood strikes a similar note. “Today has brought the community together,” he says. “I think NatWest have done a fantastic job in supporting this. They’ve realised the contribution days like this can make towards community cohesion.”Mohammad Akhtar was the star on the day, with a pivotal 59 from 40 balls as Ilford CC (173 for 4) beat Ilford Town (170 for 8) by six wickets. Watching from the perimeter, Usman Ul Haq, a highly-tipped youngster who also plays for Essex, discusses the positive impact cricket has had on his life. “It helps you stay away from trouble and harmful paths,” says the 13-year-old, whose proud father Inam has been an Ilford member for more than 20 years.“Today has been amazing,” continues Usman with a smile. “How often do you have a first-class cricketer in your net giving you tips, then hanging around, signing your bats and then coming on to the club house to have a nice chat with you?“What I’ve learned more than anything today is that you don’t need to be good at the game to enjoy the game. This whole day has shown that you should play for the love of it. That’s the best way.”As a erse and inclusive sport, cricket truly has no boundaries, and NatWest think that’s worth protecting. That’s why they’ve supported it since 1981.

You might even think of boxing: the city is home to some of the sport’s greatest exponents, including recent former world champion Tony Bellew and former British and Commonwealth champion David Price.But few people would associate Liverpool with cricket.Chance to Shine, the sports charity whose mission is to “spread the power of cricket throughout schools and communities” is hoping to change that. With the help of NatWest – with which it has formed a formidable, multi-year partnership – it aims to reintroduce cricket to inner-city state schools, and provide resources and facilities for underprivileged children to learn how to play the game. Since its inception, more than 3 million young people – half of whom are girls – have been given a chance to enjoy the sport. Some of those who were introduced to cricket through the charity have gone on to play on the national stage and even faced international Test teams.Chance to Shine currently runs three projects in Liverpool – the largest in the Anfield area, with smaller cricket training clubs in Toxteth and Dingle.“Liverpool isn’t known as a cricket city,” says Sam Goodall-Walker, a league coach on the Lancashire Cricket Board and a lead coach on the Chance to Shine project in Liverpool. “One of the challenges we face is to change the attitudes toward cricket in the city to show that anyone can come down, learn to play and be good at it.”Goodall-Walker has been a coach on the Chance to Shine project since 2013, during which time there have been a number of successes. “We ran a project in Anfield, in schools that didn’t have resources to play cricket, where nearly all the students hadn’t played before,” he says. “In the five years it’s been running, five students have started playing regular club cricket, and two students play cricket for the Lancashire district.”Of course, the successes aren’t just in getting young people to play competitively.“We work with young people who come from disadvantaged backgrounds,” says Goodall-Walker. “For example, we worked with one young man called Michael, who has dyspraxia, and there were times in his life when he felt really isolated and lacked confidence.”He goes on to say that it was the extra, specially tailored coaching that helps young men like Michael thrive at cricket. “Disability cricket training was the thing that really boosted his confidence and gave him the extra support and guidance he needed, and he is now playing senior-level cricket.”Goodall-Walker also says that the Chance to Shine cricket programme has the power to help young people arriving from other countries feel at home, and give them the opportunities to succeed.It’s not just boys benefitting from the Chance to Shine project in Liverpool either. “There’s around 30 girls who play cricket every week at our club,” says 15-year-old Charlotte Dunn, who plays at Wavetry cricket club. Dunn has been playing cricket for the past six years, and says that the enthusiasm of coaches, and the supportive environment means that “everyone, regardless of your background, where you’re from, whether you’re a boy or a girl, can learn and enjoy playing cricket”.Part of that supportive environment includes pairing younger players with older ones, who can act as role models and mentors. “I’ve been paired with people who are still in primary school, and showing them how to play can really boost their confidence,” she says. It’s that, combined with how “approachable the club and all its staff are,” which she says has made so many young women stick with the club. “The coaches will make sure everyone’s involved and that they’re having fun. The most important thing to them is that we’re having a good time.”Goodall-Walker says that while the project has achieved a great deal of success, there’s still “plenty more work to do”.“We have to be realistic if we want to survive in the long term,” he says. “We still want to work with schools to give them a chance to try out cricket, and we still want to work with youth clubs and community centres who want to try out new things ... but there has to be a bigger cultural change for cricket to get the same amount of support as football and other sports.”Part of that reluctance, he says, is because of how cricket – particularly in its longer formats – is perceived in working-class, urbanised areas of the city, where it is seen as “very traditional, and associated with middle-class white people”.“Attitudes toward cricket need to change,” he continues. “But that can only happen if the game adapts too. It needs to adapt to a society that moves faster, and can’t afford to spend a whole day playing and watching cricket. We need more variation in the kind of games offered to attract more people to the sport. There’s no reason why cricket needs to be so traditional or old-school. That’s what’s stopping it progressing and flourishing in places where there’s so much potential talent.”As a erse and inclusive sport, cricket truly has no boundaries, and NatWest think that’s worth protecting.

One 12-year-old chose a different path, and is now a graduate, cricket coach and teacherAt 12 years old Siraj Ali wasn’t a bad kid. But, like many of the young people he grew up with in the outskirts of Birmingham, he’d hang out on the street at night, sometimes get in trouble at school, and had anger management issues that could boil over.“The area that I come from, the crime rates are really high,” says Ali, a decade later. “In and outside school I was getting into a lot of trouble. I wasn’t being myself. I was being dragged into the wrong crowd.”Birmingham’s reputation for gang culture and the associated crimes – such as those involving knives and guns – is widely reported. In hindsight, Ali, now 22, reckons he was at risk of slipping into that “bad crowd” and that if things hadn’t changed he’d carry a criminal record by now and struggle to get a job.Thankfully, things did change – and in September 2017 he graduated from the University of Wolverhampton with a degree in sport, media, culture and development. He’s currently confident of being hired by a teaching agency and, perhaps most importantly for him, he’s teaching young people cricket at his local leisure centre, where he hopes he can help others negotiate the dangers of growing up in that neighbourhood.“If I hadn’t got involved in cricket something bad would have happened to me,” he says. “When I went to Street they just dragged me in another direction.”He’s referring to Chance to Shine Street, a charity that uses cricket as a means to build young people’s confidence, social skills and focus – while keeping them off the streets for a few hours a week. With the help of its official long-term partners, NatWest – who have a long history of supporting grassroots cricket to support communities and help make the game accessible to all – Chance to Shine Street has helped more than 38,000 youngsters since 2008. The broader Chance to Shine programme has introduced more than 3 million young people – half of whom are girls – to cricket since its inception.Now a coach with the organisation, Ali first encountered Street (as it’s generally known) as an angry 12-year-old. Invited along to a session by a local coach, he grew frustrated, smashed over the wickets and walked out. Luckily, both he and the coaching staff persevered. Ali went on to play around the country in his teens, continued playing for local T20 sides while at university, and is now dedicated to using cricket to help the kids coming of age in the Alum Rock and Saltley areas of Birmingham.“I’ve been coaching at the local leisure centre for four or five years now,” he says. “I enjoy the role because it’s challenging. With some of the kids you don’t know what’s going on at home or at school. But I always try to ask questions: ‘How are your studies? Are you getting into trouble? How are things at home?’”Ali, who coaches primary-school children as well as those in secondary school, reckons the key to Street’s power is the way cricket can help instil a sense of confidence in young people. “Street cricket is available for all kids, and it’s a fun and friendly environment,” he says. “These sessions are in areas where there isn’t much opportunity for kids, and they offer a chance for them to help themselves grow in many ways, such as in confidence. This is very important for kids – it can be very beneficial for them in their education.“When they play in a group, a big group of 13 or 14 kids, it’s a different crowd every time – one’s funny, one’s low on confidence, one’s very confident. They sit together, talk to each other, express how they feel and they become good friends. They work together like that. That’s the main key to our organisation – to help kids work together and get on and help each other.”Many of the young people he’s worked with over the past five years have gone on to a college education or university. The player-turned-coach attributes his ability to reach students to the fact that he’s been through the same things they’re going through the children can relate to him in a way they sometimes can’t to parents or teachers. “I understand them because I came from the same community and I’ve been through this all at a young age,” he says. “It’s all about understanding the kids and what they go through. Some of the children I have worked with are now playing for Warwickshire youth teams, so this is progress, and I will continue to help kids.”Mentoring is something Ali enjoys – and that influenced his choice of degree, which is focused on the development of young people. But it’s been a two-way street. At university, Ali found he was more confident than many of his peers, thanks to his time spent speaking to large groups of young people and working with people from across the charity and beyond.“When I first joined the street project as a coach, things were a lot different and I wasn’t confident leading sessions,” he says. “Coach Khaled worked with me and he started to review my performance. Week by week I was growing in confidence, and this confidence has been vital when I’ve had to make presentations at university or lead my group in front of the whole class. I am now a graduate and I am looking to continue to inspire kids and help them grow their passion for cricket and their education.”As a erse and inclusive sport, cricket truly has no boundaries, and NatWest think that’s worth protecting.

Will it lead to improved conditions for those forced to work for clothes vouchers instead of cash?Giulia Mensitieri takes little to no personal interest in clothes. So it is likely to have been an ugly surprise to the French fashion industry that her PhD – now a book entitled The Most Beautiful Job in the World – has opened up its secretive profession in such a dramatically public way. In France, the book’s findings – that fashion, the country’s second-biggest industry, exploits most of the creatives who work in it – were quickly picked up by the media when it was published earlier this year. The resulting headlines included: “The ruthless world of fashion” “Fashion’s dirty underside” and “An extremely wealthy industry founded on unpaid work”.The reality of fashion was illustrated by Mensitieri’s chance introduction, eight years ago, to her subject matter. She met “Mia”, a successful Italian stylist who had moved to Paris: “She was wearing Chanel shoes and carrying a Prada handbag, being flown across the world in business class. I never would have imagined that she was in the situation she was in.” Mia couldn’t afford to rent a room, so she was couch surfing at a friend’s house behind a screen in the kitchen. “Sometimes she had no money for her phone bill. She was eating McDonald’s every day. She never knew when she would be paid for a job and how much she would get. For example, for a week’s work, a very big luxury brand gave her a voucher for €5,000 (£4,500) to spend in their boutique.” True, Mia could have sold it (and, among hard-up fashion workers, there is a lively market in reselling luxury goods). But Mensitieri points out that working in fashion means being seen in a constantly updated uniform of beautiful, expensive clothes and accessories – paid for by vouchers such as the one Mia received instead of a salary. “This situation is nothing exceptional. Mia is just a paradigm of what is going on.”The book is lively from the start. Mensitieri’s analysis and case studies build up a fairly damning picture of her subject matter. One interviewee, a former fashion journalist at a glossy magazine, describes how she was dropped by her coterie of friends and colleagues one day. They just suddenly stopped taking her calls or responding to her emails. There was no explanation. “This is the violence everyone told me about,” says Mensitieri. “Once you’re out, you’re out.” There can be a trauma attached to such sudden ejection. “All your social relationships are in that world. They’re gone.” From being exceptional, now you have transgressed in some unmentionable way. Or, simply, you are not special enough any more. “Finding work in a new sector can be difficult because ‘normal’ people behave so differently from what you’re used to.” Finding a job can be difficult, coming from an industry that those on the outside tend to look down on as fluffy and lightweight.Mensitieri, an alumni of École des Hautes Études en Sciences Sociales, one of France’s elite grandes écoles, is in London to talk about her book, although it has not yet been translated into English. “I was a little bit scared when it came out,” she says, “because it’s quite a strong renunciation, even though that was not my goal. I’m an anthropologist, not a journalist.” The book’s salient claim is that, “when we think of exploitation in fashion we think of sweat shops abroad or sexual harassment of models. But that’s not what I was interested in. I was looking at the creative side: stylists, makeup artists, young designers, interns, assistants. What I really want to make clear is that exploitation exists at the very heart of the powerfully symbolic and economic centre of the maisons de couture the big luxury brands. But it is a different form of exploitation.” In some cases, also barely legal.Critics of the book complain that Mensitieri only interviewed 50 people for her analysis, all of them off the record. There are no statistics. Some took Karl Lagerfeld’s general view: “Fashion is a total injustice. It’s like that. And that’s it.” “But no one,” claims the author, “has said that what I’ve written isn’t true.”The big brands generally do not like the idea of an objective outsider meddling, but it seems that the people who work for them do. They have written to Mensitieri to say they had never considered themselves exploited before they read her book, wrapped up as they were in the industry’s glossy promise. “They say that, now they’ve read the book ... they began to see the big picture and little fragments of their own experiences,” says the author. “And once they understand the big picture, they can’t look at fashion and their job in fashion or themselves in the same way.”We meet at a London cafe where, I had read, staff are chosen for their looks and sex appeal. It is an example of the kind of social status that fashion is so good at conferring on those who work in it – in exchange, Mensitieri discovered, for not paying them enough, or at all. Or paying them in convoluted, unpredictable ways that cannot easily be turned into cash: an unexchangeable €1,000 voucher for a designer boutique, first-class flights to fashion shoots or accommodation in luxury hotels.“The message is, you don’t have to be paid because you are lucky to be there at all. Working in fashion is hyper socially validating, even if you’re unpaid. That’s an important point for me. Fashion presents itself as something exceptional, a world outside the ordinary,” she says. “There is a kind of confused denial of the norms of labour conditions. The dream that French fashion, especially, projects is that of a life of effortless luxury – mundane everyday facts of life such as working for a living, or indeed even money, are considered vulgar, taboo, even dirty subjects.“But is it really possible that France’s second most profitable industry after cars and before armaments – a €15bn industry – can be an exception in capitalism? To me, fashion is the very centre of contemporary capitalism – it upholds the old forms of exploitation factories in Bangladesh and so on – and the new, very modern forms which are more a kind of self-exploitation, a blurring of the line between your work and everything you are outside of work.”France’s fashion industry is intensely bound up with national identity. “Whoever does not visit Paris regularly will never truly be elegant,” Balzac wrote in 1830, and it is an image that the world’s centre of luxury shopping is keen to uphold. Louis Vuitton’s new flagship store, in Place Vendôme, for example, inhabits a building designed by Louis XIV’s favourite architect, Jules Hardouin-Mansart, who helped design the Palace of Versailles. To understand fashion’s reach and power, Mensitieri explains, look at the parade of designers President Emmanuel Macron invites to the Elysée palace. “The government is keenly aware of the industry’s economic and symbolic power,” she says. If the film Zoolander sums up the general public’s ideas about fashion in other countries, “In France, to say ‘I work in fashion’ is something extremely important.”To engage properly with her interviewees, Mensitieri had to learn the etiquette: “When to say ‘darling’, when to stay silent. Saying ‘no’ is uncool. ‘Yes’ can mean anything. And there is a kind of addiction to this adrenaline, this prestige, this idea of being exceptional. I talk in the book about ‘the jackpot’ – winner takes all. The economy of hope, I call it. ‘Maybe I will be next’, even though the statistics tell you it’s unlikely you will. Fashion is colonised by desirable projection. You are never present, because tomorrow will be better. It’s an addictive way of thinking.”Her interviewees talk a lot about personas and the need to invent one if they are to have any hope of success. A teetotal model describes how her agent told her to be more “rock’n’roll” – to wear leather jackets and to be seen in certain bars drinking beer. An assistant makeup artist describes the tantrums his very famous boss threw if his favourite green cotton wool buds were not laid out in a perfect square.“It starts in fashion school,” says Mensitieri. “The students there know they will be exploited but they don’t see themselves as exploited.”It is not just people working in fashion who might recognise themselves in these descriptions. It is a similar scene across all the creative industries and academia, says Mensitieri. She also makes a good comparison with the charity sector where, it is widely held, “doing good” is incompatible with being paid well.If her theory is true, does she think there is hope for reform? “If you want to change things, you have to look beyond fashion, or whatever industry you’re in, and talk to people in different fields who are working under the same conditions,” she says. “I’m not an optimistic person, but there are interesting things happening at the fringes. There is a strong anti-fashion movement in the UK and, in France, models are working together for better working conditions.” It’s advice that some people working in the fashion industry may not want to hear. “You need to start collaborating – which is an almost heretical thought in fashion. You need to stop thinking of yourself as special.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/65c8922d8a80c790a43bebc4e86abf4c83df014d/0_2266_4912_2948/master/4912.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e6b4ba75c3e0de364deeb17ad9647492","title":"barry keoghan american animals star interview","story":"Brought up in foster care, the Irish actor’s ability to charm and terrify has made him one of Hollywood’s most recognisable young faces – and he’s only just getting startedWhen Barry Keoghan was growing up in Dublin, he and his mates would find their way surreptitiously into the local cinema to try and watch films for free. “We used to sneak in, run upstairs, get chased. All that ‘young kid’ kind of thing.” Eventually his antics got him barred. Little did young Keoghan know, he notes now with a grin, that years later one of his films would receive a festival premiere in the very same cinema. “I was thinking, ‘What happens if I go to this premiere and I’m still barred? Would they let me in?’” He’s pleased to report that his ban has been lifted.Once sneaking into films, now starring in them, Keoghan has enjoyed a rapid rise. In the last year and half alone, the 25-year-old has landed a pivotal role in Christopher Nolan’s Dunkirk, as the local lad who smuggles himself aboard Mark Rylance’s boat to muck in with the evacuation, and utterly stole the show – from Colin Farrell and Nicole Kidman, no less – with his chillingly composed portrayal of a sadistic middle-America teen in The Killing of a Sacred Deer. He’s rattling off career landmarks at such speed that he’s already reached the “briefly abandon film for a prestige TV series” stage of his career, by signing up for a big-budget adaptation of post-apocalyptic graphic novel Y: The Last Man.It’s a state of affairs that Keoghan, who grew up in the inner-city Summerhill area of Dublin, is still trying to get his head around. For a sense of his bewilderment at where he’s ended up, look no further than a recent interview he did for an Irish chat show. As the host begins to introduce a clip from The Killing of a Sacred Deer, Keoghan interrupts him. “Is it the one where Nicole Kidman kisses me feet?” he asks, shaking his head in amazement.Alas, Keoghan’s latest film features no A-listers kissing his feet, but is no less compelling. Directed by British film-maker Bart Layton, American Animals tells the real-life story of four college students who attempted to steal a cache of valuable books from the Transylvania University library in Kentucky. Initially framed as a riotous caper, the film takes a sudden queasy turn when the heist gets under way and the have-a-go criminals realise they are disastrously out of their depth. Keoghan plays the informal leader of the group, Spencer Reinhard. A talented if directionless artist, Reinhard is convinced that a middle-class upbringing has left him without what Keoghan calls “that crisis, that experience” that will allow him to be creative. He devises the plan to rob the library – and then struggles with the implications. Keoghan has since met Reinhard and found him “easy-going but deeply regretful”. What did Reinhard make of him? “Oh, he sized me up all right!” Keoghan laughs. “I think he probably thought ‘I should have got a prettier lad’! All the lads are quite handsome looking. I think it’s the first time ever in a film that the real dudes are more handsome than the actors!”You suspect, he is doing himself a disservice. While it would be a stretch to call Keoghan leading-man handsome, he’s usually the first person you notice on screen. His eyes seem permanently narrowed, as if he is gauging everyone around him. It’s a look used to great effect in The Killing of a Sacred Deer, where his quizzical, detached air contrasts chillingly with the chaos he wreaks.Of course, in reality he is nothing like that. Sipping a Diet Coke at Somerset House in London, he is a cheeky, fidgety presence. At one point he apologises for his bad language while talking about the “headfuck” of auditions. When I tell him that it is fine for him to swear, he leans into the dictaphone and shouts “Fuck fuck fuck fuck!”Speaking to the , Keoghan’s Sacred Deer co-star Farrell says that this “exuberance and sense of excitable mischief” is just one aspect of a more complex personality. “My first impression of him was that he was a pure burst of Irish energy,” Farrell says. “He seemed young – but that was a miscalculation on my part. Before too long I got to know a little more about him and rather than younger than his years, he’s older, wiser, more experienced than them. He’s stepped between the pillars of tragic loss way more often than most twice his age and he’s done so with his head unbowed.”Keoghan’s route to mainstream recognition is a remarkable one. In the early 90s, heroin addiction was rife in Dublin. His mother died of an overdose, and Keoghan and his brother were placed in foster care. Over five years the pair were moved between 13 different homes, before eventually living with his grandmother. “Foster care was a big part of my life,” he says. “My mother dying of drugs is not easy for any kid. Anyone dying is not easy, but certainly not a mother. Me and my brother, we stuck together. The foster families were good to me and then my nanny took me in.”Keoghan began acting after answering a casting notice in a shop window for the Irish crime drama Between the Canals. That small role led him to begin studying at local workshop The Factory. “I’d mitch off school and go to this place to watch all of these films,” he says. “I’d watch Paul Newman and all these greats and I was like ‘Who are these?’ I was learning my craft by watching these old movies. I was getting educated and I didn’t even know it.”Growing up Keoghan wanted to be a footballer – his second cousin is the former Manchester United and Arsenal striker Frank Stapleton – or a boxer. Indeed, he still calls boxing “his dream” and was due to enter the ring for the first time at Ireland’s Celtic Box Cup last September before an injury put paid to his involvement. (Before the tournament he joked that he hoped the fight would “make his face better looking”.) Still, something about acting stuck.“I was looking for something, he says. “I was looking to mess around, to joke. And get paid! But on a deeper level, it was very therapeutic for me. I could be someone else. I think you get to release a few of your problems there through being another person.”His early roles cast him as a skittish delinquent: a Loyalist underling in Yann Demange’s Troubles-set thriller ’71, a slingshot-wielding traveller in Trespass Against Us, which starred Michael Fassbender, and most notoriously – for Irish viewers at least – “Wayne the cat killer” in TV mob saga LoveHate, a part that saw him machine gun down a moggie and prompted complaints to broadcaster RTÉ.He says he’s now wary of being stereotyped as “the weirdo”, and has begun seeking counter-intuitive roles, to “show people what I can do”. He wants to work with distinctive film-makers: Lenny Abrahamson, Paul Thomas Anderson (“If you are reading this Paul, will you pick up that phone there”, he shouts again into the dictaphone). He’s starting to take a long-term view of his acting career. Farrell is one of those helping Keoghan as his career progresses. “I love Barry. I think all the experiences he’s had in life would bury most of us. Certainly, I believe such struggle would place me in anger and destructiveness that is counter to what I’ve seen in him. He’s about creating. Just look up his CV and see who he’s worked with already, and the depth and mystery he’s brought to each role. He’s focused, driven and grateful, all alongside the natural talent he has.” Keoghan, in turn, says that Farrell is “looking out for him”.“He’s had his battles,” he says referring to Farrell’s past struggles with addiction, “and that’s why I really look up to him. He gave me a lot of advice. When you’re chatting with him, he’s genuine. It’s a hard thing to find in people. To sit and just be present with someone, even for two minutes. Colin has that.“I can’t believe I’m sitting here talking about how much Colin is a good friend,” he adds, laughing. “That stuff hits you. It’s just hit me now.”So it still hasn’t become normal to Keoghan?

The perky, brightly lit, undemandingly entertaining romantic comedy – once churned out by studios as optimum unisex viewing to ease an evening’s flirtation between two people still unsure of each other’s tastes? It was always a needlessly specific term – a horror film can be an effective prelude to a kiss, as can an austere arthouse experiment\u0026nbsp– but it’s one the industry once vigorously traded in, making box-office queens of Meg Ryan and Julia Roberts at its zenith.If you’re struggling to think of a 2018 Meg Ryan equivalent, that’s because Hollywood has rather lost heart in the date movie, along with most other forms of character-driven mainstream storytelling: amorous cinemagoers can make out against the crashing spectacle of superhero adventures instead, while frothy exceptions like Jon M Chu’s Crazy Rich Asians are hailed as special events.Yet a flurry of “return of the romcom” headlines has hit the entertainment media of late, and notwithstanding the success of Chu’s film, they aren’t being fuelled by cinema releases: rather, Netflix has been hailed as the genre’s saviour, after a run of slick romantic comedies that have popped up under their Netflix Originals banner. They haven’t all been hits, even by the debatable terms of what constitutes a hit in the figureless world of film streaming: The Kissing Booth has already become a punchline denoting the paltriest of the network’s creative instincts, while the perfectly pleasant gay teen romance Alex Strangelove played like an accidental Aldi knockoff of modest cinema success Love, Simon.Yet two such efforts – one released to Netflix in June, the other in late August – have achieved what few of the streaming giant’s more flashy attempts at multiplex movie-making (from Bright to Mute) managed: genuine pop-cultural interest. Set It Up and To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before, both sweet, light, high-concept romcoms that would easily have been in cinemas a decade ago, have swiftly become objects of mass internet affection, inspiring sundry dedicated tweets and memes and BuzzFeed tributes, and raising the celebrity stock of their adorable young stars. Following two harried corporate PAs who fancy themselves workplace cupids, Set It Up is essentially one extended meet-cute powered by the sparky, wholesome chemistry between Zoey Deutch and Glen Powell it’s amiable and a little thin,\u0026nbspbut was quickly tagged the year’s best romantic comedy in multiple outlets.They spoke too soon. Button-cute but also surprisingly complex and compassionate in its exploration of adolescent desire, To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before feels genuinely revelatory. Charting the tangled fallout when a shy teenage girl’s unsent juvenile love letters belatedly find their way to their recipients, it earns and even exceeds its now-mandatory John Hughes references. Its teenagers are vulnerably imperfect and inconsistent in ways that rarely survive the studio lacquer casually centred on a modern mixed-race household, it feels wholly made in 2018 without a hint of down-with-the-kids contrivance. It may well be the best Netflix Original to have first\u0026nbsppremiered on the platform,\u0026nbsprather than being snapped up at a festival.Netflix has more such projects lined up on their “coming soon” list – including Sierra Burgess Is a Loser, a high-school spin on Cyrano de Bergerac, the trailer for which is also tracking well on social media. It seems the network,\u0026nbspafter trying the genre blockbuster form with minimal success, has spotted a cheaper, more-needed gap in the market: the small, human commercial movies crowded out of\u0026nbspthe cinemas by franchised fantasy. The date movie lives on – but it’s now for those staying in, not going out.Avengers: Infinity War (Disney, 12)It feels about as endless as that title implies, but if you’ve stuck with Marvel’s sprawling superhero network thus far, this bulk-buy blockbuster is lumbering good value.Custody (Spirit, 15)Xavier Legrand’s terrific debut feature is the year’s most unexpected white-knuckler.What begins as a Kramer vs Kramer-style orce drama escalates into a startling exercise in human terror of fanatical jealousy and\u0026nbspparanoia.The Rape of Recy Taylor (Modern Films, 15)Nancy Buirski’s straightforward, lapel-grabbing documentary account\u0026nbspof horrifying sexual violence in the Jim Crow south slightly overdoes the emotive urging\u0026nbsp– its power needs no amplification – but it’s still hard to shake.How to Talk to Girls at Parties (Studiocanal, 15)A peculiar disappointment from\u0026nbspdirector John Cameron Mitchell,\u0026nbspthis adaptation of a Neil Gaiman short story merges sci-fi\u0026nbsppunk-era nostalgia and\u0026nbspshaggy Britcom\u0026nbspto hyper-quirky, oil-on-water effect."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8f982cfc679b36afc6f962172dd2169e23cea1b8/14_42_2535_1521/master/2535.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d52d7994e8ee99807c9f48d41b908cc0","title":"premier league 10 talking points from the weekends action","story":"Emery should change his tactics or his keeper, Sarri is getting his message across at Chelsea and it’s been a rough start for Burnley and West HamUnai Emery must have known the question was coming, and the answer, a bit like Petr Cech’s goalkeeping, was not wholly convincing. Arsenal’s manager was asked after their victory over Cardiff whether he is still confident that Cech, at the age of 36, can develop and adapt to the style of play that he is determined to introduce, namely passing the ball out from the back at every opportunity. Cech had looked uncomfortable with the ball at his feet against Manchester City, prompting the manager to be quizzed about whether he would turn to Bernd Leno, the new No 2 from Germany, and that debate is unlikely to go away after another afternoon that threatened to turn into an ordeal for Cech. Either Emery needs to change his tactics or his goalkeeper, because it is hard to see Cech turning into Ederson at this stage of his career. Stuart JamesThe penny has dropped at Chelsea. Maurizio Sarri’s desire for his players to swarm forward, pressing high and moving the ball at pace, has been impressed upon them over the head coach’s first seven weeks in charge and, as the majority of his squad depart on international duty and he concentrates on moving into a new home (his dog, Ciro, has now joined him as company), progress is evident. The players corrected their own shortcomings from the first half against Bournemouth. “We could have moved the ball quicker,” said Eden Hazard. “He doesn’t like it when we just keep the ball at the back. He wants it moving forward quicker, us pressing higher.” Eddie Howe’s side made that difficult, but the hosts prevailed to ensure ambitions for the campaign are lofty. “We want to be champions,” added the Belgian. First impressions are positive. Dominic FifieldThe Premier League’s two leading assist-makers are both left-backs. While one is not that much of a surprise (Manchester City’s Benjamin Mendy), the other is: José Holebas of Watford. The former Greece international delivered two sublime crosses from a free-kick and corner to bamboozle a shoddily organised Tottenham defence and take his season tally to four. From a defensive point of view, he also limited the influence of Kieran Trippier. The 34-year-old in many ways symbolises a mishmash of a squad with few household names but an identity founded on determination. That is credit to the work of Javi Gracia but also to Holebas’s own competitiveness, helping prove – for now at least given their propensity to drift in the second half of the season – that Watford’s “band of mercenaries” tag is unfair. James PiercyOne point from four games, only three goals scored and nine conceded for Sean Dyche’s Burnley, who are second-bottom going into the international break. This is not yet a crisis but lose at Wolves in a fortnight and the manager will have to start considering a Plan B, and expect to come under serious scrutiny regarding why the wheels are falling off. Dyche’s men barely threatened against a United side low on confidence. This is cause for alarm for the manager although post-match he exuded a calm that will be needed to turn their fortunes around. Burnley’s season started six weeks ago in the Europa League so there is no excuse for being under-prepared. They went out of Europe on Thursday to Olympiakos, so Dyche and his team can now concentrate on the Premier League. After their terrible start that may be for the best. Jamie JacksonWhen Richarlison picked up his daft red card at Bournemouth, the Everton support consoled themselves with the thought that he would only actually miss home games against Huddersfield and West Ham. The implication being that Everton might be able to win those games without him. Wrong. Huddersfield were livelier in attack than Everton, though that is not saying a great deal. No one had any inidual spark of creativity or productive understanding with teammates. Not Gylfi Sigurdsson, not Tom Davies, not Theo Walcott and not even Ademola Lookman when he was sent on in search of a winner. Everton should spend the international break introducing themselves to each other. West Ham will probably be doing the same, and a visit from the bottom club might be just what Everton need. Paul WilsonIt has not taken long for West Ham’s summer optimism to drain away. Despite spending £100m on nine new players, they have lost their opening four fixtures for the first time since 2010-11. Avram Grant took them down that year and that historical precedent means that the Premier League’s bottom side cannot be complacent about their awful start, even though Manuel Pellegrini insisted that it is too early to panic. “We cannot talk about relegation when we have just played four games,” West Ham’s manager said. But his team’s laboured performance against Wolves, who snatched the points when Adama Traoré punished Carlos Sánchez’s late howler, heightened the sense of foreboding. There was no drive in midfield or cohesion in attack and the suffering will continue if West Ham do not improve after the international break. Jacob SteinbergJames Maddison’s first season at Leicester is already going better than his first season at Norwich. After his move to Carrow Road from Coventry in 2016, great things were expected, but he made only three appearances for the Canaries and ended up on loan to Aberdeen. Attitude issues were a concern but the following summer he knuckled down, and last season became the best No 10 in the Championship. He already looks at home in the Premier League, that early arrogance tempered by something closer to healthy confidence, which he showed against Liverpool. Not everything he tried worked but the key was that he kept trying. The best players have an ability to forget previous mistakes, so their heads are clear for the next time. Maddison might not be among the best just yet but he does appear to have that quality. Leicester have a gem. Nick MillerThe time when he was being touted for an England place is surely now passed but Glenn Murray continues to be a beacon of hope for strikers toiling away in the lower isions. The player who started his career bouncing between the likes of Workington, Wilmington Hammerheads, Barrow, Carlisle, Stockport and Rochdale only seems to be improving as his 35th birthday approaches. His two goals rescued a lost cause against Fulham. The first came after a typically intelligent run and cool finish, while the second saw him assume penalty responsibilities after Pascal Gross had missed Brighton’s earlier spot-kick. Where Gross failed through trying to be too clever by half, Murray, faithfully upholding the unpretentious values of the workhorse lower-league centre-forward, simply thrashed the ball into the net. John BrewinCrystal Palace came down to earth with a bump. The composed, athletic football that had steered them clear of relegation last season was strikingly absent (actually, it was being played by Southampton). Instead there was uncertainty and a lack of determination. It’s not that Palace were bad, but they received a reminder that they cannot expect to win if they are at something other than their best. “People are building us up, I don’t want to be built up,” was the way Roy Hodgson put it. “I still think we’re one of those teams that will have to be looking over our shoulder.” With a small squad, largely reinforced with rejects from other clubs, Palace do not have many options other than those available on Saturday. A fit Wilfried Zaha is a must, of course, but others will have to step up too. A goal from Christian Benteke would be nice. Paul MacInnesWhether or not you feel the backs-to-the-wall tactics Rafa Benítez has employed during Newcastle’s fiendish start to the season are a bit much, a point of agreement must be that he is doing a superhuman job in holding everything together. His players are certainly on board. “This is the manager’s idea but we all back him and believe in him,” Mohamed Diamé said after the 2-1 defeat at Manchester City. It was interesting to hear Benítez talk about the extra responsibility their current plight piles onto those in his position. “Because I was on both sides, I know how important the manager is for these teams,” he said, comparing the difficult spell he endured managing minnows Extremadura with the comparative ease of passing on instructions at Real Madrid. His task at Newcastle bears a closer resemblance to the former.

With a national fertility crisis mushrooming, and our status as a global leader in scientific breakthroughs threatened, there has never been a worse time for Britain to be shut out of the sperm\u0026nbsploop.As a diehard Remoaner, the troubling statistics piqued my interest. Perhaps I could exploit them to criticise Brexit? After a little late-night Googling at my laptop, I realised that, typically of overworked journalists who can no longer afford to cover anything in real depth, the Observer’s Andrew Rawnsley had only scratched the surface of the Danish semen story. The sperm crisis ran far deeper than even Rawnsley imagined and over the last week I have become the Carole Cadwalladr of sperm.It’s not a coincidence that, in 1969, liberal Denmark became the first country to legalise pornography, including with animals (nb it’s banned now). The vast proliferation of sexually stimulating material available, from everyday vanilla through to the strongest chocolate andor strawberry flavoured imagery, soon made the cake- and Lego-loving land the international capital of\u0026nbsponanism.Indeed, throughout Scandinavia, the act of solo sexual gratification is still euphemistically known as “going for a Danish” (in Swedish, “går till en Danska”, in Norwegian “går til en Dansk” and in Finnish “menee tanskaksi”).To give you some idea how deeply the notion of the Danes as lonely self-pleasers is embedded in Scandinavian culture, the popular 1970s Swedish satire show Pappa Olaf’s Karneval Av Idioter included a famous sketch, voted the funniest joke of all time in a recent Swedish poll, where a foolish Norwegian visitor to London becomes angry when he is offered a Danish pastry by an effeminate cockney baker.At first, commercial Danish sperm production was a small-scale affair. In the 70s and 80s, Danish sperm, packed in heavy, thick glass test tubes, was most commonly used as a mildly profitable ballast in the hold of their cargo ships. These Danish “semen-både”, as they were known in the shipping industry, mainly carried more profitable Danish products such as bacon and fish bits to Europe, the semen subsequently sold on to collectors and enthusiasts for minimal return once the more commercial products had been disposed of.But it was inevitable, as even the socialist Scandinavian states fell under the spell of the capitalist doctrines of Reaganomics and Thatcherism, that sooner or later the great national Danish pastime would be monetised. By the end of the 80s, Denmark was the unchallenged world leader in the business of commercial human sperm production. The Danish “sperm-salg” industry became a major concern, swiftly nationalised under the Dansk Sperm-Salg I Hele Verden banner and employing tens of thousands of men in the manufacturing process.Hans Thrigger Andersen is a wiry 50-year-old who enjoys the life of a comfortable flâneur and he FaceTimed me from the jazzy countercultural enclave of Aarhus on the Jutland peninsula. It was easy to understand why Hans’s sperm donor directory profile pictures have, over the years, seen millions of British couples clamour\u0026nbspfor his sperm above that of most other Danish\u0026nbspdonors.As a younger man, Hans, who is one of a small handful of full-time sperm-donating Danes, had the hard-rock angel good looks of Chris Hemsworth’s Thor, and he’s aged to sport the same rugged Viking charisma evidenced by the Canadian standup comedian and woodcutter Tony Law. It’s a ludicrous coincidence that Hans’s parents met in 1968 at an early Aarhus performance by Pekka Airaksinen’s experimental Finnish band Sperm, and conceived him that very night, but he dismisses any idea of environmental determinism as deftly as he evades my attempts to inculcate him into the second referendum narrative.Despite the damage it will do to his livelihood and lifestyle, Hans is an unlikely champion of Brexit. “Listen, I have spent my life lying on my back like a lazy hog. Brexit will force me to make something of myself. Same as maybe it will for Britain. The kitten is out of its sack, man. You make nothing and you can’t feed yourselves and all your fruit is picked by Latvians. Sure, in the short term, we are both taking a heavy cash hit, but maybe Brexit will make us get our shit together.”I tried to press Hans further on exactly what he meant but he had a daily quota to meet. In the short time we spoke, the tired Dane had already given me food for thought. If a man whose precarious lifestyle, predicated as it is on an endless cycle of continual self-abuse, can rationalise the destruction Brexit will wreak on his career as an opportunity for self-improvement, maybe it’s time for all of us here in Britain too to move on and embrace the no-deal uncertainty as a chance for a new\u0026nbspbeginning."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/81dcf15c4d06ee7c6d5eb2b47f451c03b4441bbb/0_0_4623_2774/master/4623.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a7538a0e13bef8ac84b6ac89ad566563","title":"seven ways to help avoid dementia","story":"One in 14 people over the age of 65 in the UK will develop dementia and while there is no cure, scientific evidence shows there are several ways you can guard against it Among the biggest risk factors for dementia are diabetes and mid-life obesity, which can double your chances of dementia at a later age. Links have also been found between elevated blood pressure, high cholesterol levels and the risk of dementia, although these are not conclusive. Monitoring your weight and cardiovascular health in middle age could greatly reduce your likelihood of dementia.The brain may be affected by the long-term consequences of heavy smoking. Scientists have found smoking to increase the risk of cognitive decline in old age, with one study showing that middle-aged people who smoked more than two packs a day more than doubled their risk of later-life dementia.Numerous studies have shown that regular, vigorous physical activity - and in some cases, even mild exercise such as walking - can preserve your faculties in later life. Staying active is particularly important for the elderly, with studies finding that older iniduals who began a regular exercise programme experienced improved cognitive function. However, younger people should avoid sports where they are prone to repeated head traumas, such as boxing or even football. There is growing evidence that even moderate traumas increase the risk of developing certain forms of dementia.People with more years of school and university education are known to have a lower risk of dementia, but there is evidence that everyone can reduce their risk of dementia through trying new things as they get older. Taking up new hobbies, learning new skills and partaking in a daily intellectual activity such as doing crossword puzzles are all thought to have neuroprotective effects.Maintaining social activities as you get older, such as going to clubs or volunteering, has been found to have a protective effect against dementia. Studies have shown that iniduals who maintain a larger social network into old age tend to have better cognitive functions and a reduced risk of cognitive decline.Scientists are still not completely clear on how various nutrients, vitamins and food groups affect your risk of dementia. However, there have been a few studies focusing on the Mediterranean diet – which consists of small amounts of meat, and an emphasis on whole grains, fruits, vegetables, fish, nuts and olive oil – that suggest it can reduce risk of dementia, possibly by preventing high blood pressure.Sleep disturbances, for example chronic insomnia, have been linked to increased risk for cognitive decline in later life. Taking steps to deal with any sleep problems could reduce your chances of getting dementia. However scientists still don’t understand exactly how disturbed sleep may contribute to the condition, and whether certain dysfunctional sleep patterns pose more of a risk than others."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c07e9e2aeec171edd7d641181f75e59bb2525f5b/0_547_5315_3189/master/5315.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=47ca1ba81d97165d23d7b08b7d9dc34c","title":"price loft space above flat freeholder surveyor valuation","story":"The freeholder has rejected a surveyor’s valuation and seems to be taking advantage of usQ My husband and I jointly own a one-bedroom flat in Greater London on a long lease.

It offered them a way to shape Labour’s future.“This is about staying and fighting for our party. That is in no way meant as fighting against anything within it,” Kinnock said. “The one thing that does unite us all is a desire to win elections, to form a government and to change the country. Drifting back to the liberal centre would be a fatal error, we are not in 1997 any more. Drifting to the hard left, with a conspiracy driven view of the world, is also a fatal error. This is an offer to get back to a principled debate about what we can offer.”Kinnock, the MP for Aberavon, said there were “two dominant tribes shaping 21st century Britain” – communitarians and cosmopolitans. The assessment mirrored that of the journalist David Goodhart who categorised the new ide as between “somewheres” and “anywheres”.The MP said it was time for the party to accept the assessment that it had still concentrated too much on cosmopolitans – liberal, educated, middle-class voters comfortable with globalisation – at the expense of communitarians, whose values were “rooted in community” and who “valued security over personal liberty”.Kinnock said he saw the departure last week of the Labour MP Frank Field – a staunch supporter of Brexit, who advocated a tougher approach to migration, coupled with long-running campaigning on low pay and welfare – as a sign the party was losing touch with some of those values.The book co-authored by Kinnock, entitled Spirit of Britain, Purpose of Labour, argues that both New Labour and the party under Jeremy Corbyn have “almost exclusively cosmopolitan politics” and calls that position “electorally and morally bankrupt”.Kinnock started the project with his co-author, Joe Jervis, after the EU referendum. He said the “deeply ided, polarised, country” had been thrown into sharp relief by the referendum, and then in the 2017 election it could be seen how much those ides were entrenched.Kinnock said the shift in Labour’s approach was needed not just to secure an election victory, but to win a convincing majority and keep Labour in power for several election cycles.He said in 2017 that there had been a swing against Labour in 130 constituencies, the vast majority of which had voted leave.Most MPs who have contributed to the book are from areas which voted leave in the 2016 referendum, though one of the chapters on security has been written by Will Straw, former head of the Stronger In campaign.Turley, the Labour and Co-operative MP for Redcar, who co-authored a chapter on regional growth, said there was much the party could build on, including its 2017 commitments concerning zero-hours contracts, as well as the Build it in Britain campaign about manufacturing.“Jeremy captures some of this really well,” she said. “However, on defence, national security and crime we are not articulating as well as we could be.”Kinnock said the party had to get its patriotism across convincingly. “Vitally, we are patriots, we believe the nation state is a force for good,” he said.He said the Labour leader could do more to speak convincingly on that subject over the coming months. “People have to believe that Corbyn does not have an anti-west view of the world, that he doesn’t only see our history as one of colonialism and imperialism and nothing else. There is also a perception that we want to centralise and nationalise everything, when people want to see power and control coming back to local communities.”Kinnock stressed he did not want the book to be seen as a challenge to Corbyn’s leadership. “This is meant as a vision that will help to solve a problem the party has – that we have not won a general election since 2005.”Jarvis, the Barnsley Central MP, who is also mayor for the Sheffield city region, said he intended his contribution on skills, education and automation to be seen as “the hard yards of opposition” in order to prepare a comprehensive offer for the next election.“At the next election the general consensus among the population will be that Labour has a good chance of winning,” he said. “There has to be a relentless focus on improving it and moving forward. This is a contribution to that process.”Kinnock said there was not a consensus among the authors about what should happen over the next six months: he favoured an EEA-style deal, Mills favoured exiting both the single market and customs union, and Turley had backed a second referendum on the deal.Turley said she hoped an adoption of some of the values and ideas advocated in the book could act as a guide to navigating the Brexit process. “One thing we do agree on is that the underlying factors that drove this vote are still there,” she said. “We have to tackle them, and the power to do that lies with Westminster.”Others who contributed to the book included the MPs Emma Reynolds and Steve Reed, the former MP John Denham, and the broadcaster and John Lewis president, Trevor Phillips, who has written a chapter on Labour and business."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0377e57fc90b1dd1dfb6c2fcfc438b9a22985f5a/0_150_5108_3064/master/5108.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=049b308677d57bfe077b79b8110951bc","title":"scientists hunt for dark force to discover what the universe is made of","story":"Physicists say a fifth force of nature would ‘completely change the paradigm’Scientists are about to launch an ambitious search for a “dark force” of nature which, if found, would open the door to a realm of the universe that lies hidden from view.The hunt will seek evidence for a new fundamental force that forms a bridge between the ordinary matter of the world around us and the invisible “dark sector” that is said to make up the vast majority of the cosmos.Physicists, to date, know of only four basic forces of nature. The electromagnetic force allows for vision and mobile phone calls, but also stops us falling through our chairs. Without the so-called strong force, the innards of atoms would fall apart. The weak force operates in radiation, and gravity – the most pervasive of nature’s forces – keeps our feet rooted to the ground.But there may be other forces that have gone unnoticed. These would shape the behaviour of the so far unknown particles that constitute dark matter, and could potentially exert the most subtle effects on the forces we are more familiar with.This month, Raggi and his colleagues will turn on an instrument at the National Institute of Nuclear Physics near Rome which is designed to hunt down a possible fifth force of nature. Known as Padme, for Positron Annihilation into Dark Matter Experiment, the machine will record what happens when a diamond wafer a tenth of a millimetre thick is blasted with a stream of antimatter particles called positrons.When positrons slam into the diamond wafer, they immediately merge with electrons and vanish in a faint burst of energy. Normally, the energy released is in the form of two particles of light called photons. But if a fifth force exists in nature, something different will happen. Instead of producing two visible photons, the collisions will occasionally release only one, alongside a so-called “dark photon”. This curious, hypothetical particle is the dark sector’s equivalent of a particle of light. It carries the equivalent of a dark electromagnetic force.Unlike normal particles of light, any dark photons produced in Padme will be invisible to the instrument’s detector. But by comparing the energy and direction of the positrons fired in, with whatever comes out, scientists can tell if an invisible particle has been created and work out its mass. Though normal photons are massless, dark photons are not, and Padme will search for those up to 50 times heavier than an electron.The dark photon, if it exists, would have an imperceptible influence on what makes up the world we see. But knowing its mass, and the kinds of particles it can break down into, would provide the first glimpse of what makes up the bulk of the universe that is beyond our perception.The Padme experiment will run until at least the end of the year, but there are tentative plans to move the instrument to Cornell University in 2021. There it would be hooked up to a more powerful particle accelerator than in Italy to broaden its search for dark photons.Other laboratories around the world are also looking for dark photons. Bryan McKinnon, a research fellow at Glasgow University, is involved in the search for the particle at the Thomas Jefferson national accelerator facility in Virginia. “The dark photon, if it exists, is effectively a portal,” he said. “It lets us peer into the dark sector to see what is happening. It won’t open the floodgates, but it will allow us to have a little look.”Physicists have little idea how complex the dark sector might be. There may be no new forces to discover. Dark matter itself may be shaped by gravity alone and made up of only one type of particle. But it may be a far richer realm, where new kinds of invisible particles and forces wait to be found.According to McKinnon, the very fact that modern theories leave room for exotic particles like dark photons means that physicists feel compelled to search for them. “It would definitely be a huge thing in physics if some evidence of a dark sector was found,” he said. “Right now, it’s labelled as such because it’s the stuff we don’t understand. If a door can be opened, what will come out? That’s guesswork right now.”Since the discovery of the Higgs boson at the Large Hadron Collider near Geneva in 2012, particle physicists have had little to get excited about. But the dearth of new findings from major facilities has boosted efforts at smaller labs to perform long-shot experiments with potentially huge pay-offs. What are the odds that Padme will find a fifth force? “We are shooting in the dark in every sense,” said Raggi. “But if you are shooting, you at least have a chance.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/331fd57b5aff98fd101ecd3e1e336dcda833eda5/801_658_2567_1541/master/2567.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=316b7cf83d75257e2b3c060691c34117","title":"women tiny minority financial services firm partners","story":"Despite pushes for a change in culture, data shows progress towards equality is slowFewer than one in seven partners at hedge funds and private equity firms are women, and progress towards equality is slow. Nicky Morgan, the chair of the Treasury committee, said greater gender ersity led to “better financial performance, reduced groupthink and more open discussions”.“The women in finance charter has been effective at raising awareness on gender ersity, but as this sluggish progress shows, there is still a considerable way to go,” she said. “As the Treasury committee’s report on women in finance concluded, one of the next steps must be for firms to set out how they will support the progression of women.“Firms should focus on changing the culture in financial services firms, which remains a deterrent for women, especially the bonus culture.”Most firms in the sector are too small to be covered by the gender pay gap reporting rules that were introduced this year, while the UK pay gap reporting rules do not cover partners, said Dean Fuller, a partner at the law firm Fox \u0026amp Partners, which released the data on equality.“Raised awareness of workplace discrimination means that firms need to consider what they can do to redress the balance,” he said. “These figures show that efforts to increase ersity have not gone far enough. Historically, private equity firms and hedge funds have been male-dominated, and there has been little progress made on increasing ersity over the past five years.”Fox \u0026amp Partners warned private equity firms and hedge funds that a lack of ersity in the workforce exposed them to legal risks. A group of women recently filed a class action suit against Goldman Sachs in the US, accusing the firm of discriminating against them in promotions, pay, and performance reviews.Fuller said smaller private equity firms recruited mainly through their own networks as many did not have significant HR departments, and that reduced the potential pool of candidates.“While recruiting beyond immediate contacts can be more expensive, having a erse employee group is likely to be a significant benefit in the long run.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/14303098421ac4e0e80adbdb73e5854e80fbb15e/0_41_2739_1643/master/2739.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b21b6d20dde283d8da30ef2a89e9db3c","title":"england captain joe root we can go from strength to strength","story":"• Series victory over India lifts Root into a ‘really exciting time’ • ‘I’ve a real clear vision of how I see us improving long-term’Joe Root described his side’s newly secured series victory over India, the world’s No 1 Test side, as the finest of his captaincy to date and believes his vision for England is starting to take shape as his authority grows over time.The path to an unassailable 3-1 lead, secured by the 60-run victory in Southampton, has been curious to say the least, coming in spite of continuing issues within an unstable batting order but thanks to an impressive showing from the all-rounders and bowlers.“We’ve got some guys who are very willing to buy into that, and are very realistic and understanding of where we currently are and where we could really get to.

By its close he stood atop the podium telling the partisan and booing crowd how he had revelled in drawing energy from their negativity. His positive spin was entirely understandable from a win that had looked almost unthinkable when he took to the grid until he put in what he said was “up there” with his greatest drives.The elation with which he leaves Monza was in stark contrast to the visible deflation of the massed tifosi but Hamilton will take away so much more having delivered an absolutely stinging blow to Sebastian Vettel.His victory hinged on three decisive moments of overtaking and a peerless, ruthless piece of strategy from his Mercedes team. Vettel, who finished fourth and now trails Hamilton by 30 points in the title race, was involved only once and his misjudgment cost him any chance of the win and may have derailed his championship challenge. For the fourth time this season he made an error under pressure.The Ferraris had been quickest all weekend and Hamilton had acknowledged the task. He started from third on the grid, behind Kimi Räikkönen, on pole, who was ultimately second, and Vettel. The three were clean together through the first chicane but Hamilton took a tow through the Lesmos and was able to go round the outside of Vettel into the Roggia chicane. Hamilton left him room but the German took too much kerb and chose not to back off and concede the place. They touched and Vettel spun, sending him back to 18th. Just as in Baku, France and Germany a single incident proved costly.Shortly afterwards the second key moment could not have been more apposite. After a short safety car period Hamilton overtook Räikkönen on the start-finish straight but gloriously the Finn hit back immediately , coming back round the outside of Roggia with a great piece of late braking to retake the lead. It was exactly as Hamilton had done to Vettel but this time with both drivers exiting the chicane cleanly.Finally, after Mercedes had kept Hamilton out for a long time so he had fresher tyres at the end and had used Valtteri Bottas, who finished third, to hold Räikkönen up on track, the battle for the lead fell to the British driver as he pulled off an inch-perfect pass on the Finn round the outside through the Retifillo chicane with eight laps to go. It was enough to secure victory, albeit once again to the disappointment of the tifosi.It had been against the odds and against the head. Ferrari have enjoyed a pace advantage since the British Grand Prix. Asked afterwards if it was one of his greatest drives, Hamilton believed it was. “Under the sheer pressure that we are under I definitely will consider it to be quite far up there,” he said. “Especially to do it on Ferrari’s home turf as well, with such a difficult crowd and so much pressure on the team with the performance that they have, to really be able to pull a little bit more out of the bag and really make it stick.”Vettel made an admirable comeback through the field, battling a damaged car, but insisted he had not been at fault. “I guess Lewis saw his chance but he didn’t leave me any room,” he said. “So I got spun around and couldn’t avoid what happened.”1 Lewis Hamilton (GB) Mercedes 1hr 16min 54.484sec 2 Kimi Räikkönen (Fin) Ferrari 1:17:03.189 3 Valtteri Bottas (Fin) Mercedes 1:17:08.550 4 Sebastian Vettel (Ger) Ferrari 1:17:10.635 5 Max Verstappen (Neth) Red Bull 1:17:12.692 6 Romain Grosjean (Fr) Haas 1:17:50.804 7 Esteban Ocon (Fr) Force India 1:17:52.245 8 Sergio Perez (Mex) Force India 1:17:53.162 9 Carlos Sainz (Sp) Renault 1:18:12.624 10 Lance Stroll (Can) Williams at 1 Lap 11 Sergey Sirotkin (Rus) Williams at 1 Lap 12 Charles Leclerc (Mon) Sauber at 1 Lap 13 Stoffel Vandoorne (Bel) McLaren at 1 Lap 14 Nico Hülkenberg (Ger) Renault at 1 Lap 15 Pierre Gasly (Fr) Toro Rosso at 1 Lap 16 Marcus Ericsson (Swe) Sauber at 1 Lap 17 Kevin Magnussen (Den) Haas at 1 Lap.Fastest Lap: Kimi Räikkönen 1min 23.515sec on Lap 28.Yet his argument feels thin. Hamilton pointedly noted that he and Räikkönen had engaged in an identical exchange successfully. “It was a racing move, the same manoeuvre that Kimi did to me,” he said. “We are supposed to be racing and I left him space.”His racecraft is in possibly the best form of his career but Mercedes also managed his race with precision. They have been guilty of poor calls this season but in the intensity of Monza there were cool heads. They thought well on their feet regarding the stops as the race evolved and their use of Bottas was as successful as it was clinical. Ferrari, in contrast, may consider they might have been better served giving Vettel the best shot at pole on Saturday, which may have seen him away from Hamilton’s clutches on the opening lap.For the British driver, however, his remarkable run at Monza continues, with his fifth win here, equalling Michael Schumacher. The German scored all his for Ferrari, whose fans continue to wait for a driver to return such heady days to the temple of speed. But for Hamilton it is a win that bodes only well. The last three occasions he has won in Italy, he has gone on to take the championship.Max Verstappen in the Red Bull was in fifth. The Haas of Romain Grosjean was in sixth, in front of the two Force India’s of Esteban Ocon and Sergio Pérez. Carlos Sainz in the Renault was in ninth with the Williams of Lance Stroll scoring his team’s second top ten finish of the season in tenth. Daniel Ricciardo was forced to retire with what appeared to be another engine failure on lap 25.After a protest by Renault the floor of Romain Grosjean’s Haas was found to not be in compliance with regulations and he was disqualified. Which means Haas return to fifth behind Renault in the constructors’ championship and Williams’ Sergey Sirotkin is awarded tenth place."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4d10636ff7b6d72088cbe0f38956020a9e288aa7/16_40_2529_1518/master/2529.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=16030464baed1913351d6d933b47787b","title":"rugby union talking points premiership opening weekend","story":"New signings Danny Cipriani and Dan Biggar faced off, Will Skelton impressed for Saracens and Worcester ran Wasps closeThere are plenty of high-profile fixtures heading to Newcastle over the next 12 months, with the city to host this season’s European Champions Cup final and England’s final warm-up game prior to the 2019 Rugby World Cup, which will be confirmed this week for a Friday night at St James’ Park. There are currently only around 10,000 public tickets left for the European showpiece next May, which Saracens will be hoping involves another trip to Tyneside for them. If their Australian forward Will Skelton, who has slimmed down by 15kg since the end of last season, can maintain the promising form he showed in Sarries’ bonus-point win at Kingston Park, it will do the north Londoners’ prospects no harm. Robert KitsonRob Baxter has always been an admirer of Matt Kvesic. He tried to sign him a few years ago, but the flanker chose Gloucester. Now the Exeter director of rugby has had his man for a season, and showed off the revamped version to great effect. Baxter reckons he had become too fixated on the defensive aspects of his game, but the reason he had wanted him was as much for his attacking prowess, which now looks as if it has been rekindled. Much more of this, and he will join a host of younger men who might appeal to England as conforming to the conventional model of a “seven”. Michael AywlinTwo international fly-halves made their competitive debuts for their new clubs and in their markedly different ways, Danny Cipriani and Dan Biggar will be pivotal if Gloucester and Northampton are to break into the top four. Cipriani has sometimes been tagged as too inidual for a team sport, but he is calculating rather than impetuous, and if he occasionally flits to the margins of a gameplan, he is always mindful of it. It is not so much that opponents do not know what he is going to do but more, at crucial times, that they cannot stop him. He measures his involvement in a match, unlike Biggar who likes to be at the centre of events. Cipriani profited from the dominant pack on Saturday and his ability to create space was the catalyst for his side’s two tries. Biggar will have more fulfilling afternoons for the Saints, but standing flat rather than deep, kicking the ball less than Cipriani despite touching it more, he was the eyes of his side’s new attacking ambition. Paul ReesPlenty about Worcester’s 21-20 defeat beyond the final scoreline will have given pause for thought among the other Premiership clubs and the pundits who almost universally tipped them for the drop. The hosts caused Wasps a raft of problems, much of it stemming from their Springbok-Scottish half-back combination of Francois Hougaard and Duncan Weir. Having established a rapid 13-0 lead, Worcester did not go behind until the 69th minute and could still have clawed it back when a late Weir drop-goal went wide. Wasps, who stuttered in the early part of last season, will be relieved to get the win and eager to put in their southern hemisphere signings, Brad Shields and Lima Sopoaga, sooner rather than later. Claire TolleyMarcus Smith believes a summer spent at the world under-20 championship rather than with England in South Africa is behind his blistering start to the season after scoring 26 points against Sale to ensure Paul Gustard’s reign at Harlequins began with a bang. The 19-year-old is well known to Gustard having been included as an apprentice in a number of Eddie Jones’s senior squads, but was overlooked for the South Africa tour, instead helping England’s Under-20s to the final in France. “I learned a lot from that experience,” said Smith. “I learned how to take control and try and lead a team, and I tried to take what I learned from the seniors experience into that World Cup. I want to add a bit of control to my game. It’s every kid’s dream to play for England but I need to let my performances do the talking here and hopefully get Eddie calling me.” Gerard MeagherThere was no London double-header at Twickenham this year but those in charge of the new Gallagher Premiership could not have wished for a more stimulating way to launch the season. While Bath were disappointing, the occasion was first class and the appetite for big-time rugby in Bristol has been gloriously refreshed. If Stephen Luatua, George Smith, Ian Madigan and Luke Morahan can sustain their opening-night form the Bears will not just be good to watch but will ask questions of most visitors to Ashton Gate. Bath, surely, will not be as sluggish in this weekend’s clash with another rising West Country force, Gloucester. One early setback does not automatically define a season but they will have to sharpen up considerably, not least at half-back, to avoid another chastening derby experience.

Who’s next? A French marathon man and an Austrian politico among othersSusanne Kennedy turns actors into avatars and makes human life seem alien. On her candy-coloured stages, masked figures glitch and glide like animatronics. Instead of speaking, they lip-sync along to recorded, distorted dialogue.Yet her shows mostly sit in banal, suburban settings. She turned the small-town Bavarians of Marieluise Fleißer’s 1924 play Purgatory in Ingolstadt into pallid zombies, and made a mannequin of Fassbinder and Fengler’s Herr R, the petit-bourgeois conformist who ultimately cracks. For Jeffrey Eugenides’ The Virgin Suicides, her teenage girls were flowered idols on a stage caught between shrine and shopping mall. Kennedy’s dislocated style exposes the emptiness of neoliberal life. Her shows loop round in circles as if stuck on repeat.Born in Friedrichshafen, Kennedy began her career in Dutch theatre, directing Sarah Kane and, tellingly, Enda Walsh, but was hailed as a significant voice on returning to Germany in 2009. She had two shows selected for consecutive Theatertreffen festivals and joined Chris Dercon’s directorial team at the Volksbühne – the first theatremaker in his cross-disciplinary programme.The move made sense. Her theatre borders on installation. “I see a theatre where the voice no longer belongs to the body, the face is no longer the conveyor of emotion,” she has written. “In the end, the actor becomes imperceptible.”Julien Gosselin goes long. His four-hour adaptation of Michel Houellebecq’s novel The Elementary Particles was dwarfed by a 12-hour stage version of Roberto Bolaño’s unfinished epic 2666. No bother: Gosselin’s swaggering style staves off longueurs, marrying pop sensibility with a keen self-awareness.His latest marathon, which premiered in Avignon last month, mashed up three Don DeLillo novels – Players, Mao II and The Names – to track the evolution of terrorism over 10 hours. It was exhilarating: the offspring of Ivo van Hove’s exhaustive stage adaptations and Katie Mitchell’s live films. Starting on a closed set, the action only visible on a big screen, it allowed terror groups to tear apart a toy world. The stage opened up, the cinematography grew glossier, terror became part of the picture.On graduating from Lille’s Théâtre du Nord school, Gosselin set up a collective, If only you could lick my heart. Its debut was documentary theatre: Fausto Paravidino’s interrogation of a protestor’s death at the 2001 G8 summit, Genoa ’01. But the company immediately swerved into surrealism with Anja Hilling’s play about six friends caught in a forest fire, Black Animal Sadness. Gosselin swamped the whole stage with smoke. At 26, he became the youngest director invited to the Avignon festival and, if critics cocked a snook at his Houellebecq, audiences took Gosselin’s verve to heart straight away. Next year, there’s more DeLillo: Falling Man, the story of a 911 survivor, opens in Amsterdam in March. Eight Romany actors stand on stage in Rome, all in white, and proclaim themselves a pan-European army. One’s a drag artist from Sweden, another’s Serbian and identifies as queer. A third is blonde with a home counties accent. It’s December 2017 and, in just six months time, Italy’s new interior minister, Matteo Salvini, will announce a compulsory census of Roma people.This is the territory Yael Ronen works in: hotly political and intensely personal. Her devised shows draw on her actors’ lives and identities, mingling fact with fiction in a way that teases comedy out of significant conflicts – Yugoslavia’s civil war in Common Ground, Israel-Palestine in The Situation.Her work places great stock in the stage as a space for unity, bringing people together across political ides. Her companies, whether her Roma Army or the Gorki Theatre’s new Exil Ensemble made up of immigrants from Afghanistan, Syria and Palestine, stand as symbols of collaboration. Like the work of Lola Arias and Rimini Protokoll, Ronen’s shows practise what they preach.Saigon set Caroline Giuela Nguyen apart. Since its premiere last year, it has zipped around Europe non-stop, festival to festival. At home, it won its writer-director a second Molière award nomination.Staged in a replica Vietnamese restaurant, the four-hour piece swung between Saigon in 1956, as French colonialists shipped out post Dien Bien Phu, and Paris 40 years later, as Vietnamese exiles faced the prospect of returning for the first time. Nguyen made that trip at 16, with her mother, but Saigon was not straightforwardly autobiographical. It grew out of two years of research with her cast, and the show swam with ghosts, grief and dreamy nostalgia as it kept various storylines spinning like plates.That’s a mark of her beginnings – not only as a sociology student, but in reshaping literary classics for the stage. Having first worked with novels, including a two-parter that chucked Madame Bovary into today’s world, her company, Les Hommes Approximatifs, changed tack, focusing on overlooked stories and underrepresented lives. She began collaborating in prisons with Joël Pommerat and, in her shows, started to focus on the scars left by colonialism. Her shows have a gorgeous, unreal aesthetic, but the language is radical too: by refusing surtitles for multilingual shows, Nguyen pushes against old hierarchies and privileges.On a wall in Vinkovci, eastern Croatia, the words “Death to Oliver Frljić” appeared overnight. He has drawn protests and faced violent threats, lost festivals their funding and seen politicians vow to remove him from post. Frljić is one of the continent’s most controversial theatre directors – and one of its most necessary.A strident and unapologetically political artist, Frljić’s work scrutinizes and satirises the political fallout across the former Yugoslavia: the fruits of war, the rise of far-right nationalism, the meekness of democracy. He counters with shock and scorn. One show has actors urinating on a map of the region. Another sees a woman extract the national flag from her vagina. He might push unruliness to extremes – gratuitously so, perhaps – but this is no time for politeness. Frljić is a frontline artist.For all its messy anarchism – he once had teenagers instruct audiences in bomb-making – Frljić’s theatre is calculated, too. He challenges the form and questions its limits, writing fake personal histories for his actors, quoting and critiquing other shows in his own and flicking between representation and reality. His theatre, as one critic put it, is “nothing more and nothing less than the search for the right artistic tool to stop the descent into national hell”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f796958178d48f982b350e2d97f26620e772a312/0_400_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a64e9e275147f554873e864884fbfff7","title":"el chapos lawyers accuse government of an inquisition as trial nears","story":"Joaquín Guzmán Loera’s defense team complain that their client is being systematically denied due processOn the face of it, criminal complaint 1:09-cr-00466-BMC is a straightforward drug-conspiracy case based on 300,000 pages of seized documents, including drug ledgers and shipping manifests, wire-tap recordings and potentially dozens of cooperating witnesses.But the sheer abundance of discovery material alone is an indication that little about United States v Joaquín Guzmán Loera will be straightforward when jury selection begins in Brooklyn federal Judge Brian Cogan’s court room on 5 November. For the government, it’s a banner prosecution a rare opportunity to serve justice on a notorious trafficking kingpin known variously as El Shorty (for his diminutive stature), El Rapido (for the efficiency of his trafficking operation), or El Chapo to followers of narco folklore everywhere.But the passage from extradition on Barack Obama’s final night in office in 2017 to trial in Brooklyn has been fraught with delays caused by defence complaints that Guzmán, for two decades the head of Mexico’s dominant Sinaloa crime cartel, is being systematically denied due process. “I’ve defended some difficult cases and some notorious clients but I’ve never had both arms tied behind my back like this,” says Jeffrey Lichtman, a heavy hitting New York criminal defence lawyer who formally joined Guzmán’s defence team last month. “This is literally an inquisition. Constitutional fairness has gone out of the window because the government wants a show trial with a quickie conviction.”The addition of Lichtman, who is best known for winning an acquittal for John Gotti Jr on mob related racketeering charges, has amplified a sense of anticipation before the trial. Guzmán’s wife, the former beauty queen Emma Coronel Aispuro, now attends pretrial hearings with the couple’s two young daughters, who wave and coo excitedly to their father from the gallery. That space is now crammed with increasing numbers of media from Mexico and Central America, where Guzmán remains both reviled and revered.The vast amount of evidence prosecutors have assembled to back up their story of Guzmán’s two decades at the top has now landed with the defence, a “dump” in their opinion, and assembled “with no rhyme or reason”.If the government’s evidence against Guzmán is as good as it claims it is, Lichtman argued, why are they treating El Chapo in this fashion? “It’s making me think that maybe the evidence is not so good and they’re going to rely on the evidence of people who’ve spent their entire lives selling drugs and lying,” he said.Exacerbating the problem of sifting through that material, the defence claims, is being denied sufficient access to a client who does not speak English and whose ability to participate in his defence is hampered by the harsh conditions of his 17-month confinement at the politan Correctional Center in lower Manhattan. “He’s in isolation 24 hours a day and his condition is deteriorating,” said Lichtman. “He has no contact with other prisoners and very little contact with jailers, who don’t speak Spanish. He has no ability to speak to his family and gets two calls from his sister totaling half-an-hour a month.” After he was hauled from a drainage ditch in the coastal city of Mochis by Mexican federal authorities in January 2016, Guzmán told Mexican prosecutors that he was “just a farmer” who earns 20,000 pesos a year ($1,500) growing corn, sorghum and safflower. He did not, he claimed, “belong to any cartel or have any cartel”. Part of the government’s rationale for keeping Guzmán under conditions of maximum detention, his legal team concedes, may be rooted in Guzmán’s proven ability to escape from maximum-security prisons in Mexico – once, according to his lore, secreted in a laundry cart and, in a second successful bid for freedom, via a mile-long tunnel that connected to the shower of his cell. “We have to be realistic,” A Eduardo Balarezo argued. “We’re in a secure facility in downtown Manhattan. Does the government have so little faith it its own security that they think something like that could happen again?” As the government lays out Guzman’s rise and fall at trial, much of the evidence will come in direct testimony from as many as 40 witnesses, among them Colombian drug lords, couriers, enforcers and accountants – some of who may be allowed to testify under aliases.One likely prosecution witness is Dámaso López, Guzmán’s former right-hand man who was extradited to the US in July. One figure who might be called by the defence is actor Sean Penn. Months ago, prosecutors petitioned the judge to exclude any mention of Guzmán’s sit-down interview with Penn for Rolling Stone magazine in 2015, which came shortly before the arrest that led to Guzmán’s extradition. Penn has denied his contact with Guzmán could have tipped off US or Mexican authorities to his whereabouts.  Asked if he believed Penn’s involvement led to his client’s arrest, Balarezo said simply: “I have no doubts about that.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8ebd136d73b61379bfa82fa4aeba46af0859a207/0_518_7750_4651/master/7750.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e1790ab8d09af22caa2456ef0f4cea80","title":"sweden elections everything you need to know","story":"Scandinavian country’s 7.3 million voters go to polls on 9 September. What are the key issues?Anti-migrant feeling fuels Swedish far right as election loomsSweden’s 7.3 million voters go to the polls on 9 September, electing a new parliament and government to succeed the Social Democrat-Green coalition of the prime minister, Stefan Löfven, which has run the country since 2014.Current opinion polling suggests his centre-left party may remain Sweden’s largest, as it has for more than a century. But it, the main centre-right Moderate party and their respective blocs face a stiff challenge from the rightwing populists of the Sweden Democrats, who could well end up holding the balance of power.After Italy’s election of a far-right, populist coalition in March, the performance of the anti-immigration, anti-EU party will be watched across Europe – though its support appears to have been fading since early summer, when it led some polls.The 349 MPs in Sweden’s Riksdag are elected through proportional representation, 310 of them by the country’s 29 constituencies (each of which has a set number of seats depending on their population).Europe’s 2105 immigration crisis, in which Sweden received 163,000 asylum seekers (more, per head of the population, than almost any other EU country), propelled immigration and integration to the top of the political agenda.Although the present government radically tightened asylum laws, the Sweden Democrats – whose roots lie in the neo-Nazi movement, but under leader Jimmy Åkesson have been mostly purged of their openly racist elements – have kept them there, hammering their core message that Sweden’s generous welfare state is at risk.Sweden is also increasingly alarmed by violent crime following a spate of shootings and grenade attacks, often in deprived areas with high concentrations of immigrants, masked youths recently torched more than 80 cars in Gothenburg and other west coast towns.The far-right party’s other main policy, holding a referendum over whether Sweden should leave the EU, has little support among voters. Sweden’s economy, motoring along nicely, barely features in the debate. After this summer’s record heatwave, however, climate change is also now a major electoral issue.Many analysts believe that could clear a path for Moderate leader Ulf Kristersson to become the next prime minister, even at the head of a minority government, if the anti-immigration party votes down Löfven.A strong performance by the Sweden Democrats could create its own problems for the anti-immigration party, however: although it might force mainstream parties to engage, compromising on their fundamental principles for a share of power has rarely won populist parties more votes."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3615815.1535905872!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"irish individuals order 100 sperm samples annually","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tCryos chief executive Peter Reeslev said there had been a dramatic shift in customer groups in the past 10 years.About 1,000 orders for sperm samples have been made by private Irish iniduals from the world’s largest sperm bank in the past decade, it has emerged.According to Cryos International – Denmark, about 100 orders are privately placed by Irish people annually.The figure does not include sperm orders supplied to Irish fertility clinics.Cryos chief executive Peter Reeslev said there had been a dramatic shift in customer groups in the past 10 years, while the number of orders placed had stayed relatively stable.He said private heterosexual couples from Ireland now make up just 20 per cent of purchasers. The majority of private orders are now made by singles (40 per cent) and lesbians (40 per cent).Based on customer surveys, he said “we can see a change of customer groups with a rapidly growing share of singles and lesbians out of the total distribution”.Mr Reeslev declined to reveal the exact number of orders placed by private and corporate iniduals, but added that about 80 per cent of Irish sperm orders were supplied to clinics while the remaining 20 per cent were issued to private iniduals.There has also been a shift in the type of sperm sought by Irish iniduals.“We see a tendency for Irish customers to order more non-anonymous over anonymous, about 65 per cent non-anonymous versus 35 per cent anonymous year to date,” he said.“That has changed from 56 per cent non-anonymous versus 44 per cent anonymous donors in 2017 and, further back, the share of anonymous was even higher. This tendency might be an influence of the anticipation of a potential legislative change.”The anonymous provision of sperm and eggs in fertility treatment is set to be banned under Irish law shortly.According to another outlet, the European Sperm Bank, personal orders by Irish patients numbered around 100 in 2017 and order numbers are increasing in 2018.About 20 per cent of the sperm delivered to Ireland last year was anonymous, while 80 per cent was non-anonymous, a spokeswoman said.Parts of the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015, which have yet to be enacted in Ireland, will see the creation of a register of a donor-conceived person register, to contain the details of sperm and egg donors.Mr Reeslev disagreed with the plan and argued that both anonymous and non-anonymous sperm samples should be permitted.Sperm sample prices varied greatly depending on a number of different factors, but could range between €46 and €800 per sperm sample, he said."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Acting commissioner Donall O\u0026rsquoCualain stepped down at 00.01am on MondayCollapse of Northern Executive undermines people\u0026rsquos faith in politics, says FF leader\u0026lsquoI\u0026rsquom 54 and in all my time I have never experienced anything like it\u0026rsquoGovernment may request visit to take place after Armistice event to avoid protocol clashManaging protests will be main challenge during November visitCouncil to repair Edmondstown Road while case against Ghandi Mallak continuesGlider route system mirrors changes planned under Dublin\u0026rsquos BusConnects planUp to 100 women and 30 men die each year from cancers caused by HPV in IrelandUp to 14,000 people to benefit from initiativeFather of child with scoliosis says State failing to fulfil promise of surgery within four monthsNew grind school signs up 200 full-time students with fees of more than \u0026euro7,000\u0026lsquoMy heart sinks at the thought of ringing Sky again and going around in the same circles\u0026rsquoFigure does not include orders supplied to Irish fertility clinicsSystem failing to meet the needs of people faced with changing world of workUniversity researchers find urban bees make better honey than their country cousinsTwo Government ministers say they will boycott State events with US presidentGemma O\u0026rsquoDoherty mired in controversy over Veronica Guerin \u0026lsquoconspiracy theory\u0026rsquo\u0026lsquoI was often sitting here for eight hours not talking to anyone,\u0026rsquo says one ownerBishop Deenihan said he was \u0026lsquoparticularly conscious\u0026rsquo of his role in supporting the priests of his diocese"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3616014.1535915134!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"as carrick on shannon shops close some blame hens and stags","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tJim Gartlan looks out the window of his shop, which closed on Friday. Photograph: Brian FarrellLast Friday the shutters came down on three town centre shops in Carrick-on-Shannon and locals spent much of the day dropping in with good wishes and cards. A fourth shop in the Co Leitrim town had said a final farewell to customers the previous day.Two of the businesses, Prior’s on Main Street and Gartlan’s on Bridge Street, were family-run newsagents that had survived for generations. Scented Meadows, a gift shop styling itself “the lavender experience”, opened in Carrick five years ago but, according to owner Nicoletta Pantano, she was closing for the sake of her sanity. “I was often sitting here for eight hours not talking to anyone, with no cars passing,” she explained.A children’s clothing store, Sherbet, also shut last week, although it is to continue as an online business. Three more businesses have either recently closed or are preparing to go.In a town frequently lauded in the tourist guides for its vibrancy and picturesque location on the banks of the Shannon, the closure of at least seven town centre shops is a talking point.There are two motions before Monday’s meeting of Leitrim County Council urging that something be done. “Is there some reason for these closures that we can address?” independent councillor Enda Stenson is asking officials, echoing the bewilderment locally at the scale of closures.The reasons are varied and complex, but the development of out-of-town retail parks and online shopping are being cited as factors. The proprietors of one popular boutique are closing for family reasons, while another boutique has little choice because the landlord is selling up.The impact of Carrick’s popularity as a destination for hen and stag celebrations ides opinion, with some saying it kept the town going during difficult times, while others believe the regular weekend influx of revellers is keeping other potential customers away.“Hens and stags bring €28 million annually to Carrick and create 800 jobs, including part-time work,” said Colm McGrath, president of the chamber of commerce. He agrees that seven shop closures is a cause of concern “in the short term, but medium to long term I think the future looks positive”. McGrath says that once funding is secured to improve the streetscape in Carrick, investment will follow.Fellow chamber member Leslie O’Hora does not share his enthusiasm for hens and stags. “We have a population of 4,000 but get an extra 1,000 every weekend, most of them well-behaved but some obviously boisterous,” said the businessman. “Families will not come into town if there are people marching up and down the streets carrying inflatables and bottles and glasses.”O’Hora, a business consultant and former Green Party election candidate, argues that only a handful of “superpubs” are benefiting from the hen and stag trade and says the same people provide accommodation and transport for the visitors. “It’s a beautiful town with fantastic hotels, 20 restaurants and some lovely boutique shops, but it is destroyed at weekends.”Jim Gartlan, who sold tourist souvenirs in his newsagent, points out that 13,000 people reportedly visit the Rosebank retail park on the Dublin side of town every Saturday.“People can get all they need on the edge of towns. It’s not just Carrick,” he said. His grandmother Eileen Murray started the business on Main Street in the late 1930s, a time when most families lived over their shops creating a close-knit town centre community.Gartlan says “a combination of 20 different things” including a sharp drop in overseas visitors, made closure inevitable.Colm Prior’s father, Denis, bought the business in 1953, “so after 65 years Prior’s is retiring”. Prior says the “last straw” for him was when the traffic flow was changed and commuters travelling from Leitrim and Drumshanbo could no longer turn right and pass his premises. “We were never consulted,” he said. “From the first day we saw a difference,” his partner, Bernadette Keenan, said.They had no problem with hens ands stags, especially hens. “They’d come in for coffee and to buy confectionery for the kids before going home on Sunday. The lads, in fairness, were here to drink,” laughed Prior.Claire McGovern, editor of the Leitrim Observer, believes there are multiple reasons for the spate of closures, including traffic issues. “The town is well known for being a bottle-neck as motorists cross over the bridge, and this can put off people coming into Carrick.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3616127.1535922111!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit would boost support for united ireland poll finds","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tIn the event of Brexit with a hard Border, 56 per cent in the North said they would vote for unity. Photograph: Stefan RousseauPAA majority of people in the North would vote for a united Ireland in the event of Brexit, according to a new poll published on Monday.The poll carried out for Our Future Our Choice, a campaign group of young people calling for a “people’s vote” on the final Brexit deal, found that 52 per cent of people in Northern Ireland would vote for a united Ireland if the United Kingdom quits the EU.The online poll of 1,199 people from Northern Ireland was conducted by Deltapoll between August 27th and August 30th.One of the questions posed was this: “Imagine now that the UK decided to leave the EU. Under these circumstances how would you vote in a referendum on the constitutional arrangements of the island of Ireland?”More than half – 52 per cent – said they would vote for a united Ireland, while 39 per cent said they would vote for Northern Ireland to remain part of the UK.The poll also found that more would vote for a united Ireland in the event of a hard Border. In such circumstances, 56 per cent said they would vote for unity in a Border poll while 40 per cent responded they would vote to remain in the UK.A total of 94 per cent of those surveyed from a “nationalist heritage” said they would vote for unity in the event of Brexit. However, that nationalist figure dropped to 73 per cent if the UK did not leave the EU.Among people who described themselves as neither from a nationalist nor a unionist heritage support for a united Ireland dropped from 59 per cent to 23 per cent if the UK stayed in the EU.“This result confirms what everybody already knows in their heart, that if we leave the EU, people will vote for a united Ireland,” said Doire Finn (23), a spokeswoman for Our Future Our Choice Northern Ireland.“Arlene Foster and the DUP’s stance on Brexit has advanced the nationalist cause further than 40 years of IRA violence ever managed,” she added. “But her supporters have a chance to defend unionism by calling for the DUP leadership to support a people’s vote on the final Brexit deal,” said Ms Finn.The campaign group held a similar poll in Scotland of 1,022 respondents. There 47 per cent said they would vote for Scottish independence in a future referendum if the UK left the EU as planned while 43 per cent said they would vote to stay in the UK. But if Brexit was stopped, 47 per cent said they would vote for Scotland to stay in the UK and 43 per cent said they would vote for independence."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3615936.1535911516!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"irish honey among world s healthiest study finds","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPhD student Saorla Kavanagh of DCU, who led the research that has found Irish heather honey as having health benefits comparable with manuka honeyIrish heather honey contains health benefits comparable with the world renowned manuka honey from New Zealand, according to a study from researchers at Dublin City University and Trinity College Dublin.Honey provides many benefits for overall health, with antioxidant, antibacterial, antidiabetic and anti-inflammatory properties.Manuka honey is produced in New Zealand by bees that pollinate the native manuka bush. Advocates say it has particularly strong properties that are useful for treating wound infections and actually prevents damage to cell tissue.The Irish research found a similar overall presence of powerful antioxidants called phenolic compounds in Irish heather honey as has been found in manuka honey.Researchers also found that multifloral honeys produced by urban bees had a greater level of antioxidant phenolic compounds than their rural counterparts – a finding possibly due to the flower ersity and abundance surrounding hives.The findings are published in the prestigious journal Food Chemistry.The research was led by PhD student Saorla Kavanagh of the school of chemical sciences and DCU Water Institute, and supervised by senior academics Dr Blánaid White of the school of chemical sciences in DCU and Prof Jane Stout of the school of natural sciences, Trinity College Dublin.Honey samples for the research, which was funded by the Irish Research Council, were donated by beekeepers across Ireland.The research also represented the first ever comparison of Irish single-origin honeys heather, ivy and oilseed rape and multifloral honeys.– Honeys with a dark colour typically have a higher total phenolic content and thus a higher antioxidant capacity.– Urban multifloral honeys had a higher total phenolic content than rural multifloral honeys.– Irish heather honey had the highest total phenolic content of all Irish single origin honeys and had a higher total phenolic content than manuka honey.– Ivy honey was the darkest Irish honey analysed and its total phenolic content was less than that of heather and manuka honeys.Dr White said the research “shows that Irish honey is a high-quality product and something that we should really value.Prof Stout said finding a difference in honey composition between urban and rural hives probably reflects the difference in flower availability in urban and rural areas in Ireland”."},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"Two jailed for illegal possession of documents while reporting on violence against RohingyaKathmandu Letter: Protests and shock at growing sexual violence and rights abusesTrump administration says Islamabad is granting safe haven to insurgentsBeijing says UN panel\u0026rsquos report on one million Uighurs in detention \u0026lsquowithout factual basis\u0026rsquoBishops says children will be less rather than more safe if mandatory reporting requiredTwenty-five years after the end of a rabies-inspired ban, dog ownership is boomingAccused under antiquated law, Divya Spandana has case adjournedMyanmar under fire from UN over \u0026lsquogenocidal\u0026rsquo mass killings of Rohingya peopleSydney Letter: Public tired of PMs changing via party processes, rather than by votersMyanmar leader speaks only of fiction when comment on Rohingya mass killing expectedCurrent limits of two children per couple may end as population agesCaptain of flight on which 51 died in March was \u0026lsquoupset and hurt\u0026rsquoUN calls for genocide charges against army leaders for attacks on Rohingya minorityReporters accused of illegally possessing official documentsMove against hate speech after UN report accuses miltary of genocide in treatment of RohingyaSecurity forces carried out \u0026lsquocrimes against humanity\u0026rsquo against Rohingya and other groupsNegotiations remain deadlocked as Mike Pompeo\u0026rsquos visit cancelledJulie Bishop announces move to backbench after Scott Morrison wins leadership battlePark Geun-hye was ousted from office last year and jailed on corruption chargesTurnbull blames \u0026lsquoinsurgency\u0026rsquo in Liberal Party \u0026lsquobacked by powerful voices in the media\u0026rsquo"},{"url":null,"title":"introducing telegraph new way get news","story":"Head of Digital PublishingMedia and Telecoms industryWe’ve made it even easier for you to get the news you want, when you want it. Introducing My , a new way to get the news.When you login to your  account you can now follow your favourite  writers and the subjects you’re most interested in to create a feed of news that’s just for you.Whether you want the wisdom of Charles Moore, want post-match insight from Paul Hayward or need straight-talking lifestyle advice from Bryony Gordon, the My Feed feature gives you a truly personalised experience of The .The first time you use My , we\u0027ll present a selection of popular subjects and writers to get you started.

If people want to go home, that\u0027s fine - we\u0027ll play another show for you another time.At first the show was paused  after Bono said he would leave the stage for 10 minutes but the audience was soon told the performance would have to be cancelled.There is some consolation for disappointed fans.

The duchess\u0027s ice-pink off-the-shoulder Carolina Herrera dress at Trooping the Colour in June was also popular, with searches for the designer almost doubling.Prince George of Cambridge, Princess Charlotte of Cambridge and Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge attend the Maserati Royal Charity Polo Trophy at the Beaufort Polo ClubRob Hattrell, UK vice president of eBay, said: While Meghan was clearly the focus of the fashion pages this year, Kate\u0027s distinctive style has long been a hit with shoppers on eBay since her wedding in 2011.We always see an uptick in searches around landmark royal events and 2018 was a bumper year for small businesses on eBay, with both the birth of Prince Louis and Meghan and Harry\u0027s wedding driving purchases across the nation.Princess Charlotte, who was top in 2017, came third, with the flower crown she wore as a bridesmaid at Meghan and Harry\u0027s wedding prompting a 60 per cent increase in searches for similar products on eBay.

So I don’t think that Neil viewed himself as an American hero. From my interviews with his family and people that knew him, it was quite the opposite. And we wanted the film to reflect Neil.”This observation was turned into a false report published by news websites including The , Breitbart and Business Insider which claimed there were no American flags in the film. Rubio then picked the story up, despite not having seen the film himself.\u0026nbsp“The American people paid for that mission, on rockets built by Americans, with American technology \u0026amp carrying American astronauts. It wasn\u0027t a UN mission,” he tweeted, stirring up more outrage.However, the Daily Beast’s Marlow Stern contradicted Rubio’s claim, writing: “Having actually seen the film, can confirm that while the physical act of planting the American flag into the moon is not portrayed, there are several shots of the American flag flying on the moon — including one long shot as Armstrong and co. disembark.”Armstrong’s own sons contributed their own view on the row and said they approved of the film. They also confirmed Gosling’s comment, that their father did not see himself as an American hero.“It\u0027s nonsense, it\u0027s just nonsense. The film itself can be interpreted as patriotic,” Clarke said, speaking at the Deauville Film Festival, where he was accepting a career honour. “It\u0027s just silly and naive I think. Of course, it celebrates one of the greatest acts of America and Americans and humanity and mankind.”He added: “People look for conspiracy theories rather than looking for the truth.”The best dressed guests at Venice Film Festival 2018Lady Gaga attends the ‘A Star Is Born’ photocall, the film about an aspiring singer songwriter, with co-star and director Bradley Cooper.

The figures were provided by 55 out of 74 universities asked.The NHS in England has 40,000 unfilled nursing positions, the RCN estimates, and hospitals are reporting growing shortages of nurses along with\u0026nbspother healthcare staff.Applications to study nursing in England have dropped by a third since 2017, when the Government scrapped bursaries, meaning\u0026nbspnurses and midwives must pay £9,000 a year in fees.Anne Corrin, Head of Professional Learning and Development at the RCN, said:\u0026nbsp “These figures are a stark and timely reminder of the need to properly support student nurses.“It is vital that student nurses have the opportunity to learn in placements – where they spend half their time – and are not relied upon to make up shortfalls in staffing numbers. They must not be exploited as cheap labour.“Nursing is a wonderful career, but student nurses face some of the most demanding workloads of any course. This makes financial pressures of student life and placements even harder to bear.“Falling student numbers and rising vacancies in our health and social care services mean addressing these issues has never been more urgent.”NHS at 70: Pride and worry as free health service celebrates birthdayNurses test the hearing of a newborn childThe waiting room is busy in Milton Keynes University HospitalOn Ward 24, two nurses work at the nurses stationIn A\u0026ampE, a porter rushes a patient through the corridorA surgical team prepares a patient for their operationIn the physiotherapy department, patients are treated in the hydrotherapy poolIn the physiotherapy department, amputees take a classA junior doctor is at work in the staff roomA surgical team prepares a patient for their operationAn inpatient has her hair washed by the staff hairdressersIn the audiology department, a mother watches on as her son is given a hearing testOn Ward 8, staff serve lunch to the patientsOn Ward 24, a patient waits on their bedOn Ward 8, a cleaner is at workA nurse takes blood from a patientInpatient Donald Ritson lies in bed in Ward 24 in Milton Keynes University HospitalNurses test the hearing of a newborn childThe waiting room is busy in Milton Keynes University HospitalOn Ward 24, two nurses work at the nurses stationIn A\u0026ampE, a porter rushes a patient through the corridorA surgical team prepares a patient for their operationIn the physiotherapy department, patients are treated in the hydrotherapy poolIn the physiotherapy department, amputees take a classA junior doctor is at work in the staff roomA surgical team prepares a patient for their operationAn inpatient has her hair washed by the staff hairdressersIn the audiology department, a mother watches on as her son is given a hearing testOn Ward 8, staff serve lunch to the patientsOn Ward 24, a patient waits on their bedOn Ward 8, a cleaner is at workA nurse takes blood from a patientInpatient Donald Ritson lies in bed in Ward 24 in Milton Keynes University HospitalFigures from a Nursing Standard investigation in 2006 found the\u0026nbspattrition rate was 24.8 per cent, suggesting efforts to retain nurses and nursing students over the last decade have had little effect, the publication said.James Buchan, professor in the health and sciences faculty at Edinburgh’s Queen Margaret University said: “Student nurse attrition has been for many years identified as a major problem for the UK, both in terms of the negative impact on iniduals who leave programmes early, and also for the system at large, given nursing shortages are so prominent and increasing.”Ben Gershlick, a senior economics analyst at the Health Foundation said: “While the attrition rate has\u0026nbspremained fairly constant over the last decade, its impact is becoming more severe bearing in mind the overall shortage of nurses, vacancies in nursing posts and rising demand pressures on the NHS.“The need for nurses trained in the UK has also increased as we have seen a recent fall in the inflow of nurses coming from abroad.“Reducing attrition should be a crucial aspect of our overall approach to workforce planning.“The long-term plan for the health service, which is currently in development, and the workforce strategy expected from Health Education England, need to bring a much more joined-up and strategic approach.”A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: “The NHS runs on the dedication and commitment of our wonderful nurses, who work tirelessly to provide the highest quality of care for their patients.“There are currently 52,000 nurses in training to work in our NHS, with more to come thanks to our historic 25 per cent increase in training places which will ensure we have the nurses we need for the future.”Royal College of NursingEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/30/13/frestonia-1.jpg","title":"frestonia squatters london declare independence uk 1970s free independent","story":"Created with Sketch.The Free Independent Republic of Frestonia was born of a generation who knew counterculture as much as precarious living. Now a new book collects photography and stories from the communityClick to followThe IndependentThe community designed a flag, appointed ministers of state – including actor David Rappaport as foreign minister – made their own postage stamps and issued visas for visitorsThere was a lot of talk, in the wake of the Brexit referendum, suggesting that London should stage its own exit from the United Kingdom, declare independence, and ask to rejoin the EU as a nation state.Ignoring for now the fact that not everyone – though\u0026nbspit might seem that way to London – outside the capital voted to leave the EU, it seemed a satisfying, though jokey, postscript to the Brexit vote. Indeed, more than 180,000 Londoners signed an online petition calling for the mayor, Sadiq\u0026nbspKhan, to “declare London independent, and apply to join the EU –\u0026nbspincluding membership of the Schengen zone”.But what a lot of the signatories might not have realised was that there was indeed a precedent for London seceding from the UK. Or at least, one street of the capital.\u0026nbspWelcome to the Free Independent Republic of Frestonia. Or, what’s left of it, which these days amounts to the Frestonian Gallery, keeping the name and spirit alive of one of the most curious episodes in London’s history. It\u0026nbspbegan on Halloween\u0026nbsp1977, when the residents of Freston Road in Notting Dale, West London, which was largely comprised of squats and communes, declared independence.Threatened with eviction, the squatters said they were no longer part of the UK and appealed to the United Nations to send in peacekeeping forces to prevent Greater London Council turfing them out of the homes they had claimed. They designed a flag, appointed ministers of state, and even made their own postage stamps and issued visas for visitors.The short-lived story of the Free Independent Republic of Frestonia has now been documented in a new book of photographs by one of its residents, the photographer Tony Sleep, who was resident on Freston Road from 1974.\u0026nbspSleep describes the Frestonia experiment as “part publicity stunt, part theatrical protest”, and adds that while it wasn’t a serious attempt to break away from the UK, there was never any need to, because what became Frestonia “was already on a different planet”.He writes in the lavish book: “Frestonia was rooted in the counterculture of the time. The period is now dismissed as little more than daft clothes and hair, accompanied by a great soundtrack and the invention of sex and drugs.“It was, we are told, youthful self indulgence that ended badly because it was irresponsible and naive.”Frestonian Gallery)Frestonia was born out of problems that young people will recognise today: the lack of affordable accommodation. Sleep points out that the millennial generation might have a beef with the baby boomers who grew up in the 1960s and 1970s because they had it easy, and accommodation was cheap and plentiful. Not a bit of it, he says.“Rented flats were in very short supply, and mostly slum standard. You might achieve a rented bedsit as long as you weren’t black, Irish\u0026nbspor a dog. Then, as now, landlords wanted ‘professional’ people.“Council housing lists were only for families, and backlogged for decades. Despite what now seem like absurdly low prices, only the wealthy and secure could obtain mortgages at a time before easy mass debts. Less than half the population owned their own homes at the start of the 1970s.”Freston Road, where squatters and activists founded housing coop and community Frestonia\u0026nbsp(Getty)Many of the houses on Freston Road were empty, having been condemned as unfit for human habitation, and most of the residents had been relocated to the new highrise blocks of flats that began to go up in the 1960s and 1970s. There had been a move to demolish the vacant properties, but residents in neighbouring communities had complained that they would be looking out onto swathes of barren, rubble-strewn land that would encourage flytipping, so the authorities decided to take the cheaper option and just leave the buildings standing for a while.Freston Road might have been abandoned, but that didn’t mean it was unused. From 1974, squatters began to break into the empty houses and set up home there Tony Sleep, aged 24 at that time, was one of them.He recalls:\u0026nbsp“Squatting is distinctly equal opportunity. If you can gain possession, it’s yours. This led to an interesting mix of people who had little in common except needing somewhere to live and being poor for one reason or another. While some tried to make their new homes habitable, several houses were quickly wrecked.”Sleep remembers well his first sight of Freston Road. He’d been living in a “dismal rented basement” in west Kensington, but as he and his girlfriend parted company, he needed somewhere else to live, and heard about a street of empty houses. Some of his friends went to have a look and broke into two of the houses.“That night I paid them a visit,” writes Sleep. “Eight people, four guys, four girls, in one candlelit room, the only one that had windows. There was no toilet, no water, no electricity.”But his friends set to work installing plumbing and wiring as best they could, found an old toilet, rescued carpets and furniture from skips, and Sleep asked if he could move in with them.By 1977 Freston Road had settled into an unorthodox community, of sorts. But the attention of the GLC wandered back to these old, abandoned homes, and the squatters were told that they were to be evicted from these properties.The council offered to place the squatters in what were considered “hard to let” properties dotted around London, and some took the flats –\u0026nbspand, says Sleep, were promptly replaced in Freston Road by other people desperate for somewhere to live.\u0026nbspThe GLC announced its intention to bulldoze Freston Road after all, and a meeting was called, attended by 200 people. They decided – inspired by the Ealing comedy Passport to Pimlico – to go it alone. The Free Independent Republic of Frestonia was born. And the battle was on.The Frestonian National Anthem was written (“Long live Frestonia! Land of the free – not the GLC”) and a community newspaper, The Tribal Messenger, was distributed. Frestonia made the international press, and the Daily Mirror ran a piece declaring “All Hall, Frestonia”. The actor David Rappaport was made foreign minister, and playwright Heathcote Williams became ambassador to the United Kingdom.It was all a bit jolly and, of course, more than a pinch of Ealing comedy. But, Sleep points out, Frestonia was also an interesting way of putting British society under the\u0026nbspmicroscope.“Communities are defined, more or less, by what people have in common,” he writes. “That’s usually class, background or aspiration, sometimes race or religion. What people have in common helps them feel safe and valued. What is different can be threatening or isive.Frestonian Gallery)“Families, on the other hand, are a matter of being stuck with people you sometimes struggle to tolerate, let alone like. Frestonia was a bit of both.“Frestonians were, beneath the veneer of pragmatic anarchy, from different cultures. There were the hippies, idealists of a sort. There were the punks, nihilists of a sort. And there were the itinerant street people, whose lack of youth and lost changes gave them a thread of bitterness to chew on together.”Over the next couple of years, fighting the threat of the GLC bulldozers, the anarchic squat collective organised itself more seriously, forming the Bramley Housing Cooperative with an aim that was less about the fun of independence and more about securing the future of the Freston Road community.Eventually, the GLC won the war, and demolition of the squats began in 1983. But the Bramley Housing Cooperative, working with the Notting Hill Housing Trust, continued to fight for Freston Road as a residential area. And, ultimately, they won.Sleep says, “Frestonia didn’t cease when the squats were demolished. How could it? They were only useful ruins. Frestonia was about the people, its improbable family.“If you walk through Frestonia now, there’s little to suggest it is much different from anywhere else. You’ll find a street of small, but perhaps unusually pretty houses, built in the mid 1980s. They look carefully designed, a bit too inidual to be social housing. You may not notice the enclosed communal gardens, or the sheltered housing scheme that the coop insisted on, you won’t know the coop ensured housing for some of the more vulnerable Frestonians.”It might be that Frestonia would be forgotten all together, but for Tony Sleep’s photographic record of the people, events and houses on Freston Road in the late 1970s and early 1980s.‘Pop-up squat’: Activists occupy property to protest Housing BillNew photography exhibition shows the tough reality of squattingChallenging consumption and overwork in a Danish communityThe name does linger on in the form of the Frestonian Gallery, opened in 2017 by Matt Incledon and Rollo Campbell, who have published Tony Sleep’s photographs and recollections in Welcome To Frestonia. A pair of, in their own words, “itinerant art dealers”, they opened the gallery in The People’s Hall, a Victorian building that was once at the heart of Frestonia.\u0026nbspFrestonian Gallery opened in 2017 to remember a most curious episode in London’s history\u0026nbsp(Tony SleepFrestonian Gallery)Becoming appraised of the story of Frestonia, they were introduced to Tony Sleep, and arranged an exhibition of his photographs. They write in their foreword: “It was an exhibition unlike anything either of us had worked on previously. Each day at the gallery provided a steady stream of visitors keen to revisit and share their own personal memories of Frestonia. It would be a nice point at which to say ‘We then decided a book of Tony’s work needs to be published...’ but again, in truth, the decision had been made for us already by the sheer emotional response to this unique exhibition.”Was it all worth it for the Frestonians? Did it make a difference? Tony Sleep closes his remarkable document of this time by musing, “Forty years on, the UK seems to have travelled in a large circle and arrived little the wiser, but probably angrier, more cynical and more ided than ever.\u0026nbspWe are all Frestonians, on this small blue dot in the middle of nowhere.

The acclaimed movie mogul, who produced Oscar-winning films Shakespeare in Love, The English Patient, and The Artist, clocked up box office successes and accolades aplenty. But this has quickly changed since a chorus of women have come forward to accuse the Hollywood producer of sexual harassment and assault. Since the New York Times’ bombshell report disclosed sexual harassment and rape allegations against the film mogul dating back decades, Weinstein has been fired from his namesake company, expelled from the Oscars and has had his wife leave him. Weinstein has apologised for having “caused a lot of pain” but has denied all allegations of nonconsensual sex. The Sopranos actor alleged Weinstein raped her after shooting The Night We Never Met, a 1993 movie that Weinstein produced. The model and actress, who has appeared in around 50 films, said she met Weinstein at a BAFTA after party in 2008 while she was working as a spokeswoman for LG.The actor, best known for her role in Ridley Scott\u0027s Blade Runner, said that Weinstein exposed himself to her in the early 1990s, when she was starring in the Miramax-produced Love Crimes - a production company that Weinstein headed at the time. Mimi Haleyi said she was assaulted by Weinstein in what appeared to be a child\u0027s bedroom in his New York City apartment in 2006 when she was in her 20s.In an op-ed for The New York Times, the Oscar-winning actor said she was invited to Weinstein’s family home in Connecticut on the premise of watching a film shortly after they met in 2011.Writing on social media, the Game of Thrones actor claims she first met Weinstein at the Venice Film Festival in 2005 where, after taking her for a walk by the water, he “made some suggestive comment and gesture.”  The actor told The New Yorker that after a meeting to discuss casting her in various projects, Weinstein forced her to perform oral sex on him. “I said, over and over, ‘I don’t want to do this, stop, don’t’.”Madden,  a production assistant who worked at Miramax for a decade, told the Times that Weinstein allegedly “prodded her for massages at hotels,” a common theme among the sources the Times’s reporters spoke with. On one occasion, she claims she locked herself in his hotel bathroom, sobbingJudd recounted for the Times how Weinstein allegedly harassed her while she was filming Kiss the Girls in 1996, inviting her to his hotel room and asking her for a massage, then inviting her to watch him shower. McGowan reportedly reached a “previously undisclosed” $100,000 settlement with Weinstein in 1997, over an incident that occurred in a hotel roomMimi Haleyi said she was assaulted by Weinstein in what appeared to be a child\u0027s bedroom in his New York City apartment in 2006 when she was in her 20s.Nestor had been temping at the Weinstein Company for only one day in 2014 when Weinstein allegedly offered to boost her career in return for sexual favours, according to the Times. She declined and reportedly complained of his behaviour to colleagues, who later passed the information on to senior executives. An internal Weinstein Company document cited by the Times describes Nestor’s encounter with Weinstein as follows: “She said he was very persistent and focused though she kept saying no for over an hour”In March 2015, Battilana, an aspiring model and actress, was reportedly summoned to Weinstein’s office on a Friday night to discuss her career. Lauren O’Connor,  an employee of the Weinstein Company, penned a memo to executives alleging “a toxic environment for women” at the company. The memo cited numerous incidents of Weinstein harassing or coercing women who worked for him. She expressed fear that Weinstein was using her and other female employees to “facilitate liaisons with ‘vulnerable women who hope he will get them work.’” That same year, Weinstein allegedly reached a settlement with O’ConnorThe actor, who starred in the Weinstein Company films Serendipity and The Aviator, alleges that she was invited to Weinstein’s hotel room at the age of just 17. When she approached the door, the producer reportedly greeted her dressed in just a dressing gown.The actor alleges that after he cast her in the title role of the film Emma when she was 22, he took her to his hotel room, placed his hands on her and suggested massages.Italian actress Asia Argento has alleged that in 1997 Weinstein forcibly performed oral sex on her as she repeatedly told him to stop.The British model and actress penning an Instagram post claiming that Weinstein had ordered her to kiss another woman in his hotel room, and tried to kiss her on the lips.Ashley Judd said she rebuffed Harvey Weinstein’s unwanted sexual advances by offering to consent only after she had won an Oscar.French actress Judith Godrèche said when she was 24 Weinstein invited her to his hotel room and asked to give her a massage.The Oscar-winning actor said she found herself in a hotel room with Weinstein in 1995 where “he started massaging my shoulders, which made me very uncomfortable, and then tried to get more physical, sort of chasing me around.” According to an interview in The New Yorker Weinstein subsequently arrived at her apartment late at night and she had to call a friend to come over to pose as her boyfriend in order to get Weinstein out of the house.The actress said Weinstein undressed and chased her around a living room when she was just 23. She subsequently felt that telling others meant “I’ll never work again and no one is going to care or believe me,” she told the New York Times.As an aspiring actress and working in a restaurant in New York, Tomi-Ann Roberts encountered Weinstein who encouraged her to audition for one of his films back in 1984. She subsequently went to meet him and found him naked in the bath and invited her to get naked and get into the bath with him, she told the New York Times. She said she left feeling manipulated.It has also been alleged that the disgraced film producer propositioned Myleene Klass with a “sex contract” at Cannes Film Festival in 2010.Sophie Dix, best known for her role as Captain Sadie Williams in Soldier Soldier, described her encounter with Weinstein when she was 23 as “the single most damaging thing that’s happened in my life”.The actor and director claims she had to fight off Weinstein after he brought her to his hotel room during what she remembers to be 2012.British actress Claire Forlani wrote on Twitter that she had evaded Weinstein’s advances on five occasions at the age of 25. At meetings with the Hollywood a-lister, she says “massage was suggested”, and that Weinstein had boasted of all the women he’d had sex with.French actress Florence Darel claimed Weinstein relentlessly pursued her in the mid 1990\u0027s and propositioned her while Eve Chilton, his wife at the time, was in the hotel room next door. “I was astonished,” she told People magazine. “When you have someone so physically disgusting in front of you, continuing and continuing as though this was all perfectly normal… What happened to me may not be illegal but it was inappropriate. Very inappropriate.”Lysette Anthony, who starred as Marnie Nightingale in Hollyoaks, has claimed Weinstein raped her in the late 1980\u0027s after turning up to her London home in the late 1980’s. She described the disgraced film producer’s alleged attack as “pathetic and revolting” and said it left her feeling “disgusted and embarrassed”.Dunning said she met Weinstein in 2003 when she was 24-years-old and the disgraced film producer suggested she have a threesome with him and someone else. She told the New York Times Weinstein got angry when she refused.Rosanna Arquette was already well known for her role in Desperately Seeking Susan, when she said she met Weinstein at his hotel to pick up a script in the early nineties. Weinstein was dressed only in a dressing gown, and tried to put her hand on his erect penis.

However, Matthew Maguire, machinist and secretary of the Central Labor Union (CLU) in New York has also been posited as an alternative source.The first Labor Day was duly held on 5 September 1882 in New York City at the instigation of the CLU, with a street parade held in Union Square.Other cities followed suit and Oregon became the first state to make it an official holiday in 1887. By 1894, 34 states observed the date, prompting the president, Grover Cleveland, to sign a bill into law that June making it an official national holiday. \u0026nbspWhy was the holiday so timely?\u0026nbspPresident Cleveland’s bill coincided with one of the darkest episodes in the history of American industrial relations: the Pullman Strike.The result of unrest born of poor working conditions and wages, the dispute saw 4,000 American Railway Union (ARU) workers employed at the Pullman Company plant on Chicago’s South Side engage in a series of wildcat strikes between 11 May and 20 July 1894.Pullman, a manufacturer of railroad cars, ran the local community as a company town, refusing to let its employees own their own homes. When it sacked operatives and slashed wages without lowering rents and utility bills, its staff downed tools in protest.World news in picturesA Somali soldier walks near the wreckage of vehicles at the scene of a blast outside the compound of a district headquarters in the capital Mogadishu, Somalia.

It\u0026rsquos noticeable that autumn is the only season blessed with a decent adjective: autumnal. and the best the others can do is springlike, wintry and summery \u0026ndash no cadence, no style, no charm. \u0026ldquoSummer afternoon, summer afternoon, said novelist Henry James, \u0026ldquoto me those have always been the most beautiful words in the English language. Well, to each his own but James certainly wouldn\u0026rsquot have said that about \u0026ldquosummery. But \u0026ldquoautumnal, full of atmosphere. It conjures misty mornings, golden leaves, the subtle interlude between the banality of summer and the frigidity of winter and with none of the hectic excitement of spring. It\u0026rsquos a time for mature contemplation. Perhaps I like autumn because I am in the autumn of my years (and that may be putting it kindly). Perhaps it requires a certain maturity. Fully 10 years ago I was walking along a river bank with my friend Andrew, past some residential barges. \u0026ldquoHello, said a man from his deck, \u0026ldquowhere are you going? \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore just two middle-aged men out on a walk, said Andrew. \u0026ldquoMiddle-aged? said the man, \u0026ldquoyou\u0026rsquoll be lucky.Britons can continue to enjoy the sunny spells as autumn arrives (Image: )Whether you are in the autumn of your years you cannot really say until it\u0026rsquos over because autumn means you\u0026rsquore only three-quarters through. If it turns out you never reach winter then I suppose this was winter. No other season has inspired a song to compare with Autumn Leaves (\u0026ldquoI miss you most of all my darling when autumn leaves start to fall) \u0026ndash try Nat King Cole, or the original French Les Feuilles Mortes (C\u0026rsquoest une chanson qui nous resemble, Toi tu m\u0026rsquoaimais, et je t\u0026rsquoaimais)\u0026ndash try Yves Montand. And those well into the autumn of life will surely remember the 1967 song by the brilliant 23-year-old Ray Davies (fresh from making Waterloo Sunset earlier that year): \u0026ldquoBreeze blows leaves of a mustycoloured yellow So I sweep them in my sack, Yes, yes, yes, it\u0026rsquos my autumn almanac.

The Irish backstop, effectively, asserts that they have the right to demand that we separate a part of the United Kingdom from the rest of the United Kingdom.\u0026ldquoThat is unacceptable to all Conservatives - probably to most British people.Brexit news: Nick Boles said Theresa May\u0027s Brexit proposal is wrong (Image: \u0026bullBBC)Mr Boles said there is a \u0026ldquovery very small chance of the Chequers plan getting through Parliament.

Far left Trotskyite infiltrators — operating under the banner of the Militant Tendency — took over the city council.Under the leadership of the charismatic but confrontational Derek Hatton they were set on purging traditional Labour voices and creating Moscow on the Mersey.They ramped up tension between the city and central Government by playing politics with council jobs.Their antics provoked then Labour leader Neil Kinnock into giving one of his most famous speeches when he condemned the “grotesque chaos” of a Labour Council sending redundancy notices to its own workers by taxi. Eventually, the moderates won, Militant was defeated and the city was saved.But now, fast forward 33 years and another titanic struggle for the future of Labour is being played out in Merseyside.Veteran Labour MP Frank Field who was the target of Militant in the Eighties, has sensationally been thrown out of the party he’s served all his life after resigning the whip in protest at the rise of the new extremists.But this time it’s not just Liverpool that’s being taken over by the hard Left but the Labour Party itself.And instead of Labour’s leader mounting a fightback for moderation, as Neil Kinnock did, the leadership of Jeremy Corbyn is the heart of the problem.Corbyn will be in Liverpool later this month for Labour’s own party conference — where the fate of the party may be decided.Will it cement victory for the new militants, now calling themselves Momentum, or be the moment that we get, in every sense, the opposition we need?I’ve known Frank for many years and he’s Labour to the core.He’s dedicated his life to fighting poverty. He has been a tough critic of my party and speaks with the moral authority of someone whose whole life has been given to serving the poorest.He pursued Philip Green over the collapse of BHS and got millions back for the company’s pensioners.But because Frank is an authentic spokesman for working people, including on issues like Brexit, he’s been targeted by the new militants who want everyone to follow Comrade Corbyn’s rigid party line.Frank is also heir to the Old Labour tradition of fighting racism and intolerance wherever it comes from. A war baby, he cherishes the role Labour played in defeating fascism. So when he takes such a stand against the party he loves, and does so citing the leader’s own complicity in anti-Semitism, then this is an alarm bell no-one can ignore.Other Merseyside MPs including Luciana Berger and Louise Ellman have also spoken out against rising anti-Semitism and intolerance within Labour ranks and the abuse they have received is truly shocking.The question now must be, will others follow Frank?With not just local parties, but the leadership itself, implacably in the grip of the hard Left, can moderates stay, and thus lend cover and credibility to the current leader?Labour was the party, when Frank was a boy, which helped create the state of Israel as a homeland for the Jewish people, which helped build Nato as a bulwark of Western values and which put the interests of working people first.Now that Labour’s leadership is criticised by our own Chief Rabbi for its attitude to Israel and the Jewish community, now that Labour has a leader who doesn’t believe in Nato and a strong defence, now that Labour is more interested in single-issue protest than building a better future for workers, can the majority of Labour’s MPs, who are decent, hard-working and moderate, really stay?Frank is right to shine a light on the issue of anti-Semitism. And not just because it is truly horrendous that, after the horrors unleashed in the 20th Century, this intolerance should return.But also because attitudes towards the Jewish community are the best indicator of how free and progressive a country is.Throughout history, the countries where Jewish people have felt safest, like the Netherlands and the UK, have been among the world’s freest.Countries where Jewish people have faced growing prejudice, like Germany and Russia during the last century, have been countries slipping into darkness.And as the Chief Rabbi has reminded us, what starts with prejudice against Jewish people spreads to taint society more widely.The Jewish community is the canary in the coal mine.And if our democracy is to stay strong then we need to have political parties that are broad-based social movements and not increasingly ideological sects.I am a Tory but I grew up to admire and respect the patriotic Labour tradition of people like Clement Attlee, Ernie Bevin, Jim Callaghan, Peter Shore, Barbara Castle and Frank Field.I wish him well and hope that his bravery will prove the wake-up call his party and the country needs to ensure there’s a sensible party of the centre left once more.NO more heroes any more, the Stranglers sang. Well, they reckoned without Lewis Pugh, a man whose grit, endurance, idealism and dedication make him the very model of a modern hero.Lewis is the endurance swimmer who powered his way into the record books this week by covering the length of the English Channel – from Land’s End to Dover – in 50 days.He covered the 330 miles – past the Eddystone Lighthouse, the Isle of Wight and Dungeness Power station – in just Speedos, cap and goggles.In stormy waters, sometimes swimming in the dead of night, through rain and high winds, with shoulder injuries, jellyfish stings and treacherous currents to slow him down, Lewis triumphed in a trial of character and cojones, which takes the breath away.But what drove Lewis on was not a desire to etch his name in the record books.It was a swelling passion for our seas, the wildlife in them and the future of our planet.In our own waters, and across the globe, the seas have suffered as a result of past exploitation, the growing danger from climate change, acidification and the rising tide of plastic waste.We have an opportunity to change that now.Leaving the EU’s Common Fisheries Policy means we can have a more sustainable approach to managing the fish in our seas.And reducing our reliance on single-use plastics, as well as improving recycling, can stem the flow of waste into our seas.But there is still more to do and making sure that more of the Earth’s surface is protected from exploitation is critical.Lewis records that during the length of his swim he encountered jellyfish in abundance, happy to bask in our warming waters, but far fewer fish, dolphins and other marine wildlife than he would have expected.As another modern hero, Sir David Attenborough, has reminded us, our Blue Planet is a precious but fragile place and we all have a responsibility to think about our impact on our seas.But the good news is that more and more people in Britain are cutting down on plastic, recycling more and helping nature recover, which is heroic in itself.The tech giant is planning to co-operate with China to censor material online.But it won’t respond to calls from the UK, US and others to co-operate in removing horrific images of abuse.The company’s motto used to be “Don’t be evil” but that was dropped earlier this year. Now we know why.I’M not surprised Prince Harry burst into song – albeit briefly – when he and wife Meghan met the cast of hit musical Hamilton.The hip-hop lyrics are infectiously catchy, so much so the Gove family often sing along to them in the car.And a musical about breaking free from an overbearing and distant overlord who doesn’t govern in your interests does have a special resonance for us.Happily, she accepted and will presumably now promise to forsake all udders.SAD to see the lovely Kirsty Young having to take a break from Desert Island Discs to battle fibromyalgia.This terrible condition – marked by chronic pain and extreme fatigue – has no ready cure.It can strike any of us down, casting a shadow over even the simplest pleasures.I hope Kirsty recovers soon ­– and I also hope that the light shone on this illness hastens progress towards a cure.Almost everything you need for a healthy, balanced diet can be sourced from British farms and fishermen.And you know it will have been caught or grown in a way that respects the environment.Instead of our diet going south, why not save on the food miles and help the planet by buying British?THE return of Strictly to our screens this autumn divides the Gove household. But not in the way you might think.My wife can’t stand the show and my daughter cringes at it – but my son and I are hooked.We’ve cheered on Ed Balls’ Gangnam Style and rooted for Susan Calman last year.This year I think Casualty actor Charles Venn and Paralympian Lauren Steadman could become popular favourites.But no, I won’t be harbouring dreams of joining in.

They trust our laws and our financial services, they admire our Armed Forces and they envy our universities.Actually, that’s not quite true: everywhere I go in the world, except right here in the UK.There are some who can’t or won’t see the natural advantages we have and the opportunities that exist for us. I get frustrated when some people purposefully choose to ignore good news such as last week when China opened up their market to UK dairy products.Britain can and should be confident and the world needs a confident Britain.A confident Britain can bang the drum for free trade across the world, as more and more countries look to pull up the drawbridge and turn away from the huge benefits that we have seen in poverty alleviation.A confident Britain can work with African countries to tackle extremism and instability which threatens millions of people across the world, including right here in the UK, as the Prime Minister promised to do this week.A confident Britain with an independent seat at the World Trade Organisation can be a leading voice for free trade and prosperity.A confident Britain is good for the world, and it’s good for us at home too. Why?Because free trade means we can sell more world-class British goods and services across the globe. That means safeguarding and creating jobs as well generating revenues for the Treasury to spend on our vital public services.That’s why I launched the Export Strategy last month: to turn the UK into a 21st Century exporting superpower.We need to work together to ­create a more confident Britain that can export to the world.To do that, we need to support business the length and breadth of the whole UK.Over 99 per cent of our businesses are small or medium-sized, and 96 per cent are micro-sized, employing fewer than nine people.That means many thousands of Sun on Sunday readers either own one or work for one.You are the lifeblood of our economy — it’s your entrepreneurship, risk-taking and innovation that drives the entire economy.It’s your wealth creation that provides the income we all depend on for our public services, from funding our NHS to paying our brave Armed Forces.It also means that you might not be exporting — yet — because more than 90 per cent of companies aren’t currently seizing the opportunities of exporting.That’s where we can help.Government doesn’t manufacture products and doesn’t provide services for exporting.But we can help create the right conditions by intervening where only government can.We have created a network of Her Majesty’s Trade Commissioners to lead the Government’s trade and investment promotion and policy in high-growth regions across the world.And I as International Trade Secretary can step in and speak to foreign ministers about overcoming a trade barrier — as I did last week, when I signed a deal in Beijing to enable the UK to export seed potatoes to China or help a UK company close a deal in an overseas market or seal a partnership with a foreign company.And to support British businesses — whether they produce farm products, or manufacture playgrounds, or provide legal services — we are also creating a network of Export Champions, people who run businesses that successfully export, to guide their peers and share their expertise.As I’ve often said before, in the next ten to 15 years, around 90 per cent of global economic growth is expected to be outside the EU.I truly believe that Brexit is an ­opportunity.The positive response and engagement we’ve seen from the EU negotiators to the Chequers proposals makes me believe that a good deal is now more likely.At Chequers the Government agreed its proposal for an economic partnership with the EU after the UK leaves on March 29, 2019.It confirmed that the UK will leave the Single Market and the Customs Union and will seize new opportunities from trading with the rest of the world.That’s why the Prime Minister visited Africa, one of the fastest-growing regions in the world, this week.It’s why I visited China last week, and am visiting India later in the autumn, to ensure Britain can make the most of their breakneck growth.Booming countries across the globe are confident in Britain.They’re confident in our crucial role in supporting world prosperity, world security and world growth.If they have faith in us, we need to have more faith. Because a more confident Britain is a better Britain for the world.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

What’s more, do they care?More than 17million people voted to leave the EU. Most have not changed their minds. They want our politicians to get on with it.Mrs May has also claimed that she is going to start focusing on her domestic agenda. About time.Away from Twitter and Westminster, voters aren’t worried about the latest Project Fear smear.They care about the NHS, schools, being able to afford a home, and money in their pockets.Mrs May said she was the PM for the “Just About Managings”. She has the chance to build an economy that, in her words, “works for everyone”.Last week, she was right to call for foreign aid to be used to assist Britain’s trade in Africa.It was even refreshing to see the PM show some character through her dancing.OK, she won’t win Strictly, but it was at least endearing.

It will replace an out-of-date system currently used by local authorities and utility firms to share data on the countries’ 2.5 million roadworks.Planning for roadworks is also set to be better co-ordinated and prevent drivers getting caught up in knock-on roadworks. Aids including Google maps and Waze will have access to the information. Satnavs and smartphones are also likely to benefit from the changes allowing motorists to choose a new route.Roadworks cost the economy £4 billion as employees are late for work and deliveries are delayed. A typical motorist faces £1,168 in costs for sitting in queues wasting fuel and time, research from traffic experts Inrix found earlier this year.London had the longest hold-ups last year with motorists stuck in rush hour traffic for 74 hours every year.Roads Minister Jesse Norman said: “Roadworks can often be frustrating for motorists, especially when they cause hold-ups at busy times and delay journeys.“We want to reduce this disruption and delay, and Street Manager is just one of a number of actions we are taking so that local authorities and utility companies can better plan and manage their roadworks.“The data opened up by this new digital service should enable motorists to plan their journeys better, so they can avoid works and get to their destinations more easily.”Ministers are also today publishing new guidance on lane rental schemes including a new calculator for assessing costs and benefits. The schemes see utility firms charged £2,500 for carrying out roadworks at the busiest times.Utility firms are more likely to work with town halls to avoid charges and work at quieter times.

The well-off shouldnt get a hand out from government that pushes up the price of houses in already expensive markets.”He called for ministers to take more radical steps to reduce the cost of housing - such as relaxing planning laws and even scrapping the Green Belt.But developers today warned the Government that scrapping Help to Buy could prove devastating for the construction sector and housing market generally.David OLeary of the Home Builders Federation told the Sunday : As well as supporting hundreds of thousands of first-time buyers on to the housing ladder, Help to Buy has driven unprecedented growth in housing supply since 2013. Builders continue to invest in new land and labour to build more.Without the scheme in some form, the Governments ambition to deliver 300,000 new homes per year will be even tougher to achieve.A Government spokesman said: The vast majority of those using our Help to Buy equity loan scheme are first-time buyers, as we help a new generation of people own a home of their own.More than half of households using it earn less than £50,000, so we are also helping those on lower and middle incomes get on the property ladder.Shadow Housing Secretary John Healey called for a change to the status quo, saying: As it stands, the scheme is poorly targeted and poor value for taxpayers money. Help to Buy should be overhauled and tightly targeted on first-time buyers with ordinary incomes, as Labour has long-argued.Help to Buy Isa - Its a tax-free savings account where for every £200 you save, the government will add an extra £50. But theres a maximum limit of £3,000 which is paid to your solicitor when you move.Lifetime Isa - Another government scheme that gives anyone aged 18 to 39 the chance to save tax-free and get a bonus of up to £32,000 towards your first home. You can save up to £4,000 a year and the government will add 25 per cent on top.Shared ownership - Co-owning with a housing association means you can buy a part of the property and pay rent on the remaining amount. You can buy anything from 25 to 75 per cent of the property but youre restricted to specific ones.First dibs in London - London Mayor Sadiq Khan is working on a scheme that will restrict sales of all new-build homes in the capital up to £350,000 to UK buyers for three months before any overseas marketing can take place.Starter Home Initiative - A government scheme that will see 200,000 new-build homes in England to be sold to first-time buyers with a 20 per cent discount by 2020.

girl’s window air conditioner on the second floor and crawled inside through the opening, police sources said.He then allegedly raped the girl in her bed, officials said.But he dashed back out the window as she screamed to alert her mother, who rushed to her aid, the New York Post reports.The mum called cops but did not catch sight of the attacker, the sources said.By luck police were able to grab video-surveillance images of the suspect.On Saturday at 2:35 p.m., some 30 officers from the NYPD’s Emergency Service Unit and the 70th Precinct converged on ­Ayala at his hideaway in an under-construction three-story building at 930 Flatbush Ave.They pulled out the scrawny, hunched man, who was seen handcuffed and dressed in filthy black jeans and a red T-shirt.Ayala — who police sources said carried a federal Permanent Resident Card, also known as a “Green Card,” as his only identification — was led struggling into a police SUV.A high-level police source told The New York Post that investigators believe Ayala is a member of the violent MS-13 gang.Cheers and taunts rose from a crowd of dozens of spectators as Ayala was hauled out.Some applauded and took pictures on their phones.“They got him!” one man yelled.“He raped somebody, an 11-year-old girl,” another onlooker said.Ayala was charged Saturday night with sexually motivated burglary and first-degree rape.He

But we owe it to children to do more. We must and I will.”In a strong hint of the ultimatum for tech firms coming today, Mr Javid adds: “I am also clear that all parts of society must play their part in this battle”.The Home Secretary also reveals the personal upset he has suffered since taking the job in April from detailed briefings on online child sex abuse.And he also revealed growth in horrific “abuse to order” services, where paedophiles direct abusers what to do to their victims over a two-way livestream.Mr Javid writes: “Invisible crime gangs are also now able to live stream these sick acts to online abusers for just over £10 – a quarter of what paedophiles were paying four years ago.“Abhorrent crimes where perverted offenders live stream the rape of innocent youngsters over a web cam – and are ordered to carry out gut-wrenching acts by their conspirators who are watching on a computer from the comfort of their own home.”He added: “They sicken me to the core. But I am also sickened by the sheer number of these vile abusers.“Horrifying cases like this leave an emotional scar on me as well.”Mr Javid will also offer more money today to the NCA and police forces fighting online child sex abuse.His ultimatum follows Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt’s searing attack on Google last week for refusing to cooperate with police forces to take down child abuse content.Children’s charity Barnardo’s last night welcomed Mr Javid’s new drive.Its chief executive Javed Khan said: “All children with access to the internet are potentially vulnerable to being groomed online and sexually or criminally exploited offline.“Of the victims of online grooming referred to Barnardo’s specialist support services, we know that nearly two thirds of them, some as young as 10, had also gone on to meet their attacker and were sexually exploited.”In a coordinated effort, the National Crime Agency also last night pleaded with tech companies to cooperate with police investigations more.Its officer in charge of child sexual abuse, Director Rob Jones, called on the California-based giants to be far more proactive on stopping sick material ever appearing on their platfroms.Mr Jones said: “The technology exists for industry to stop these images being shared.The monsters who commit these acts are beyond contempt.It’s staggering that there are 80,000 of them prowling the net — the equivalent of FOUR packed-out O2 arenas — and we must tackle these horrendous crimes with all the force Britain can muster.The police must be given the resources they need to find and pursue these twisted individuals.Social services and local council staff, who have in the past too happily looked away from systematic abuse in places like Rochdale and Rotherham, must be properly trained and report their suspicions accurately.But the tech companies who allow their platforms to be filled with depraved filth need to do more, too.Their deliberate ignorance is part of a pattern.Whether it’s far-right extremism, anti-Semitism or terrorist propaganda, firms such as Facebook and Twitter are all too happy to turn a blind eye.The web has turned into the Wild West, and the companies profiting from it refuse to play sheriff.If they continue to abandon their responsibilities, they can have no complaints if the Government steps in, sooner rather than later.The Home Secretary must act if the billionaires refuse to do so.Keeping our kids safe is all that matters.“Whilst some online platforms have taken important steps to improve safety, we are asking them to take it to the next step to innovate, to use their brightest minds, and to invest in preventing these online offences from happening in the first place.“That would significantly reduce the trauma to the victims whose images are shared, prevent other individuals from developing a sexual interest in children through accessing these images, and disrupt the methods used to access them.”National Police Chiefs Council lead for child protection Chief Constable Simon Bailey added: Only by working collaboratively with technology companies and law enforcement partners will we be able to minimise the risk posed to children online by predatory offenders.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

She’s now filed a human rights complaint.Speaking to the Osoyoos Times she said: “No male employee is required to wear an undershirt.

They’re not hanging down by my waist. If they were, whose problem is it but mine? These things happen and these things aren’t right.”Miss Schell said she confronted the golf club’s manager, Doug Robb, and he allegedly told her the dress code was for her protection.She claimed he told her: “I know what happens in golf clubs when alcohol is involved.”Employment lawyer David Brown said dress codes that apply different rules for different genders could be viewed as discriminatory under the British Columbia Human Rights Code.He said: It’s an interesting question as to whether or not an employer can dictate the underwear that women can wear, but they don’t say anything about the underwear that men can wear, and does that create an adverse impact on the individual?”Mr Robb declined to comment, saying employee matters were confidential.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

That is an incredible open sesame door”.Insisting that it is inevitable that the PM will have to give more ground under her current plan, he added: “The other argument I made at that Chequers Cabinet was this won’t be the last step.“You know, they will not accept this.”The former Cabinet minister also revealed he will join hard Brexiteer rebels to vote against any Brexit deal based on Chequers plan during a final Commons showdown, after having resigned over it.And he dubbed her blueprint – where the UK would agree to a common rule book with the EU on goods but not services – is “almost worse than being in”.Some Tory eurosceptics last night suggested Mrs May’s compromsies hint was an attempt to prepare voters for more climbdowns at a crucial meeting of EU leaders in the Austrian town of Salzburg in two weeks time.One senior party figure said: “What the f*** was that about? The only two explanations are either utter incompetence, or No10 laying the ground to give away something else before conference.As more and more European leaders turn on Michel Barnier and the EU’s negotiating team for pushing Britain too far, now is the time to tell them it’s DEAL or NO DEAL.What the Prime Minister cannot do — either for the country’s future or for her own — is betray the millions of people who voted to leave.No concessions on freedom of movement. No cash unless it comes with benefits that far outweigh the price tag.She left the door alarmingly ajar yesterday by saying she wouldn’t row back unless it’s in the ‘national interest’.David Davis is right to be concerned that the EU will see that as an invitation to make more demands.She needs to slam that door shut and tell Brussels that if they don’t want a deal, we’ll be fine on our own.And continue to plan for a clean break.Mr Davis’s broadside came as the number of Tory MPs opposing the Chequers plan on both sides of the party’s Brexit divide continued to pile up ahead of Parliament’s return tomorrow  for an Autumn session of high drama.In a second major headache for Mrs May, a new challenge on her also emerged from a senior former Remainer MP.Ex Tory minister Nick Boles called on her to dump Chequers and apply for Britain to join the European Economic Area when Brexit happens as a stopgap to negotiate from a stronger position.Pro-EU Tory MP Sarah Wollaston added: “Why is Government carrying on as if the ERG \u0026amp Corbyn’s votes aren’t set to sink the Chequers Plan?“This chaos is leaving the rest of us at higher risk of a disastrous No-Deal.”International Trade Secretary Liam Fox also refused to rule out having to make any more compromises, saying: “We have to understand this is a negotiation”.But Dr Fox also warned against rumours of a fresh putsch to oust Mrs May and install Boris Johnson being orchestrated by her forme election chief Sir Lynton Crosby.He argued: “Changing the leader doesn’t change the parliamentary arithmetic and that is part of the problem we have at the present time”.But the trade boss also reopened a furious Cabinet spat to slam Chancellor Philip Hammond’s predictions that a hard Brexit would blow a £80bn hole in the Treasury’s coffers by 2030.Dr Fox said: “The idea we can predict what our borrowing will be 15 years in advance is a little hard to swallow”.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He knows now.Last week, Field quit the Labour Party whip amid a barrage of “intolerance, nastiness and intimidation” from Corbyn outriders over his stand against anti-Semitism.Along with other moderate Labour MPs, he was battered by Twitter storms using the vilest language to wish him dead.Field bluntly accuses Jeremy Corbyn of racism and hints he is ready to force a by-election if kicked out of the Labour Party. Others facing deselection may follow suit.Leadership critics have endured relentless bullying and abuse, a trademark of the brutal machine which swept Jezza to power and intends to keep him there. As Frank Field himself now admits, Corbyn is going nowhere.The party might split but the ageing hippy “will lead Labour into the next election”. Corbyn’s sullen anti-Semitism triggered this revolt, but it is only a symptom of the sinister nature of hard-Left politics which brooks no criticism.Labour really is the Nasty Party. Jezza’s pro-Russian, anti-capitalist malcontents loathe everything the UK and other Western democracies stand for.They support some of the world’s most brutal tyrannies and catastrophic economies while railing against free speech and Press freedom.Corbyn sees no evil in these repressive forces and this week shelved an invitation from MI5 chiefs to show him the secret intelligence. On such evidence alone, it is fair to say Corbyn as PM would permanently damage this country, its freedoms and its prosperity.We knew all this when Ed Miliband threw open the party’s leadership to anyone with three quid to buy a vote. Thanks to his stunning act of stupidity, the “broad church” Labour Party of Clem Attlee, Hugh Gaitskell, John Smith and Tony Blair is history.It lives on in name only, an empty husk colonised by Momentum parasites who once fought the party they now own. Corbyn didn’t even want the job, telling supporters: “You’d better make f***ing sure I don’t win.”When he surprised himself by storming to victory in 2015, shell-shocked Blairite MPs assumed they could get rid of him if he stepped too far out of line.They tried that in 2016 — turning Jezza into the unassailable champion of the loony Left and handing over the keys to the asylum. Theresa May bolted him in place with her botched General Election. No wonder the Glastonbury millennials cooed: “Oh, Jeremy Corbyn.”Have we learned from Frank Field’s mistake? Or do we believe, as he did, voters will never be silly enough to give Corbyn the keys to power? Well, look at the polls. They show nobody much rates Jezza, but Labour remains neck and neck with the Tories.Theresa May has yet to navigate her way to a tricky Brexit deal with Brussels — or to a no-deal rejected by Commons Remainers. She has rightly turned her face against a second referendum, a democratic abomination.But who knows who will be leader by then? Boris Johnson is circling, helped by a growing team of sponsors and supporters. Mrs May would do anything to stop BoJo. She is even seeking official advice on another snap election gamble. Good luck with that, Theresa. But Remainers should be careful what they wish for.Corbyn, a fervent fan of arch-Eurosceptic Tony Benn, loathes the EU as much as the angry Labour supporters who voted Leave. But he would conveniently bury that hatred for the time being if it meant riding a Remainer wave into Downing Street.Pro-Brussels campaigner Keir Starmer would emerge, not for the first time, as a “useful idiot”.The Purge will have just begun.At a media event before his referendum, the ex-oil analyst confidently bet the price would not crash below 50 a barrel. It did. He sent me my winnings but they apparently went astray.So he offered double-or-quits. The price stayed below 50 for yet another year – and is still only a bit higher today. My winnings, £60 in today’s money, allegedly went to a charity. I never saw any evidence of that either.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I asked who he was and his name and last name sounded very familiar.I kept asking where he was from and he told me that he was from San Jose, California, and that he was a premature baby born at our hospital.I then got very suspicious because I remember being the primary nurse to a baby with the same last name.

A further 13% said their puppy had fallen ill in the first 12 months but went on to recover. The Kennel Club survey comes after the Government announced plans last month to ban the sale of puppies and kittens by pet shops and other third-party dealers.  The pledge was a victory for the Mirror’s Lucy’s law campaign, named after a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel rescued from a Welsh puppy farm five years ago. The Kennel Club warned that puppies were being put at risk by a culture of “instant gratification”.  Its poll of 2,176 dog owners found one in three people do less than two hours’ research when buying a puppy, while 12% of people - equating to roughly a million dogs - pay for their puppy before they have even seen it.

The move, which risks widening the rift between moderate MPs and hard-left activists, would make it easier to oust those who are seen as disloyal to the party leader. Some backbenchers have spoken privately of fearing being “purged” in reselection battles.  Momentum, which grew out of the grassroots campaign to elect Mr Corbyn Labour leader, said in a statement: Recognising the groundswell of support from ordinary Labour members, Momentum  would like to affirm its commitment to the creation of a more open, inclusive selection process which would open the door to a new generation of Labour MPs.   Labour has to nurture the talent of its half a million members and we cannot let an outdated rulebook hold back a new generation of MPs. Labour\u0027s selection procedure should be democratic, give a fair chance to all candidates and encourage positive campaigning. “This means ending the divisive practise of forcing activists to campaign against sitting MPs and replacing it with a process that is open from the start.” It claims that opening up the selection process “will create a more level playing field between candidates”.  The statement added: Labour MPs need to stay close to their communities, in tune with their needs and understand that the deep, collective knowledge of our half a million members - who live and work in every kind of community across Britain - is an invaluable resource which must be utilised.

The Tory record since 2010 is woeful after destructive tax rises and spending cuts in George Osborne’s so-called long -term economic plan snuffed out a promising recovery \u0026shyinherited from Gordon Brown’s Labour. Osborne’s successor as Chancellor of the Exchequer, Philip Hammond watched, politically powerless in the Treasury, as Brexit extinguished much of what growth existed, plunging Britain into the relegation zone alongside Italy. The cost of austerity and Brexit’s lost years will be eye-boggling when the sums are finally calculated, costing every person in the country thousands of pounds.  We’re enduring inflation rising faster than incomes, low productivity and too many of the jobs created paying less than a living wage. Oh, and the Tories are still borrowing and a national debt now \u0026pound1.8trillion will continue to climb for years to come, despite the Conservatives fetishising reductions and vowing to balance the books by 2015.

The anti-Semitism row damages Labour on two counts. Vile racism’s a uniquely poisonous stain on a movement preaching decency, Gordon Brown rightly arguing eradication is a battle for the party’s soul. And some of Jeremy Corbyn’s internal, as well as external political, opponents realise continued attacks consume oxygen a leader could otherwise use to champion Left-wing radical alternative answers. Theresa May is exhibit one by remaining mainly mute on Islamophobia in her own ranks while highlighting Labour’s woes.

One family dressed as The Incredibles, while other people had disguised themselves as Dalmatians for a charity mixed netball tournament.  The event, in aid of former Exeter Chiefs rugby player Ian Stewart who has terminal cancer, was due to start at 8.30am but the mishap meant he teams didn\u0027t get in until 10.45am, Devon Live reports.  Exeter players and many families were among those left twiddling their thumbs outside West Exe School in the city in scenes described as shambolic by local residents who faced disruption as a result of the crowd. A spokeswoman for Sodexo, which manages events at the premises out of school hours, said: “The person who was supposed to turn up and open the gates is a part-time adhoc Sodexo employee.  Unfortunately he did sleep in this morning and when were alerted we got an out of hours member of staff to open up the venue. “We would like to apologise for any inconvenience.” The event has gone ahead and is being held in aid of retired rugby player Ian Stewart and his family. Event organiser Anita Palmer, chairman of West Exe Netball Club, said: “I was here at 8.10am and the employee should have been here to unlock the gates at 7.30am but I was told he overslept. “I was told at 10am he was 10 minutes away but no one came until 10.45am and it wasn’t him. “It has meant about 500 people and their cars have been on Hatherleigh Road this morning. Half of the Exeter Chief players are here. “We have had people travel from as far away as Wales and London. It’s been chaos and understandably the local residents have not been happy. “The girls at the netball club have been wonderful putting the event together so quickly, and it was all booked and paid for so to have this happen is awful.” Among those who are taking part in today’s event is the Bassett family who are donning The Incredibles fancy dress costumes. They said: “It has been an absolute shambles. All these people have come together for the charity event and have just been stood here.” The event, involving 34 teams - including rugby and football players - was scheduled to run from 10.20am to 5pm, and the fancy dress theme is Disney as the Stewart family are self-confessed ‘Disney nuts’. It has been organised by West Exe Netball Club which Ian’s daughter attends.

It emerged today that the thief apparently managed to escape on August 7 with around \u0026pound300 worth of gear - in a store which has been known to stock expensive items by signature brands such as Gucci and Jimmy Choo.  Members of the royal family are understood to have donated unwanted items to the shop on Gloucester Road in the past - but there is no indication that anything they might have given in the past was taken.   According to The Sun , the thief apparently managed to gain access to the premises with little effort after picking up a set of keys left with the coffee shop opposite.  He is said to have claimed to them he was an Oxfam volunteer who had come to collect the keys.  He reportedly let himself into the shop on Gloucester Road an hour before it opened at 10am before loading the stolen goods onto a van parked outside.

Whether it be squishing grapes and trifle or simply being paid to have a pedicure Julie Preston AKA Mistress Dita is happy to help.  While she admits the weirdest thing she has ever done is feed a man from Grimsby dog muck she says she does turn her nose up at certain practices, Hull Live reports.  “I get asked to do plenty of stuff which I refuse to do,” Julie said. “But probably the weirdest thing I have actually carried out was feeding a man from Grimsby dog muck. I don’t even have a dog and had to collect it from a neighbour.”  “We get a lot of requests for people wanting to be babies,” she said. “I offer it on my premises but it is carried out by someone else and they act like a nanny. “It is often very powerful people like judges and CEOs who enjoy it and want a break from all that responsibility. They want to regress completely.” Julie is a big name on the one-time European city pf culture\u0027s sex scene and says feet have proved a fascination for many of her clients. “Foot fetish is massive,” she said. “I had no idea when I got into the industry how popular it was. “I have been doing this for ten years now and it is now a huge part of what we do and is one of the most popular services we offer. “People seem to enjoy kissing my feet bare foot or with stockings. Some like it sweaty and when I’m wearing gym socks. “Others like to watch as I squish grapes or trifle and it seems to turn them on.”  Foot fetish seems to be the domain of males, according to Julie. “Hardly any women seem to be into it, it is definitely the guys,” she said. “I go kickboxing and I get requests not to wash my feet afterwards. “Some just want to give you a foot massage or paint your toe nails. Some even pay for me to have a pedicure and watch or get me to take photos. “Foot fetish has always been a thing and seems to be associated with stockings and legs. Sometimes people like to when you wear old fashioned stockings and high heels. “People think it is strange but is it really any different to me liking Tom Hardy lookalikes?” she said. “It is just something people are into. “It is actually a really easy thing for me to do as I don’t really have to do anything.

Single mum-of-two Cleo Duckett, 46, said she discovered her bank account had just \u0026pound8 left in it on Friday night. Cleo, from Cefn Glas in Bridgend and on benefits as she suffers from polio and is on a wheelchair, said she has had to dig funds out of her son\u0027s savings pot in order to make until her next benefit payment on September 6. Fortnite is currently one of most popular video games among young people, garnering some 45 million players, according to Epic Games.  The programme contains in-game purchases where players can buy outfits and other items. Cleo, who receives around \u0026pound700 a month in benefits, said: I only found out about it all when I went to use the cash machine and there was only \u0026pound8 left in my account, she told Media Wales. Not long after that, Cleo received a text from the bank saying she was now in her overdraft. Cleo said: My son started crying and admitted everything that he had done. He had used my bank card behind my back, typed my details into his Xbox and bought lots of games on Fortnite.  He spent \u0026pound1,193.25, leaving me around \u0026pound245 into my overdraft. There was \u0026pound50 here and \u0026pound50 there \u0026pound60 here and \u0026pound66 there, and that\u0027s without the VAT. I think he must have been paying for different parts of the game. Cleo said she went to her bank in Cardiff on Saturday morning and was told by staff that it was her responsibility to cover the overdraft debt. The bank is refusing to help me because they said my boy is my responsibility and I am responsible for his actions, Cleo said. I\u0027m not a criminal. I haven\u0027t stolen the money or spent it on games for myself.

Now six months old and at home with his parents Katie Rhodes, 24, and Jay Taylor, 27, he is believed to be the smallest baby to survive in the UK.\u2028 Theo stopped growing in the womb and was so small doctors even offered Miss Rhodes a termination the day before he was born. \u2028 But the little fighter defied the odds to pull through despite weighing just 350g . \u2028 Theo was born early at 26 weeks and five days and Miss Rhodes, a support worker from Durham says he\u0027s a little fighter.  She added: Before he was born, it was really hard hearing all the time that he wasn\u0027t going to make it, and even when he was born that we might not get to take him home. \u2028 But we got through it by saying, \u0027no, he\u0027s made it this far, lets just support him\u0027. \u2028 We were so positive and kept saying that we would fight for him.\u2028 Mr Taylor added: I had never ever seen a baby that small - I didn\u0027t know babies could be that small. \u2028I kept saying to Katie that everything would be ok and he would be fine, but it wasn\u0027t until I saw him that I realised how serious things were. \u2028  I think that was the most scared I have ever been, but it was also a relief to see him.    Miss Rhodes\u0027 pregnancy was normal until the 19-week scan revealed Theo was smaller than expected. \u2028 Delivery driver Mr Taylor and Miss Rhodes discovered he\u0027d stopped growing and were told to expect the worse and prepare for a demise at almost every scan or meeting. \u2028 The mum-to-be was admitted to hospital with pre-eclampsia and three days later doctors performed an emergency c-section when tests showed Theo had fluid around his heart. \u2028 They were all really good and helpful and said they would do anything they could to help him, but right up until the day before he was born, we were offered an abortion, said Mr Taylor. \u2028 Doctors estimated he would be 450g - still below the 500g \u0027ideal\u0027 - but when he was born on March 15 at Newcastle\u0027s Royal Victoria Infirmary Theo was only 350g. \u2028 The couple only got to touch his hand for a few seconds before he was put on a breathing machine using the smallest possible tube. Doctors warned that he was so small he might not survive long enough to come home.\u2028  But his proud parents got to hold him properly after two weeks, and he was moved to a lower dependency ward when he was seven weeks old and 3lb.    Mr Taylor said: He was smaller than my hand and much smaller than they even thought he would be, but doctors said he didn\u0027t have any of the usual complications premature babies have. \u2028The doctor said he was about the weight of a can of Coke, but even when I picked up a can, it felt heavier than Theo. \u2028 On the day he was born one doctor said \u0027don\u0027t take for granted that you will be able to take him home\u0027. \u2028But he is proving everyone wrong. \u2028  The doctors that first looked after him came in over the weeks to see him and couldn\u0027t believe how well he was doing.   Theo, who was due on June 17, finally came home on July 7 weighing 7lb 4oz, after an operation to remove a hernia. \u2028He is still on nasal oxygen at home but is gradually being brought off it. Doctors don\u0027t think he\u0027ll suffer any problems in the future. Miss Rhodes added: It\u0027s much easier with him home now than in hospital. It feels like he has been with us for much longer than six months. It\u0027s weird to think that he was the smallest baby ever as he is so much bigger than he was and is doing so well now.

Beaches across the South East of England were packed, as temperatures soared to 23.5C  in London. The top temperature of 24.8C was recorded in Lossiemouth in Moray. The good weather is set to continue in much of the country this week with September forecast to be largely warm and sunny.    Bookmakers say it has the potential to be the hottest September on record – as Coral cut the odds from 2-1 to 6-4. It also has odds of 10-11 for 30C or higher to be recorded at some stage this month. Spokesman John Hill said: “A warm start has prompted a flurry of bets on this month ending as the hottest September on record. “The betting suggests temperatures will reach 30C or higher, so barbecues shouldn’t be put away just yet.”    But the forecast for this week shows much of the nation split down the middle, with the East and the South getting the best deal. Met office forecaster Steven Keats said: “There is going to be an East-West split through the week, with the East enjoying the warmer temperatures. “Overall though it is going to be a pretty typical September week for most with sunny days and the odd rainstorm. In the South and East, temperatures will peak at around 26C but in the North and West and Scotland there will be a chance of rain with the top temperature of 17C.” Autumn heatwaves are often referred to as Indian summers, but what does the term actually mean?  The Met Office Meteorological Glossary, first published in 1916, defines an Indian summer as a warm, calm spell of weather occurring in autumn, especially in October and November. The exact origins of the phrase are uncertain and several writers have speculated it may originally have referred to a spell of warm, hazy autumn conditions that allowed Native American Indians to continue hunting. Whatever the origin of the phrase, it was first used in the eastern United States.  The first recorded use of the phrase appears in a letter written by a Frenchman called John de Crevecoeur dated January 17 1778.  In his description of the Mohawk country he writes: Sometimes the rain is followed by an interval of calm and warm which is called the Indian summer. The term was first used in the UK in the early 19th century and went on to gain widespread usage.  But the concept of a warm autumn spell was not new to the UK. Previously, iations of Saint Martin\u0027s summer were widely used across Europe to describe warm weather surrounding St Martin\u0027s Day on November 11.  Yesterday also saw the formation of rare tornado-like funnels of wind that stunned residents across Cornwall. Amanda James, 45, spotted one while her son was playing in the garden in Truro. UK Southwest Storm Chasers Ltd said the clouds had been seen right around the county. According to the Met Office funnel clouds are spinning fingers of cloud that reach towards the ground or sea. Amanda said: “It was amazing.” "},{"url":null,"title":"woman who fled home wrapped","story":"NewsWoman who fled home wrapped in bedsheet after “monster” ex-boyfriend repeatedly stamped on her head slams soft sentenceKirsty Schofield, 38, of Bolton, had to flee to her neighbour\u0027s house wearing nothing but a bed sheet following the sustained and vicious attack in JuneShare\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCommentsByEmma CramptonEd McConnell17:06, 2 SEP 2018NewsBruising left by Bobby Stewart \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA woman left slipping in and out of conciousness after her thug ex repeatedly stamped on her head has branded his two-year prison sentence ridiculous. Victim Kirsty Schofield, 38, had to flee to her neighbour\u0027s home wearing just a bed sheet to escape vicious Bobby Stewart, 29. He\u0027d become obsessed by the idea she was cheating on him when he launched the sustained attack in June. Just four days earlier he\u0027d been released from police custody where he\u0027d been on remand for a similar attack. The assault left the mum-of-one fearing for her life and led to her dialling 999 and making what a judge described as one of the most desperate phone calls he had ever heard.  Stewart had arrived at her home after a day of drinking and eventually lost control and attacked Miss Schofield as she cowered underneath the bathroom sink. After a 30-minute stand-off, during which she begged Stewart to call an ambulance, she escaped to the safety of her neighbours, wearing only bed sheets. Last month at Bolton Crown Court Stewart stuck two fingers up at her as he was sentenced via video link. Judge Timothy Clayson jailed Stewart for 15 months for actual bodily harm and nine months to run concurrently for breaching a suspended sentence order and also imposed a restraining order banning him from contacting Miss Schofield.  Miss Schofield, of Bolton, said: I honestly didn\u0027t think he was going to stop until he killed me. He looked evil and that\u0027s when I saw him for what he was. Before I could always forgive him, but not after that. She says she suffered months of emotional and physical abuse fat the hands of Stewart, which turned her into a nervous wreck and affected her work and isolated her from friends. Stewart would check her phone daily, force her to block friends and family and even called her at work if she didn\u0027t respond to his texts immediately. Miss Schofield said: “I actually met Bobby through his sister who I worked with last July and staggeringly she warned me off him. “I didn’t listen though as in my eyes he was wonderful, but it didn’t take long for the abuse to start and after two months he started getting violent. “It’s easy to say now that I’m at the other side I should have left him but I couldn\u0027t. I thought he was the love of my life and I wanted to be there for him and fix him.”  The violence continued and Stewart was arrested for assault by beating but Kirsty dropped the charges before the case went to trial. Desperate to believe he had changed, she took him back but Stewart attacked Kirsty the day he was released. Miss Schofield added: “I hoped jail would make him change his ways and when he called me saying he loved me and he was so sorry I believed every single word. I was brainwashed.  “So I naively dropped all charges but I was so so wrong, I should have left him to rot where he deserved to be. “He wanted payback for me getting him locked up and he was obsessed with the idea I’d cheated on him. Which I would never do. He was screaming at me that he knew I had and he wouldn\u0027t stop until I admitted it. “He dragged me around my own home and demanded I didn’t go to work the next day as he didn’t want me to leave his sight, he was so paranoid and controlling.” Describing the final attack she said: “He had been drinking and burst into the flat again. He was adamant I had been unfaithful and demanded to look through my phone. “Ridiculously, the last person who had called me was a taxi driver saying he was outside and he even rang the firm convinced I was having an affair with the taxi driver. “His eyes were wild and he just saw red so I ran to the bathroom wrapped in bedsheets and cowered under the sink where he hit and kicked me and stamped on my head. “I was sick and kept going in and out of consciousness and I begged him to call an ambulance but he just sat there and said I deserved it.” "},{"url":null,"title":"cryptic last post instagram model","story":"NewsInstagram model\u0027s cryptic last post before mysterious death while working on billionaire\u0027s superyacht in GreecePolice said Sinead McNamara was found on the rear deck of the Mayan Queen IV - owned by Mexican mining magnate Alberto Baillères - in Argostoli on the Greek island of KefaloniaShare\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCommentsByLucy Clarke-Billings22:47, 2 SEP 2018Updated08:48, 3 SEP 2018NewsLocal media reports Miss McNamara was discovered in a critical condition and died on the way to a hospital \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailMystery over what happened to an Instagram model who died while working on a billionaire\u0027s superyacht deepened after a chilling message came to light.

But he couldn’t remember much about it, apart from a couple of his team-mates who were Hamish McAlpine and John Duncan.“Hamish, of course, went on to be a legend at Tannadice with Dundee United, while John stepped up to the big time with Dundee, and even more so with a transfer to Tottenham Hotspur.“Jim was a player with St Francis BC at the time and thinks he actually played in an age group below , and was pulled into the U/18 side.”The Black Trophy was a competition for U/18 select teams from all the different regions and associations in Scotland.The Dundee-based Angus Amateur FA won it in 1961-62, again in 1965-66 and in 69-70.I’ve told in previous columns how I was part of the 69-70 success, with the Grier brothers Billy, George and Lewis at the helm.I couldn’t uncover any information on this Black Trophy success in 65-66.If any reader has information on this, then please get in touch.Indeed, some may even have played in the team.However, as I was trying to gather information on Jim, something from his senior career emerged. It was the transfer that never was.The process of a possible transfer from Dundee United to Fulham was quite bizarre, as a cutting, from March 9, 1972, revealed:Jim Henry, Dundee United’s 22-year-old star wing-half, reported transferred to Fulham three days ago, was back in Dundee last night – and still a United player!This shock turn of events, similar in many ways to the recent mix-up over Asa Hartford’s transfer from West Bromwich Albion to Leeds United, was revealed in a short statement issued last night by Dundee United chairman Johnstone Grant on behalf of his board.The statement read:‘Jim Henry returned from Fulham tonight.They were not satisfied regarding his injury, which was made known to them by team manager Jim McLean before negotiations for his transfer were opened.In spite of having him medically examined on Friday, they have now declined to register him with the Football League.’The background to whatever the mix-up is leaves United completely in the clear.The position as far as the player is concerned is that Fulham opened negotiations for him when he was out of the United team suffering from a strained stomach muscle. This had kept him on the sidelines for the last five games.Only a matter of days before Fulham came on with their final offer, Henry had seen a specialist in Dundee, and was advised to take a fortnight’s rest from training.The English club were informed of this and, on Friday past, Henry and Jerry Kerr flew to London, where the player was examined by a Harley Street specialist.He not only passed him fit, but fit enough to play against Hull City this Saturday.Henry asked for time to talk over the proposed move with his fiance, and returned to Dundee the same night to do that.On Monday, Jim and Jerry again flew south once again, and this time Henry signed the forms which duly made him a Fulham player, provided he was then registered with the Football League.This Fulham have now declined to do.Obviously, something has cropped up to give them second thoughts.Part of that “something” could well be that Fulham manager Bill Dodgin knew nothing about the transfer until Jim and Jerry arrived at Craven Cottage.The following year, Jim Henry eventually did get a move, joining Aberdeen.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee defender jeffries moves to partick thistle","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDan Jefferies has today moved to Partick Thistle.The defender has joined the Jags on loan until January.Jefferies, 19, was signed from Colchester in January but has made only one first team appearance for the Dark Blues, giving away a late penalty shortly after coming on against Hamilton in May.The Welshman joins up with the SPFL Championship side ahead of their match with Greenock Morton tomorrow.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee united loan defender to championship rivals","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee United defender Tam Scobbie has sealed a late move to Partick Thistle.The 30-year-old has joined the Jags on a six-month loan until January, with the news announced just moments before the Scottish transfer window slammed shut.Scobbie was told he was free to move on from United at the end of last season, despite having a year left on his contract.The former St Johnstone man will now shore up the defence of United’s rivals in the push for the Premiership.A statement on Partick’s website said Scobbie “brings a wealth of experience to the Thistle backline with a Challenge Cup win and Scotland youth caps to his name.”\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/08/5b896518849be.jpg ","title":"former gp surgery that closed earlier this year could get new lease of life","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA former GP surgery that closed its doors earlier this year could be set for a new lease of life.The Stobswell Medical Practice on Albert Street had served the area for more than 100 years but closed to the public in February.Now plans have been unveiled for the Stobswell Forum, Brooksbank Centre and Dundee Money Action to move into the building.Maryfield community officer Stuart Fairweather, pictured, said talks about the building’s future were being held this week.

He travelled north to collect Adele and stayed for a few days.The pair took a walk along the “gorgeous” Coral Beach and Lewis decided the perfect proposal spot would be on top of some rocks – much to the annoyance of Adele.He managed to convince her and after popping the question Adele gave the answer – no.Adele had thought Lewis was about to break up with her so a marriage proposal was not what she saw on the horizon.After quickly retracting her first answer the pair were engaged and they embarked down the rocks – no easy feat as the tide had come in during the romantic gesture.Within a week the wedding was booked for August 18 at Hospitalfield, Arbroath.The bride was piped down the aisle by 12-year-old Andrew Russell, who has only been playing the pipes since December.The couple stood in front of 25 close family members in the beautiful paddock and said their vows.\u0026nbspAdele was joined by sister Charlie Allan as her bridesmaid and Lewis had brother Merrick Macmillan as best man.Just as light rain started to fall, the wedding party made its way inside to devour a vegetarian feast which had been prepared with fruit and veg from the venue’s gardens by chef Simon Brown.That wasn’t the only way the gardens were used though as Adele and Charlie’s bouquets – Adele’s favourite part – were arranged by Maria Coleman using flowers from Hospitalfield.The bride said: “We tried to make the wedding as eco-friendly as possible and thanks to Scott Byrne, the event manager at Hospitalfield, it was all possible.”Lewis had prepared a special poem as his speech and he had also given his bride an extra special wedding present – personalised Beano’s for each of their guests’ wedding favours.Adele said: “Everyone had a wee tear when Lewis performed his poem and it was extra special as his kilt was my clan’s tartan.”Ceilidh band Reel of Fortune then got the wedding party dancing and thanks to photographer Angela Bell the whole evening was captured – even though she was meant to leave before the evening reception began.Lewis said: “Angela was like a kid in a candy shop, she had so many ideas and the photos look amazing.“The whole day was more amazing than we could have ever imagined and we are so grateful to our families and everyone at Hospitalfield.”The happy couple travelled to Croatia for their honeymoon and remember that sense of nostalgia when they first met?

It changes the dynamic in the market hall. It\u0027 a great unit with fantastic windows and great visibility.The idea is to charge \u0026pound20 per hour for use of the premises.If the initiative is approved by the council\u0027 city committee, Mrs Murray promised the unit would be redecorated before it is let.Meanwhile, the market could be renamed Old Town Arcade Inverness in a major rebranding exercise.The proposal has emerged after talks between interested parties and council, which has employed consultant Tristram Woolston Design of Cannich to look at the marketing of the landmark, which has often been a focal point for city visitors from home and abroad.Mrs Murray said further talks will be held before it goes to Highland councillors for consideration.\u0026ldquoThe consultant has identified problems with the existing name, in that the building and its environment doesn\u0026rsquot strongly present Victorian qualities and it\u0027 not a \u0026lsquomarket\u0026rsquo as such, but has permanent enclosed retail units rather than changeable stalls, she said.\u0026ldquoThe vision for this historic building after refurbishment is to provide a high-quality destination with a mix of unique Highland brands and products, a place to eat and drink, and a venue for events and entertainment.\u0026ldquoOther similar destinations in the UK and abroad call themselves arcades and hence the proposed new name is Old Town Arcade Inverness.Those involved will discuss the new image for the facility in September.Inverness economist Tony Mackay said it might be better to focus on other matters.\u0026ldquoTo be honest I\u0026rsquom not sure what sort of impact changing the name will have, he said.\u0026ldquoThere needs to be improvements at the market, there are a few empty premises in the centre. It\u0027 gone downhill due to lack of investments and the decline in people shopping in the city centre.\u0026ldquoWe need to move away from the traditional shopping idea, more social activities and more attractions are what is needed.

Detailed measures will be presented next week.Leaders of the minority independent administration said every attempt would be made to minimise the impact on services but \u0026ldquosome impact on service is inevitable.Budget leader Alister Mackinnon said: \u0026ldquoOur  reserves of \u0026pound8 million are well below the minimum recommended by Audit Scotland and it\u0027 vital that they\u0026rsquore not depleted further. The committee agreed stricter controls on recruitment and overtime, a review of all agency appointments and tighter controls on staff travel.The \u0026pound5.1 million figure equates to one per cent of the total budget and compares with a \u0026pound2.7 million estimate at this stage last year. The potential overspend is blamed on high cost placements for \u0026lsquolooked-after children\u0026rsquo, lower income from new parking charges and fewer savings from toilet closures because those two policies have not yet taken full effect.Council chiefs insisted no staff jobs were at risk.Finance director Derek Yule, however, warned there were \u0026ldquono more rabbits to be pulled from hats to tackle the problems.Black Isle Liberal Democrat Gordon Adam blamed Scottish Government grant cuts while SNP city councillor Richard Laird said the crisis was \u0026ldquoentirely of this council\u0027 making.Council leader Margaret Davidson claimed local government services were \u0026ldquonot a priority for the Scottish Government.The budget leader angered the SNP benches, accusing group leader Maxine Smith of not fully participating in budget discussions.

fixed 20,404 problems that year.This compares to 2013-14 when it spent just £684,614 on resurfacing roads and in that year repaired 17,274 potholes.But Lib Dem group leader Ian Yuill said more needs to be done to tackle potholes.“If you ask anyone who drives or cycles on Aberdeen’s roads then they will tell you things are getting worse,” he said. “It’s welcome that the council is spending a little more in repairs but it’s still far from enough.“The council needs to invest year after year on bringing roads and pavements back up to a safe standard and keep it like that.“It’s failed to do that for the last five or six years and it’s just not good enough.”Councillor Jackie Dunbar, SNP operations spokeswoman, said: “This is hardly surprising given the condition of our roads as a result of years of neglect.“While the council committed to more spending, it did not support our proposals for additional resources this year and that was incredibly disappointing.”Since April, the council has spent £261,513 on patching its roads and has filled in 6,613 potholes in this time.The city council’s ruling administration committed an additional £10m over the next five years for roads and pavements when it set its budget and councillors agreed to add an extra £500,000 over the next year.That will be added to the £267,000 pothole-fighting fund which the local authority has already received from Cosla, the local government representative organisation.Council transport spokesman Ross Grant said: “In spite of remaining Scotland’s lowest funded council, increasing resources to better tackle roads maintenance has been one of our key priorities and we are delivering on that pledge to invest an additional £10m in our roads infrastructure over the coming years.“While there is more work to be done, as an administration we are dealing with more pothole repairs than in previous years and we are carrying out more extensive resurfacing than

However, they often endure short, painful lives without the most basic requirements.This is where SPANA makes such a huge difference, ensuring animals have access to the free veterinary treatment they urgently need when they are sick or injured.Actors Dame Judi Dench and Joanna Lumley are throwing their support behind this year’s event, and we hope your readers will be inspired to take part and help transform the lives of working animals around the world.The SPANA World Tea Party fundraising pack, full of free recipes, is available from www.spana.org/teaparty or by calling 020 7831 3999.SPANA World Tea Party Host, Tom HorsfieldSir,It only takes one person to put a stop to the accidental loss of life to drowning.With recent headlines being filled with tragic stories of people losing their lives to drowning, Lesley Laird, Shadow Scottish Secretary and the Royal Life Saving Society UK  urge the public to be that \u0026#8216one person\u0026#8217: take some simple precautions and get \u0026#8216water smart\u0026#8217, before cooling off this summer.For more information on the issue, the statistics involved and interview opportunities, please contact Claire Huggins on 0300 323 0096 or email clairehuggins@rlss.org.ukSenior Communications Executive, Claire HugginsSir,There are more people using Instagram for interiors inspiration than ever before, but 70 percent of Scottish Instagram users feel dissatisfied with their homes after looking at images of other people’s houses on social media, a study has found.Researchers who polled 1,500 UK adults using social media for inspiration with their homes, found that a whopping 66 percent of those are displeased with their home. They admit to feeling this way once a month or more after scrolling through other properties on Instagram, with 25-34-year-olds feeling dissatisfied most frequently.The findings describe people having an unrealistic idea of what their home should look like, spending time worrying about flaws which would be unnoticeable to others, whilst feeling pressure to maintain a certain appearance in their home and being self-conscious of it in front of visitors. This mindset has been described by Chartered Psychologist, Dr David Lewis, as ‘Home Dysmorphic Disorder’ .energypr representative, Beth ReynoldsSir,Researchers at the University of St Andrews have shown for the first time that some of the standard measures of memory in rodents and humans are likely based on the same cognitive process which could have implications for development of treatments for memory disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease.One of the most widely used memory tests for rodents is the novel object recognition test, in which animals explore two objects one of which is new and the other they have seen before.The results of new research showed that their participants object recognition scores were far more associated with their memory abilities than their preferences for newness.One of the research team, Dr James Ainge, of the School of Psychology and Neuroscience at St Andrews said: \u0026#8216This is important as it provides some of the first evidence that the standard memory tests in humans and rats are testing the same cognitive process. If we want to find a treatment or cure for disorders of memory like Alzheimer’s disease then we need to have a test of memory in animals that is analogous to human memory tests.\u0026#8217Steve Bargeton, St Andrews\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"do you want to see inveraray bank crumble","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 05/08/18, 6:01 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowAnn Thomas\u0026#8217 latest cartoon depicts the growing worry over the potential closure of Inveraray\u0026#8217s branch of the Royal Bank of Scotland.The branch has been threatened with closure since the end of 2017, prompting protests and petitions.The status of the branch is still undecided and the bank remains open for now.The opportunity to have a say is quickly closing, with an online petition set to be hand-delivered by the person who initially set it up, Mid Argyll writer and journalist Marian Pallister.The petition will be handed over in Inveraray on Wednesday August 8.To sign online, visit the 38degrees website and search for ‘RBS Inveraray’.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 32","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 12/08/18, 6:15 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Sir,At the latest Mid Argyll, Kintyre and Islands meeting I stated a large number of my younger constituents have been contacting me in regards to the availability of housing.While a greater number of affordable rental accommodation is more than welcome, a larger amount of affordable housing to buy needs to be built across Argyll.I was also very happy at a recent meeting with my fellow Conservative councillors to discuss the huge importance of having a more streamlined planning service that helps rather than hinders economic strength across Argyll and Bute.An effective planning system plays an important role in supporting growth – promoting and enabling the homes, jobs and services that communities need, creating a more competitive local economy and minimising uncertainty and delay for those proposing or affected by development.We in Argyll are seeing a tremendous increase in our industrial output and we as a council must not place barriers in the way of future growth in this area.Councillor Alastair Redman, Islay.Sir,I\u0026#8217m calling on Argyll and Bute\u0026#8217s small shopkeepers to enter the Best Small Shops competition, celebrating the creativity of small shops and the central role they play in their local community.Argyll and Bute is a hub of small local retailers, many of which are a lifeline.The Best Small Shops competition is open to any small shop operating in the UK.

The wealth of experience and knowledge of the staff cannot be replaced.I would certainly support a trust taking over the service, but firstly I would ask VisitScotland and Scottish Government to reconsider their closure plans.Councillor Robin Currie, Kintyre and the Islands wardSir,I am extremely disappointed over the proposed closure of the VisitScotland iCentre in Tarbert.Michael Russel MSP, Tarbert and Skipness Community Trust and myself have had frequent discussions regarding the issue and I am hopeful that the interested parties will be able to offer a proposal that ensures continuity in the service, although perhaps in a different form.Councillor Anne Horn, Kintyre and the Islands wardSir,Deputy First Minister John Swinney is now requiring local authorities to devolve powers and budgets to local schools. If councils do not respond within the next year, he has vowed to legislate for improved school governance across the country.The fear of making mistakes has led to an unwillingness to experiment and a total absence of diversity to suit individual communities. Local authorities have prevented head teachers and staff from running their schools and classes in their pupils’ true interests.Councils have failed to recognise the very significant contribution which broadly constituted and empowered school councils could make to the overall education system. Schools have had little incentive to cut back wasteful expenditure.The shortage of resources being allocated to education is, of course, partly to blame for the mess we are in, but it is by no means the whole story.We now have an ideal opportunity to introduce governance reforms to ensure that policies are shaped to local circumstances otherwise we could all well end up with more direction from St Andrew\u0026#8217s House.Is it too much to hope that councillors and education officials in every education authority will now play their part in restoring Scotland’s state schools to their once iconic world status?Angus Tulloch, Longniddry, East LothianSir,Through your newspaper I would like to thank the staff Alex, Mark and Alex  from the George Hotel in Inveraray.Two guests staying at my holiday cottage in Cairnbaan lost their car keys while on a day trip to Inveraray.

All members of the 19th Argyll were successful and, as far as we are aware, it was the only unit to achieve this feat.Two of the team, Martha Payne and Polly Payne, have secured places at the World Scout Jamboree, a three-week adventure at the Summit Bechtel Family National Scout Reserve in West Virginia, USA.

But Alfie Briggs does plan to downsize the long-established business. Mr Briggs, 74, wants to change part of the arcade, to create a town house. And he has been granted planning consent by South Ayrshire Council. Mr Briggs says he will transform the smaller part of the arcade - next to the Harbour Bar pub - back into a house. But the larger, deeper part of the business will remain an amusement arcade. However, Mr Briggs also has consent to create a house there, should it ever be required. He said: “I was advised to do it  this way. But I’m definitely not closing the arcade.” He added: “I won’t be around forever, and maybe my children will decide it should go back to a house. “But I know I won’t do it.” Mr Briggs, who lives in Ayr, has owned Mayfair Amusements since 1984. The business was created in 1962 by the late Edwin Lawrence, a former travelling showman. He had bought the two-storey house next to the Harbour Bar pub, and converted the downstairs front into a small amusement arcade. This had originally been John Carson’s fish shop. The arcade was greatly expanded around 1970, after the acquistion of a house at No 29 Knockcushan Street. The arcade, which included a prize bingo and a shop, was run successfully by Mr Lawrence and his family, until bought by Mr Briggs. The new owner kept the name ‘Mayfair Amusements’ which was a tribute to Mr Lawrence’s wife May, as well as an affluent part of London. Alfie Briggs recalls: “There was more business for everyone back in the days when there was about five amusement arcades in Girvan. “Takings have certainly gone down, but we’re still getting by. “This conversion will allow me to rent out a house and a flat, instead of just a flat.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilGirvanAyr NewsAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"ayr united fans under starters","story":"NewsAyr United fans under starter\u0027s orders for Somerset Park charity racenight in aid of Ian McCall\u0027s player fundInternet supporters\u0027 team KaisAyr is staging the bash this Saturday night in United\u0027s Hospitality Suite.Share\u0026nbspByStuart Wilson10:56, 23 AUG 2018NewsAyr\u0027s Craig McGuffie and Alan Forrest go for a ride with mascot Pandamonium \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThey’re under starter’s orders for a top night of action at Somerset Park this Saturday.

The ailing Kyle Centre is to lodge plans for a round the clock fitness facility. Retail chiefs want to rival Heathfield’s bid for a similar project on the outskirts of town. Both are now set to go before South Ayrshire Council in a battle for planning permission. Kyle Centre boss, Fiona Paton, said: “Lifestyles and work patterns are changing and we believe there is demand for this. “There is no escaping that we, as a centre, need to evolve and we’ve had to adapt our business model since I came here 10 years ago. “Opening a gym is part of that direction of travel and can help sustain the centre moving forward.” Energie Fitness has agreed a deal to open an 8000sq foot unit within the barren centre. And bosses claim their stalling dream to open a cinema is far from dead.  Negotiations, understood to be with screen giant Odeon, have so far failed to bear fruit.

and the Caribbean island of Barbados.\nFirst screened on Tuesday , Scots in Paradise features the Barbados Celtic Festival \u0026ndash a large cultural get-together held in and around the capital Bridgetown.\nAnd taking centre stage for much of the programme is Riddell Fiddles founder Sheila Sapkota.\nThe Caribbean festival takes place during the last weekend of May and features multiple collaborations between Scottish and Barbadian or \u0026ldquoBajan culture.\nMusicians, dancers, drummers and pipers all come together for a fun-filled weekend, accompanied by top chefs, serving up much loved Scottish meals with a distinct Bajan twist.\nThe now popular festival had humble beginnings in the 1990s when a Welsh men\u0026rsquos choir travelled to the island to perform in a local concert hall.\nSince then, the celebration has expanded and has featured Celtic acts from Canada, across the UK, Ireland, the USA and even Australia.\nFestival director Carol Anderson from Edinburgh said: \u0026ldquoWe have developed a unique fusion of music from both sides of the Atlantic in this growing festival through our folk and traditional music.\n\u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a great fusion

National Piping Centre, led by Fifer Ian Lowther.\nSheila Sapkota from Selkirk\u0026rsquos Riddell Fiddle made headlines in Barbados this year when she performed with Jenni Borthwick, Robbie Sapkota

playing Scottish songs taught to them by the St Patrick\u0026rsquos head teacher, Glasgow born Sister Pauline Dempsey.\nAnd several of Sheila\u0027s performances were caught on camera for the STV programme Scots in Paradise.\nThis year\u0027s Barbados Celtic Festival closed with a ceilidh, presented by local dancers from the island\u0026rsquos Scottish Dance Society, led by Scottish ex pat Ken Thomson.\nThe Celtic festival celebrates the shared history between Scots and the people of Barbados.\nAround the 1700s, Scottish and Irish immigrants were shipped all over the Caribbean to be indentured servants for the sugar industry.\nSince then, descendants of Scots can be found living across Barbados \u0026ndash sharing Scottish surnames like McCluskie, and even last names such as Glasgow.\nA small community still lives in what is known as \u0026lsquoScotland District\u0026rsquo \u0026ndash an area of the island that became home to settlers when they eventually gained their freedom.\nAny musicians interested in taking part in next year\u0026rsquos Massed Band events in May 2019 can sign up at www.barbadoscelticfestival.\nScots in Paradise will be available to watch on

report showed just five were issued in the space of a year.\nFigures revealed via a freedom of information request showed that in 2017 the local authority received 100 complaints about out of control dogs \u0026ndash but gave just six advisory notices and five dog control orders to irresponsible owners.\nHowever, following a meeting with Midlothian South, Tweeddale and Lauderdale MSP Christine Grahame, the council has revealed it has handed out 15 dog control notices over the last 12 months, with two still pending.\nMs Grahame, who introduced the Control of Dogs  Act 2010 as a member\u0026rsquos bill, said: \u0026ldquoI had a very useful discussion with the representatives from Scottish Borders Council and it was important to hear first-hand how this legislation is being used in practice.\n\u0026ldquoIn the last year there have been 15 dog control notices with two pending, although there are some issues with obtaining owner details. Some owners just need to be spoken to and advised of their responsibilities.\nDog control orders allow Scottish Borders Council to impose certain conditions on dog owners. For example, a dog which frequently runs away may be required to be kept on a lead at all times, or an aggressive dog may have to be muzzled when in public spaces.\nThe control orders can also be used to compel dog owners to seek training for themselves and their pet. Failure to adhere to a dog control order could lead to a ban from keeping animals or the dog being put down.\nA Scottish Borders Council spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThe council is currently reviewing its responsible dog ownership strategy, which will aim to remind owners of their social and legal responsibilities.\n\u0026ldquoAs part of this strategy, the council works in partnership with local and national charities to promote responsible ownership and dog control by educating the public at ious events across the Borders.\n\u0026ldquoThe council responds to all complaints received concerning out of control dogs, but in order to assist us in investigating each complaint fully, we ideally require the dog owner\u0026rsquos details.\n\u0026ldquoMembers of the public can contact 0300 100 1800 or visit www.scotborders.gov.uk if they have a concern about a dog\u0026rsquos behaviour.\nMs Grahame added: \u0026ldquoMy main concern is that members of the public may not be aware that if a dog\u0026rsquos behaviour is causing concern, for example being allowed to be out of control, they can report it to the council through this route.\n\u0026ldquoThe police, of course, deal with the most serious incidents. However I brought in my bill establishing dog control notices as a way of intervening before a dog bites or attacks and becomes dangerous.\n\u0026ldquoOnce a dog control notice is issued, the council will regularly check up to ensure it\u0026rsquos being followed.\n\u0026ldquoI would encourage anyone concerned about a dog\u0026rsquos behaviour whether in public, in its garden or indeed any other private place to get in touch with the council.

link-up has been brought to my attention.This is something I strongly agree with \u0026#8211 if we are to encourage tourism and over all business growth on the island then joined up transport links are a must.Other issues mentioned included high roadside verges leading to roads being flooded, BT cabling not being properly buried and being left exposed at the side of roads, slow internet speed, poor mobile phone signal and many other issues.There has been some good progress with road repairs with many of the potholes that I had reported to our council\u0026#8217s roads department being now fixed, however there is still more that needs to be done.Also some of the much needed and long overdue association housing repairs have taken place but only after much pressure from tenants and myself and even then the wait was unacceptably long.The sight of more and more of our Union flags on display each time I visit Gigha is fantastic.As I said after my previous Isle of Gigha surgery I will work

grieving for a cat","story":"In the run up to Grief Awareness Day on August 30, Cats Protection would like to let readers know that it offers a grief support service called Paws to Listen.For many, losing a cat can be a very traumatic experience and there can be a lack of understanding from family and friends about how deeply the loss can impact on a person.A survey carried out for Cats Protection earlier this month highlighted that 73 per cent of pet owners feel it can be as difficult and upsetting grieving for a pet as it is grieving for the loss of a person.Cats Protection understands just how much a cat means and what owners may be going through if their pet is missing, has had to be re-homed, nearing the end of its life or has recently passed away.Cats Protection has a large range of resources, information and support to help at this difficult time, including ways to celebrate the cat\u0026#8217s life.Anyone experiencing the loss of a cat can talk to Cats Protection on 0800 024 9494 between 9am-5pm Monday to Friday excluding bank holidays.It is a free and confidential service and our volunteer listeners can provide emotional support and practical information.To talk to someone please give the Paws to Listen service a call.We all need to be mindful of the emotional impact that losing a pet can have on a person.Stuart Sheppard,Cats

local schools.If councils do not respond within the next year, he has vowed to legislate for improved  school governance across the country.The fear of making mistakes has led to an unwillingness to experiment and a total absence of diversity to suit individual communities.Council authorities have prevented head teachers and staff from running their schools and classes in their pupils’ true interests.Councils have failed to recognise the very significant contribution which broadly constituted and empowered school councils could make to the overall education system.Schools have had little incentive to cut back wasteful expenditure.The shortage of resources being allocated to education is of course partly to blame for the mess we are in, but it is by no means the whole story.We have an ideal opportunity to introduce governance reforms so as to ensure that policies are shaped to local circumstances otherwise we could all well end up with more direction from St Andrew’s House.Is it too much to hope that councillors and education officials in every education authority will play their part in restoring Scotland’s state schools to their once iconic world status?Angus

And while a little young to be enjoying a champagne celebration, Maisie will be returning to her Upper Stratton home as one of the youngest actors to have starred in an Oscar-winning film.      THE.

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.  After filming, a surprise screening of The Silent Child was organised by Rachel at Maisie\u0026rsquos school, Red Oaks Primary, in August.  Maisie then flew with her proud parents, Elizabeth, who is also deaf,\u0026nbspand Gilson, who is partially deaf, to the film\u0026rsquos international premiere in Rhode Island \u0026ndash her first visit to the US, and her first time on a plane.

The move comes just 16 months after a public consultation on similar plans in which three quarters of those who took part objected to the change, leading the council to scrap the proposal.  The council said the move was part of a review of its service provision however, it has been criticised for not taking the plan back to the community before making the decision.  Brian Weddell, chairman of Prestonpans Community Council, said: \u0026ldquoIt is extremely disappointing that East Lothian Council are pressing ahead with service changes in Prestonpans that were rejected last year.  \u0026ldquoPrestonpans Community Council and other local community organisations should have been consulted on these changes rather than being presented with a fait accompli and we would ask that the council assure the local community that they will consult fully on the future proposals for Aldhammer House.  The proposal to turn the library, which was built in 1905 through funds from Scottish philanthropist Andrew Carnegie, into a shared facility and move council services from their offices in the town\u0026rsquos Aldhammer House, was first put to the public in June 2016.  At the time the community council raised concerns that merging the services would take away people\u0026rsquos views of the library as a safe and neutral area.  And at a public meeting in the town Manja Porteus, then six, whose dad Tim is a professional storyteller and Courier columnist, appealed to the council to rethink its proposals and leave the library alone.  Following a public consultation, the council announced it had scrapped the plans in March last year, stating that \u0026ldquothe majority of respondents said they wanted the two services to remain in separate buildings and did not want to see any changes to the library building.  However, last week they said that a wide range of services would move into the library from August 27.  Councillor Jim Goodfellow, cabinet spokesperson for community wellbeing, said: \u0026ldquoAs more of our customers make use of online services and library staff are readily available to help people to go online, the council has reviewed its service provision and Aldhammer House will be developed to provide complementary services which give more support to the local community.  \u0026ldquoMeanwhile, Prestonpans Library will be developed as a joint library/area office as has been done in Dunbar, North Berwick and Tranent.  \u0026ldquoThis builds on the council\u0026rsquos work to strengthen our communities and support town centres such as Prestonpans with easy access to high-quality local facilities and services.  Aldhammer House will continue to be staffed by housing service staff, as well as keeping The Pantry Foodbank, Citizens Advice Bureau and local politicians\u0026rsquo surgeries. Capital Credit Union will also continue to operate part-time there. All other services will move to the library.  The changes were welcomed by some on social media, who said it had worked in other communities.  One person said: \u0026ldquoDoes it really matter where you pay your rent or fill in forms? If the council can\u0026rsquot afford it then they can\u0026rsquot afford it.  However, there was an angry response from others.  One woman said: \u0026ldquoThis is an outrage, what can we do? Are they determined to strip Prestonpans of everything?  A council spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThe changes being made differ from those proposed in 2016. Housing enquiries will continue to be dealt with at Aldhammer House, while payments for other services can be made at the library. This will in turn improve the range of services available at our improved library \u0026ndash and we are grateful for the positive feedback we have received on this from customers so far.  Tim Porteus, Prestonpans storyteller and Courier columnist, said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom disappointed. I recognise the council is under pressure to make cuts but they should say that it what is about: saving money."},{"url":null,"title":"merger-of-prestonpans-schools-proposed","story":"  East Lothian Council launches a public consultation exercise on Monday where members of the public are asked for their thoughts on the potential move.  If approved, the merger would follow the expected merger of Haddington Infant School and King\u0026rsquos Meadow Primary School, which have Jacqui McKinnon, headteacher at Cockenzie Primary School, as interim headteacher until their formal merger goes ahead.  According to the Prestonpans proposal, the two schools would \u0026lsquoclose\u0026rsquo in February \u0026ldquoor as soon as possible thereafter, with a new non-denominational primary school then created. The town\u0026rsquos St Gabriel\u0026rsquos Primary School would be unaffected.  The merged school would continue to operate over the two sites within the existing buildings and facilities, but with a single management team.  Currently, Prestonpans Infant and Nursery School, on West Loan, has a school roll of 358 up to P3, with the primary school, on Preston Road, home to 332 pupils from P4 to P7.  The leadership of Prestonpans Early Learning and Childcare Centre, which opened last year on Kirk Street to provide additional nursery places for the town, would also transfer to the headteacher of the new single school structure if the move goes ahead.  Brian Weddell, chairman of Prestonpans Community Council, was surprised to hear the news.  He said: \u0026ldquoFirstly, I would like to see the details of it and what is behind the proposals because the infant school is a superbly-run school and works exceptionally well.  \u0026ldquoThe primary school is a very well-run and successful school as well \u0026ndash we have got two very well-run and successful schools.  \u0026ldquoWe would need to look at what the implications are.  Fiona Robertson, East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos head of education, stressed the local authority was \u0026ldquoabsolutely committed to continuously improving the quality of education at the two schools.  She said: \u0026ldquoOur Education Service Local Improvement Plan sets out a range of key outcomes, one of which is to ensure consistency in our approaches to planning learning, teaching and assessment.  \u0026ldquoWe believe that the proposal to establish a single school operating under a single management team offers the best solution to ensuring this consistency, improving transitions for children, and will deliver considerable educational benefits to all of the schools\u0026rsquo children and young people.  Councillor Shamin Akhtar, cabinet member for education and children\u0026rsquos services, said: \u0026ldquoOur first priority is to ensure that we provide the best educational experiences and outcomes for the children and young people of Prestonpans. The consultation process will focus on how we do this through an educational benefit statement.  \u0026ldquoWe have already informed the chairs of the parent councils of this proposal.  \u0026ldquoAll parents, carers and the wider school community will have the opportunity to comment on the proposal once the consultation has been published and the statutory consultation period begins on Monday.  The consultation runs to October 2, with drop-in sessions held at both schools next month.  Prestonpans Infant School hosts a consultation event on September 4 from noon to 5pm, with the primary school event taking place a week later between the same times.  Finally, a public meeting takes place on September 26 from 7pm at Preston Lodge High School.

And it takes the masterplan a stage further with more detailed ideas for each of the zones proposed in its vision, including calling for the Scottish Government to be invited to base its HQ for its proposed state company on the site, as well as suggesting offshore windfarm company Inch Cape \u0026ndash which wants to place a substation on the land to bring energy ashore from proposed turbines \u0026ndash should also be encouraged to put its Scottish base there.  The community council document comes in the wake of a brochure produced by neighbouring Prestonpans Community Council promoting its vision of a Port of Prestonpans cruise terminal at the former power station site.  That proposal sparked anger among supporters of the masterplan vision, who accused the Prestonpans group of ignoring the views of the local communities.  It led to the launch of \u0026lsquoGreenhills: delivering the Masterplan\u0026rsquo, a campaign by local groups and businesses backing the consultation document.  Now Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council has drawn up a draft brochure which sets out why it supports the plans and proposes a range of detailed ways it could be taken forward.  That includes putting head offices for Inch Cape and the Scottish Government energy interests in one part of the site, identified as its \u0026lsquoEnergy Quarter\u0026rsquo.  It also floats the idea of flooding the power station footprint to create a marina \u0026ndash as suggested by a local fisherman \u0026ndash with associated retail and leisure facilities, attracting businesses such as a film studio or 3D printing innovation to the site, or even creating a brewery.  Graeme Jeffrey, community council chairman, said: \u0026ldquoAs a community council we are promoting our vision of what we would like to see. It supports the masterplan, looking at how it could be delivered.  A Scottish Government spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoWe have set out our ambitions for a public energy company and its contribution towards tackling fuel poverty.  \u0026ldquoWe will be consulting on proposals later in the year and will make sure that Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council have an opportunity to provide their views."},{"url":null,"title":"cheese-sold-in-east-lothian-recalled-after-salmonella-found","story":"  L\u0026rsquoEARL Mounier of France is recalling some batches of its Cheese AOP Pelardon after finding traces of the bacteria in the product.

Mother Nature has been kind and the pipe is, by and large, under sand once again \u0026ndash though there are concerns it is likely to be exposed again in future if a permanent solution is not found.  As well as being an eyesore at a popular tourist spot, sand and rocks collect around the pipe and are then blasted by the tide at the sea wall, causing it damage.  The town\u0026rsquos community council has long voiced concerns over the issue and claims houses overlooking the iconic West Beach are \u0026ldquoin danger.  North Berwick Community Council  contacted Scottish Water over the issue and the company\u0026rsquos response was read out at a NBCC meeting last week.  A letter from Brian Lironi, director of corporate affairs, said: \u0026ldquoWe are not able to re-lay this section of pipe. However, following an inspection of it, we plan to carry out some work on the casing around the laterals and raised manhole columns.  \u0026ldquoThis work will take place outside of the bathing season when the laterals are more exposed and the beach is less busy. This should help to improve the aesthetic of the pipe.  The letter added: \u0026ldquoOn the point of erosion, we do not believe our pipe is to blame for this. With that said, I am asking for this to be looked at in more detail as it is important that we take an evidence-led approach. This will not happen during the bathing season.  Mr Lironi said the community council would be kept informed of any developments.  Spring 2018 was not the first time that severe weather saw the sewage pipe badly exposed. The pipe was clearly visible in the aftermath of storms in December 2010 and it took many, many months before the tides re-covered it with sand."},{"url":null,"title":"in-this-weeks-courier","story":"  HADDINGTON...

Plans lodged with East Lothian Council are split into two.  The design and access statement states: \u0026ldquoThe brief is twofold: to diversify the core business on the site with the introduction of small-scale gin and whisky distillation to enable the production of speciality spirits for sale within the business pub chain.  \u0026ldquoSecondly, in light of the increasing demand for both brewery tours and the use of the Monk\u0026rsquos Retreat as a function venue, it is felt that the facilities require being upgraded, both in terms of general amenity, improving the visitor experience and to provide for the disabled visitor with the addition of a platform lift and accessible toilet.  A spokeswoman for owners Greene King explained why they were looking to diversify at the site, on Belhaven\u0026rsquos Brewery Lane.  She said: \u0026ldquoLike any business we are always exploring options to develop our business and facilities. The recent planning application is just one of many opportunities we are considering but no decision has been made yet about whether it is an option we will pursue if planning permission is granted.  In terms of the production of gin and whisky, a still house would be created.  According to the design and access statement: \u0026ldquoThe distillery will be designed to produce 250 litres of spirit a day. It will be unique in the marketplace, making spirit from the same wurt as the beer.  \u0026ldquoThe spirit will be a mixture of Scotch whisky, gin and rum.  \u0026ldquoThis volume and complexity will mean that the brewery will need to employ an additional person to run the distillery.  \u0026ldquoIn time the site would like to re-instate a historical greenhouse within the gardens in order to grow their own botanicals to add to the gin however, this will be part of a separate application.  The new still house would mirror the mash house, which was given planning permission in January 2011, in terms of its look.  It is two storeys, with a more modern design than some of the historic buildings on-site.  If the plans were given the green light, work would also be carried out at the main building on the Belhaven site.  A museum is already in place on the ground floor of the main building, with a pub on the first floor.  Plans show a refurbishment of both floors as \u0026ldquothe existing interiors are now tired and dated and in need of a revamp.  The application, which could go before members of the council\u0026rsquos planning committee later this year, adds: \u0026ldquoConsidering the site\u0026rsquos historic importance both locally and within Scotland, it is clear that any development both internally and externally requires to be sensitive.  \u0026ldquoIt is also important to recognise the value of this development in terms of the improved visitor experience, which will impact visitor numbers to the area as a whole, and the business diversification."},{"url":null,"title":"avid-lynyrd-skynyrd-fan-pens-foreword-to-new-book-about-his-idols","story":"  Iain Monk has contributed to The Gospel According to Abraham by Paul Abraham, who was the American band\u0026rsquos road manager for a decade.  The new book is full of stories about the band, best known for hits such as Sweet Home Alabama and Free Bird.  Iain said: \u0026ldquoI became an instant fan of the band in the 1970s and was instantaneously hooked by the music, that kind of southern rock music.  \u0026ldquoMy obsession for the band just grew from there but the first time I saw them live was in 1988 in New York when I flew over to see them.  \u0026ldquoI had written to the band\u0026rsquos management to see if they could help me with tickets and I think they were impressed that I was coming from Scotland to see the band.  \u0026ldquoThat relationship grew with management, road crew and members of the band and I started following them across America.  Iain, who lives in Gullane, has spent countless hours travelling across the globe to see his idols perform at 31 shows, ranging from New York, Boston and Washington to Belgium, the Netherlands and all across the UK.  His friendship with band members and those associated with the band has even seen him spend a week at the family home of Randall Hall, who was the band\u0026rsquos guitarist, in Florida. A friendship also grew with Paul Abraham, with Iain interviewing the road manager for his Lynyrd Skynyrd blog about his intention to write a book.  Iain said the band, which was formed in 1969 and continued following the tragic death of lead singer Ronnie Van Zant in 1977, were \u0026ldquoamazing live but also \u0026ldquolovely people.  He added: \u0026ldquoThey are down to earth, very friendly people in my experience and the people that formed the band are very approachable.  \u0026ldquoI have been very, very fortunate that I have been given access to the band over the years.  \u0026ldquoThat is something most fans would simply not get and I think that is down to trust and trusting me not to take advantage of their generosity.

ICOL wants to build a substation, which will bring energy from an offshore windfarm onshore and into the National Grid, on the former power station footprint.  The application has been opposed by local community councils and the council, who believe it is not the best use of the site, which was bought by East Lothian Council from ScottishPower in March and is subject to an ongoing masterplan process for its future.  However, within weeks of the council buying the site, Scottish Ministers called-in the only lodged application for the land, from ICOL.  They said the move was because it was of \u0026ldquonational importance and denied any link to the fact that First Minister Nicola Sturgeon was on a state visit to China \u0026ndash whose state-owned company Red Rock own ICOL \u0026ndash at the time of the announcement.  The reporter appointed to investigate the application carried out a site visit at the start of this month.  Following that visit, it was announced a hearing into the plans would be held and Allison Coard was named as the appointed reporter who would oversee the hearing and report back to ministers.  Ward councillor Lachlan Bruce welcomed the announcement.

High Street as far west as the Town House was under several feet of water which stretched to the gates of Amisfield Park, a distance of more than half a mile.  Distillery Park, the Nungate, Peffers Place and Brewery Park were similarly devastated.  The Biel Burn also flooded, submerging all the low-lying land north and west of West Barns.  The flood occurred as the culmination of a period of truly exceptional rainfall \u0026ndash 122 mm of rain fell between August 1 and 8, followed by 153 mm in the next five days.  The saturated ground then received a huge 139 mm of rain in the next 24 hours, bringing severe flooding across the county.  The Haddingtonshire Courier reported on \u0026ldquodisastrous flooding without parallel in living memory \u0026ndash if not in history.  In the August 20, 1948 edition of the Courier, \u0026ldquoserious damage was inflicted on the banks of the River Tyne while other streams burst their banks and \u0026ldquoleft destruction in their wake.  It added: \u0026ldquoSo heavy was the flood of water that the streams made courses for themselves, with the result that many people were flooded out of house and home.  \u0026ldquoOne of the worst areas to suffer was Haddington, where a large number of people were rendered homeless, while shops and business premises were flooded to a depth of several feet.  Meanwhile at West Barns, the Biel Burn overflowed, causing serious damage to houses and shops in the village but fortunately \u0026ldquono loss of life is reported, although some people had narrow escapes, so suddenly did the water levels rise.  The floods also caused serious damage to crops on farms close to the Tyne and extensive damage was also caused to the now-demolished New County Cinema on Hardgate.  Nungate residents who had been enjoying the evening\u0026rsquos film were instructed by cinema management to return home to avoid being cut off as water levels rapidly rose.  And slightly further afield, the electricity supply in Gifford and Saltoun was interrupted, and at the Maltings in Haddington the sub-station was completely swept away. It was anticipated it would take many months for the affected areas to return to normal, and calls for assistance to help with the recovery were issued."},{"url":null,"title":"tims-tales-the-commodore-of-haddington","story":"  TEENAGERS often get a bad press. To be sure, it\u0026rsquos a time when parents wonder what has happened to their children and feel they have lost them or gone wrong somewhere. This is because teenage years are a time of great change in terms of brain development. Quite literally the teenage brain is being remodelled and new priorities and emotions are created as a result.  It\u0026rsquos a time when peers and their approval become more important than parents or family, or almost anything else. Taking risks, or doing seemingly foolish things, are all part of this. We are familiar with the term \u0026lsquopeer pressure\u0026rsquo, but in our teenage years, approval by our peers and being included by them takes on a massive importance. It is an essential part of growing up and creating a new self-identity.  And a story from over 200 years ago shows that although the word teenager may not have been invented, and that there was no such thing as \u0026lsquoyouth culture\u0026rsquo as we now know it, behaviour was much the same.  It involves a group of young men who we would now call teenagers. They were a group of friends from Haddington. They included George Neill, John and William Haldane who were brothers, Peter Martine, Benjie Hunter and John Davie, whose nickname was \u0026lsquoLettie\u0026rsquo. They were all from Haddington, and their escapade became a story told well into their senior years. The nickname \u0026lsquoCommodore\u0026rsquo was coined for George on this day and stayed with him until he took it to his grave many years later.  Much of the tale is left to the imagination but the essentials were well told. One of the group came up with the idea of hiring a boat and heading out to Fife. These young men were not from poor backgrounds and so had the means to do this. So with the madcap plan devised, they set off as a group to the fishing village of Prestonpans.  The negotiations to hire a boat were concluded and they set off for the foreign shore of Fife, aiming for the town of Kirkcaldy. I cannot comment on their sailing abilities but they must have had some experience for they successfully navigated themselves to the shore of the \u0026lsquoLang Toun\u0026rsquo, possibly using the Lomond hills as a marker.  They came ashore like invading Vikings, intent on mischief. No social media in those days, but each town had a drummer who would disseminate news. And so they found Kirkcaldy\u0026rsquos drummer and paid him to announce to the town that at three in the afternoon there would be a spectacular diving and swimming show at the harbour entrance. The drummer set forth announcing the news, creating an air of expectation.  The group chose Lettie to be the performer. He was the best swimmer amongst them. As 3 o\u0026rsquoclock approached, a large excited crowd assembled on the harbour walls. The Haddington lads looked at each other with wry smiles and secret sniggers. Their ruse had worked, perhaps too successfully.  \u0026ldquoShow them what ye can dae, Lettie was told by his friends. And so Lettie stood on the edge of the boat and dived into the sea, from a height of about two feet. The crowd was silent, except for a wee five-year-old girl who clapped. She was the only one impressed by the spectacle.  There were murmurings as the Kirkcaldy folk began to realise they had been duped and were being made a fool of by these young Haddington lads. The mood began to get angry, and boos were followed by threats and words I cannot print here. It was clear it was time to go.  \u0026ldquoThank ye, the lads said, bowing to the crowd and laughing, mocking them for being so gullible. Stones began to fly towards them as they set off back towards Prestonpans, gesturing to the now-furious crowd. The lads in the boat were hysterical with laughter. They had raided and fooled the \u0026lsquoLang Toun\u0026rsquo.  But then their laughter stopped. Emerging from the harbour was a boat filled with angry Kirkcaldy lads who were shouting serious threats. The prank looked as if it might end unpleasantly so the Haddington lads had no choice but to row for their lives.  George took command. His friends had nicknamed him the Commodore at the beginning of their voyage, not so much because of his nautical skills but because of his leadership qualities. They were now desperately needed.  \u0026ldquoRow lads, row, he called on them. To be truthful the Haddington lads were at a disadvantage. They were not skilled seamen and in truth they were more bookish than brawn. But fear can do mighty things to a man\u0026rsquos capabilities, and as the adrenaline pumped through their veins they found levels of strength they didn\u0026rsquot know they had. They rowed like true Vikings, heave ho, heave ho. The sea splashed at their feet, their hearts nearly burst, but they kept the pace.  Slowly they began to pull ahead from the Kirkcaldy boat. \u0026ldquoKeep rowing, lads, dinnae look back, dinnae slow doon, called George, who was himself rowing as hard as he could. The tide was strong, the night was drawing in and the weather was beginning to change. The Kirkcaldy boat turned back, but the Haddington lads dare not attempt a Fife landing. They had no choice but to cross the Firth.  Darkness fell, then a thick haar covered them in freezing mist. They rowed through the night not sure in which direction they were headed. They wondered if their parents would ever know what had happened to them if, as now seemed likely, they were lost at sea.  The morning sun slowly burned off the mist. Thankfully they were still in the Firth, and there in front of them was the smoke coming from the lums and salt works of Prestonpans. They wept with relief and summoned up their last drops of energy to row ashore. Their final few hundred metres to the stony beach was watched by village children and women drying clothes.  Some fishermen helped pull the boat to land and the Haddington lads literally collapsed out of the vessel onto the beach, utterly exhausted but elated to be still alive.  George Neill was later to become a well-respected Baillie in Haddington, a bookseller and publisher of great local repute. He outlived his friends who had shared that day of adventure and danger.  He was often asked by those who knew him less well: \u0026ldquoWhy do people call you the Commodore? He never tired of telling the tale of his teenage adventure."},{"url":null,"title":"east-lothian-secondary-schools-delighted-with-pupils-exam-results","story":"  This year saw the best pass rate in Higher exams across East Lothian for five years.  East Lothian Council said that pupils across its six secondary schools \u0026ndash Musselburgh Grammar School Knox Academy, Haddington North Berwick High School Preston Lodge High School in Prestonpans Ross High School, Tranent and Dunbar Grammar School \u0026ndash improved their performances, with the number of Highers passed going up to more than 79 per cent.  Lauren Rodger, headteacher at North Berwick High School, told the Courier: \u0026ldquoWe are absolutely delighted.  \u0026ldquoOur Higher results are brilliant and we\u0026rsquore really pleased with how all the current sixth year pupils have performed.  \u0026ldquoI know schools are judged on their exam results, but for us it\u0026rsquos also about seeing the pupils develop \u0026ndash that\u0026rsquos the most pleasing part.  Similarly pleased was Paul Reynolds, the Ross High School headteacher.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe are delighted with the exam results.  \u0026ldquoOur Higher results have been record-breaking and the sixth-years who have just left us have got really positive results that will allow them to hopefully go to uni or further education.  Meanwhile, Musselburgh Grammar School is celebrating record attainment levels for S5 and S6 pupils at all levels in this year\u0026rsquos exam results.  Headteacher Colin Gerrie said that there were also many \u0026ldquoexcellent results achieved by pupils in S4.  He added: \u0026ldquoThe results achieved by our students this year are exceptionally good and continue the successes of recent years, with school records broken on an annual basis.  \u0026ldquoWe do not underestimate the hard work of our pupils and the commitment of our teachers to make this happen.  His counterpart at Preston Lodge High School, Gavin Clark, also gave his thoughts.  At PL, four S5 pupils achieved six As at Higher, although the number of pupils gaining one, two, three or four Highers dropped from the last set of results.  Mr Clark added: \u0026ldquoWe expected that to happen, as a result of our regular tracking process.  \u0026ldquoThis dip in no way diminishes the achievements of those who performed so impressively in examinations.  At Knox Academy, new headteacher Susan Cook gave an update on how the school was performing.  She said: \u0026ldquoSeventy-four per cent of S4 pupils attained five or more qualifications at National 3 69 per cent achieved five or more passes at National 4 and 47 per cent achieved five or more passes at National 5 at grades A-C and 55 per cent at grades A-D.  \u0026ldquoThere were some outstanding individual performances in S4, with eight of our candidates achieving seven A passes at N5.  \u0026ldquoThese results are a really strong foundation to build S5 performance upon and I would encourage all parents/carers to continue to support their child to study at home as the transition from S4 to S5 in terms of challenge and pace moves up a few gears and much more study is required, especially at Higher level.  Meanwhile, the performance of S5 pupils in their Higher exams was down on the previous three years.  Ms Cook added: \u0026ldquoFifty-five per cent attained one or more Highers 35 per cent three or more and 16 per cent attained five or more Highers.  \u0026ldquoTwenty-two of our pupils achieved five Highers and some with straights As across all subjects.  \u0026ldquoMany other pupils achieved a mixture of Higher and National 5 awards and will build upon these in their sixth year.  Finally, there was \u0026ldquoan improving trend for S6 pupils over the last four years at Higher level, Ms Cook added.  The headteacher said: \u0026ldquoThose attaining one or more Highers was 62 per cent and then added to their results from S4 and S5  this rose to 76.22 per cent having achieved one or more Highers over S5/S6 \u0026ndash one per cent lower than last year, which in terms of statistics is not significant. However, it\u0026rsquos more than 13 per cent more than pupils attained in 2015 and 2016.  \u0026ldquoThirty per cent of the year group attained three or more Highers and the accumulate total was 66 per cent .  Finally, Claire Slowther, headteacher at Dunbar Grammar School, told the Courier that the staff at the school were \u0026ldquovery pleased with the exam results and said: \u0026ldquoAt Dunbar Grammar we are very pleased with the SQA results our students have achieved.  \u0026ldquoIt is wonderful to see the hard work of our students be rewarded with great results.  \u0026ldquoOur excellent team of teachers always work hard to support and challenge students and we were all really delighted to see them do well.  \u0026ldquoWe are incredibly proud of the achievements of our students and are looking forward to celebrating these at our awards evening, which will be held on September 12."},{"url":null,"title":"plans-for-longniddry-south-to-go-on-display","story":"  Developers Cruden Homes  and ZeroC will be displaying their proposals for development at the Longniddry Inn on Wednesday from 3pm to 8pm.

That project came about following rising safety concerns from drivers who did not feel confident using the unlit road.  Since then, driver confidence has improved by 78 per cent, with the project, which was undertaken by UK-based Clearview Intelligence in partnership with Transport Scotland and Amey, shortlisted in the Road Safety, Traffic Management and Enforcement category at the National Transport Awards, which take place in October.  Councillor Norman Hampshire, a Dunbar ward councillor and deputy leader of East Lothian Council, as well as chairman of the A1 Action Group, was one of those hailing the project as a big success.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe installation of the studs has, in my view, revolutionised the driving experience on the A1 after dark.  \u0026ldquoThe studs have improved night-time visibility beyond all recognition along certain parts of the route.  Concerns about driving conditions on the unlit road were first raised by the A1 Action Group, which comprises councillors from Scottish Borders and East Lothian Councils, transportation groups and community councils.  Transport Scotland met with the action group and, upon investigating the road, recognised that entering or exiting the A1 during the hours of darkness was a key area of concern due to a lack of visibility, junction definition and consistency in signage and road markings.  Clearview Intelligence was then appointed by Amey to make improvements to the road as part of a wider project and installed the road studs to give a visual consistency to the route by ensuring all major junctions were visible and treated similarly.  This included using white, red, amber and green studs to effectively highlight road edges, the centre of the road and junctions.  Andy Salotti, director of solutions at Clearview Intelligence, said: \u0026ldquoWe are immensely proud of the work we did to improve the driving conditions on the A1 and delighted this has been recognised at a national level.

However, fellow Tranent, Wallyford and Macmerry councillor Colin McGinn  said he was concerned about the traffic that would be created by more than 100 homes on the site, which is on the opposite side of the town\u0026rsquos Haddington Road from Steading View.  He added: \u0026ldquoWe have a responsibility within Tranent to increase employment and opportunities for our young people.  Councillor Brian Small , opposition leader, told the committee: \u0026ldquoThere is no point in having a [Local Development] Plan if at the first turn we think we can turn it over. We need to give this business land the opportunity to develop.  The committee was told that while the district valuer had agreed with developers that the land was not financially viable as a single business plot, they had said it could be made financially sound by developing it in phases.  Mr McMillan said: \u0026ldquoWe have enough land set aside for housing.  \u0026ldquoPeople want \u0026ndashand need \u0026ndash local employment and if we build it they will come. This is a signal to developers we want to grow the number of jobs around the county.  The committee voted by nine votes to two to support the officials\u0026rsquo recommendation to refuse the plans."},{"url":null,"title":"transport-co2-emissions-on-the-rise-in-east-lothian","story":"  The latest data from the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy has revealed that CO2 emissions from freight and passenger transport rose by 4.2 per cent in the county between 2011 and 2016.  That means traffic was responsible for 18.5 per cent of the total amount of carbon dioxide released in East Lothian in 2016.  But in total, CO2 emissions in the county fell over the same period.  Jason Rose, from East Lothian Greens, blamed more housing developments in East Lothian for the rise in CO2 from emissions relating to transport.  He told the Courier: \u0026ldquoTo live [in the new developments], you need a car. More houses means more cars.  Mr Rose also highlighted the fact that nearly half of East Lothian residents commute to Edinburgh every day for work.  \u0026ldquoThe main issue is half the people who live in East Lothian work in Edinburgh, so they have to commute, he said.  \u0026ldquoBuses take a long time, you want cheap and reliable.  \u0026ldquoWith trains, there definitely needs to be more of an effort to improve length and frequency.  \u0026ldquoEast Lothian Council should be trying to increase employment in East Lothian, so people don\u0026rsquot need to commute.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove heard some people say, \u0026lsquooh what if you open a bridge here or build another road?\u0026rsquo but creating more roads just increases traffic and spreads the problem around.  Overall, emissions from transport, both private and for business purposes, increased by 3.5 per cent in the UK over the period between 2011 and 2016.  However, total CO2 emissions fell by 4.6 per cent over the five years in East Lothian.  The county was responsible for releasing 1.1 million tonnes of CO2 in 2016 \u0026ndash down from 1.15 million tonnes five years earlier.  But Mr Rose highlighted that it was not just CO2 emissions that needed to be monitored.  \u0026ldquoWe need to watch for NO2  and PM10  \u0026ndash those are the pollutants that can cause health risks, he added.  In East Lothian, industrial and commercial activities are by far the main producer of CO2 emissions, releasing 63.9 per cent of the total. In 2016, households produced 16 per cent of the CO2 in the county, lower than five years earlier.  The Department also takes into account the amount of CO2 produced by farms and through other rural activities and the CO2 removed from the air by trees.  According to its estimates, these agricultural activities produced more greenhouse gases than forests removed, and so were responsible for 1.6 per cent of the carbon emissions in East Lothian in 2016.  Overall, the UK reduced its carbon emissions by 15.4 per cent over the five years."},{"url":null,"title":"in-this-weeks-courier","story":"  We\u0027ll also reveal the Top 25 in this year\u0027s Pet Idol competition.

Duo Gymnastics, based at the Aubigny Sports Centre, Haddington, is keen to buy a new vaulting table, which costs about \u0026pound1,000.  Jane said: \u0026ldquoWhat I have been really impressed with is the way the club and coaches have adapted to him.  \u0026ldquoThere is mainstream gymnastics but they have adapted lessons for his needs.  \u0026ldquoIt has made him not feel different and he still feels part of the club \u0026ndash he really enjoys it.  \u0026ldquoCameron\u0026rsquos disability comes under Global Development Delay.  \u0026ldquoHe has a real difficulty with comprehension and understanding what is being asked of him, following instructions.  \u0026ldquoHe is also very sensitive to noise and sudden loud noises.  \u0026ldquoThat is what they have managed to do really well, break it down into small parts for him.  \u0026ldquoThrough time, it becomes a routine and he understands what is being asked of him.  Jane, who lives near Gifford, has been a keen swimmer for a number of years and represented Scotland in the 1994 Commonwealth Games, in Canada.  However, after a break from swimming she returned to the pool at the beginning of the year before swapping the pool for the sea earlier this summer.  She said: \u0026ldquoI kept swimming as a hobby and to keep fit.  \u0026ldquoI have always swam but it has always been indoor swimming.  \u0026ldquoI started looking about and had always had an interest in open-water swimming but never did it.  \u0026ldquoI came across the Firth of Forth swim and that quite appeals to me and thought I would give it a go.  The mum-of-two signed up in March for the swim, which sees swimmers head off from Hawes Pier and swim alongside the Forth Bridge towards North Queensferry.  Swimmers set off at 2.10pm and have an hour to complete the 1.4-mile swim.  In preparation for the fundraiser on September 22, Jane has taken to the waters off Dumfries and Galloway\u0026rsquos coast and has also linked up with the Bass Rock Swimmers, who are based in North Berwick.  Despite being an accomplished swimmer, Jane said there were still challenges.  She said: \u0026ldquoThe currents are certainly a big factor.  \u0026ldquoIt is just your awareness and you can go off track very easily and just that anticipation of what is below you and what you are swimming over.  \u0026ldquoI have enjoyed the challenge and it has certainly put me out of my comfort zone.  \u0026ldquoI have really enjoyed it and met some really lovely people.  \u0026ldquoMy thanks go to my husband, Garry, and family for support and encourage to take on the challenge and to Duo Gymnastics Club for the support and help they have given Cameron.  Pamela Fletcher, from the gymnastics club, said: \u0026ldquoThanks to Jane undertaking the swim, the club can purchase a new and much needed vaulting table for the gymnastics at Aubigny Sport Centre. Due to local support we have now met our target however donations continue meaning we can hopefully purchase some more equipment. Our club trains twice a week however classes are ran Monday to Friday through enjoyleisure so the equipment is well used by over 200 local gymnasts.

I\u0026rsquom now in my late 50s, and 60 is looming ahead of me like a cat waiting to pounce and have cruel fun. Yet I know people who are in their 30s and 40s who are much older than me, and folk in their 60s and above who are younger. My oldest daughter is in her early 20s and is already lamenting the fact she is no longer \u0026lsquoyoung\u0026rsquo.  The truth is that age is a mentality or, as is often said, \u0026lsquojust a number\u0026rsquo. Of course, deteriorating health and pain can come with age, as I have experienced, but even then, getting this far makes me very thankful despite the wear and tear.  I often say that life is like toothpaste: we use it with abandon at first and then, as we realise it\u0026rsquos running out, each squirt becomes increasingly more precious and satisfying.  \u0026ldquoA whole summer seems nothing these days, it\u0026rsquos over before you get used to it, a friend said to me recently. And indeed it is nothing if we measure it by days passed.  Yet if we measure not the passing of hours, days or years but the accumulation of memories and experiences, then time seems longer, both in quantity and quality. The trick, then, is to make those experiences and memories, and to truly live in them as they happen. This means understanding what is truly meaningful to us, and what gives genuine joy and fulfilment.  I think that is the secret to a long life, regardless of what number you reach. It\u0026rsquos not just about how much toothpaste is in your tube, it\u0026rsquos about how much you savour and use the amount you have. All of us savour key moments, of course. The first day at school for our children, our holiday time, time with friends or spent doing things we enjoy.  Yet inevitably such moments are less common than what we might call the daily routine of life. I suppose that\u0026rsquos what makes them stand out. Thus the daily routine of \u0026lsquonormal\u0026rsquo life shoots us by, almost without us noticing. And that\u0026rsquos most of our life.  And so I am now more determined than ever to make my life \u0026lsquonot normal\u0026rsquo for as long as I may have left. This isn\u0026rsquot a commitment to hippy living in a campervan  but a conscious decision to savour every day as if it were my last. And what really helped me in this realisation was a conversation one day while waiting for a train. . .  One spring morning just before this summer, I was standing on the platform at Prestonpans station waiting for a train. I was not used to getting this early train and was surprised how busy it was. I was heading into Edinburgh to do some storytelling and so unusually sharing my journey with commuters.  It was a beautiful warm sunny morning, the herald of the heatwave soon to arrive. As I waited for the train I scrolled on my phone. Then I heard a voice behind me saying: \u0026ldquoOn your death bed, will you really look fondly back on the countless hours, equivalent to years of your life, spent scrolling on a phone? Will you remember just one per cent of that activity, or even want to?  I turned round to see who was speaking to me there was nobody. Then I noticed the hawthorn tree.  \u0026ldquoThat\u0026rsquos better, the hawthorn said. It was resplendent with blossom, leaning over the edge of the side of the bridge which takes the cars below the station.  Perhaps I had seen it before, but this time I really noticed it because it had spoken to me. I studied its flowers and took in the immense beauty of it. It\u0026rsquos perfectly situated to admire, but the hawthorn seemed sad.  \u0026ldquoCan you imagine the effort it takes to get this magnificent and beautiful? it said. \u0026ldquoYet nobody seems to notice me.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom sure they do, I replied. \u0026ldquoNo, they don\u0026rsquot watch, insisted the tree. And so I did.  The hawthorn was right. People walked past the tree, stood next to it, but nobody seemed to notice it, and certainly nobody took any time to admire it.  \u0026ldquoBut they are busy, I said in our defence.  \u0026ldquoWe are all busy in different ways, said the tree. \u0026ldquoBut we can choose to be \u0026lsquotoo busy\u0026rsquo for some things while being busy doing others. Often you decide what is important to be busy with so you exclude what you think are the less important things.  \u0026ldquoLike looking and admiring you? I replied sarcastically.  \u0026ldquoPrecisely, said the hawthorn, perhaps not understanding a sarcastic tone.  Suddenly the train arrived. People put away their phones and I bade a hasty farewell to the tree. We all crammed into the carriage and it filled up to the brim. I saw the blazing white of the hawthorn\u0026rsquos blossom through the window. Then we headed for Wallyford.  The train ground to a halt and the doors opened. There was a crush and people calling out politely \u0026ldquoplease move up. I wondered if everyone would get on, and I think they did, but only just. Now the train felt overloaded and it literally ground its way out of the station.  When it arrived at Musselburgh, the doors opened to present a human wall made of commuters from the Pans and Wallyford. There was simply no way anyone was getting on. I watched from the privilege of my seat. Two young men with suitcases, obviously going on holiday had no chance, and didn\u0026rsquot even try.  As the train pulled away, leaving dozens of people stranded on the platform, I felt a sense of guilt at having a seat. At Waverley we were trapped in a bottleneck by ticket collectors, ensuring that none of the lucky ones who had actually managed to get onto the train would escape paying for their good fortune.  When I returned I had to cross the bridge to my car. And there was the hawthorn tree, showing off its blossom like a peacock trying to impress a mate with its feather display.  And I have noticed the hawthorn ever since. The blossom faded as summer arrived and now it bears it berries. Its haws glisten where once there was blossom, reminding me that summer has had its course, and asking the question of how I made it memorable.  I am so thankful for the hawthorn\u0026rsquos advice. It was simple but so important. The trick is to live in the moment to notice that which makes the mundane and normal extraordinary or beautiful or special.  We can pepper our daily life with simple but extraordinary moments of connection, so a day never really remains \u0026lsquonormal\u0026rsquo. We just have to truly live in that moment, to come out of our busyness and worries, and savour it.  Maybe the hawthorn tree will speak to you if ever you find yourself at Prestonpans train station. Or maybe someone else will your child, your grandchild, your partner, friends, your grandparents, your work colleague, or perhaps your inner self.  Maybe it wasn\u0026rsquot actually the tree which spoke to me. Perhaps it was my inner self. But then again, perhaps it was a speaking hawthorn, and you have to be \u0026lsquonot normal\u0026rsquo to hear it!"},{"url":null,"title":"leader-of-councils-conservative-opposition-steps-down-after-health-issues","story":"  Councillor Brian Small, who has held the position since being one of seven Conservative councillors elected in May 2017, stood down for a brief period last year following a severe bout of sepsis before returning to the post.

Her lies meant there was a delay in providing necessary medical treatment, resulting in the tot experiencing \u0026ldquounnecessary and prolonged suffering.

The Scottish Social Services council decided to strike Craig from the register following a hearing on August 30.  The council told Craig: \u0026ldquo[The child] had sustained serious injuries and by failing to be open and honest about the circumstances of the accident, there was a delay in the appropriate medical treatment being sought for [the child].  \u0026ldquoThis is likely to have resulted in unnecessary and prolonged suffering being sustained by [the child].  \u0026ldquoPeople that use services, together with the public generally, have the right to expect that registered social service workers, in whom they place their trust and confidence, will work responsibly and not engage in dishonest behaviour, or any other behaviour, inside or outside of work, that would call into question their suitability to work in the social services profession.

A spokeswoman for nursery said: \u0026ldquoStaff are always vigorously checked with appropriate checks prior to starting any employment.  \u0026ldquoThis was an isolated incident and it was dealt with in respect of ensuring the child received the appropriate care.  \u0026ldquoAfter we received information that the child had broken her arm, we suspended [Craig] pending an investigation.  \u0026ldquoWe had CCTV footage that prove what had happened but [Cook] stuck to her story.

His determination to clear his name of allegations of sexual impropriety has the potential to tear the Scottish Government and the SNP apart. The two most important politicians in the modern history of Scottish nationalism have been pitted against each other at the very moment the party needs to unite over the future of independence.  We\u0027ve had the extraordinary spectacle of the former First Minister, and SNP leader, conducting a war of legal words over social media with the current First Minister, and SNP leader. In lengthy posts, Nicola Sturgeon defended the anti-sexual harassment procedures she introduced in January, and insisted on fairness for the complainants. Alex Salmond has condemned that due process as an unfair kangaroo court. Worse, he\u0027s accused the Scottish Government of leaking salacious details of the allegations to undermine him. Mr Salmond has even raised an action against the Scottish Government in the Court of Session.  For their part, Scottish Labour say that Nicola Sturgeon should already have suspended her predecessor from the party. That she has failed to follow the precedent set by the expulsion of the former Children\u0026rsquos Minister, Mark Macdonald. No formal complaint been lodged, however, with the SNP that could trigger such a disciplinary procedure. But to the dismay of many members, Ms Sturgeon has pointedly failed to rule out Mr Salmond\u0027s future defenestration. She can\u0027t.  The FM faces an acute dilemma. Under the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos procedures, complaints against former ministers are assessed by the civil service. If the result is problematic it is handed to the First Minister, \u0026ldquoin their capacity as party leader, so that the FM \u0026ldquocan take action to secure the highest standards of behaviour in the current administration. It\u0027s not clear what actions should be taken here, but you can be pretty sure critics will insist that suspension from the party is one of them. The allegations have been serious enough to be handed to the police.  However, the usual resignation argument that a minister cannot do their job properly until they\u0027ve \u0026ldquocleared their name does not apply. Alex Salmond sits in no parliament, holds no senior position in the party and is merely a sometime television presenter.  Labour\u0027s Rhoda Grant called for Mr Salmond to be suspended in order to create \u0026ldquoa safe space for his accusers \u0026ndash the two women who have made complaints. But it\u0027s not at all clear what kind of threat he is supposed to present to these women, or how removing Mr Salmond\u0027s membership card would make the space they occupy any more safe. The implication that Alex Salmond is some kind of crazed sex criminal, who cannot be allowed to walk free, is appalling. He\u0027s been found guilty of no improper conduct whatever.  Of course, the real damage was done by whoever leaked the confidential details of the allegations that he sexually assaulted two women. This vastly increased pressure on the First Minister to suspend Mr Salmond for the duration. He strenuously rejects the allegations and says he\u0027s been denied the right to see the evidence. That\u0027s assuming there is any concrete evidence.  Police and government agencies tend to work nowadays on the supposed Macpherson Principle that \u0026ldquovictims should always be believed, which is sometimes taken to mean that actual evidence is superfluous. Following a succession of miscarriages of justice, the politan Police has now abandoned this inversion of the presumption of innocence, and changed its guidance to say that accusers should be \u0026ldquolistened to rather than their allegations automatically accepted as fact. But it may be too late for Alex Salmond. In politics, you are now guilty until proven innocent. All the parties have tended to suspend politicians when allegations become public.  Many in the SNP are dismayed that Ms Sturgeon did not, at the very least, give her former mentor some kind of positive character reference last week, and then refuse to comment further. The First Minister placed herself at the forefront of the controversy, declaring that she was \u0026ldquo100% behind the Permanent Secretary, Leslie Evans, whom Mr Salmond\u0027s supporters believe has acted as judge and jury. Her remark that the complaints couldn\u0027t be \u0026ldquoswept under the carpet sounded damning.  The unalloyed glee among opposition politicians at what they see as the final humiliation of their greatest former foe is matched in the SNP by a kind of existential despair. It is hard to convey just how important Alex Salmond is to the independence movement. Political journalists and Women for Independence may regard the former leader as a hangover from alpha male politics, but for many ordinary nationalists he has hero status, comparable to that of Charles Stewart Parnell, the 19th century Irish Nationalist with whom Salmond used to compare himself. Unfortunately, that career ended with a sex scandal, too, over Parnell\u0027s adultery.  Irish nationalists always believed that Parnell was brought down by Establishment dirty tricks. There is an unshakeable conviction among many in the SNP that today\u0027s scandal must be, if not the work of M15, then a move by the deep state to silence an influential voice on the eve of a possible announcement of a second independence referendum. Salmond promised in his so-called Morningside Declaration in May to return to front line politics as soon as indyref2 is announced.  But if this is an establishment plot, then the unfortunate reality for Nationalists is that Nicola Sturgeon finds herself at the apex of it. As the new parliamentary term begins she\u0027ll come under intense pressure to suspend Mr Salmond from the party, or be accused of favouritism and hypocrisy. But if Alex Salmond were expelled on the eve of the most crucial SNP conference in years, the consequences would be unimaginable. The SNP has not just been rocked by this development it has been traumatised \u0026ndash and it may never be quite the same again."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/8486553.jpg?type=article-full","title":"five-women-in-business-speak-out","story":"  All women can think of another woman who has inspired her to try a career in business, education or industry.

We will never see greater female representation in workplaces or as entrepreneurs if women don\u0026rsquot apply for the jobs or start the businesses in the first place.

It seemed the perfect job Helen didn\u0026rsquot drink yet was interested in finding out more about the process. Little did she know it would take her life in a whole new direction.  Rather than viewing distilling as chemical engineering, Helen found it felt far more artistic - all based on the creative expression of how it looks, smells and tastes. After inheriting an old family book detailing how her relatives used to distil on the family farm, Helen realised distilling was part of her history and heritage.    With derelict out-buildings on her family\u0026rsquos farm, Helen had a fresh appreciation for these old spaces once viewed as a millstone around her neck. Buildings that were near fresh spring water, surrounded by botanicals created a unique opportunity.  Gin attracted Helen initially as the old distilling manual described how people used to flavour spirits with whatever was around them. The farm had a wealth of natural botanicals, including Scottish juniper, so suddenly this untapped heather hill was incredibly valuable.  The gin is named Badvo, after Helen\u0026rsquos family farm where the stories of distilling inspired Helen when starting out. The heron logo represents the fresh spring water used, as only a very pure spring can support enough fish for a heron. To fund the start-up, Helen pre-sold the first batch of 105 bottles collectively for \u0026pound6,500, going on to use the money to unlock match funding, which snowballed until the entire distillery was grant funded.    Helen commented: \u0026ldquoI got a lot of flak for being a solo entrepreneur. Yes, there are downsides to being a one-man band, but it gives you the opportunity to be dynamic. You can make a decision and you don\u0026rsquot have to justify it to anyone or get it past any board.  \u0026ldquoIt hurts occasionally when people assume someone else set up the distillery as I am too young or too female to have accomplished this alone. I just don\u0026rsquot think some people can comprehend how you can cover so much ground at this stage in life, but I think this is the perfect time.

On the contrary, her peer group expected that students of both sexes could progress to further education, and into careers of our choice. This certainly was Julie\u0026rsquos experience.    Graduating from Glasgow University, Bachelor of Laws with Honours in 1993, Julie then went on to complete the required post-graduate Diploma in Legal Practice in 1994. A legal Traineeship commenced immediately, and she was formally admitted as a solicitor in 1995, at the age of 23. By 27, Julie had been promoted to partner. At that time, she was one of the youngest female partners in a law firm in Scotland. By 2015, more than 60 per cent of solicitors under the age of 40, practising in Scotland, were women \u0026ndash unimaginable in 1995, far less in 1918. For the following 11 years, Julie practised a wide range of areas of law and managed three of her firm\u0027s\u0026nbspbranch offices. She was in charge of HR, and worked long hours.  In 2010, Julie decided to leave the relative security of her large firm behind. Seeking a better work/life balance, she set up her own firm \u0026ndash Millen Solicitors. Hard work continued, and although she faced pressures of a different kind as a sole practitioner, she succeeded in achieving a balance, not only for herself, but for every member of her team.  From the outset, Julie envisaged a practice which would provide an exceptional level of service to clients, and a collegiate and stimulating environment for employees. These values continue at the core of Millen Solicitors as they approach the end of their 8th successful year.    \u0026ldquoFamily Solicitors For Generations is the business maxim, with a nod to their specialisms in all aspects of family law, as well as powers of attorney, wills and executries. Julie and her team provide an outstanding, supportive and compassionate service to families, parents, grandparents and children in times of crisis or uncertainty, at ying stages of their respective lives. Their clients agree, with the majority of work now coming in the form of referrals from satisfied clients, and professional colleagues seeking their expertise.  Julie comments: \u0026ldquoI am proud to have contributed to the cracking of the \u0026ldquoglass ceiling, and I look forward to seeing Scotland\u0026rsquos entrepreneurial women achieve its eventual demise.

The first edition of the Sunday Herald was published in February 1999 and captured a Scotland that is now unrecognisable.  Tony Blair, approaching his second anniversary as a Labour prime minister, had embarked on a radical agenda of social, economic and constitutional change. Devolution had been endorsed through a referendum and voters were three months away from voting in the first Holyrood election.  The first issue, assembled by visionary editor Andrew Jaspan and his team, carried a front-page interview with Blair by Kirsty Milne, who was the paper\u0026rsquos first political editor. The then prime minister told the fledgling paper that devolution was a \u0026ldquo21st-century symbol of a \u0026ldquomulti-layered democracy based on \u0026ldquopartnership in the UK and the European Union.  Fast-forward to today, which marks the last issue of the Sunday Herald, and few people could have predicted how the political landscape that had existed under Blair would change.  Back then, the SNP had around half a dozen parliamentarians. Now the party has more than 100 MSPs, MPs and MEPs. Labour dominated UK and Scottish politics in 1999 but has been out of power at Westminster and Holyrood for a generation. Debate still centres around the constitution, but on independence, not devolution. And Brexit looks set to extinguish our relationship with the EU.  The Sunday Herald\u0026rsquos political journey over that period reflects the switch made by large segments of Scottish voters: broadly sympathetic to Blair in the early years of his premiership, but turned off by the Iraq war. Tentatively pro-SNP in 2007 \u0026ndash more out of frustration with Labour than anything else \u0026ndash before becoming pro-independence.  However, regardless of constitutional politics, the paper\u0026rsquos political anchor never moved. Under all three editors \u0026ndash Jaspan, Richard Walker and Neil Mackay \u0026ndash the Sunday Herald was centre-left, socially liberal and pro-European. Appealing to younger readers was also a key part of its ethos.  My overriding memory of the Sunday Herald is not just of a paper that adopted a distinctive position on independence, but of a publication that broke big political stories and had far-reaching consequences. In circulation terms we were bantamweight, but in our coverage we fought at a higher level.  Milne, who passed away in 2013, was in the job for barely a few months before moving on and going on to become a renowned columnist. Its first Scottish political editor, Douglas Fraser, brought intellectual heft to the Sunday Herald and was in post for five years from 1999. While anti-devolution publications tried to undermine the Scottish Parliament, his coverage was marked by fairness and balance. He was an authoritative presence who was the right political editor for the time.  Fraser was in post during one of the most shameful episodes of recent Scottish history. In 2000, when Labour\u0026rsquos former minister Wendy Alexander announced plans to repeal anti-gay legislation which banned the promotion of homosexuality in schools, forces including SNP donor Brian Souter, the Catholic Church and the Daily Record mounted an ugly campaign of opposition.  Fraser and his colleagues, to their credit, extensively reported the distortions of the Keep the Clause campaign, while the Sunday Herald\u0026rsquos stance urged the Labour-led Executive to hold firm. The paper\u0026rsquos uncompromising stance in defending a vulnerable minority group helped define its political outlook more than any other issue. Opposition to the Iraq War, meanwhile, bolstered its progressive credentials.  Fraser also covered the early traumas and controversies of devolution, such as the death of Donald Dewar and the resignation of his successor as First Minister, Henry McLeish, before moving to The Herald. We also benefited from first-class Westminster coverage from Iain Watson, James Cusick and Torcuil Crichton.  I became the Sunday Herald\u0026rsquos Scottish political editor in 2004 after an approach by a senior figure on the paper. Although there had been a formal process, I got the impression the job was mine unless I cried or puked at the interview. I held my nerve and was hired by Jaspan.  Without making myself sound like a sociopath, I had a different temperament to Fraser and brought my own style. He was cerebral \u0026ndash I use that as praise \u0026ndash and interested in policy, whereas I was an angry 27-year-old who wasn\u0026rsquot quite sure what he was angry about. My title should have been \u0026ldquoanti-political editor. Months after I started, Jaspan moved to Australia and Richard Walker became editor. He wanted a more robust approach to politics, which I was comfortable with, and we worked together closely for 11 years until he left the paper in 2015.  I\u0026rsquom proud of our working relationship. An investigation into Scottish Tory leader David McLetchie\u0026rsquos expenses \u0026ndash yes, I think it was legitimate no, I don\u0026rsquot believe it was petty \u0026ndash led to him quitting and Holyrood publishing the entirety of the MSP allowances system online.  Stories on Labour chief Wendy Alexander\u0026rsquos dodgy donation to her leadership campaign triggered her resignation, while coverage of crooked MP Jim Devine\u0026rsquos expenses got him jail time. During the latter investigation, I was lucky not to die after getting knocked down by a random driver on the way to doing a television interview on the Devine story. I was later told a senior Holyrood figure had said he wished the accident had been \u0026ldquomore serious.  In 2012, by which time I was writing about politics as investigations editor, our stories on abuser Bill Walker, who was an SNP MSP at the time, led to him getting a custodial sentence. We also broke, and covered endlessly, the story on Labour shenanigans in Falkirk, which had major consequences outwith one town in central Scotland.  Reporters are only as good as their editors allow them to be. If your boss spikes your work, or puts it on page 38, the article has either zero or marginal impact. All these political stories were published during Walker\u0027s editorship. We had cross words once \u0026ndash it was my fault \u0026ndash and I can recall only one occasion in 11 years when I felt a good story had been canned. Any journalist would accept that sort of ratio.  Before this sounds like a self-regarding roll-call of glory, I should offer full disclosure by admitting to a mistake or two. In 2007, I reported that a mystery Labour MP \u0026ndash \u0026ldquohe or she \u0026ndash was \u0026ldquopoised to defect to the SNP. The story, much to my embarrassment, subsequently proved to be cobblers.  So appalled was I by the prospect of winning the Tartan Bollocks \u0026ndash given to the journalist who penned the most inaccurate story of the year \u0026ndash I fled to Paris for two nights and skipped the dunce ceremony. One colleague woundingly described my loser\u0026rsquos expedition as a trip to the \u0026ldquocity of self-love.  I also over-wrote a story about something vaguely controversial former first minister Jack McConnell had said about drugs when he was a student. My awful piece, which we splashed, had all the zest of a casserole that had been decomposing in a garden for six months. Walker\u0027s last-minute \u0026ldquotweaks did not help. In the end, it read like it had been written in Bulgarian and put through Google Translate.    Image: Bill Walker\u0027s violent past    Front pages: Wendy Alexander and Jim Devine    Splash: the Labour/Falkirk fiasco and free school milk  My successor, Tom Gordon, became Scottish political editor in 2008 and stayed in the job until 2016. To paraphrase author PG Wodehouse, it was never hard to tell the difference between Tom in a grumpy mood and a ray of sunshine. If there had been an Olympics for small talk, it is unlikely he would ever have made the podium. He was also the best reporter I worked with.  He and I \u0026ndash friends as well as colleagues \u0026ndash competed with rival papers, of course, but also with each other. We would have endless \u0026ldquodiscussions about joint bylines, whose beat a particular story fell on, and who had the best angle to justify top billing. It was my favourite time on the paper.  Gordon was the paper\u0026rsquos longest-serving Scottish political editor and had a terrific scoop count. He revealed how Alex Salmond had congratulated former RBS chief executive Fred Goodwin on the botched ABN AMRO deal. He also reported how the Tory Government was planning to axe free school milk for under fives, a story that triggered a televised U-turn by the Government hours after its publication.  He also disclosed how Better Together secretly called their campaign Project Fear \u0026ndash a phrase that went viral \u0026ndash and exposed how the SNP had been auctioning Holyrood lunches at party fundraising events. One caveat: just as I cringe at my McConnell drugs \u0026ldquoscoop, I imagine Gordon does not dwell too long on his 2013 \u0026ldquoexclusive report about a predicted \u0026ldquooil boom in the North Sea. I did not seek a joint byline on that one.  Gordon\u0027s time in the job also coincided with the editor of the paper backing a Yes vote in the referendum. I offer no comment on this decision \u0026ndash it was above my pay grade \u0026ndash but some basic facts should be noted. Unlike other newspapers, whose big editorial decisions are influenced by proprietors living abroad, the Sunday Herald\u0026rsquos position was not taken by its owner but its editor. It was Walker\u0027s call and he made the decision. He explained it clearly and never shied away from defending what even opponents of independence would concede was a major moment in the campaign.  It has also been said Walker was motivated by commercial opportunism. Again, wrong. His decision stemmed from his personal belief in independence. He had been moving the paper in this direction for around three years and was convinced it was the right move for Scotland.  Walker left in 2015 and was replaced by Neil Mackay, who continued with the Sunday Herald\u0026rsquos pro-independence stance and who was instinctively supportive of investigative journalism. Our last Scottish political editor was Andrew Whitaker, an impressive story-getter who was known for his persistence in pursuit of an exclusive. Whitaker\u0027s reporting led to the SNP Government announcing an inquiry into the miners\u0026rsquo strike and he revealed Nicola Sturgeon\u0026rsquos plan for a reshuffle.  Having worked for 14 years on the Sunday Herald, it is natural I feel a huge sadness at the paper\u0026rsquos demise. However, a combination of branding difficulties and low circulation made the company\u0026rsquos decision to cease publication inevitable. The creation of two new Sunday newspapers is also a positive move for the media in Scotland.  The Sunday Herald no longer has a future, but this should not detract from the impactful political coverage that its editors and reporters produced in the years since its iconic first edition nearly two decades ago."},{"url":null,"title":"vicky-allan-waving-goodbye-on-a-feminist-wave","story":"  Here, then, are my last lines for a paper that\u0026rsquos taken up around a third of my life. I keep trying to think back to what things were like in 2003 when I arrived at what I thought was an utterly cool paper. Sixteen years is long enough not to quite remember how things were and how you thought the future world might turn out. But, among the many things I probably didn\u0026rsquot imagine is the past week of Scottish news, and that we would be watching one first minister  struggling to navigate what to do about the sexual misconduct allegations against the last first minister .  That, to me, says a great deal about where Scotland and the world have come to. It speaks of the journey that has been made in women\u0026rsquos rights, and what kind of behaviours we tolerate. Power structures seem, at times, like they\u0026rsquore on the verge of being overturned.  This world, where it\u0026rsquos conceivable that a political giant like Alex Salmond could fall over such allegations, true or not, is different to the one we were writing about in 2003. It\u0026rsquos also different from the one I reflected in 2015, when I casually described an interview meeting with Salmond in which he unexpectedly greeted me with a friendly kiss on the lips. The tone has changed \u0026ndash transformed by #MeToo.  But I\u0026rsquove seen, and covered, many other changes in that time. The revolution, for instance, in gender identity. It\u0026rsquos hard to believe that back in 2014, when I wrote a piece on non-binary people in the trans community, I had barely come across the term gender fluid. There has been a profound shift, too, in how open we are about mental health. I remember when I interviewed former MSP Rosie Kane about her depression back in 2004, it seemed like she was busting some intractable taboo.  The Sunday Herald reflected that changing world and debated it. It did more than that. It told the human stories behind it. It brought to its pages tales from the unheard or powerless, and it encouraged me, and other writers \u0026ndash Judith Duffy and Karin Goodwin \u0026ndash to look at the people who were struggling in 21st century society, as well as those who were shaping it. When, for instance, the Domestic Abuse  Bill was proposed, we carried harrowing stories from women who had experienced coercion and violence.  I\u0026rsquoll always think of the Sunday Herald as the place that nurtured my feminism and social awareness, as well as my journalism. Interviews with big names were part of that. But, above all, it was my meetings with everyday people who talked of their lives, dramas, challenges, and frustrations, that shaped my world view.  I mourn already the loss of the old Sunday Herald. I felt an immense pride at being part of the team here, of being read alongside such greats at Ian Bell, Iain Macwhirter, David Pratt, Joanna Blythman and Tom Shields. The editors I worked for were inspiring. But the world shifts. The industry moves.  What doesn\u0026rsquot change is the need for stories. Hence, I look forward to bringing them to the new hope, the Herald On Sunday.  Here\u0027s to all those good times  Did I forget to mention the fun? For, at least back in the early years, the Sunday Herald felt like it was a paper that was almost up for anything. Whatever madcap idea you had, there was a chance you could give it a go. Within my first couple of years I\u0026rsquod camped in the snow-blanketed woods with the Naked Rambler, been wolf-tracking in Poland, tried out as a commis chef at Andrew Fairlie\u0026rsquos. But others were pushing the envelope further. As Peter Ross, whose features writing lit up the paper for many years put it, in a tweet: \u0026ldquo The Sunday Herald was a blast at times. It felt like you could just do stuff.  In fact, no one really describes it \u0026ndash or, for that matter, anything \u0026ndash better than Ross. \u0026ldquoIn those days, he says, \u0026ldquoit was hardly a hard-bitten news room. It was more Girl On A Motorcycle than His Girl Friday: full of louche, bohemian types talking about fonts. I remember one colleague \u0026ndash I won\u0026rsquot name him, but it was Barry Didcock \u0026ndash turned up one day in sandals with his toenails painted blue. I remember we commissioned Edwin Morgan to review The Phantom Menace. Not sure what poor Eddie did to deserve that particular assignment. I think it was Pat Kane\u0026rsquos idea. Anything seemed possible, failure most of all. Every week there seemed to be another meeting at which graphs were wheeled out to suggest that we were probably doomed but might not be.  So here we are. Doom comes knocking for the Sunday Herald. But, as they say every death is a new beginning. Here\u0026rsquos hoping, whatever happens, it\u0026rsquos a blast."},{"url":null,"title":"businessman-who-ran-companies-while-being-a-disqualified-director-convicted-after-sunday-herald-investigation","story":"  Stephen Roberts, 50, was in effective control of two health and medical technology firms \u0026ndash one of which his law officer wife was a major shareholder in \u0026ndash while he was banned.  Roberts\u0026rsquo wife Nicky Patrick, procurator fiscal for homicide and major crime, is listed at Companies House as having had the largest holding of 8,997 shares in one of the firms, Log Six Systems , in 2013. Her husband owned 7,503, giving the couple a majority of the shares.  There is no absolutely suggestion Patrick knew about the management of the business at the time. The Crown Office is now investigating her husband\u0026rsquos financial affairs and have applied for a confiscation order under the Proceeds of Crime Act.  Former bankrupt Roberts, of Troon, Ayrshire, was disqualified for four years in July 2010 after failing to ensure a previous firm, Innova Business Solutions, had paid tax. Innova owed \u0026pound292,882 when it was liquidated. An appeal judge described him as \u0026ldquoevasive\" and \u0026ldquodevious in cross-examination.  In 2013, a Sunday Herald investigation revealed Roberts was involved in a healthcare start-up, LSS, that won a \u0026pound50,000 prize at a Dragons\u0027 Den-style event funded by Scottish Enterprise and the Scottish Government.  John Swinney, then finance secretary, presented the prize to Roberts and a former director but Scottish Enterprise later withheld some of the money. Despite Roberts\u0026rsquo directorship ban, which stopped him forming, promoting or managing a company, this newspaper uncovered footage of him saying on a crowdfunding site: \u0026ldquoWe kill superbugs, but we can do it 12 times faster and 100 times cheaper than existing disinfectant methods.  Log Six has the ability to save lives, time and money on a global scale with proven technology to a global problem. And with your help we can make it happen faster.  In another video, Roberts addressed an audience at Heriot-Watt University and said: \u0026ldquoWe have developed a high-efficacy disinfectant chemical, which has been proven to kill every pathogen known to man.  The articles were followed by a police investigation and Roberts later denied two charges of being involved in the \u0026ldquoformation, promotion and management of LSS and another company, Nightingale Intensive Systems International, between September 2011 and July 2014.  After a lengthy trial at Kilmarnock Sheriff Court, Roberts was found guilty of both charges after Sheriff Iona McDonald ruled he had been a \u0026ldquodriving force of Nightingale and co-founder of LSS, where he referred to his \u0026ldquoinvestors.  McDonald told Roberts: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos clear you told almost everyone you were a disqualified director.  Gary Allan QC, defence counsel, told the court: \u0026ldquoThe whole sorry saga has been a social, family and financial catastrophe.  McDonald continued the case for 10 weeks for prosecutors to produce a statement of Roberts\u0026rsquo financial affairs for a confiscation order under the Proceeds of Crime Act."},{"url":null,"title":"sunday-herald-the-birth-of-a-media-legend","story":"  IT began as Project White \u0026ndash a top secret scheme to cook up a new paper for a new century, a newspaper that would go on to define modern Scotland.  The first inklings of Project White took shape in February 1998 thanks to Gus Macdonald. Macdonald had risen from humble beginnings as an apprentice in the Govan shipyards to become one of the most significant figures in Scottish journalism. A glittering career saw him rise to director of programmes for STV by the mid-1980s and, after Tony Blair took power in 1997, he was made a life peer, taking his seat in the Lords as Baron Macdonald of Tradeston. He went on to become Minister of Transport and Cabinet Office Minister.  Macdonald, today in his mid-70s, was a powerful and influential man in the late 90s. At the end of 1997, he was appointed non-executive chairman of Scottish Media Group, then owners of both STV and The Herald. As a leftwing big beast in the media, Macdonald was a man uncomfortable with the state of the Scottish press \u0026ndash for both political and business reasons. He felt the right-wing tilt of the Scotsman skewed the national debate, and also worried that The Scotsman \u0026ndash combined with its sister paper Scotland on Sunday \u0026ndash was a threat to both The Herald\u0026rsquos circulation and advertising revenues. So he hit on an idea \u0026ndash what if The Herald had a Sunday title as well \u0026hellip  One of the other big beasts of British and Scottish journalism in the 90s was Andrew Jaspan \u0026ndash a gifted maverick and an inspirational leader who had edited The Observer, The Sunday Times Scotland, The Scotsman and Scotland on Sunday. In early February 1998, Jaspan received a phone call from Macdonald out of the blue. Macdonald asked if they could meet in the House of Lords.  \u0026ldquoBack in the 1970s, Jaspan says, \u0026ldquoGus would have wanted a blether over a pint of beer, in the 1980s it might have been a glass of wine, now he tempted me with \u0026lsquotea served in the finest House of Lords\u0026rsquo bone china\u0026rsquo.  Macdonald had a simple proposition: would Jaspan be interested in setting up a new Sunday paper? Jaspan quickly agreed and soon he and the CEO of Scottish Media Group, a reserved but affable and media-savvy former accountant called Andrew Flanagan, met in London. Flanagan asked Jaspan to come up with a feasibility study \u0026ndash how much would this paper cost, how many staff would he need, how much money could it pull in, and most importantly: what would the paper stand for. Jaspan was told to keep the entire scheme utterly under wraps. Not a word was to be breathed to anyone.  Gary Hughes, Flanagan\u0026rsquos deputy, told Jaspan it was to be called \"Project White\". Jaspan asked why \u0026ndash Hughes replied \"because we have given you a blank sheet of paper\".  What followed next was a five-month period of intense and secretive work by Jaspan in order to get the figures right, mould the editorial philosophy, and come up with the branding and marketing for a new paper for Scotland \u0026ndash one of the most crowded newspaper markets in the world. By the end of August, Jaspan delivered Flanagan his masterplan.  He wanted to create a paper that felt young and aspirational.  The world had changed drastically by the time 1998 came to a close \u0026ndash the age of deference was dead, the Cold War was over, the Good Friday Agreement had been signed bringing peace to Northern Ireland, and Scotland was soon to get her own parliament again. Facile as it may sound today, back then \"Cool Britannia\" \u0026ndash a cocktail of Britpop, the craze for young British artists like Tracey Emin and Damien Hirst, fashion designers like Alexander McQueen, a new youthful Labour government, and a growing economy \u0026ndash seemed to sum up a country brimming with hope and change.  \u0026ldquoHistory was in the making and I wanted a paper that would embrace this change, Jaspan says. When it came to the new era of devolution, he wanted the paper to \u0026ldquowelcome the opening of a new chapter for Scotland. That\u0026rsquos not to say the paper would be a cheerleader, but we would give the new constitutional arrangements a chance to succeed, and pounce on any ill-thought out policy or actions. It was, then, to be a paper both positive about Scotland \u0026ndash there would be no \"Scottish cringe\" \u0026ndash and a watchdog over those in power. But what would it be called? From the get-go, the title that became the frontrunner was the \"Sunday Herald\".  \u0026ldquoThis instantly told readers that the paper was part of The Herald family, but of course a new Sunday paper, Jaspan says. \u0026ldquoWe had messed around with other neutral names, but no others were seriously considered. The upside was that this would be an easier sell to Herald readers \u0026ndash that is, to ask them to drop Scotland on Sunday and chose a west coast Sunday, the downside was that Edinburgh readers might still shy away from a Glasgow paper.  But the Sunday Herald was never intended to be just a Glasgow paper. Capturing sales and ad revenue on the west coast of Scotland was merely the first step to securing the financial future of a new national title, a newspaper which saw itself on the world stage, not on simply the British or Scottish stage.  With the title and vision in place, Jaspan needed to give the paper \"a look\". How to design a paper that wanted to be different to every other paper on the news stands? This was a paper that wasn\u0026rsquot going to talk down to readers, or tell them how to think \u0026ndash it would take for granted that readers were intelligent and well-read, that they wanted information and entertainment, not dull instruction from above. The look of the paper had to reflect that very modern approach to news.  So, one of the most talented designers in European newspapers made a trek north to Glasgow. Simon Esterson had won plaudits internationally for his work on the redesign of \u0026rsquos G2 section. To Jaspan, when it came to designing the new paper, Esterson was the only person for the job. Perhaps the best way to explain how radical Esterson\u0026rsquos design was is to ask you to turn to the front cover of this paper and look at the masthead \u0026ndash the title is all in lower case, the colours vivid primary blue and red. It 1998, this was a radical approach to newspaper design, and a dramatic way to signal a break with the papers of old. The Sunday Herald was to be simple, elegant \u0026ndash a canvas for what would go on to be award-winning photography and journalism. As the first new paper of the 21st century, Jaspan wanted to \u0026ldquoproduce journalism to read, not flick through.  The paper was to have six elements: five printed sections \u0026ndash News, Seven Days , Sport, Business, Jobs and a magazine \u0026ndash and, crucially, one digital section, a website, marking the Sunday Herald as the only paper to embrace online at this stage. Back then, The Herald and The Scotsman still had no web presence. After the Sunday Herald launched \u0026ndash using its website as an integrated part of the paper \u0026ndash , now one of the world\u0026rsquos most popular news sites, soon followed suit.  By now, everything was in place \u0026ndash apart from people: the staff who would make this still imaginary venture take life. And it was the people that made the Sunday Herald. Anyone \u0026ndash and I mean literally anyone, apart from a few sad souls who just didn\u0026rsquot get the spirit of the paper \u0026ndash anyone who has worked on the title will say without hesitation that not only did it give them the best years of their careers, but it often made their careers, and it made them friends \u0026ndash and sometimes lovers \u0026ndash who last with them until this day.  The first two people to be brought onboard were Charles Magee \u0026ndash a consummate journalist who has mastered every art in the industry \u0026ndash and Richard Walker, one of the most talented, hardworking journalists in the UK. Both had worked with Jaspan at Scotland on Sunday. Magee was to work on a publishing system \u0026ndash a bit like building a bespoke desktop printing press from scratch \u0026ndash and Walker tirelessly fine-tuned design. The three-man team holed up in a backroom in STV that stored the props for the crime show Taggart, working in secret to keep opposition newspapers in the dark.  With the foundations now in place, Jaspan went to the board of directors of SMG in September 1998 and got final approval to launch the paper \u0026ndash the only member of the board who seemed less than enthused was David Montgomery, the notoriously dour Ulsterman who had set up the now defunct Today newspaper, and was then running Mirror Group, which had a stake in SMG. Despite the board\u0026rsquos support, there was a sting in the tale for Jaspan: the board wanted the paper launched by the end of January 1999. He had three months to get one of the most ambitious media projects of the last half-century off the ground, and an entire team \u0026ndash more than 50 staff \u0026ndash to hire.  \u0026ldquoI wanted to recruit a cadre of journalists,Jaspan says, \u0026ldquowho would relish the challenge of working on a new paper, which would be a beacon of editorial excellence in everything it did. I wanted to hire journalists who had fire in their bellies \u0026ndash those who wanted to prove themselves rather than those hacks who just wanted to play the safe game and sleep-walk to their pension. I wanted free thinkers who would give the paper a feel of being new and different, so that we would not just be another ordinary Sunday newspaper.  In the end, that thought \u0026ndash \"No Ordinary Sunday\" \u0026ndash would become the tag line for all Sunday Herald marketing and branding. But it also helped Jaspan focus his mind on the kind of people he wanted working for the new Sunday Herald.  He quickly assembled a team, pillaging the best talent from opposition titles in Scotland and London \u0026ndash what better way to get the jump on Scotland on Sunday than taking its gunslingers and have them turn their firepower on their old employer. When staff were hired they were a little taken aback to find themselves each given a beanie hat \u0026hellip emblazoned with the logo \"No Ordinary Headline\"."},{"url":null,"title":"maverick-genius-some-just-plain-mad-people-behind-the-sunday-herald","story":"  There are too many names to list here but among those that stand out from the early days were Pennie Taylor, who joined as health editor from the BBC and remains to this day one of the go-to experts on the NHS Connie Henderson, an unflappable news editor also brought in from the BBC Torcuil Crichton, now the Westminster editor of the Daily Record and undoubtedly the most charming Gael to ever have left the western isles Susan Flockhart, the former editor of the Big Issue in Scotland and an old-fashioned intellectual who brought real gravitas and intelligence to the newsroom David Milne, a bright whip-smart young executive also from the Big Issue in Scotland who now looks after STV\u0026rsquos digital side Lesley Riddoch, the voice of Scottish feminism and a big brain and big player in the nation\u0026rsquos media Ron McKay, a hack\u0026rsquos hack, game for anything, and one of the best reporters to ever come out of Scotland David Pratt, perhaps the most seasoned war reporter this country has ever produced and a man who has risked his life countless times to bring back to Scotland the truth about what is happening overseas David Dick, known to the crew as Dave Vegas  and another big talent who is now the editor of the Daily Record Roxanne Sorooshian, one of the best production journalists in the game Jane Wright, a brilliant magazine executive and a woman born to throw a good party Alan Taylor, a literary flaneur and Scotland\u0026rsquos answer to Tom Wolfe Ian Bell, perhaps the greatest Scottish columnist ever, now sadly dead at too young an age and a loss to us all Donald Cowie, an unassuming and charming sports editor Trevor Royle, a quintessential gentleman and military historian who became the paper\u0026rsquos diplomatic editor Chris Furlong, a former soldier turned photographer with the eye of an artist and a big, kind, happy heart former BBC anchor Iain Macwhirter, a man who knows more about Scottish politics than just about anyone alive Pat Kane, pop star turned public intellectual and Simon Stuart, a chief sub-editor who subjected copy to linguistic forensics and had a gift for hollering the most inventive expletives should a split infinitive or unnecessary pluperfect tense ever cross his desk \u0026ndash the man was a veritable Profanisaurus he\u0026rsquos now an acclaimed psychologist after leaving journalism.

The team holed up on the top floor \u0026ndash in a building that smelled of bad canteen food and cigarettes. Cigarettes played a major part in the early days with most staff taking it in turns to hang out of the toilet window for a lightning quick drag on a fag before racing back to their desks to finish a 12-hour day.  If the bricks and mortar were less than salubrious \u0026ndash the new Sunday Herald office was something different, something very modern: it was the first newsroom kitted out in day-glow iMacs, each desk dotted with a neon green, blue or red computer. Staff soon learned that each byline would be printed in the paper with an email address beneath. It may seem quaint now \u0026ndash but this was cutting edge, and it represented something very democratic, a way for readers to directly communicate with the writers in their paper of choice.  Staff at The Herald and the Evening Times \u0026ndash the Sunday Herald\u0026rsquos other sister paper \u0026ndash kept their distance, suspicious  both of what changes the new paper might usher in for them, and of the loosening of corsets on the top floor. Not all Sunday Herald staff came to work in a shirt and tie, or a nice two-piece ladies\u0026rsquo business suit. There were strange rumours that some staff at the Sunday Herald were seen wearing jeans and even \u0026hellip trainers. This was Generation X taking over the newsroom, and not everyone was chuffed about it.  The Sunday Herald even had its own dedicated entrance at the Black Lubyanka \u0026ndash the separation was intentional, in order to preserve the distinct identity of the paper, but also so such sights as staff coming to work listening to headphones would not cause mass disgust on the other floors.  Before the first edition rolled off the presses in early 1999, all staff got together for a mass briefing from editor Andrew Jaspan. \u0026ldquoI wanted to make sure everyone was singing from the same hymn sheet, he says. The vision which Jaspan laid out to staff was this: the paper is being born at the fag end of the 20th century, so look forward, not back \u0026ndash embrace change and challenge yourself and despite the changing and increasingly hectic and atomised way we live our lives in modern Scotland, Sunday remains a day distinct from the rest of the week, it is a day of relaxation, play, family and food \u0026ndash so amuse readers, give them some laughs along with the heavy news. Sunday newspaper readers are also notoriously promiscuous \u0026ndash hopping into bed with one paper one week because a free CD is being given away, but picking up a different paper the following week because of an investigation or big celebrity interview \u0026ndash so we had to give them a reason to fall in love and stay with us.  Jaspan had a few nice little metaphors to throw in as well. A Sunday newspaper is different, staff recall him saying, because the reader isn\u0026rsquot reading their paper on the train or over a hurried breakfast, they are reading the paper over a leisurely lunch, or at home on the couch, or even naked, in bed. \u0026ldquoArouse them! Jaspan hollered. Sunday papers, Jaspan knew, relied on an element of \"theatre\" \u0026ndash journalism is the lowest rung of show business after all \u0026ndash so the Sunday Herald needed to stand out, be different and make readers stop and think.  Finally, Jaspan, told his team, everything could be boiled down to the four \"I\u0026rsquos\" \u0026ndash the paper must be independent of thought, intelligent, international in outlook and, when needed, irreverent to authority.  That was it \u0026ndash the staff had a few weeks to go before the revised launch date, February 7 1999, so they better go off and start finding stories and thinking up some good ideas. The next two Sundays saw the team work on two dummy editions of the paper, making sure the production system was right, that stories were being filed on time, and that the whole thing knitted together in one seamless chain from newsroom to corner shop. There was one casualty in those few weeks before the paper went live \u0026ndash a section head who was just a little bit out of their depth, and left before the heat in the kitchen got too hot for them. My one abiding memory of this time is of being cheated out of a cracking story I\u0026rsquod written making it onto the news stands. Our final dummy paper was to have a print run of less than 100 so staff \u0026ndash and only staff \u0026ndash could see what an actual physical edition of the Sunday Herald would look like. We spent Saturday as a live news day \u0026ndash each of us doing our jobs as if the paper would be in the shops the next morning. My beat was crime and terrorism. Around noon, I got a call that a big paramilitary player in Northern Ireland had been killed. I hit the phones and got details on the murder, the killers, the motive, pictures \u0026ndash the lot. The execs decided the story was the splash \u0026ndash but it was a splash that would never see the light of day."},{"url":null,"title":"the-camaraderie-nothing-but-a-bunch-of-absinthe-sipping-dilettantes-less-of-the-sipping-please","story":"  \u0026ldquoThat was my final hoorah at the Sunday Herald, says Jaspan. \u0026ldquoWhen I addressed the staff to say I had resigned, I felt terrible. I had hand-picked this team and they had been truly brilliant. They had given their all to make this paper special. I thanked them all from the bottom of my heart.  The Sunday Herald had also by now developed a reputation not just as a hard-working paper, but a hard-partying paper. \u0026ldquoI don\u0026rsquot know how everyone did it, Richard Walker recalled. \u0026ldquoPeople seemed to work to three in the morning, go out clubbing and then come in the next day and do it all over again.  It probably didn\u0026rsquot help that the original office on Albion Street \u0026ndash the Black Lubyanka \u0026ndash was directly above our printing presses and the Press Bar, so no matter what time you finished work you could pick up a paper and pop into the pub, where many a night began often with Simon Cunningham, a lead on the design team, telling a story so outrageously filthy it made the whites of your eyes blush.  There were plenty of love affairs, more than a few heartbreaks, at least one baby born thanks to their mum and dad meeting in the newsroom, a lot of dancing and clubbing, and way, way, way too much alcohol and partying.  But it was all very innocent as well. It wasn\u0026rsquot mean or debauched or sleazy \u0026ndash it was celebratory and, at worst, silly. Ironically, one senior executive, with a glutton\u0026rsquos taste for cocaine and a phoney po-faced line in moral rectitude, who was at a rival paper \u0026ndash I won\u0026rsquot say whether it was Scottish or London-based in order to keep speculation as wide as possible \u0026ndash once described the Sunday Herald staff as a \u0026ldquobunch of absinthe-sipping dilettantes.  Absinthe, yes. Dilettantes, yes. Sippers? Never. We glugged \u0026hellip but then we were all much younger back then. Fun was part of the secret recipe of the Sunday Herald \u0026ndash not just providing fun for the reader, but having fun ourselves, from the editor down to the copy boy or copy girl. It was a paper which celebrated and revelled in individuality, mischief and just having a laugh.  There are too many bizarre and silly stories to tell \u0026ndash trying to buy the island of Gigha, putting on a band made up of Sunday Herald staff at T in the Park just for the hell of it \u0026ndash but perhaps the best one involves Prince Philip, Special Branch and Billy the Singing Sea Bass.  Around 2001, the Queen and Prince Philip arrived to open SMG\u0026rsquos new building at the top of Renfield Street, where the papers had moved after abandoning the Black Lubyanka. Sniffer dogs were sent through the building before Philip was, bizarrely, to attend morning conference \u0026ndash much to the barely concealed displeasure of a predominantly anti-monarchist staff. The Queen was wandering about in The Herald office, if memory serves.  In the conference room, there was a wall of honour, with many of the best awards staff had won over the years, and in the middle of the wall was Billy Bass \u0026ndash in case you\u0026rsquove forgotten this cultural blip of the new millennium, a Billy Bass was a replica plastic sea bass mounted like a fishing trophy.  Significantly, Billy Bass also sang. He had some sort of trigger mechanism and if it was activated he would sing, in a kind of Barry White baritone, \"Take me to the river\". Philip sat in front of Billy. We sat around Philip.  Photographers were filming Philip at conference, and as best as anyone can recollect, a flash from a camera activated Billy and he began his mournful, piscine chant. Two armed special branch officers rushed into the room, ripped Billy off the wall like a terrorist and raced with him outside. They believed he was some sort of bomb, albeit a singing one. Philip shouted: \u0026ldquoJust bloody shoot it!. After that Philip got pretty bored and left, presumably to catch up with the Queen and tell her that he\u0026rsquod had a plastic fish executed by Special Branch in the piazza in front of Herald Towers."},{"url":null,"title":"sunday-heralds-triumph-over-ryan-giggs-super-injunction","story":"  JOKES and silliness aside, there was not one member of staff unaffected by Jaspan leaving for the other side of the world \u0026ndash to many he\u0026rsquod been a mentor. I especially admired him for giving me my head as an investigative journalist and allowing me the time and resources to do the sort of reporting that is all but impossible today in new super-slimmed down newsrooms. Before he left though, Jaspan made sure the best candidate took over his editorship: Richard Walker, who was by then deputy editor of the paper. \u0026ldquoI felt that Richard uniquely understood the ethos of the paper \u0026ndash he was best placed to look after it and cherish it, Jaspan says.  Walker is one of the most decent and honest people you can meet, so it\u0026rsquos no surprise to hear how candid and even humble he was about assuming the role. \u0026ldquoIt was intimidating, he said, \u0026ldquoAndrew\u0026rsquos were a very big pair of shoes to fill.  Walker was given a \u0026ldquosort of life coach by the new owners of the Sunday Herald, Newsquest, to help him transition into the role of editor \u0026ndash a big, difficult job. The life coach advice was simple \u0026ndash do something to stamp your own mark on the paper, to make it your own.  So, heeding those words, Walker took the most modern of papers and added a little extra top spin of modernity \u0026ndash dropping the old broadsheet format and making the paper a compact. Tabloid in shape, broadsheet in style, delivery, tone and content.  Seasoned journalists from other titles had joined the Sunday Herald and were leaving their indelible mark on the paper. Kevin McKenna, one of the smoothest operators in Scottish journalism and a man with a contacts book most hacks would die for, arrived before Jaspan\u0026rsquos departure, bringing with him years of experience and deal-making, adding to the gravitas of the paper. In 2006, dogged political editor Paul Hutcheon won highly-deserved plaudits for investigations revealing that David McLetchie, then leader of the Scottish Tories, had abused taxpayers\u0026rsquo money to pay for taxi fares for legal and party work. McLetchie later resigned.  We were also now easily attracting star names to the paper. To me one of our all-time great reads was a piece commissioned by David Dick, then sports editor, from Budd Schulberg, the man who wrote the movie On the Waterfront, on Muhammad Ali at 60. A piece worthy of gracing the pages of the best papers in history.  Now well and truly a mature newspaper, with its roots laid down and its infancy long behind it, the years ticked by as they do for all papers \u0026ndash but unlike every other paper, the Sunday Herald has mischief in its DNA and was always looking to take on authority. Let\u0026rsquos fast-forward to May 2011. It was the era of the super-injunction, with the rich and famous able to stop any unsavoury story about them being published.  Years before, the Sunday Herald had flouted a super-injunction over a story relating to a member of the royal family. We\u0026rsquod realised that the injunction did not run in Scotland as it had been granted in an English court, and I wrote a piece which went on the front page detailing the allegations, much to the delight of Scottish readers and the chagrin of those south of the Border where we did not publish.  In order to not flout English law we did not run the story online. Given that this story which you are reading is going to run online, I can\u0026rsquot go into details of the royal piece \u0026ndash but I am sure you can find it if you go to a good Scottish library.  In 2011, however, thanks to Twitter and Facebook, most people knew the names of the rich and famous who\u0026rsquod taken out super-injunctions as well as the reasons for taking them out. I was head of news back then and mid-way through a long Saturday afternoon, Richard Walker and I started reminiscing about the royal story and the fact that the Sunday Herald had been able to ignore a super-injunction in the past because of the gap between English and Scottish law.  I think the look of gleeful recognition crossed his face before mine, but within minutes Walker was on the phone to lawyer \u0026ndash Paul McBride, a man who wore his swagger like a suit, but was loved by pretty much everyone who knew him. Sadly, he died too young, still in his mid-40s while on a trip to Pakistan some years back. Yes, the story was entirely doable, said McBride. Within the hour, there was a front page \u0026ndash iconic now you look back on it \u0026ndash of Ryan Giggs with a thin black strip across his eyes and one word \u0026ldquoCensored.  Under any other series of events, this was not a story which the Sunday Herald would have cared much about \u0026ndash the love life of a footballer not being something that we would see as a fit with our readership, or have any public interest issues surrounding it. But this story was in the public interest and it was not about someone\u0026rsquos private life \u0026ndash this was about power and money and fame having undue influence when it comes to the law, and the utter ludicrousness of everyone in the UK who was online knowing the nature of the story and talking about it in pubs and offices and their own homes, while press and broadcasters could not report a single word. The next day Giggs was named in parliament, and the then PM David Cameron said the law needed to catch up with how people consume news in the 21st century.  Walker says he woke up on the Sunday we published the story and thought \u0026ldquowhat the hell have I done, but it was to go on to be one of the crowning achievements of his editorship, putting the Sunday Herald at the centre of a national debate about wealth, privacy and privilege.  By now, the Sunday Herald was following a political trajectory similar to many of our readers. Like many of our readers, we were liberal, progressive and we had fallen out of love with the Labour Party. The SNP \u0026ndash buoyed in many eyes by its valiant opposition to the Iraq War \u0026ndash seemed to offer an alternative home to those of a progressive persuasion. As a paper which had championed devolution, it was \u0026ndash as it was for many of our readers \u0026ndash only an intellectual hop, skip and a jump to supporting independence.  \u0026ldquoIt was a natural progression,\" says Walker, who was editor when the Sunday Herald became the only paper to back Yes in 2014. Not all members of staff supported independence and some were undecided \u0026ndash but as Walker says: \u0026ldquoA member of staff\u0026rsquos politics are up to them. We weren\u0026rsquot inspecting political identity cards, that\u0026rsquos for sure. People are free to think as they please \u0026ndash but the vast majority of our staff did support independence.  Walker\u0026rsquos rationale wasn\u0026rsquot solely about nailing our political colours to the mast \u0026ndash it was also about democracy and plurality of the press. \u0026ldquof we hadn\u0026rsquot come out for independence, can you imagine what the referendum would have been like? Not one paper supporting a position held by 45 per cent of the population. It would have been deeply wrong, he says.  And so came one of our most famous front pages \u0026ndash obviously loved and hated in equal measure, certainly by a margin of 45 to 55 - the \u0026ldquoSunday Herald says Yes. The decision to back Yes saw our sales sky-rocket for a while, before falling back to where they were. Like all papers, the schisms and riffs thrown up by the referendum hurt the Sunday Herald. It doesn\u0026rsquot take a genius to look at Scotland post-referendum and see a population which has one of the lowest levels of trust in the press and broadcasters anywhere in the Western world \u0026ndash which is a terrible shame because this country has produced some of the finest, most honest and brave journalists anywhere in the world.  In the wake of the success of the Sunday Herald backing independence, Newsquest decided to go for the idea of setting up an avowedly pro-independence paper \u0026ndash a paper which became The National. I was deputy editor of the Sunday Herald by this time and Walker was trying to juggle his day job as editor while planning to launch The National as well. I tried to take some burden off him at the Sunday, and myself and other senior members of the Sunday Herald executive team tried to help him as much as we could with The National launch. It was an exhausting and brutally gruelling period of work.  Walker says of The National: \u0026ldquoThe Sunday Herald was a paper which gradually found itself supporting independence \u0026ndash the support for independence evolved \u0026ndash The National is a newspaper set up specifically to support independence. That\u0026rsquos the key difference.  Not long after the launch of The National, Walker stepped down as Sunday Herald editor and left the company. \u0026ldquoI was knackered, he said. \u0026ldquoI needed a break. After he stepped down, I became editor."},{"url":null,"title":"iain-macwhirter-keeping-the-flame-of-serious-journalism-burning-bright","story":"  This summer has demonstrated just how rancid our political culture has become. Earlier this week, the former Labour spin-doctor, John McTernan, told BBC\u0026rsquos Today programme that Labour \u0026ldquois transforming itself into the nasty party. In doing so he was implicitly condemning his and Jeremy Corbyn\u0026rsquos Labour party as worse than the Tories. This kind of hyperbolic rhetoric is becoming pretty standard.  Earlier in the week, the former Chief Rabbi, Jonathan Sacks, a figure commanding great respect not only among Jews, compared the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, to Enoch Powell, and said his recent remarks about Zionism were as racist as Powell\u0026rsquos infamous \u0026ldquoRivers of Blood speech in 1967. It\u0026rsquos as if even normally sober-minded people feel that they have to ramp up their invective to 11 just to get a hearing.  It was the same with Boris Johnson\u0026rsquos burka remarks. It was, of course, provocative to describe women wearing this attire as looking like \u0026ldquobank robbers and letter boxes. But Johnson was widely accused of being a racist and even a neo-fascist. The former Foreign Secretary is many things, but whatever you think of him he is not a fascist, neo or otherwise, and nor is the British Conservative Party a racist organisation. Indeed, to claim that Tory politicians are fascists and racists robs these terms of any meaning at a time when the real far right is undergoing a resurgence.  Similarly, the widespread allegations about Jeremy Corbyn\u0026rsquos anti-semitism \u0026ndash not least from Labour MPs like Margaret Hodge - devalues the very concept of anti-semitism. His critics may even unknowingly be giving comfort and encouragement to genuine jew-haters. Repeated claims that Labour is an anti-semitic organisation makes it look as if this despicable creed is becoming almost respectable. Look, racists can say: even the British Labour Party is now on our side.  All this has a lot to do, of course, with the rise of social media. When the Sunday Herald was born, the internet was a relatively new toy. Google was around, but it was still a fact-based search engine run by academic geeks largely for geeks. Twitter had yet to be born, and Facebook was confined to US campuses. These internet phenomena have now taken over the world \u0026ndash almost literally in Facebook\u0026rsquos case \u0026ndash and have turned journalism on its head, as well as stealing the advertising revenue that supported it.  In the past, newspaper editors acted as gatekeepers, assessing the overall quality and news value of the information that entered the public sphere. Professional journalists were paid to research stories and comment on matters of public concern. Now anything goes. Bored teenagers in Macedonia can cobble together some pro-Trump sites and sell them for clicks to gullible US consumers of fake news. There is zero quality control on Facebook. Post-truth has invaded the public consciousness like a computer virus.  People can now believe whatever they want to believe: \u0026ldquothe Pope backs Trump, \u0026ldquoClinton is a murderer and find confirmation on social media. There readers are insulated from alternative views and factual evidence. Computer algorithms create filter bubbles, pre-selecting posts that conform to people\u0026rsquos prejudices, in a form of digital brainwashing. Newspapers had editorial lines, but they at least tried to give a range of opinion, and did not, as a rule, run comment as news.  Endless rows on Twitter have debased political discourse by infecting it with abuse and anger. The laws on defamation seem to have been abolished. No matter what you think of Alex Salmond, or his crowd-funding campaign, the things that have been routinely tweeted and retweeted about his alleged sex crimes are disgraceful and would never have appeared in the Sunday Herald or any other newspaper back in the day.  Some might think this is a good thing, that powerful figures can no longer hide behind the law. But this social media free-for-all is death to responsible journalism and also to natural justice. Newspapers that still keep within the law, look as if they\u0026rsquore stuffy and behind the times. Worse, they\u0026rsquore regarded as part of that sluice of evil, the MSM, the Mainstream Media.  Of course, the press has its faults. Newspaper editors exercised power, but they didn\u0026rsquot always exercise it responsibly. Tabloid newspapers in the noughties spread hatred against immigrants and people on benefits, pandering to the worst prejudices of their readers. In 1999, some tabloid and broadsheet newspapers just couldn\u0026rsquot forgive Scots for voting in massive numbers for a Scottish parliament, one of the proximate causes for the creation of the Sunday Herald.  The early months and years of Holyrood were torrid. There were accusations of misuse of expenses, incompetent MSPs and attempts to ridicule and undermine the policies of the Labour/Lib Dem administration, such as the repeal of Clause 28, which effectively banned any positive representation of homosexuality in schools.  Abolishing Section 2A, as it was properly called in Scotland, remains the Sunday Herald campaign in which I take greatest pride. Alone of the press of the day, the Sunday Herald took, head on, the Keep the Clause campaign, led by the formidable combination of Stagecoach bus tycoon, Brian Souter, and Cardinal Thomas Winning, leader of the Catholic Church.  The editor, Andrew Jaspan, and I, received many threats, and not just of divine retribution, for arguing that Clause 28 was a homophobic abomination that should be repealed in a civilised country.  The row spread to the Scottish cabinet and became a fierce battle between liberals like then Communities Minister Wendy Alexander, and less progressive ministers of the day. The Labour First Minister, Donald Dewar, was almost torn apart by the divisions, and some believe that the stress may have contributed to the collapse of his health and his premature death.  It is a measure of how Scotland has changed since 1999 that it\u0026rsquos inconceivable anything like Section 2A could become law today. An undoubted achievement of the Scottish parliament has been to help change Scotland\u0026rsquos primitive attitudes to diversity.  And it\u0026rsquos not over till it\u0026rsquos over. The Sunday Herald is not dead, it has simply evolved. There will now be two quality newspapers on Sunday: the Herald on Sunday and the Sunday National. The one becomes two. What better way to demonstrate that, no matter what the internet says, serious journalism is not dead."},{"url":null,"title":"sunday-herald-tributes-kind-words-from-across-scottish-life-to-a-well-loved-friend-in-its-final-hours","story":"  Farewell dear friend, I\u0026rsquove loved you since you were born and over the last twenty years, my God where does time go, I have watched you grow and mature and take your rightful place in our lives.  You were a breath of fresh air, you came with integrity, you came with courage, you were unafraid of your own voice or the choices you made. You, quite simply, raised the bar and set standards others can only dream of.  My Sundays will be bereft without you, without the joy of reading you from cover to cover excited at what I might find as I turn the page. Alas, no more will you shine your light but the voices of those who made you unique are still with us and long may they be heard for they are needed more than ever.  Elaine C Smith, actor and comedian  The Sunday Herald has been a staple in our home since it started and has kept many a paper boy or girl delivering to us every Sunday. It\u0026rsquos the only newspaper that we continued to have delivered \u0026ndash the demise of the habit of buying a newspaper every day is evident, with people getting their news in so many different ways now \u0026ndash but our loyalty to the Sunday herald continued.  It continued for me because in so many ways its political commentary kept me sane. In a world of right wing Labour and Tory opinion in Scotland  the Sunday Herald was a beacon of light.  Not because it was/is pro Scottish independence  but because it tried to present an alternative view and that was like a breath of fresh air. Under the editor Richard Walker, the paper took brave steps. A country that has at least 45 per cent of its people supporting Independence having no newspaper representing or even covering that view would have been ludicrous. Columnists like Iain McWhirter stepping out at a time when all the fire was aimed at the Independence movement was a brave step and as many have found in this wee nation  when you step out from those who have run things for a long time then you are shunned, or ex communicated.  So, I feel sad that things are moving and that there is no more Sunday Herald but am pleased the National on Sunday is being printed and that will be the paper in my house from now on.  Ruth Wishart, journalist, broadcaster and commentator  When the Sunday Herald took the decision to back independence it did so against a media backdrop which was at best neutral and, more commonly, openly hostile to the concept.  It seemed to me vital that a major title should give voice to a cause supported by hundreds and thousands of Scots, and to offer support for and reportage on the Independence campaign.  It has of course mounted many other campaigns and provided space for thought provoking essays and columns.  Often these have been rather more left field than more conventional publications in the mainstream media, and all the more welcome for it. We need diversity in journalism as much as we do elsewhere.  On a more personal level I was delighted to participate in the judging for the Sunday Herald Culture Awards, which helped recognise the myriad talents flourishing throughout the country in every art form.  I will reserve judgement on the Herald on Sunday until I read it. But Sundays just won\u0026rsquot be the same without my Sunday Herald fix.  Professor Emeritus Sir Tom Devine, historian  Over nearly two decades the Sunday Herald has become an important and stimulating addition to the Scottish ?newspaper scene.  The decision taken in 2014 to lend support to the cause of independence was not only courageous but of positive benefit to Scottish democracy. Whatever one\u0027s political view, it was surely unhealthy for the press to be overwhelmingly committed to a unionist position when the nation itself was split over the central Scottish constitutional issue of our time.  This is especially so since the question of the future of the country was not finally laid to rest by the result of the referendum of 2014 and remains alive to this day.  In that sense all democrats should applaud the fact that the Sunday Herald gave some voice to a nationalist perspective without at any time becoming a propaganda sheet either for the SNP or the pro-independence movement.  The paper was also fortunate in being led successively by three first class editors in Andrew Jaspan, Richard Walker and Neil Mackay?. They were all innovative figures in their different ways who ensured that the quality of journalism was always of a high standard.  I much regret the passing of a newspaper with such a distinctive editorial line? and fresh approach as the Sunday Herald, especially in light of the current difficult times for the Scottish press more generally. We can only hope that some at least of the traditions of the paper are maintained by its successor each Sunday.  Stuart Cosgrove, writer and broadcaster  The Sunday Herald came of age at a time when I was travelling extensively. It was mostly to cities across the UK but often on research trips to America too. I remember coming across a piece of trivia that has stayed with me ever since. It was a minor bit of detail about the pioneering Motown acts who travelled the deep south of America in the days when racial segregation was still the norm. To protect their stage shoes and to keep them in touch with home, groups like The Temptations and The Supremes would roll-up pages from the Michigan Chronicle, Detroit\u0027s major black newspaper. Otis Williams of the Temptations once said that when he was bored or missing home he would unravel the crumpled paper in his shoes and read about Detroit.  For me it was the Sunday Herald. I was home to appear on radio every Saturday and the next day began my travels again. So, I would religiously buy the Sunday Herald, fold it into my bag and once or twice in an act of Motown mimicry even stuffed a section in my trainers. It was the paper that kept me in touch, reminded me of home and spoke to my hopes and dreams, it seemed effortlessly left-of-centre, supportive of an independent Scotland and connected to the exciting cultural developments that made me want to spend more time at home.  Josh Littlejohn, founder of Social Bite  The Sunday Herald has been a massive supporter of our organisation Social Bite and has always championed the need to tackle social causes. The publication has covered Social Bite\u0027s journey over the last six years which has helped us raise awareness and funds to help homeless people throughout Scotland.  The Sunday Herald also recognised our Sleep in the Park event with a special award at their Culture Awards, for which we were touched and honoured. I would like to thank everyone in the team for their legacy to us and many organisations like ours over the years.  Aamer Anwar, human rights lawyer  I first got involved with the paper back in 1999 when we began the campaign for justice for the murder victim Surjit Singh Chhokar. The Sunday Herald carried our campaign week after week, building a relationship with the family and caring little about the powerful institutions which desperately tried to silence us. The paper was a key player in helping us get justice 18 years later. For that one issue which placed victim\u0026rsquos rights at the heart of the criminal justice system you can be immensely proud.  But looking back over the years, there have been so many issues and campaigns that I have worked on with the paper on that it\u0026rsquos hard to pick the most memorable. There was articles about the death of Sheku Bayoh in police custody the corrupt Counter Corruption Unit at Police Scotland the betrayal of justice for Emma Caldwell the ticking timebomb of sexual harassment at the Scottish Parliament. You even supported me when I was placed on trial for speaking out against a miscarriage of justice or faced death threats from \u0026lsquoIslamic\u0026rsquo extremists.  On so many levels your journalists have shown immense courage and compassion but you also gave us hope in the words you wrote. What compliment can I give to so many of you who worked this paper, other than to say you really made a difference to Scotland. There are so many ordinary people without powerful friends or money to rely upon, who would have been pushed aside, silenced and crushed had you not been there with your campaigning journalism.  It makes me incredibly sad to see you go, but on a personal level I just want to say thank you so much for being there for myself, the families and campaigns in our darkest hours. We always knew if we picked up the phone you could be relied upon for your unconditional support. Good luck my friends.  Hugh MacDonald, writer and broadcaster  There was, at first, a distance between us. The Sunday Herald lived above The Herald on Albion Street, below it on Renfield Street. We then grew close. Long before the Sunday Herald moved its digs to join The Herald on the same floor, I \u0026ndash a perennial daily hack - had made the occasional contribution to its pages. These dalliances became more of a regular relationship. These pieces generally represented what I liked about the Sunday Herald.  First, they were interesting. At least in their commissioning. I did my best to knock any intrigue from them. But articles were sought from me on such as the secrets of the confessional, the curious lack of professed gay footballers, and the importance of geography in American crime writing. They were typical of how the Sunday Herald sought to investigate the corners as well as the broad floor of politics, culture or sport.  Secondly, the editing was first class. Kathleen Morgan, the best journalist in Scotland never to have edited a national newspaper, produced a stunning magazine that her successor, Jane Wright, maintained to the highest standard. Susan Flockhart was a brilliant, insightful editor of copy. Any piece emerged better from her examination. This is a tribute born of personal experience.  There was a sense of gallusness about the Sunday Herald, too, never better illustrated by a front page that may have featured Ryan Giggs. Or maybe not. It also allowed some latitude. I began to write more sports pieces  and more book reviews, commissioned by Rosemary Goring, a peerless literary editor.  The rein was so free it could have been a four. I was allowed to write a preview to the 2012 Olympics that consisted of the first verse of London Calling, with slight amendments. It was fun. At least for me.  But best of all, it was independent. It informed you without apology about what it believed was important. It told you what it thought and it oft times took extraordinary criticism for that seeming impertinence. I loved that then. I mourn it now that it is gone.  Katie Archibald, columnist and champion racing cyclist  I first wrote for the Sunday Herald in 2014, the year of the Glasgow Commonwealth Games. The sports section had a weekly column written by a rotation of six Scottish athletes, all aspiring to Commonwealth success that year. It was a logbook of the highs and lows of lives consumed by sport. The column didn\u0026rsquot retell the happenings of races, matches and galas, but instead revealed the recipes behind our victories, confessed the insecurities muddled into our losses, and gave the insider view on sports controversies.  The Commonwealth Games came and with it the end to these six stories, whether they finished as fairy tales or not. But somehow, I continued writing in the paper. For me, the Sunday Herald was a platform to talk about cycling. It was inches on a page to entertain people and to subtly convince everyone to get on a bike, and for that opportunity I am very grateful. I was one small voice in the countless that were given the chance to be heard in this paper. The Sunday Herald will be missed.  Professor Sir Anton Muscatelli, Principal and Vice Chancellor, University of Glasgow  A healthy and provocative press is essential to the wellbeing of democratic debate and one of the great strengths, and I hope enduring legacies of the Sunday Herald, was the space provided for all shades of comment and opinion. In my own case I was pleased to engage with the editorial team, sometimes to offer just a line or two to a story but more often to contribute my thoughts and my perspective on often complex and challenging issues. From the Fiscal Framework to the economic consequences of Brexit for Scotland and the wider United Kingdom, I was encouraged to provide clarity and explanation. At a time of controversy over what is real and what is fake news, and against a continuing backdrop of those who still say we should not listen to experts I believe with great conviction that it is more important than ever that different and diverse opinions are given their place in our press."},{"url":null,"title":"ron-mckay-quoting-mao-in-the-office-crying-foul-on-the-phone-and-a-flying-fish-supper","story":"  AS\u0026nbspthis newspaper passes away and a new one is in gestation just a week before delivery, we\u0026rsquore beaten to the punch by the launch of The Herald this Thursday. It\u0026rsquos what Donald Trump would call a fake newspaper. It features in a new six-part BBC drama, Press, as a stately broadsheet, sharing the building with its sleazy tabloid sister called The Post, set in the internet age. It\u0026rsquos written by the screenwriter of the lauded Doctor Foster. There\u0026rsquos violence, sexual infidelity, illegal drug-taking, petty jealousies, bullying, duplicity and bribery \u0026ndash and I guess that will feature in the fictional Herald too.  Actually, newspapers have changed out of all recognition from the rumbustious, hard-drinking, highly-competitive, brawling, character-filled days before 24-hour news and social media mauled circulation and advertising revenues. But these days are something the one-time, short-lived editor of the Daily Mirror, Roy Greenslade, knows about. He\u0026rsquos the editorial adviser on Press, as well as being a journalism professor, and Roy has gone through his own highly-dramatic reinvention. I remember him as a Red Book carrying Maoist, a member of the Communist Party of Britain  which backed China in the spit with the Soviet Union and then Albania\u0026rsquos despot Enver Hoxha. Greenslade used to stupefy NUJ meetings and conferences with his quotes from the chairman and calls for class warfare, but while Mao anticipated Twitter by keeping his pronouncements to under 140 words Roy was under no such stricture. Later he moved rightwards and, for a time, became Alastair Campbell\u0026rsquos best pal. None of which will feature in the new show.  RAIL LINES AND SICK NOTES  SOME ScotRail services were disrupted on Thursday because of an unexpected rash of illnesses to staff. Unexpected? Just check the fixture list. Celtic and Rangers were both playing in the Europa League. Could it be true? Unexpected becoming expected with crucial staff taking sickies to watch the games? Only the travelling public suffered and, whatever the reason for the mysterious bout of lurgy, no doubt the company management and the RMT union will have nothing to say about the inconvenience.  FAIR SCUNNERED  BETFAIR? It\u0026rsquos a breach of the Trade Descriptions Act. I like the occasional wager, it makes TV sport more interesting as well as politics, but all in moderation of course. I\u0026rsquove done it online through Betfair for the last eight years or so. No longer. A few days ago, with my account in credit I tried to put on a bet \u0026ndash which would have netted me \u0026pound150,000, or so my lawyers will argue \u0026ndash and got the message that the account was suspended. There had been no warning, no email, letter, call or carrier pigeon.  The woman on the phone couldn\u0026rsquot tell me why but insisted that I now had to provide photo ID, proof of address as well as funding. Being a curmudgeon I refused, and said just close the account and put my winnings into the bank account from which I\u0026rsquove always deposited money. She said she would. But of course it didn\u0026rsquot happen. So I called again a few days later and asked where my cash was, to be told I couldn\u0026rsquot get my own money back until I had sent them a scan of my passport, the deeds of my house, the details of my bank account so they could verify I had money, as well as a DNA sample. I exaggerate, but only slightly.  Now some might think that providing sensitive and potentially usable information to a company is fine, but not me. It\u0026rsquos my money and I want it. I serve notice on Betfair that I shall be referring this to the Gambling Commission, taking them to the small claims court  and launching a judicial review on their practices. I will, of course, be crowdfunding that.  DYING TO REPRESENT YOU  YOU wouldn\u0026rsquot think lawyers would need second jobs  but some of them certainly do, from driving lorries to opening restaurants, none more bizarrely than Glasgow lawyer Stephen Fox, who defends people during the week and buries them at the weekend. He\u0026rsquos a partner in undertakers Malone and Fox which has three places in the city. Well, the competition is stiff!  BOOM AND BUST  EARLY last week I was in court to hear the eloquent QC Gary Allan, a man who has been called one of the finest legal brains in Scotland. In 2012 he was one of a three-man panel which imposed a transfer ban and a substantial fine on Rangers, then in administration. The panel members were supposed to be kept secret but after then-manager Ally McCoist demanded to know their names, and in the fervid atmosphere, they were leaked. Allan then received credible death threats. Just weeks later, of course, Rangers went bust and a couple of years later Allan went the same way and declared himself bankrupt with debts of more than \u0026pound200,000. Ironic, although I doubt Gary finds it so.  WILLIE\u0026rsquoS A RIGHT CARD  WILLIE Collum is a religious education teacher, which is fine. He\u0026rsquos also a football referee, which is not. He\u0026rsquos a card sharp, whipping them out like he\u0026rsquos playing the crowd at a conjuring convention. He was at it at Rugby Park last Saturday when he precipitately sent Kilmarnock\u0026rsquos Gary Dicker off and ruined what was left of a dire game \u0026ndash and if he does the same in the Old Firm clash today there could be mayhem.  I\u0026rsquove counted the cards over the last five seasons and Collum \u0026ndash excluding this one \u0026ndash has sent off 60 players and booked over 700, brandishing a card roughly every 20 minutes per game. Hearts, who were the beneficiaries of the red card last weekend, even muttered three seasons back that he wasn\u0026rsquot just incompetent he was biased against them, so perhaps he was just rebalancing?  But thank goodness we don\u0026rsquot have the Italian sanctions system or, believe me, there wouldn\u0026rsquot be a player on the park by half-time if teacher Willie was in charge. The Udinese midfielder Rolando Mandragora has just been given a one-game ban for \u0026ndash not going over the ball, play acting or preventing a goal-scoring opportunity \u0026ndash but blasphemy! He was caught on camera mouthing to himself \u0026ldquoDio cane, which is literally, \u0026ldquoGod is a dog, but perhaps better translates to something like \u0026ldquoJesus f*****g Christ. Willie just wouldn\u0026rsquot be having that.  AND FINALLY ...  ANDREW Jaspan, the founding father of this newspaper, writes elsewhere in these pages. But I\u0026rsquom sure he won\u0026rsquot be mentioning the time when, cycling home in Edinburgh, someone driving past hit him slap in the coupon with a fish supper. Or the night when he was locked in the loo for four hours calling for help . He was a brilliant and fastidious editor, although exasperating at times, as all the good ones are. I was there at the launch of the paper and now at its end. The feeling of sadness, and there certainly is that, is overwhelmed by all of the great memories.  The paper launched on a dreich February 7, 1999, from the old Express building, the Northern Lubyanka in Glasgow\u0026rsquos Albion Street, where I had worked in a previous life. We all had those new-fangled iMacs, the bulbous blue ones, on our desks and somehow it all worked. Sitting in the chair next to me was the polymath and chanter Pat Kane, although I can\u0026rsquot recall him ever giving us a song. I\u0026rsquoll stop before it gets maudlin. It\u0026rsquos been marvellous. It really has.

But thanks to state-of-the-art technology, the patterns and shades that once adorned one of Scotland\u0026rsquos most beautiful medieval buildings have now been rediscovered.  Scientific testing has revealed details of the cathedral\u0026rsquos windows, including the patterns, colours and origin of the glass, shining a light on cultures and trade routes at that time.  Helen Spencer, the PhD student at Heriot-Watt who led the study, said: \u0026ldquoWorship was a major part of medieval life, and the importance of decorations on church windows cannot be overstated.  \u0026ldquoDepending on the time of day, different windows would illuminate the worshippers. Evensong would have a different colour and character to morning worship.  \u0026ldquoIf we can find what the windows looked like, it can tell us about what religious orders and fashions came in to Scotland, what saints were idolised, who funded the construction of churches, and where the builders, glass and glass decorators came from.  \u0026ldquoUnlike most countries in Europe, there is no surviving medieval window glass in situ in monastic or ecclesiastical buildings in Scotland.  \u0026ldquoThis means we rely on recovered fragments to learn more about glass from this period.  \u0026ldquoThe tests we carried out have shed light on the colour and origin of the window glass of Elgin Cathedral.  Built in 1224, Elgin Cathedral - once known as the Lantern of the North - was the principal church of the bishops of Moray.  However, it was abandoned in 1560 after parliament legislated that the Scottish church would be Protestant and made Catholic mass illegal.  The lead was removed from the building\u0026rsquos roof in 1567 and sold for the upkeep of Regent Lord James Stewart\u0026rsquos army. The windows were later vandalised and destroyed.  However, the site\u0026rsquos fortunes began to change when it became a visitor attraction in the early 1800s.  The recent project examining the glass saw scientists use cutting edge technology including electron microscopy and x-ray fluorescence, as well as the first laser-ablation spectroscopy analysis of medieval Scottish glass.  Ms Spencer said the results showed that most of the glass had its origins in northern France, while a smaller section of it came from Germany.  She added: \u0026ldquoWe identified two distinct blue glasses, both containing cobalt. While one was very dark and rich in potassium, the other a light blue that is richer in calcium, sodium, phosphorus and aluminium.  \u0026ldquohe lighter glass was coloured with bronze, while the darker blue most likely had brass filings added. Both these blue glasses were sourced from different parts of Europe.  \u0026ldquoWe also found that the brown and amber glasses had quite different base glass \u0026lsquorecipes\u0026rsquo to the greens and pinks, meaning they were likely made at separate locations before being imported to Scotland.  \u0026ldquoScotland didn\u0026rsquot manufacture glass in the medieval period, although several regions in England produced white \u0026lsquocolourless\u0026rsquo glass.  \u0026ldquoAt the beginning of the 13th century, much of the white glass came from Normandy and by the 15th century it was coming primarily from Flanders.  \u0026ldquoMonastic connections and new trade routes from present day Belgium that connected to east coast ports like Leith, Perth and Aberdeen all had an impact on the glass that was commissioned and used for these beautiful cathedrals.  \u0026ldquoUnderstanding more about these sites brings them to life. The more we discover about our historic buildings the more we can appreciate our history, how people lived, the connections between Scotland and Europe at that time and the craftsmanship involved.  \u0026ldquoThe next time you visit a ruin in Scotland, take a look at the window spaces and imagine them filled with blue, pink, yellow, green and amber glass from across Europe.  \u0026ldquoIt will change how you think about and experience these buildings.  The project, funded by the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland and Historic Environment Scotland, was prompted by a lack of research looking at stained glass in Scotland.  The Heriot Watt team will now test medieval window glass from across Scotland in the first comprehensive study undertaken since the 1980s.  The team hopes advanced testing techniques will uncover more secrets from the country\u0026rsquos cathedrals.  Dr Simon Gilmour, director of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland, which part-funded the project, said: \u0026ldquoThe Society of Antiquaries of Scotland was proud to fund this project.  \u0026ldquoThe lack of research about window glass used in Scotland during the medieval period was highlighted in the Scottish Archaeological Research Framework and this project has been able to use cutting-edge technology to enhance our knowledge of how these ancient windows were made."},{"url":null,"title":"review-of-miners-strike-policing-calls-for-evidence","story":"  Led by QC John Scott, the Independent Review has issued a call for evidence as it compiles a report to justice Secretary Humza Yousaf over the coming nine months.

However her opponents will try to use the occasion to portray a government beset by \u0026ldquodrift and obsessed by the constitution.

She said: \u0026ldquoScotland is a country which in many ways led the world into the industrial revolution \u0026ndash now, we have a real chance to lead the world into the low carbon age.  \u0026ldquoBrexit heightens the importance of everything else we are doing as a Government.

The Deltapoll for the Best for Britain group also found a majority of voters in Northern Ireland would back unification with the south if Brexit went ahead, especially if it meant the return of a hard border with the Republic.  Best for Britain, which wants a second vote on the 2016 referendum to Leave Europe, said the findings showed leaving the EU threatened the Union on several fronts.  Scotland voted 62-38 for Remain in the EU referendum, but Brexit has so far failed to shift the polls in favour of independence.  The poll of 1022 Scots found 47 per cent of people would vote No in another independence referendum tomorrow, compared to 45% saying Yes, with 8% unsure.  If Brexit was cancelled, the numbers were 47% No, 43% Yes, and 10% unsure.  But when people were asked how they would vote if Brexit went ahead, the numbers flipped to 47% Yes and 43% No .  However the poll did not include a baseline question asking how people voted in 2014, so it is unclear if the sample was wholly representative.  Of the 1199 people polled in Northern Ireland, only 35% would back a united Ireland if Brexit was cancelled, but support jumped to 56% if there was a hard border Brexit.  Theresa May yesterday insisted there would be no second vote on Brexit and no compromises on her soft Brexit Chequers plan unless they were in the \u0026ldquonational interest.  But there were also reports that her former election guru Sir Lynton Crosby was behind a plan to install former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson in Downing Street.  It was reported Sir Lynton, who helped Mr Johnson become London mayor, had let staff at his firm CTF Partners liaise with hard Brexit group Change Britain as part of the plan.  Best for Britain chief executive Eloise Todd said: \u0026ldquoWhen people voted in 2016, they didn\u0026rsquot vote to break up the Union and risk both Scotland and Northern Ireland voting for a different future outside the United Kingdom.  \u0026ldquoThis is compelling evidence as to why we need to stop and think again.  \u0026ldquoThe public deserve a say on the final deal, with the knowledge that if Brexit happens we could shatter the Union altogether.\"  Scottish Labour MEP Catherine Stihler, said: \u0026ldquoThis is a devastating poll which reveals there is a clear and present danger to the future of the United Kingdom.  \u0026ldquoThe Tories must stop putting the Union at risk and give voters a say on the final Brexit deal.  Professor Sir John Curtice, of Strathclyde University, said the poll posed hypothetical questions on one issue, but people decided how to vote based on numerous factors.  He said: \u0026ldquoWhat the poll shows is that Scotland\u0026rsquos status inside the Union is problematic irrespective of whether we remain in the EU or not. According to this poll it\u0026rsquos already on a knife-edge and the [Brexit-related] movement is very small.  \u0026ldquoRemain voters become more pro-Indy [when prompted on Brexit] and Leave voters move in the opposite direction, but the net effect is very close to zero.  \u0026ldquoThe 64,000 question is what will happen if we leave the EU and people feel Brexit is a disaster - would public opinion shift enough in favour of independence?  \u0026ldquoWe know that Brexit has made the Yes movement more closely tied to the EU, but that\u0026rsquos also a problem for them, because it means they\u0026rsquore fishing in 62 per cent of the public, much of which is never going to be interested in independence in the first place.  SNP MP Stephen Gethins said: \u0026ldquoWith almost 90% of polls since the referendum showing support for an independent Scotland above 2014 levels, independence is polling at historic highs.  \u0026ldquoAs the deeply damaging consequences of a \u0026lsquoNo deal\u0026rsquo Brexit become clearer, as Scotland\u0026rsquos economy continues to outperform the UK, and as people grow increasingly concerned about the future under Westminster rule, support for Scotland\u0027s ability to take its own decisions in an independent country will only grow further.  Tory MP Colin Clark said: \u0026ldquoThe people of Scotland voted by a significant margin to remain part of the United Kingdom in 2014.

New details of the case have emerged showing how Lord Glennie in his judgment felt judges in two first tier tribunals  were predisposed to reject the men\u0027s claims of asylum having \"paid little attention\" to other evidence, particular witnesses from the Tron Church in Glasgow, of which the men, referred to only as TF and MA are members.  READ MORE:\u0026nbspAsylum-seeking Christian family fear death if forced to leave Glasgow after six years  He said the Tron witnesses gave \"admissible opinion evidence which is entitled to respect\".  Both the first tier and upper tribunals who rejected the appeals \"failed properly to take account of the independent evidence relating to the genuineness of the appellants\u0026rsquo conversions to Christianity. And they have failed to give adequate reasons for, in effect, disregarding such evidence.\"    Around 130-150 Iranians both asylum seekers and those who had already been granted asylum regularly attend mid-week meetings and Sunday services at the Tron.  The unidentified FTT judge in the case of TF had decided that he was claiming to be a Christian because it would assist him in his asylum claim in the UK.  He had identified \"major inconsistencies\" in his account of distribution anti-regime leaflets in Irain in 2013 before he came to the UK and rejected his claim that he had been arrested and tortured.  The judge went so far as conclude that a letter from a hospital relating to the man\u0027s treatment for physical injuries and sexual harm while in an Iranian prison were fabricated to improve his chances of asylum.  The judge found that TF, who entered the UK legally six year ago on a student visa, had been on a pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia in 2013 undermining his claim that Islam did not play a role in his life.

I would therefore request that this application for permission to remain in the UK be granted so that he may continue to live a useful life in UK society.    The other asylum seeker MA entered the UK illegally in October, 2015 and initially claimed asylum because he was perceived to be a homosexual and at risk if returned, the Court of Session heard.  When the matter came to the FTT the claim was made on the basis of a conversion to Christianity which was not raised before Theresa May, then Home Secretary.  FTT judge took the view that the claim of conversion to Christianity was being kept \u0026ldquoin reserve as a \u0026ldquoPlan B, to be deployed if the initial claim based on perceived homosexual orientation should fail.  And the FTT judge called his claim a \"multi-layered contrivance\" adding: \"He is not a genuine asylum seeker and should be removed from the UK on that basis\".  The judge felt that a fabricaiton of a story about an alleged homosexual encounter appeared to indicate that the appellant is \"someone who is prepared to contrive an account to suit his purposes\".  Four representatives from the Tron backed MA\u0027s asylum bid including Mr Taylor who again warned of persecution if returned to Iran.  But Lord Glennie said that in each case, the FTT, having formed a view on credibility adverse to the men \"appears to have paid little attention to the other evidence available to it, particularly the evidence from the witnesses from the Tron Church, accepting its honesty but giving it little or no weight.    \"It is wrong in principle to form a concluded view of the probable veracity of particular items of evidence and then, from that fixed point, to allow that view to govern the assessment of other evidence in the case. The proper approach is to adopt what is sometimes called an \u0027holistic\u0027 approach, considering all the evidence \u0027in the round\u0027 before arriving at any concluded view on the facts.  He added: \"The judge should not jump too readily to the conclusion that because the appellant has told lies about some matters then his credibility on all matters is fatally undermined.  \"Juries in a criminal trial are commonly directed that the fact that an individual may have lied about one point does not necessarily mean that he is lying about other matters, and the same words of caution should be taken to heart by tribunal judges hearing evidence in immigration and asylum appeals.  \"People have different reasons for not telling the truth, or the whole truth, about particular matters.  He said in the case of TF: \"[The FTT judge] says that he has \u0027looked at all the evidence in the round and taken into account my other findings herein before reaching my conclusions in respect of the appellant\u0026rsquos claimed conversion to Christianity\u0027. But when one looks at his reasons, he does no such thing.  \"What he ought to have done was to look at all the evidence in the case, including the evidence from the Tron Church witnesses, on its own merits before forming a concluded view as to the veracity of the appellant.  \"We cannot say what conclusion he would have reached had he done this, but it is not beyond the bounds of possibility that a consideration of the evidence from the church, carried out on its merits and without any a priori assumption about the appellant\u0026rsquos lack of credibility, might have led him to form a different view of the appellant.\"  Lord Glennie said over the MA decision that the judge expressed concern about \"what appears to be a mean-spirited approach to some of the evidence\".  The FTT judge had referred to the Tron Church as an example of organisations which \u0026ldquoon the face of it at least are bona fide religious institutions or organisations.  Lord Glennie said: \"The use of the expression \u0026ldquoon the face of it at least appears to imply some doubt as to whether or not it is a bona fide religious organisation. If that is what he is saying he should say so clearly and give his reasons. If he has no good reason to doubt its bona fides then he should refrain from this insinuating reference.\"  The judgment said the men\u0027s appeals were heard together because they appeared to raise similar questions relating to the appropriate treatment of certain types of evidence in cases where the genuineness of conversion is challenged.  Lord Glennie said they also raised questions as to the status of evidence from church leaders or others holding positions of responsibility about the conduct of a person who has begun the process of admission into the church and as to the sincerity of his conversion to Christianity."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/3814483.jpg?type=article-full","title":"bbc-faces-strict-quotas-to-ensures-it-delivers-on-promises-on-scottish-content-on-new-channel","story":"  Proposed new licence conditions state that 95% of the output of the new BBC Scotland channel must consist of programmes made in Scotland and it must carry news during peak viewing times - between 6pm and 10.30pm.

Other conditions Ofcom wants to write into the Licence also include ensuring the new channels provide a \"range of genres in its programming that reflects Scotland\u0027s culture\". There is a similar condition for BBC Two Scotland which will be discontinued with the new channel launch.  It is further proposed that at least three quarters of the new channel\u0027s output must consist of \u0026lsquooriginal productions\u0026rsquo, an approach previously taken with BBC Alba and BBC Two Scotland.  BBC Two Scotland is expected to provide at least 200 hours of non-news programmes, including Gaelic language output during every financial year.  But Ofcom decided not to propose any conditions relating to Gaelic programming on the new channel, saying the BBC indicated it would not form part of the new channel.  It also ruled out imposing rules that ensure that repeats make up no more than 50% of the new channel. The BBC has already indicated that about 50% of the shows on the channel will be repeats.    But it has warned in its consultation paper: \"Should we be concerned by any aspect of the [BBC Scotland] on-going performance, including the level of repeats, we do not rule out imposing additional licence conditions on the new channel in future, if we consider it is appropriate to do so.\"  The BBC had indicated that the new channel which is expected to go live in February, next year, would have a news programme  covering \"international, UK and Scottish stories, told from a Scottish perspective\", with shorter bulletins at weekends.  It would feature shows that reflect Scottish life, including the opportunity to premiere some new comedy and drama.  The BBC has told the regulator the new channel would be broadcast from 7pm to midnight every evening. In addition, the channel would broadcast BBC Two simulcast from 12 noon to 7pm interspersed with ad hoc events such as live political daytime coverage - particularly First Minister\u0026rsquos Questions - and live sport. Daytime coverage would amount to no more than 150 hours per year.    The BBC has said that the new channel is expected to work in collaboration with other BBC television channels, particularly to enable it to premiere some drama and comedy. This would enable the channel to meet its ambition to schedule a wide range of programmes in the interests of audiences in Scotland.  It has been proposed that the new channel will take the place currently occupied by BBC Four on electronic programme guides  in Scotland. BBC Four would move down the EPG to a less prominent slot.

after Scrabster complaint is rejected by tribunal","story":"A LOCAL advice service is stressing that although a tribunal has rejected a complaint of workplace bullying made by a Scottish Government agency employee, others should not be deterred from launching similar action.DeeAnn Fitzpatrick had claimed that she experienced bullying and harassment while employed as a fisheries officer for Marine Scotland at Scrabster harbour, but a tribunal this week ruled against her in the case.Speaking to the Groat, Iain Gregory, the deputy manager of Caithness Citizens\u0027 Advice Bureau , stressed that bullying regularly takes place in the workplace, and each year he hears numerous complaints.\"Clients feel that they have been the victim of unfair dismissal, discriminatory treatment, bullying or other types of incorrect treatment,\" he said.\"Anyone who feels they have been the victim of such conduct or treatment should never be deterred from reporting the matter.\"DeeAnn Fitzpatrick had claimed that she experienced bullying and harassment after she became a \"whistleblower\" while employed as a fisheries officer at Marine Scotland at Scrabster.The 49-year-old Canadian national told an employment tribunal in Aberdeen recently that she felt intimidated after being sent anonymous cards between 2015 and 2017, and claimed she was targeted with sexual harassment, for being a woman, and because of her age.In a previous hearing, Ms Fitzpatrick had also alleged that she was taped to a chair and gagged by colleagues in 2010.The employment tribunal, however, ruled against Ms Fitzpatrick in its decision on the case.In its judgment, it said it could not agree whether the cards came from current colleagues, and is understood to have been unable to consider the chair allegation as it was said to have taken place more than three years before the complaint was brought.Mr Gregory says that each year CAB deals with a \"substantial number\" of bullying cases, each of which is examined carefully and then detailed evidence is obtained.He says in many cases CAB is able to resolve matters without progression to the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service  or to a tribunal \u0026ndash \"perhaps by raising a grievance with the employer or by negotiation\".He added: \"However, there are numerous cases which require referral via ACAS and we can often resolve issues at this point by using the \u0027Early Conciliation\u0027 process.\"He underlined that it is \"comparatively unusual\" for a case to proceed to tribunal, with only a \"small percentage\" going that far.\"While it would be inappropriate to comment on any case in which we were not involved, I would stress that people should not under any circumstances be dissuaded from pursuing their rights,\" Mr Gregory said.\"The system exists to ensure that your case can and will be properly considered and we can advise you and make sure that you understand it.\"Monday 3 Sep 2018

AMTE Power Ltd, based at Thurso Business Park, is expected to rise from 32 to 40 following the deal with QinetiQ whose headquarters are in Farnborough in Hampshire. QinetiQ employs 6000 staff and has a turnover of around \u0026pound700 million.The deal comes as AMTE Power has invested \u0026pound1.5 million in a new automated production line at its Caithness operation.John Fox, the company\u0026rsquos marketing director, yesterday described the partnership agreement as \u0026ldquoa positive step for AMTE Power and the local economy.He explained the two business will work together to develop battery cells.\u0026ldquoWe will use our manufacturing expertise to utilise QinetiQ\u0026rsquos experience in battery technology and research to deliver new products, manufactured in Thurso to an international customer base, Mr Fox said.He said the companies will concentrate on four key areas: defence, the oil and gas industry, energy storage and electric vehicles. They plan to supply UK and European markets with niche batteries which customers would not be able to get elsewhere.Mr Fox said there is potential and opportunities in these areas and the increase in the Thurso workforce will be largely due to the link-up with QinetiQ.The partnership deal, he stressed, will allow customers to get products which \u0026ldquodon\u0026rsquot rely on standard mass-produced cells from the existing supply chain.The agreement will enable the companies to develop \u0026ldquoa mutually beneficial relationship and lead to advances in batteries and energy storage products.\u0026ldquoOur staff in Thurso are fantastic and we will continue to grow our base there, he said. \u0026ldquoWe have 32 employees in Caithness at present but have plans for that figure to go up to 40 over the next year \u0026ndash that is a 25 per cent increase.\u0026ldquoThis is a great building block for the future development of the organisation.

Local resident and self-professed \u0026ldquoTrinkie lover Bryan Newlands welcomed the group\u0026rsquos formation, underlining that the pool harboured a lot of memories. \u0026ldquoI used to go there a lot... Even though I lived on the other side of town, every summer myself and a friend would go \u0026ndash even when it was raining, he said. \u0026ldquoIt was a great place as the town didn\u0026rsquot have an indoor swimming pool until 1994. Many people learned to swim at the Trinkie.While a slideshow showed images of how the pool used to look and how much Wickers got from it, other more contemporary images show a dilapidated ruin \u0026ndash a far cry from the hustle, bustle and smiles of yesteryear.The new group was formed with a mission to \u0026ldquobring the pool back to life and a number of office-bearers were proposed and elected.James Bremner was elected chairman with other roles going to William Macdonald , Catherine Patterson  and Garance Warburton .Seven committee members were also elected: Fiona Bremner, Trudi Mcalpine, Davina Lyall, Fiona McPhee, Leslie Grant, Roddy Mackay and Councillor Willie Mackay.Ms Patterson underlined that it was going to be no easy fix as \u0026ldquothere are holes in the wall at the deep end, which also has cracks that go right down to the ground.\u0026ldquoThe previous group... had the holes patched up, but they kept reappearing, she said. \u0026ldquoThe wall itself is also crumbling and the bridge that divides the deep and shallow ends has had its fixtures corroded. Also the south access road that leads the public to the pool is in poor nick.She stressed that volunteers to patch things up and general goodwill is always welcome, \u0026ldquobut [often] their help only scratches the surface of what needs to be done.She added: \u0026ldquoMajor investment is needed along with a report from a structural engineer to see how much damage there is, what can and cannot be done, and to get an estimate of how much the restoration will cost.Mr Newlands \u0026ndash committee member Ms Lyall\u0026rsquos son \u0026ndash stressed that the Trinkie added tremendous character to Wick.\u0026ldquoPut it this way, with the summer we\u0026rsquove had, that pool would have been full had it been in use, he said.Other memories came from Wick Society chairman Iain Leith. \u0026ldquoGoing there was a popular pastime in its day with adults and kids from all over Pulteneytown flocking to it, he said.\u0026ldquoRestoring it could be a big boost to the town\u0026rsquos economy by making it a tourist attraction as well as giving back the town a much-loved landmark.Ms Patterson emphasised that the Trinkie had the potential to be an asset to both locals and tourists.\u0026ldquoBut we need investment because if nothing gets done the pool is on its way out.Monday 3 Sep 2018 9:48 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117256.jpg","title":"Norse era in Caithness was our very own Game of Thrones","story":"He has taken some of the most dramatic events from a time when the county was the southern part of the Orkney earldom and condensed them into a rollicking, fast-moving narrative in The Katanes Saga .It is based on a series of articles published in the John O\u0026rsquoGroat Journal over a decade ago, reinterpreting source material from ious sagas, and follows on from The Raven Banner, published in the mid-1990s and now out of print. Like that earlier work, The Katanes Saga is told in an unpretentious, engaging, sometimes blokey style. From the drunken arguments to the devious plots to the mutilations and killings, Cassells tells it like it is.\u0026ldquoThe Raven Banner was basically a guide to Norse Caithness with a little bit about each area and what I thought were the main things that happened in Norse times, he explains. \u0026ldquoThe Katanes Saga is far more in-depth.\u0026ldquoThey were people like you and me. They had the same faults. You could meet three Vikings in the pub any night.\u0026ldquoOne word I would use to describe the Norse is pragmatic. They were really pragmatic people. If that\u0026rsquos the way it works, that\u0026rsquos the way it works \u0026ndash if it doesn\u0026rsquot, I\u0026rsquoll do it my way.\u0026ldquoI do mention that of all the Norse earls of Orkney only a handful actually died in their beds. Most suffered violent deaths. One was killed with contact poison from his own auntie and mother on a shirt.Cassells  is a retired Royal Mail manager who previously worked as a lighthouse keeper on Muckle Flugga and Stroma. Those experiences inspired two other books, No More Paraffin-Oilers and A Light Walk.The Katanes Saga sees him returning to a theme that first sparked his interest at an early age. Born in Barrow, he moved to Thurso in late 1950s when his father came to work at the Admiralty test establishment.\u0026ldquoI always liked Greek and Roman mythology and I started reading about Norse mythology as well, he recalls. \u0026ldquoAs a young boy I lived in Sweyn Road in Thurso and I wondered who Sweyn was. A pal of mine said, \u0026lsquoAch, that\u0026rsquoll be Sweyn the pirate.\u0026rsquo So for about a year I had this happy vision of a Pugwash-type character that the street was named after. I then discovered Sweyn Asleifarson.Swyen , iously described \u0026ldquothe last of the Vikings and \u0026ldquothe greatest troublemaker in the westernlands, had an estate at Duncansby and was renowned for raiding, plundering and pillaging. One of the many who suffered at his hands was Frakokk, who had featured in the poisoned-shirt incident: she was burned to death in her farmhouse at Helmsdale, along with other members of her faction, in a revenge attack led by Swyen.It\u0026rsquos an example of the way in which many of the strands are intertwined, as Cassells points out.\u0026ldquoI read the sagas and I started taking a look at place names, he says. \u0026ldquoFor a long time I lived at Scrabster \u0026ndash Skarabolstadr, the \u0026lsquohomestead of the sea-mews\u0026rsquo.\u0026ldquoAnd the stories were interesting to read. They were intriguing.\u0026ldquoYou try and unravel it and it\u0026rsquos just more or less two families feuding all the way through it. That goes right to the very last act of the local earl being knifed in a beer cellar in Thurso.One of the most shocking events is the burning to death of Bishop Adam by a mob in Halkirk in a dispute over a butter tax.\u0026ldquoHe got a bit greedy, Cassells says. \u0026ldquoThey complained to the earl at the time who more or less said, \u0026lsquoDamn the bishop, you can burn him as you please,\u0026rsquo so they took him at his word.\u0026ldquoBishops crop up a couple of times. There was lot of enmity between the local Norse earldom and the Scottish king over bishops. A bishop got his eyes put out in Scrabster.\u0026ldquoAfter the bishop was murdered at Halkirk, the Scottish king came up here and carried out what was, for want of a better description, pure genocide of the people from the Halkirk area. I believe they were all massacred round about where the Pennyland estate is now in Thurso. Hundreds of people were killed there.\u0026ldquoIn those days you just didn\u0026rsquot go burning bishops \u0026ndash they\u0026rsquore going to come down heavy on you.\u0026ldquoRavenshill Road used to be known as the Gallows Hill, before the atomic houses were built there, so that has been a place for judicial executions for quite a long time.From the machinations of the \u0026ldquofemme fatale Ragnhild at Murkle to the murder of Earl Rognvald at Forsie to the Battle of Clairdon Hill outside Thurso, the power struggles and manoeuvrings come thick and fast. It\u0026rsquos a rapid-fire history lesson, but more than anything Cassells simply wants people to enjoy the stories.\u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a thing I never learned in school here. It was never mentioned, he says. \u0026ldquoThis is our own local history, and I just hope people think it\u0026rsquos a good read.The Katanes Saga  is self-published and is on sale in Caithness Horizons, newsagents in Thurso, and Wick Heritage Museum.Monday 3 Sep 2018 9:48 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"Open evening in Thurso for potential Childrens Panel members","story":"AN open evening is taking place next week with the aim of attracting volunteers for the Children\u0026rsquos Panel in Caithness.Tuesday\u0026rsquos event in Thurso will allow members of the public to find out how they can play a part in the children\u0026rsquos hearings system \u0026ndash helping others and giving something back to the community in the process.Volunteers from all walks of life make life-changing decisions that create a difference in the lives of many, and this is very true for children, young people and families in Caithness and across Scotland within the children\u0026rsquos hearing system.It relies on the voluntary involvement of around 2500 people who are willing and able to give their time and commitment to serve as Children\u0026rsquos Panel members.A number of agencies work together with the system to deliver protection, care and support to families, children and young people.

This is a deal with one of the biggest names in international air travel, and we see it as the start of a partnership that will develop into a full codeshare agreement later in the year.”Gokhan Haciibrahimoglu, general manager of Turkish Airlines Scotland said: “We are pleased to be working with Loganair for our flights operating from Edinburgh Airport, thus giving Turkish Airlines the opportunity to extend its network and better serve Scotland. Our partnership will allow both of our passengers to easily connect with the regional airports of North and West Scotland to over 304 destinations and 122 countries.”The move is the latest in Loganair’s Better Connected programme, which aims to provide the Scottish airline’s key destinations with a wide range of links both for local community travelling worldwide \u0026#8211 but just as importantly to also enable incoming visitors, whether for tourism or business, to enjoy ease of booking and ease of access.Deals have already been signed with Air France, Dutch giants KLM, Emirates, Thomas Cook Airlines, and customers can through-ticket and through-check baggage where flights connect at Glasgow, Aberdeen, Edinburgh, Inverness and Norwich. Single ticket booking for ongoing flights with more than one carrier offers multiple benefits including through check-in, protected connections in the event of delays and, importantly, the APD saving on flights from the Highlands and Islands which can be as much as £78 per person if connecting onwards to long-haul destinations.The partnerships with KLM and Air France allow passengers from all Loganair’s Highlands \u0026amp Islands destinations to travel via Aberdeen, Edinburgh, Glasgow or Inverness onto KLM flights to Amsterdam and from there to destinations worldwide and via Aberdeen and Edinburgh to Air France flights to Paris Charles de Gaulle and again onwards to destinations worldwide.The deal with Thomas Cook Airlines allows holiday connections from the Highlands and Islands via Glasgow to destinations including the USA, and the same will apply to Emirates services to the Middle East and to the Far East and Australia.The Thomas Cook partnership also provides long-haul connections from Inverness and Norwich via Manchester to destinations including New York, Los Angeles, Boston, San Francisco, Seattle, Orlando and Las Vegas on a single ticket.It also complements codeshare arrangements Loganair already has in place with British Airways and its partner airlines at Manchester, offering connectivity to transatlantic routes, including Chicago and Philadelphia, with onward connections throughout the US.\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

However, notably, an interest in sport is not essential.The voluntary services of personnel with experience in event planning, fundraising and sponsorship, business and project management, procurement, marketing and PR, communication and strategic planning, are also being sought.Mr Deans added: “We’re looking for people with the skills, but they really need that long-term commitment and time to devote to this.”Recruitment information and an online application can be found at www.oiga.org.uk/organising-committee-recruitment-statement/For further information, and any queries, email info@oiga.org.uk.The deadline for applications is Saturday, September 29.            \u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Dry at the finish, it leaves an aromatic smoky flavour and a mouth-watering hint of mild, salty sea spray – the result of 30 years’ maturation on Orkney’s windswept island environment.Average colour tint 23.3Nutmeg | Dark chocolate orange | Aromatic peat smoke | Sticky toffee pudding | Sea salt45.7%700ml A simple guide to appreciating the flavours and aromas.Highland Park offer a range of tours of their distillery along with tastings of their famous whiskies.

This will briefly divert cars onto the adjacent railway track and back again at set windows during the day when trains are not passing by.But motorists who miss one of the windows could face waits of up to two-and-a-half hours for the next one.And this has prompted Highland Council to urge drivers to make sure they plan their journey and allow enough travel time so they are not caught out.A council spokeswoman said: \u0026ldquoWe have worked closely with Network Rail and our contractor TRAC Engineering Ltd to keep disruption to road users to a minimum when the road\u0026ldquoBut inevitably there will be times when road users will face longer waits \u0026ndash so we urge people to plan their travel carefully and avoid the periods when the diversion is not going to be available.During the works the road will be closed overnight to all traffic between the two gates between 10pm and 7am.Traffic control measures will operate between 7am and 10pm while the road-to-rail bypass is installed. This could take up to two weeks, but may be finished sooner.Once the temporary bypass is installed, the timetable of opening slots between trains will take effect.Cards showing details of the timetable that will be operating for the road to rail diversion have been distributed among local communities.Copies are also available at the Highland Council website by searching for Stromeferry Bypass at www.highland.gov.ukThe road-to-rail bypass will be available for use between 7am and 10pm, but only by traffic weighing less than seven-and-a-half tonnes .Traffic above those limits will have to divert along the A87, A82, A832 and A890.The council believes the restrictions and roadworks will be finished by November 24, when the A890 will fully reopen.Monday 3 Sep 2018 9:49 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Detailed measures will be presented next week.Leaders of the minority independent administration said every attempt would be made to minimise the impact on services but \u0026ldquosome impact on service is inevitable.Budget leader Alister Mackinnon said: \u0026ldquoOur  reserves of \u0026pound8 million are well below the minimum recommended by Audit Scotland and it\u0026rsquos vital that they\u0026rsquore not depleted further. The committee agreed stricter controls on recruitment and overtime, a review of all agency appointments and tighter controls on staff travel.The \u0026pound5.1 million figure equates to one per cent of the total budget and compares with a \u0026pound2.7 million estimate at this stage last year. The potential overspend is blamed on high cost placements for \u0026lsquolooked-after children\u0026rsquo, lower income from new parking charges and fewer savings from toilet closures because those two policies have not yet taken full effect.Council chiefs insisted no staff jobs were at risk.Finance director Derek Yule, however, warned there were \u0026ldquono more rabbits to be pulled from hats to tackle the problems.Black Isle Liberal Democrat Gordon Adam blamed Scottish Government grant cuts while SNP city councillor Richard Laird said the crisis was \u0026ldquoentirely of this council\u0026rsquos making.Council leader Margaret Davidson claimed local government services were \u0026ldquonot a priority for the Scottish Government.The budget leader angered the SNP benches, accusing group leader Maxine Smith of not fully participating in budget discussions. He said he invited her to meetings but had been turned down \u0026ldquobecause she views her private commitments more important than reorganising her diary.She was not in the chamber to respond. In a later statement she said: \u0026ldquoOn Friday, I received a request to attend a meeting on Monday to discuss the budget. I had commitments but they were pre-arranged meetings with constituents. I\u0026rsquove sent him a meeting request for tomorrow. I\u0026rsquom available any time, so hopefully he\u0026rsquoll re-arrange his diary. On the budget, our job in opposition is to scrutinise.A spokesman for the Scottish Government said: \u0026ldquoHighland Council has had more this year despite UK government cuts to our budget. It will receive over \u0026pound487 million Scottish Government funding in 2018-19.n Support was voiced for a city councillor who has quit as the SNP\u0026rsquos deputy leader on Highland Council.Richard Laird  cited health reasons for his decision. He will remain a Central Ward councillor. He said: \u0026ldquoMy health isn\u0026rsquot good enough. That\u0026rsquos the reason I\u0026rsquom stepping down. For the last year or so, both my physical health and my mental health have been in decline. I\u0026rsquove been told by the doctor to reduce my workload a bit.SNP group leader Maxine Smith said: \u0026ldquoI am saddened that Richard has had to step down as depute group leader, as we have worked well together. His illness has been creeping up on him for some time and he feels he needs time to rest, so removing the huge responsibility of chairing a strategic committee is a sensible thing to do. Richard will continue to be a valued member of our group. He is a highly intelligent man, who has lots more to give.Monday 3 Sep 2018 9:49 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

The campaign was highlighted earlier this year by the Ross-shire Journal when riders revealed their concerns.After meeting campaigners near Cullicudden, Miss Forbes said: \u0026ldquoIn a rural place like the Black Isle it\u0026rsquos not surprising to see horse riders. Despite that, I was really disappointed to hear that drivers usually drive too close and too fast when passing a horse. There is evidently a lot of work to do in educating drivers about overtaking horses and the serious dangers of scaring horses.\u0026ldquoSadly, horse riders told me that they believe the roads are increasingly dangerous for horse riding, despite horse riders having equal access to the road. I support these horse riders on the Black Isle who want to raise awareness of how to overtake horses and ensure that riders don\u0026rsquot fear for their safety when riding in a rural place like the Black Isle.Since 2010, there have been almost 150 incidents on Scottish roads involving both motorists and horse riders \u0026ndash including two rider fatalities and 50 serious injuries.One local rider earlier told the Ross-shire Journal how she had taken to wearing head-mounted cameras in a bid to protect herself and others. Concern over an increasing number of near misses and alarming incidents has prompted calls to the police to intervene.Nel MacDonald-Rolfe, one of the riders, said: \u0026ldquoRural roads are to be treated with respect even by the locals who become complacent and take chances. You never know what is round the corner nor what can suddenly appear from the side of the roads.\u0026ldquoRural roads are there to be used by all, which includes cycles, walkers and horse riders. Patience and respect for all users and educating is the key. As they say, speed kills.The appeal to drivers to rein in their speed and to be aware of other road users followed near-misses on the B9169 Cullicudden straight.

That echoes public concerns which prompted a rethink from Highland Council four years ago.Tarbat Community Council is amongst the latest groups backing Craighill, stating that the TRA site \u0026ldquoshould not feature even as a second choice. It has outlined concerns over the lack of space for future expansion, inadequate room to play and the prospect of \u0026ldquotall and ugly buildings more appropriate to terminals at a second-rate airport.It says that \u0026ldquohuge cost advantages could come from using modular building techniques.The new campus will replace Tain Royal Academy, Craighill Primary, Knockbreck and the St Duthus special school. Parent councils have consistently appealed for improved facilities with the existing Craighill building the lowest scoring in the Highlands for educational suitability and condition.Wendy Hennem, of Tain Royal Academy Parent Council, noted that the Craighill site appeared to be the preferred public choice and that the resounding response from young people is: \u0026ldquoJust get it done.Tain and Easter Ross ward councillor Fiona Robertson told the Journal: \u0026ldquoAs we haven\u0026rsquot reached the deadline yet, I am not privy to the results of the consultation. However, I believe from my work with the stakeholder group and from being amongst the communities, that the Craighill site may be the most popular option. This has always been my preferred option as I believe it is much more suitable for a development of the size of a three to 18 campus.\u0026ldquoWhatever the results, it is important that the community works with Highland Council in order to deliver much-needed new schools for Tain. The extremely poor conditions of our primary and secondary schools in Tain is well known and acknowledged by Highland Council, therefore we all need to work hard to prepare an agreed plan in order to be in a position to apply for government funding later in the year.\u0026ldquoI believe the majority of people in Tain and Easter Ross just want to ensure we get fit for purpose schools in Tain to ensure the best possible educational facilities for our children\u0026rsquos futures.Fellow ward councillor Derek Loudon said: \u0026ldquoStudies by the community council, the Highland Council and the Ross-shire Journal have shown a clear preference for Craighill. There is little public support for the TRA site as all three consultations have shown. I hope we can move on now to get a layout on the Craighill site which is along the lines of the study done by Lachie Stewart [chairman of Tain and Easter Ross Civic Trust] and the community council which takes advantage of the space available to deliver great new buildings for primary, secondary, St Duthus, Gaelic and sports and leisure.\u0026ldquoI believe significant savings on cost, quality and time can be made with new construction techniques which are proven and have worked elsewhere. Let\u0026rsquos work with the Scottish Government and the Scottish Future\u0026rsquos Trust to deliver a great result for the people of Easter Ross.The consultation can be accessed at https:www.highland.gov.uk/downloads/file/19305/proposal_paper_tain_final_240518What do you think?

An army of the unemployed descended on Edinburgh from all corners of Scotland. With them were bands, field kitchens and banners. Each marcher had a knapsack and blanket. The goal of the marchers was to meet with Sir Godfrey Collins, Secretary of State for Scotland, to demand the abolition of the means test, increased relief for men, women and children and for work schemes to provide jobs. The city authorities made it clear the marchers were not welcome and they would provide no accommodation or food.            The march was organised by the Communist-led National Unemployed Workers Movement , whose Scottish organiser was the veteran agitator, Harry McShane, but it won support from the Independent Labour Party, the trade unions and Labour Party. The Aberdeen and Dundee contingents marched south to join with the Fife contingent in Kirkcaldy. The Ayrshire contingent joined with Lanarkshire marching via Shotts and East Calder. The Renfrewshire and Dunbartonshire contingents, including a women’s section marched via Glasgow, Coatbridge, Airdrie, Bathgate, and Broxburn. The main Glasgow contingent marched to Kilsyth and Falkirk, where they joined with Stirlingshire, and onto Edinburgh via Bo’ness.READ MORE: Video: Rare footage of Edinburgh in the 1930sOn Sunday 12 June, they joined up in Costorphine for their entry into the capital. The next day 20,000 people greeted them at the Mound. The first sign of a thaw on the part of the authorities was when the Ministries of Labour, Health and Education agreed to meet delegations of marchers. But there was still no reply from Collins. A second victory was when the police lifted a ban on street collections. But Collins refused to meet with them.The NUWM members paraded through the royal palace of Holyrood with their band playing ‘The Internationale’ and other socialist tunes, and when the city council refused to provide accommodation their leader, Harry McShane, said they’d sleep on the pavement of Princes Street, the city’s most prestigious thoroughfare, as marcher William McVicar recalled: “I think someone offered us somewhere [to sleep] like Waverley Market or somethin’. And McShane and them wouldn’t accept that, they says, ‘No, no, we’re not going there.’ So they says, ‘Oh well, we cannae give you anything else.’ And of course he says, ‘Right we’ll sleep in Princes Street.’” The Edinburgh Evening News reported McShane telling the marchers as they gathered on the south side of Princes Street: “So far here we are and here we stay until another decision is reached. We can breakfast, dinner or tea here, and the men require a rest. They can have that rest in Princes Street. We have decided to give them a long lie in ‘bed’ this morning.” The Edinburgh Dispatch caught the mood among the ordinary folk of Edinburgh as they made thier way along Princes Street on that first morning: “Walking along on the carriageway one heard snatches of conversation: ‘Slept well?’ ‘How did ye enjoy yer feather bed?’ ‘Did ye feel a draught coming in during the night?’”            On the first morning, women marchers blocked the tramway while men shaved using their reflections in the windows of the big department stores. Tom Ferns remembers: “And they couldnae ha’ picked a better spot than Princes Street. Under the Conservative Party headquarters, the Liberal Party headquarters and the big luxury hotels, here was hundreds and hundreds o’ angry unemployed. Obviously a sight like that is not seen every day, particularly in the capital city of Edinburgh.”READ MORE: Astonishing press photographs capture interwar-era EdinburghAnother marcher, James Allison, said, “the police were going mad”. Yet Edinburgh police were not keen on inciting a pitched battle as Hugh Sloan recalled: “At dinner time, our field-kitchen came along and the police chief told Harry McShane, ‘This is Princes Street, you can’t feed here.’ Harry told them, ‘It was good enough for us to sleep here, it’s good enough for us to feed here.’” The marchers then demanded free transport home. Eventually the city’s chief constable and deputy town clerk told them they would provide transport if McShane guaranteed there would be no more marches to Edinburgh. He refused and the chief constable, worried about disturbances on the capital’s streets, backed down. Transport was then provided to take the marchers home.            On the last night, the marchers and their supporters gathered to burn an effigy of Sir Godfrey Collins before boarding buses and a final meal paid for by the city council. The march organisers refused to give a guarantee that no further hunger marchers would defile the city!Throughout the 1930s, the unemployed protested but the NUWM also organised children’s parties in the summer and at Christmas. A number of the marchers would go on to fight in the Spanish Civil War, including the leader of the Aberdeen contingent, Bob Cooney.The inter-war period, not just the “Hungry Thirties”, was grim in Scotland. Prior to the First World War, it had been at the cutting edge of British industry. Within a few years of the wars end the traditional industries, coal, steel and shipbuilding were in trouble. Scottish banks and companies were bought up by their bigger English rivals. Unemployment was a permanent feature, peaking in the 1930s and only ending with the demands of the Second World War.The shale mining industry collapsed, for example, as cheap imported oil cut demand for paraffin. In December 1925, “The Scotsman” reported from Tarbrax, a shale mining village then in South Lanarkshire under the headline “Situation at Tarbrax: Faced With Starvation,” which reported: “Workers from Tarbrax, to the number of nearly 400, marched in procession to Carnwath, nearly ten miles distant, on Thursday night last for the purpose of asking poor relief. Relief under the emergency clause of the Poor Law Act, which enables people in a state of absolute destitution to get relief, has been given to a number of people in Tarbrax on the recommendation of the doctor there. A meeting of Carnwath Parish Council has been called for today to consider the whole situation.”  Starvation – it’s a strong word. My father was little over a year old when the mine at Tarbrax shut. His father would have been on that cold December march before briefly finding work at another pit nearby, then giving up and coming to Edinburgh in search of work. He was without a permanent job until the end of the 1930s.

One is the Climate Change Bill where Scottish Labour has joined the Scottish Greens in calling for net zero emissions rather than the 90 per cent cut proposed by the SNP. Of course, percentages tend to leave the public cold. So it’s worth trying to visualise the differences between a very sizeable cut in our contribution to global warming and an absolute end.            The SNP’s 90 per cent target means electric buses, trains and cars will be standard transport modes by 2050 and the planning system will reduce the demand for travel and bring employment closer to where people live. To go further and reach net zero emissions, Scotland must also tackle the difficult areas of aviation and shipping and explore ideas like electric/hydrogen ferries and electric planes, which are being built and piloted in the Nordic nations now. Flights to the sun for summer holidays will still be possible – but at 2005 levels.To make progress in agriculture, we must cut current ­levels of meat and dairy consumption and production. It was noticeable at a recent conference in Finland that the default in hotels, cafes and universities is already almond, not cow’s milk. But for Scotland to reach net zero, far more will have to change. We may need new breeds of cows and sheep, which emit less methane and a new diet for animals. Our farming and food science institutes must start that kind of experimentation now. Industry will change dramatically under either scenario. Our oil and gas dependence must end by 2050 and there can be no new oil fields developed in the North Sea except where they supply developing nations, on the grounds that existing operations cause less eco-damage than drilling elsewhere from scratch. Companies and investment funds will have divested from fossil fuels to avoid being left with “stranded assets” as oil-based products and services become ­economically unviable. Much energy and imagination will be needed to replace cement and plastics. Where that isn’t ­possible, Scotland will have to offset using carbon capture technology  and will have to get funding agreement or political ­control from Westminster.            Heating will have to be electric by default to reach the 90 per cent target so air and ground source heat pumps will have to be affordable and commonplace. That demands a big rise in insulation and some frank discussion about whether ­utilities are up to the task. Net zero emissions means more district heating, and imaginative solutions for rural areas like hydrogen generated by renewables as ­Orkney is already doing. Tree planting will escalate rapidly because a small amount of emissions can be mitigated by planting forests to store carbon. Reafforestation demands a big debate – will big landowners be allowed to evict tenants for tree-planting grants or will the opportunity be seized to effect land reform and diversify the rural economy?These changes can boost the economy if Scotland’s politicians are resolute. We can be ahead of the manufacturing curve and not just left buying foreign innovation. Cyclotricity is relocating from ­England to Glenrothes to manufacture electric bicycles and Star Renewables – whose heat pumps use fjord water to power the Norwegian town of Drammen – could do the same in every coastal Scottish town and city. But innovation and investment is needed now so we don’t import zero-emissions related-technology as we have imported most wind turbines. All these changes are essential because Scotland’s success in tackling carbon emissions  is largely in energy production  and waste  while reductions in agriculture , residential heating , and transport  have been far lower.             The low hanging fruit have almost all been picked. If the Scottish Government still wants the most ambitious climate change targets in the world, it must tackle bigger structural issues. Norway’s Conservative-led Government has just promised to reach zero emissions by 2030, Sweden’s target is 2045 and the French target is 2050.Does Scotland’s devolved government control enough budget, taxes and levers to deliver the same? Will the public support dramatic change or will the ­prospect of more warm, dry summers and the impending chaos of Brexit combine to let politicians off the hook? What will change minds – food prices rising further as a downside of the dry summer? How about predictions that more melting ice could shift the Gulf Stream, which guarantees Scotland’s mild climate? This year wild fires covered the globe an unprecedented heat wave killed dozens in Japan and thick sea ice off Greenland has broken up for the first time on record. The world is witnessing ­tipping points aplenty. Can these extreme climate events be ­written off as insignificant or mere coincidence?Matters will come to a head during October’s SNP conference when the IPCC is due to release its latest statement on what countries must do to hold warming below the 1.5C limit demanded by the Paris Agreement. Actually, UK emissions have fallen faster since 2010 than in any other G7 nation except Italy – mostly through a switch away from coal-fired electricity.In July, more than 100 MPs wrote to the Prime Minister calling for a target of net zero emissions by 2050. In short, there may just be the appetite for real political cooperation across borders and ­party lines. Sadly the imminent chaos and recrimination of Brexit may soon end that.            Of course, politicians are frightened of confronting voters with the scale of change needed to move from the oil to the renewables age. Scotland’s remaining oil has for too long been integral to the case for independence – will the SNP be able to move beyond Scotland’s Oil as a slogan and aspiration? Will Scottish Labour’s new enthusiasm for net zero emissions be shared by Jeremy Corbyn and will the ­party weaponise Scotland’s inevitable transition away from oil as a new way to attack independence? It may be unduly optimistic, but focus on climate change could yet transform Scottish society – if we are all ready to raise our game."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4793846.1535919217!/image/image.jpg","title":"quarter of student nurses dropping out before graduation","story":"        One in four student nurses are dropping out of their degrees before graduation, figures show.                Data obtained by nursing journal Nursing Standard and the Health Foundation charity indicates that of 16,544 UK nursing students who began three-year degrees due to finish in 2017, 4,027 left their courses early or suspended their studies.            With the health service struggling to cope with a ­massive shortage of nurses, they warned that the number of student nurses not qualifying could be exacerbating the NHS staffing crisis.The figures they obtained give an average attrition rate of 24 per cent.            Data from a Nursing Standard investigation in 2006 put the attrition rate at 24.8 per cent, which it said suggests that attempts to address the issue over the last decade have had little effect.Bad experiences on clinical placements, financial difficulties and academic pressures are all known to contribute to student nurses dropping out.Nursing workforce expert Professor James Buchan, of Queen Margaret University in Edinburgh, said: ­“Student nurse attrition has been for many years identified as a major problem for the UK, both in terms of the negative impact on individuals who leave programmes early, and also for the system at large, given nursing shortages are so prominent and increasing.”Last year, the Government replaced the NHS bursary for student nurses with a tuition fees and loans system, which experts say has also affected the number of students ­taking up places on degree programmes.Ben Gershlick, senior ­economics analyst at the Health Foundation, said: “While the attrition rate has remained fairly constant over the last decade, its impact is becoming more severe bearing in mind the overall shortage of nurses, vacancies in nursing posts and rising demand pressures on the NHS.            “The need for nurses trained in the UK has also increased as we have seen a recent fall in the inflow of nurses coming from abroad.“The long-term plan for the health service, which is currently in development, and the workforce strategy expected from Health Education England, need to bring a much more joined-up and strategic approach.”Nursing Standard editor Lynn Eaton said the high drop-out rate is a “major concern”.“Nursing is a great career,” she added. “Despite all we hear about the problems in the NHS and the changes in funding students while they study, it’s still a very attractive option.            “We need to recruit enough nurses to meet the needs of our growing older population.But we also need to make sure we’re training the right people for those roles.“Some students will, sadly, realise it’s not for them.”Nursing Standard asked 74 UK universities offering nursing degrees for start and ­completion data for students on three-year pre-registration programmes for 2014-17.A total of 55 universities ­provided data, which was analysed by the Health ­Foundation."},{"url":null,"title":"watch aerial footage new eric gray centre ","story":"The long-awaited Eric Gray Centre is nearing completion – as shown by aerial footage recently published by contractors DITT Construction.\n\nThe project, costing around £6 million, marks the culmination of years of planning with a feasibility study taking place in 2006.

One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.\nCome on Haydn I agree there are many beautiful building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.\nThe Shard is a massive glass pyramid\u0026#8230.I\u0026#8217m wholly indifferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.\nMareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.\nIf I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used \u0026#8211 There\u0026#8217s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.\nAll the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.\nCall me old fashioned but I would love to see the modern  building business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of 25 to 80 tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles  ,all done 5000 years ago.It\u0026#8217s true you really can\u0026#8217t get the staff nowadays. I wonder if the Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops \u0026#8211 the British ways of one can\u0026#8217t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is about  to finish off  another burgeoning industry.\nI’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up!   As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.  May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in their  bucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.\nAluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.\nI’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of the  term ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much in  identifying the material nature of that being used but more an attempt  to denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure?  Rather like calling a van a box on wheels? I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaning  comments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.\nIf it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.\n@ Haydn Gear.\nWhen there is nothing of note to differentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.\nPretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.\nUnless you already know Mareel\u0026#8217s purpose and that its supposedly an \u0026#8216iconic\u0026#8217 design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that\u0026#8217s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname \u0026#8216The Pagoda\u0026#8217 as soon as it was built.\nLet us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for \u0026#8220Mareel\u0026#8221 to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst\u0026#8217s \u0026#8220Pickled cow and calf.\u0026#8221, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel\u0026#8217s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.\nI have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel.   What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.  Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kick  out of venting there spleens in those directions.  I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments?  I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.\nLeaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man?\nThose of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.\nPurely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda was  in any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it?  I wonder if takeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architectural  similarities.\nThe viking was a chippy when it opened.\n\u0026#8220What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.\u0026#8221 Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, \u0026#8221 is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments? \u0026#8220, \u0026#8220I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever\u0026#8221 and \u0026#8221 Pig ignorant prats.\u0026#8221 Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!\n\nWell Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.    I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.  There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there? All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , proliferate.  Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.  I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.\nLove hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my life involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of some  by those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and to  maintain  credibility from the watchful public at large.         In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.  Look what happened!      So let today’s critics mock on if it makes them feel better.\n\nParaphrasing MGM\u0026#8217s famous motto, the phrase \u0026#8220Arse gratia artis\u0026#8221, springs to mind. LOL 🙂\nAs an artist myself  doing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildlife, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.\nI have been to many art exhibitions and  art shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as \u0026#8216 ripping off the customer \u0026#8216 with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody else can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.\nIt takes me about 20 hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.\nI have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!  Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products difficult to accommodate should pay a visit.   Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spence  is an all   too common feature in most  walks of life —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.    Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns is  not too far removed from the  actions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!\nSo talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.\nNobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as \u0026#8220pig ignorant\u0026#8221. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such \u0026#8220arty things\u0026#8221.  We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £16 million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained/consecrated.\nNo doubt it was deliberate   and the  opportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !\nHad you checked out Ian\u0026#8217s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I\u0026#8217d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous \u0026#8220Sam the Eagles\u0026#8221 among us. That said, it\u0026#8217s a concept I wouldn\u0026#8217t wish to see spread any farther!  🙂\n\nNo insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to \u0026#8220The Black Mountains\u0026#8221. I  will try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found in  Mareel\u0026#8217s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing else, nasty little creatures!!! .\nFair  enough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.  I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.  Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artists  when it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of life. Nice to have these little chats from a distance and always enjoy reading your submissions.  HG\nIs the winning artist of the Turner Prize, representing what many think of the Turner Prize and this of being a club for elitist artists where their work is highly questionable or just giving art the \u0026#8216 shock value \u0026#8216 when it comes to expressing what art is or should be?\nPersonally, I would do away with this and just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it \u0026#8216 And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230. \u0026#8216. lol\n“ And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.?”.  Go on David,since you are consumed with what is appropriate why not have a go yourself ?  You said “ personally , I would just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it “ And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.David Spence.   I’ll lend you a trowel to apply the “paint” provided that you are prepared to produce it \u0026#8230\u0026#8230.. on stage at Mareel perhaps. After all, anything goes these days and you could bask in the glory for the rest of your days.  Plus free drinks at the bar with all the trendies.   LoL\nThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.\nBased on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say \u0026#8216 there is a strong likeness to themselves \u0026#8216 and they are very pleased with the outcome.\nAlternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.\nI could always get away with this by saying \u0026#8216 It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art \u0026#8216 and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lol\nWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.    I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself and if you look at my products you would find this to be true.   My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generate  sympathetic responses.  It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.  All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 22 ","story":"After being tasked with compiling a feature to coincide with the 100th anniversary of the senior football inter-county, it was a pleasure to speak to several of those with first-hand knowledge of the history of the Milne Cup competition.\nGeordie Hunter goes the furthest back, having made his debut in the 1953 game. On that occasion a top-notch Shetland team came away from Kirkwall with a 3-1 win courtesy of goals by Sammy Johnson, John “Pisco” Leask and Jim Black.\nHunter also played in the legendary 9-7 victory in Orkney 10 years later when, according to Orkney veteran Eric Hutchison, every shot that Bert Sinclair hit seemed to end up in the back of the net.\nSinclair himself has an amazing memory, and has kept records of some of his incredible achievements. His eight goals in one junior inter-county match and 11 in the next three successive senior counties have already been documented, but his scoring spree in the late 1950s and early 60s is something else.\nFrom 1957 to 1964 he played in just over 200 matches, at junior and senior level including representative games, and I can only find two occasions on which he failed to find the net. If anyone anywhere in the country has a record to beat that I’d be delighted to hear from them.\nSinclair also speaks of his greatest disappointment, being dropped from the county side in 1964, apparently for missing training when he had pretty valid reasons for not turning up.\nAnother who experienced the highs and lows was Derrick Bradley, who as manager led Shetland to an unprecedented 12 wins in 13 matches, the only blip being a 0-0 draw in Orkney.\nThen he was unceremoniously ousted, apparently because a few of the players had had enough of him. Bradley retains some bitterness, but it doesn’t stop him wishing the current side all the best for next weekend.\nLen Laurenson and John Johnston recount what it was like to play for both Shetland and Orkney, while James Johnston, Shetland’s equal most-capped player, reflects on 17 caps and how he went out on a high.\nBut the final word should go to two Orkney men, Hutchison and Morgan Harcus, both of whom are still avid fans of the annual event. As well as the fierce rivalry and hotly contested games, they mention the friendships they formed with their opponents.\nThat is probably what makes this contest so special. As Harcus says, they like to hate Shetland for an hour and a half, but the rest of the time it is completely different.\n: : : : : : : :\nDid the best team really win the World Cup? That question has been asked the length and breadth of the country after France’s 4-2 victory over Croatia on Sunday.\nPersonally I thought the Croats were very unlucky. The free kick from which the French opened the scoring should never have been given, while the penalty decision to make it 2-1 was debatable. There may just have been enough hand-to-ball movement for the spot kick to have been awarded, but it took several viewings by the referee through VAR before he was convinced.\n predictor competition, partly as a result of the scoring exploits of Antoine Griezmann, I was disappointed that it wasn’t a Belgium versus Croatia final. A new name on the Jules Rimet Trophy would only have been good for the game overall.\nFrance were ultimately the strongest team in the competition – they improved and became more resilient as the event wore on – but they were definitely not the most attractive. There was something almost German-like about the winners with their dogged organisation and ability to counter-attack with deadly efficiency.\nAs for England, I would say far too much has been made of a “new dawn” under manager Gareth Southgate. The English did get further than most people expected, but they came up well short on two occasions against the Belgians and only stuttered past Tunisia and Colombia. Two of the victories, it should be remembered, were against a shambolic Panama and a Sweden team which appeared to have no interest in winning other than by penalties.\nAfter England’s exit Graeme Le Saux – now there’s a twit if ever there was one – was going on about Southgate’s “emotional intelligence” whatever that is.\nA group of players came together and played as a team, it has been suggested by both Southgate and the media. But is that the first time in the history of football that this has happened to an English team? I don’t think so.\nIt happened at the World Cups of 1966, 1970, 1990 and 1998, and also at the European Championship in 1996. I’m sure the players who took part, for instance Bobby Charlton, Terry Butcher or Paul Gascoigne, would stress the team ethic involved.\nSpeaking of Charlton, the referee for Sunday’s final, Argentinian Nestor Pitana, had the kind of comb-over which the great man himself would have been proud of.\nThere were many who doubted the wisdom of granting the staging of this year’s event to Russia. But all in all it was a very satisfactory tournament. The organisation was good, the stadiums were tremendous, there was plenty of excitement and some great individual performances, and the introduction of VAR provided several talking points.\nMy team of the tournament, with a token Englishman in the mix, is: Thibaut Courtois  Benjamin Pad , Raphaël Varane , Diego Godín , Ivan Strinic  Ivan Perisic , Luka Modric , Jordan Henderson , Eden Hazard  Cristiano Ronaldo , Edinson Cavani .\nIf anyone questions the omission of Kylian Mbappe, I would say the young French player has been somewhat over-hyped. He certainly has pace in abundance, and a touch of skill, but is also petulant in a way that would suggest he is more of a successor to the diving Neymar than the much more honest Lionel Messi.\n: : : : : : : :\nSeveral metro stations in Paris have apparently been temporarily renamed in honour of France becoming world champions.\nAmong them are Notre-Dame des Champs, which became “Notre Didier Deschamps” and Victor Hugo which was adapted to “Victor Hugo Lloris”.\nEngland quickly cottoned on to the idea as well, with the Southgate tube stop in London being enlarged to “Gareth Southgate”.\nMaybe if Shetland wins the Milne Cup 100th centenary match next weekend the top thoroughfare in Scalloway could be changed to “Kevin Main Street”?\nOr did the county manager not name enough village players in his squad for that to happen?\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 23 ","story":"Over a hundred Shetlanders had a memorable time in Orkney at the weekend, rekindling aquaintances and reminiscing about old battles during the celebrations to mark the 100th anniversary of the Milne Cup.\nSadly this year’s football team were unable to bring the famous trophy back home again, going down to a highly charged and spirited Orkney outfit who took their chances when it mattered.\nMany supporters have been critical of the team selection, in particular the decisions to drop keeper Saul Swanson who kept a clean sheet last year, to leave striker Paul Molloy in reserve and to field James Farmer who did not seem fully fit.\nWhile it is hard to disagree with that, I also felt there was a disjointed look about the side with several players not being fielded in the positions they fulfil for their respective clubs.\nBut despite the result this did not feel like a hammering. The 5-1 scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.\nMolloy’s introduction 10 minutes into the second half obviously made a difference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubt if anyone else in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.\nBut the damage had been done in the first half – at 3-0 down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.\nSome have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.\nI felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.\nTwo years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a 3-2 defeat in Kirkwall.\nThere is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s 100th birthday.\nIt’s just a pity we have to wait a whole 12 months until a chance of revenge.\n: : : : : : : :\nA couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.\nThere are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.\nA score of 4-1 was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.\nThe Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.\nA few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.\nI would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.\n: : : : : : : :\nOrkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup 100th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday. Former Aberdeen striker Joe Harper, the evening\u0026#8217s guest of honour, is in the centre of the picture. Photo: John Coutts\nThe reception at the Pickaquoy Centre later on Saturday evening, attended by over 400 guests, was a great opportunity for former county football adversaries to meet up again.\nUnfortunately the meal was nothing to write home about – the main course of roast beef and trimmings was cold – and the acoustics of the building were downright awful.\nThe speeches which followed, if anyone could hear what was being said, were on the lengthy side. And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.\nIt was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow. Both Geordie Hunter, or the “big game Hunter” as Wood referred to him, and the inimitable striker Bert Sinclair certainly did their bit in years gone by.\nSinclair in particular was in his element, reminiscing with Orkney opponents Alan Findlay and Eric Hutchison who also featured in the famous 1963 game when he hit the back of the net five times in the 9-7 victory.\n: : : : : : : :\nAnd finally, as this week’s column is all about the inter-county weekend, it is surely fitting to end on a high note.\nOn Sunday morning, although the match really should have taken place as a warm-up to the main Milne Cup encounter, over two dozen veterans took to the field again.\nHelped by the fact that one or two of the team are still turning out occasionally at B-team level, the blues were much fitter and faster than their opponents.\nRobert Adamson, who fills out his shirt rather better than he did 20-odd years ago, was on the scoresheet along with his former Thistle team mate Stuart Smith who netted a hat trick.\nThe others came from Delting’s Stuart Hay and the aforementioned Main, who surely merited it after Saturday’s setback, and a penalty from the oldest man in the side Bruce Williamson of Spurs.\nThe final score was a 7-1 win for Shetland, which as some wise guy put it made for an aggregate 8-6 football victory. But unfortunately not many will see it that way.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.\nIt is rare enough for a local game to end 0-0, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.\nAstonishingly, Delting’s 4-1 triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.\nThe final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.\nDelting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.\nDevonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.\nThis is the 14th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back 36 years for Southend’s solitary success.\nApologies to older readers if I’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in 1982, but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.\nThe quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw 2-2 with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay 4-1 away from home.\nThe semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another 3-3 draw and another replay was necessary.\nAfter Delting won that one 3-2 at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.\nDelting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.\nAlthough it was tough ask to play two games in about 18 hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.\nSo on Saturday 7th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.\nGoals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a 2-0 lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.\nPlayer/manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.\nIt was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.\nBut it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.\n: : : : : : : :\nIn professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.\nThe benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the 20 clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.\nDuring the 2017-18 campaign the clubs benefited from over £2.4 billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £150 million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £94 million.\nJust where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.\nWhile players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.\nOn the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.\nIn Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.\nFollowing Rangers’ 1-1 draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.\nIt could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.\nThat was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.\nPerhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes finds if difficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.\nRogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.\nThere are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.\n: : : : : : : :\nOne of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.\nAlthough the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and 159 runs.\nMuch has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.\nUnfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.\nI’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.\nMaybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.\nThe only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped diffuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.\nSome apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.\nIn answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"spurs lose tight highland amateur cup final ","story":"Lerwick Spurs have narrowly lost the Highland Amateur Cup final after taking the tie to extra-time with a late equaliser.\nThe isles side had gone a goal down to Pentland United \u0026#8211 the competition\u0026#8217s most successful team \u0026#8211 in the 18th minute.\nPentland looked set to secure their eight Highland Amateur Cup trophy until a stoppage time equaliser from Spurs brought the game to extra-time.\nThe Lerwick side found themselves 2-1 down in the 6th minute of extra-time and were unfortunately unable to bag an equaliser.\nSpurs won five games on their way to the final including a quarter-final success against 2017 champions Avoch.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"fagradal lower voe ","story":"Offers over £205,000\n\nThe property is conveniently situated for Brae \u0026amp Sullom Voe, yet Lerwick  is still within easy commuting distance.

Opinion was also sought online. There is potential for the amended boundary to generate more planning applications. Parts of Grantown including The Square were designated as a conservation area in 1975. This is the first formal review since that designation.\nThe proposal is to extend the designated area along South High Street and into peripheral areas of the conservation zone. Mr Puls stressed it was not the purpose of a conservation area to prevent development but \"rather to control development to ensure it is appropriately sited and designed\".\nHe said this was aptly demonstrated by a number of new developments consented in recent years. Strong views were expressed \u0026ndash for and against \u0026ndash on the inclusion of the belt of trees to the north and west of Inverallan Church.\nThe trees contribute to the setting of the conservation area, forming a backdrop to the B-listed church \"and provide a natural separation with the later development to the north west\", according to the officer\u0027s report to members.\nThose against the proposed extension cited the project to convert the church for \"community use, part funded by developing housing either side of the church\".\nThere was a sense that including the location within the conservation area would be \"a barrier to this development\".\nConversely, there was support for including the trees because they would be better protected from speculative development.\nThe draft proposals will go to the council\u0027s south planning committee for approval. If adopted, all properties within the conservation area will be notified by letter.\nMonday 3 Sep 2018 9:50 AM\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117085.jpg","title":"Dalwhinnie makeover starts to take shape","story":"Tom Ramage\n\u0026nbsp\nDALWHINNIE is on the verge of a major makeover at its southern entrance.\nFor too long dogged by a disused, overgrown compound and a rusting old water treatment works, villagers are now beginning to hope that things could change dramatically over the next few months.\nAll being well, they heard on Tuesday, a \u0026pound2.3 million upgrade by Scottish Water could get under way in the new year which would leave the village with a new treatment works by this time next year.\n\"There\u0027s a long way to go,\" said the north\u0027s corporate affairs manager Gavin Steel when the Strathy met with an SW team in the village hall, \"but we\u0027re hopeful that all the many stages will be gone through on schedule.\n\"We are having to consult with a lot of different individuals and organisations \u0026ndash not least the national park authority, the Highland Council, the Scottish Environment Protection Agency and landowners \u0026ndash but this is work which will have to be done on behalf of the community.\n\"Quite simply the current system has reached its sell-by date.

There is certainly great excitement surrounding them and anticipation is high amongst both band and audience.\n“The Stirling concerts will be celebrations of our long musical journey, albeit tinged with the realisation that these are farewell appearances and so naturally emotions will be high – this is something we experienced recently at the farewell concerts in England and Europe – all spectacular events but nevertheless very moving.\n“We’ve been overwhelmed by the response to the announcement of the Stirling concerts – all the positive comments, the stories about what our music has meant to so many people, the sadness as the end approaches. But overall there will be a huge amount of love and positivity at Stirling and that’s what will carry everyone through these days ahead.\u0026#8221\nJones has been with Runrig all his adult life, having first joined the band on stage as a 17-year old at a dance in Portree’s Skye Gathering Hall in late 1977. He hopes the set list – which will be lengthy – will give a full reflection of the groups’s journey from a three -piece Scottish dance band playing island village halls to one which has sold out major venues across Scotland and Europe.\nHe said: “Compiling a set list is always a dilemma, with such a large back catalogue to choose from. Of course, there are certain songs that have to be included, otherwise we’d be lynched – but it’s also nice to pick some lesser-performed songs, possibly giving them a fresh twist.\n“Our set will be a good bit longer than usual – the problem was trying to keep the length down to sensible proportions – in essence, it will hopefully represent the band’s whole career, a celebration of our music and the unique bond with our audience.”\n century – the history of their native communities has shaped Runrig’s lyrics and songs. Jones believes that staying true to their roots – fusing them with the popular rock and pop influences they listened to in their teenage bedrooms \u0026#8211 has made sure the band’s popularity has endured through the generations.\n“We’ve been fortunate that throughout our long career we’ve continually gained new fans of all ages, at home and abroad, which has sustained us, even as fashions come and go around us,” he adds. “I guess there must be something in the lyrics, the melodies and the ethos of the band that has attracted such loyalty amongst fans, something universal that transcends our shared background in the heartland of the Highlands and connects with the wider world.”\nAuthenticity has been the hallmark of a band which can essentially still trace its origins to the three Portree streets of Fraser Crescent, Kitson Crescent, and Balmoral Road.\nThe original Run-rig dance band was founded by the Skye-raised sons of North Uist Calum and Rory MacDonald, along with Blair Douglas in 1973, and a year later the trio were joined by Donnie Munro, who became the band’s singer for more than two decades. Munro, who left in 1997 and was replaced by Canadian singer Bruce Guthro, will be on stage as a special guest this weekend.\n\nJones’ hopes for a legacy of music that people can continue to enjoy, and be inspired by, seem assured.\nHe adds: “Even though the band’s touring and performing life will have finished, I hope that people will continue to enjoy and discover our music for many years to come, perhaps giving inspiration to musicians that will follow on from us, in the knowledge that if you stick to your own path, be true to your musical roots and retain an open mind, great things may happen.”\nAs for the future – the band say it might be the end for Runrig, but it won’t mean retirement or the end of their music-making careers.\nSaid Jones: “The first thing to say is that there will be a long wind-down period – for instance we’ll film and record Stirling, so that will have to be worked on and brought to some sort of completion, plus there is the whole ongoing administration of the band archive and legacy which may lead to some interesting sideline projects.\n“Beyond that, we’ll all still be involved with our own individual performing, writing and music-making projects – that’s something you never retire from.\n“Personally, I’ll miss the band dreadfully but on the positive side I’ll spend more time on Skye plus I’ll have time to learn some new accordion tunes!”\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Run-Rig-1977-ADJUST-e1534430676612.jpg","title":"oidhche mhath runrig whfp editorial 24 8","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\n night spoke for the Highlands.\nThe unassuming Malcolm has often been a coolly detached figure on stage, concentrating solely on his guitar.\nBut he has been playing with the Run Rig Dance and Ceilidh Band since he was 17 years old and he is now in his 60th year.

Runrig and the legacy of fresh Gaelic musical talent that came in their wake are now bigger than their Highland infancy.\nBut whenever you listen to a Runrig song, there will always be an echo of that dance hall accordion, of Robert MacDonald, of Blair Douglas, of the island fan base that sent them on their way.\nIn the words of the title of their first, vinyl, album, they will always Play Gaelic.\n\u0026nbsp\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/web-ad-sales-large.jpg","title":"uig to tarbert service delayed due to medical","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\nThe 2.10 pm sailing from Uig, Skye to Tarbert, Harris on Wednesday  was delayed due to a medical emergency.\nThe announcement was posted on the CalMac Service Info Twitter account around 2.45 pm, and a further post has since stated that subsequent sailings will be delayed.

Arising out of the local experience of sectarian discrimination, the march helped to set in train a series of events that would change Irish politics forever.\nNationalists in the Six Counties had begun to explore new ways of highlighting the reality of discrimination. They had looked to Governments in Dublin for decades but found little help there. The IRA’s Resistance Campaign had ended in 1962, having failed heroically against the overwhelming military superiority of the British Army and RUC. However, the imposition of internment without trial, the banning of Sinn Féin and the use of the B Specials as a rural terror force, all exposed the violence that lay beneath the surface of the Orange state. \n which read: ‘Protestant girl required for housework. Apply to the Hon. Mrs. Terence O’Neill...’\n\nFive years after O’Neill’s accession nothing had changed. Unemployment and emigration among Catholics was far higher than among their Protestant neighbours. In County Tyrone, with a population of just over 73,000 Catholics to 60,500 Protestants, there were only 52 Catholics employed in local government as against 300 Protestants. Such discrimination was highlighted by the Campaign for Social Justice established by Patricia and Conn McCluskey in Dungannon in 1964. \nParallel with these developments, the IRA and Sinn Féin were rethinking their strategy with more emphasis to be placed on open campaigning against injustice in the North. The Wolfe Tone Society was established as a forum for debate and to circumvent the Stormont ban on the Republican Clubs, the name which, in turn, had been adopted to evade the ban on Sinn Féin. Members of the Wolfe Tone Society, the Campaign for Social Justice and others were involved in the formation of the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association  in February 1967.\nIt was direct action on the ground that propelled the nascent Civil Rights Movement onto the streets. The Brantry Republican Club in County Tyrone had campaigned for council housing to be built but when 15 houses were built in Caledon only one of them was allocated to a Catholic. The house next door was allocated to a single Protestant woman, the secretary of a unionist politician. \nLocal people decided to protest. The main organiser was Annie Mary  Gildernew, grandmother of Sinn Féin\u0027s Michelle Gildernew. Over a period of several months in 1967/68 a local family and supporters occupied a house in the Caledon estate. When they were evicted the case was raised in Stormont and began to make headlines beyond Tyrone. This was the spur for the march from Coalisland to Dungannon which received the endorsement of NICRA. \n\n\nIn a pattern that was to become all too familiar in the months ahead, Ian Paisley organised a counter-demonstration for Market Square in Dungannon.

The party’s spokesperson for Business, Enterprise andInnovation Maurice Quinlivan TD has announced proposals to increase the numberof people in apprenticeships to 60,000 by 2023, whilst also branding thecurrent government’s reform plans as “unambitious, uninspiring and unacceptablyslow”.\nThe document outlines Sinn Féin’s proposals to reform the system in ways suchas trebling the number of apprenticeship programmes currently availablealongside focusing on plans to increase the female \u0026amp people withdisabilities participation rates within the programmes. \nDeputy Maurice Quinlivan said\n “Thegovernment is currently missing its own targets when it comes to reforming theapprenticeship system. In 2017 just 391 people took part in newly establishedapprenticeship programmes, compared to the government’s target of 800.\n “Inaddition, only nine of the promised fifteen new apprenticeship programmes wereintroduced last year.”\n SinnFéin has also outlined the benefits of an all-Ireland apprenticeship system andthe benefits that would come with including trade unions in the development andgovernance of the programmes. The document reiterates Sinn Féin’s aim toabolish student contribution fees for apprentices and details how the partywill promote apprenticeship programmes as another tertiary education choice.\n Apprenticeshipis a tried and proven way for employers to develop highly skilled workers fortheir company and industry by using a mixture of coursework and practical onthe job learning. Record numbers of students are attending third leveleducation, but with this route not being suitable for everyone, Sinn Féin wantsto create more alternative routes for young people.\nDeputyQuinlivan continued\n“AcrossIreland we lack significant alternative opportunities for young people topursue other education. We want to build on the success of the traditionalcraft trades in Ireland such as plumbing, bricklaying and plastering, andexpand this way of learning, into a host of new fields.\n“Apprenticeships in fields such as green energy, retail, hospitality andfinancial services are hugely popular in other European countries. We aim toexpand the system into these areas to create different opportunities for allyoung people including more females and people with disabilities.”\n Currently,most apprenticeships are aimed towards male participants with just 160 out of13,589 people in apprenticeship programmes across the state being female in2018. In addition, the physically demanding nature of the current availableapprenticeships has resulted in just 1.7% of total apprentices in 2016 beingpeople with disabilities.\n\nSinnFéin aims to increase investment in apprenticeships to over €350 million perannum within five years. \nTheLimerick City TD, Deputy Quinlivan has said that this will “fund the treblingof the number apprenticeship programmes and provide places for 60,000apprentices”.\nDeputy Quinlivan continued: “€5,166,000 of investment will be required overfive years for the development of 63 new apprenticeship programmes, bringingthe total number of craft and new courses to 100.\n“Ireland’sallocation from the EU for training and education of the young is €68 million.Fine Gael was forced to return €19.8 million of this allocation in 2016, asthey failed to submit a payment application.\n“SinnFéin will ensure all EU monies allocated to Ireland would be fully utilised, tobenefit the education and training of our young people. To date, none of thismoney has been drawn down from the EU.”\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27460  ","story":" Michael McMonagle\n\nLet\u0026#039s exceed those who turned out on the very first civil rights march in August 1968 and let\u0026#039s ensure that a very clear and committed demand is presented to the governments - the Irish government as much as the British government - to address those issues of a rights based society that are enshrined in the Good Friday Agreement. - Mitchel McLaughlin\nThis Saturday the 50th anniversary of the first organised civil rights march in the North will be marked with a commemoration march from Coalisland to Dungannon. \nThe original march, held on August 24, 1968, was the first to be organised by the Civil Rights Association in the north, which was founded the previous year to challenge the institutionalised discrimination and injustice of the Six County state. \nIt was stopped at an RUC cordon before it reached its destination at Market Square in Dungannon but the organisers went ahead with their protest and held speeches at sang the civil rights anthem, \u0027We Shall Overcome\u0027, at the police cordon. \nAn estimated 2,500 people took part in the original march fifty years ago. \nThe Coalisland to Dungannon march was followed by a march in Derry on October 5 1968 which was brutally attacked by the RUC.

The march was blocked by the RUC at Thomas Street from entering Dungannon’s Market Square, subsequently leading to the second Civil Rights march in Derry’s Duke Street on 5th October 1968.\n\"The first civil rights march was a major cornerstone in Irish history, the people of the north stood up and said no more will we be treated as second class citizens, shaping politics on the island of Ireland for decades,\" he said.\nOver 2,500 took part in the first civil rights march from Coalisland to Dungannon. The march was stopped short of Market Square by an RUC cordon.\nThis would evidently change politics here forever - this was very much a campaign organised by people, from all backgrounds and none. \nProminent republicans were also central to the organisation of demonstrations, including the now Mid Ulster MP, Francie Molloy and the late Stan Corrigan.\nReflecting on the first civil rights march, 50 years on, Colm Gildernew said the first civil rights march should act as a rallying cry to those of us who seek to promote rights, equality and respect for all in society today.\n\"We are currently experiencing an unacceptable blockade on a swathe of rights-based issues by the DUP, including Irish language, marriage equality, women’s health, and legacy rights.  \n\"There are huge concerns arising from Brexit and the recent Boundary Commission proposals, seen by many as a new attempt to gerrymander the north.

They were on active service and at Drumnakilly, close to their homes, they were ambushed and shot dead by a unit of the British Army’s SAS regiment. The Volunteers were brothers Gerard and Martin Harte and Brian Mullin.\nThe SAS killings brought to an end a month which had been one of the most intense and tragic of the war in Ireland. It began on 1 August with the IRA bombing of Inglis Barracks in London, close to Margaret Thatcher’s Finchley constituency. It was the first IRA attack in England since the bombing of the Grand Hotel in Brighton during the Tory Party conference four years earlier. A British solider was killed in the Inglis Barracks blast. In the following days, the IRA killed three British soldiers and an RUC detective in the North. \n\nOn 8 August, two young nationalist men were murdered by a loyalist death squad in Belfast. There were two more such sectarian killings of young nationalist men in Belfast, on 17 and 18 August. On 20 August, eight British soldiers were killed at Ballygawley, County Tyrone, when the IRA bombed a bus carrying members of the Light Infantry Regiment returning from England. On 31 August, two civilians were killed in Derry after they triggered an IRA booby-trap bomb intended for British forces. \nPolitically this period was dominated by the issue of extradition and, on 27 August, Robert Russell, one of the IRA prisoners who broke out of the H-Blocks in the mass escape of 1983, was handed across the border to the RUC. This was despite widespread protests, including public dissent from within Fianna Fáil.\nIt was on the Long Bog Road at Drumnakilly, four miles outside Omagh, that the three IRA Volunteers met their deaths.\nAt 4pm on 30 August, they were ambushed by British forces who poured a hail of bullets into their car. The RUC and British Army immediately sealed off the area and the bodies of the three men were left at the scene, within the cordon and inaccessible to grieving relatives, until the following afternoon. \n\nGerard Harte  was the eldest of the three Volunteers and was an experienced IRA activist. With his brother, Martin, he was a prominent member of the Loughmacrory St Theresa’s GAA Club, where he organised youth teams. \nMartin Harte was just 21 but had been in the IRA for four years at the time of his death. A talented football player, he had captained the Loughmacrory team. He was the father of a three-month-old son and, to compound the tragedy, his widow was Briege Mullin, sister of his friend and comrade Brian Mullin. \nVolunteer Brian Mullin  had been singled out for particular harassment by British forces. He was arrested and interrogated in Gough Barrack on numerous occasions and a few weeks before his death he and his brothers were beaten by crown forces outside their family home.\n\n\nHundreds of British soldiers and RUC members saturated the Tyrone countryside as the three Volunteers were laid to rest. Speaking at the graveside of the Harte brothers, Sinn Féin President Gerry Adams said the Volunteers were “good, decent, patriotic freedom fighters driven to fight for justice”. \nVolunteers Brian Mullin, Gerard Harte and Martin Harte were killed on 30 August 1988, 30 years ago this week.\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_935986.jpg--.jpg?1534836507000\n","title":"the sky s the limit for stephens catering equipment abseiling team","story":"  \n \n  \nAN adventurous group of employees from Stephens Catering Equipment are going to great heights to raise money for Northern Ireland Chest, Heart and Stroke charity.\n  \nThe 12 strong team will be abseiling from the Europa Hotel on September 23 and what makes this even more of a challenge for the team is that most of them are afraid of heights!\n  \nClaire Adair explained: “This is the first abseil for most of us and a real challenge. \n  \n“I wanted to arrange a charity event that will really make us face our fears. \n  \n“Most of us taking part have a fear of heights so it will be a huge challenge.

This is the most common form of food poisoning in the UK. \n  \nWe have heavily invested in research throughout the production chain and we have already implemented new ideas such as hot water heating, double barrier changing facilities in each house and other technologies which we firmly believe have had a major impact in reducing the number of our birds which can become infected with Campylobacter. \n  \nFurthermore, we are focusing on excellence in biosecurity and innovative processing technologies.\n  \n\n  \nOngoing challenges\n  \n\n  \nControlling infectious disease in poultry is an ongoing challenge Moy Park face, in particular avian influenza . To address this, they have upgraded their AI contingency planning, rewriting the rulebook in the past year to ensure they have a robust plan in place.\n  \nWe have to think carefully how we would react and prevent spread if AI came in to Northern Ireland and together with agencies and Government departments we exchange views regularly with working groups, in order to remain on top of this key issue, Peter said.\n  \n\n  \nCareer Highlight\n  \n\n  \nOver his 40 years with the company Peter said a key highlight has been promoting ownership and pride with the people he works closely with.\n  \nA back to basics approach is one of my fundamental pillars, and I still firmly believe that bird husbandry and welfare are key to producing a high-quality product.\n  \nThere are endless opportunities for those considering a career in agriculture and food production, and as my wife and son also work in the poultry industry, I can definitely vouch for that!\n  \nAs the world population continues to expand, the demand for goods also increases and food production, and those working in the industry, will have to keep up with this development.\n  \nBy strengthening our production capabilities over the past number of years, we are well placed to meet this demand, with poultry a healthy and versatile source of protein which is also good value for money.\n  \n\n  \nPositive outlook\n  \n\n  \nPeter concluded: As I look back on my time in the industry and at Moy Park, I’ve always started each morning the same way, and I think it has stood me in good stead!\n  \nThe first thing I think of is ‘today will bring a new challenge, a new opportunity and I will most likely learn something new’ as every day is a school day!”\n \n                  \n    \n          \n"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_995387.jpg--.jpg?1535635242000\n","title":"superb gcse results for dunclug college","story":"  \nDUNCLUG College is celebrating historic levels of achievement at GCSE level. \n  \nAll students, including those with ious learning challenges sat a minimum of 7 GCSE subjects, including the compulsory core of English, Maths and Science and a range of GCSE optional choices in a balance of General and Applied courses.\n  \n Many gifted and competitive students sat 8, 9 or 10 subjects. The overall result for GCSE English for the whole cohort was 80% in the A – C range, with the overall Mathematics result being almost 60%: in each case this represented the best outcomes in the school’s history. \n  \nOverall, almost 80% of students achieved 5 or more subjects in the A – C range with almost 60% achieving this standard inclusive of English and Maths. This significantly exceeds the National and Northern Ireland averages and places our school and is testimony to the success which can be attained at a non-selective school. \n  \n Many factors contribute to such success, not least the support of parents, the commitment of students and the motivational teaching which is inspirational yet grounded, and which proves that high expectations enable students to push boundaries and indeed predictions. \n  \nSubjects which achieved the outstanding success rate of 100% of pupils gaining Grade C or better were as follows: Art, Construction, Media Studies, Double Award Science, Occupational Studies, Further Maths, Prince’s Trust, Agriculture \u0026amp Community Sport.

Universal Credit is definitely a part of that, I am in no doubt about that. We have been dealing with people who have said that they are in need of help because of Universal Credit. \nThe figures cover the six month period May to October 2017 and the period January to May 2018 with an average of 30 vouchers a month dealt with in the first period, jumping to 38 in the second.\nPeter acknowledges that these figures are from quite a small area over a limited time \u0027but something must have triggered it.\u0027 He said:There is an unmistakable trend, more people are needing help after Universal Credit.

by-election opens this Wednesday at three venues across North Antrim, including the Joey Dunlop Leisure Centre in Ballymoney.\nAccording to the Electoral Office for Northern Ireland  75,478 North Antrim voters are entitled to sign the Petition in respect of Mr Paisley, recently suspended from the House of Commons, with 10% of those or 7,547 signatures needed to force a by-election.\nUUP Leader Robin Swann and Dunloy Sinn Fein MLA Philip McGuigan have both expressed disappointment at the EONI decision to open only three centres with limited opening hours, instead of a possible 10.\n\n\nINADEQUATE\n\n\nBoth MLA\u0027s as well as TUV leader Jim Allister have said will be signing the petition.\nExpressing disappointment, Mr Swann said three petition centres was totally inadequate for a constituency the size of North Antrim, and by restricting the opening hours, the EONI has shown little regard to people in daytime employment,\n\nSUBVERTED\n\n\nMr McGuigan agreed that the EONI decision on venues was extremely disappointing, and simply not good enough.\nHe continued that people\u0027s ability to reject the disgraceful behaviour of Ian Paisley was greatly reduced by this decision after he had accepted lavish family holidays from the Sri Lankan government and lobbyied against a UN resolution about\u0026#160 human rights abuses by the Sri Lankan authorities.\nHe said the UUP would not register as campaigner during the recall petition, but would encourage any North Antrim electors who think what Ian Paisley did was wrong to sign the petition\n

grateful family of a Ballymoney schoolboy whose life was saved by his older brother\u0027s bone marrow have spoken publicly for the first time.\nA year after seven-year-old Caden Moore received a transplant at Bristol Royal Hospital for Children from his 11-year-old brother Ben their proud mother Sabrina has agreed to share their inspiring story.\nSabrina and her husband Bryan are hoping their unforgettable experiences will encourage others to give blood and sign the Stem Cell and Bone Marrow Register.\nSpeaking exclusively to The Chronicle, teacher Sabrina said: It\u0027s been the toughest year of our lives but what a difference the past 12 months have made no words can ever express how we all felt this time last year.\n\u0026#8220To have two children going through such life-changing procedures in the same hospital, on the same day, is something we could never have imagined. Caden is improving every day and Ben has never looked back. We can\u0027t forget their big sister Kaia who has kept us all smiling.\nThe family\u0027s agony began on June 8 last year when Caden, a pupil at St Brigid\u0027s Primary School, was diagnosed with aplastic anemia, a rare blood disease where bone marrow fails to produce sufficient blood cells.\nSabrina, who has taken time off from her job at Limavady Grammar School to care for Caden, recalled: Bruises started appearing all over his body and Caden was tired, so we knew something wasn\u0027t right.\n    \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n    \n          \n\n full newspaper \u0026#187\n\n    \n\nSend this page to a friend \u0026#187\n\n  \n         your_name.focus      return false     else if        your_email.focus      return false     else if        friends_name.focus      return false     else if        friends_email.focus      return false     else     ]]\n\n\n      \nSend to a friend\n  \nPlease complete the following form to inform a friend about this page.\n  \"\n    \n    \n      \n        \nYour Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n      \n        \nYour E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n                      \n        \nComment\n        \n\n      \n                    \n                  \n      \nIn order to process your information we must ask you to enter the letters in the image into the box:\n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n\nplay audio version\n\n            .src = \u0027/securimage/securimage_show.php?\u0027 + Math.random return false\"\n\nReload Image\n\n          \n          \nVerify Code:\n          \n        \n      \n    \n                   \n          \n\n*\n Mandatory field - please complete\n          \n              \n      \n    \n  \n\n    \n  \n     \n        \n      \n        \nNews Search\n        \n          \n          \n        \n        \nsearch news, sport and features across all publications\n      \n    \n                      \n       .ready .click .hide          .attr + \u0027-menu\u0027.          .attr + \u0027-menu\u0027.          .attr + \u0027-menu\u0027.fadeIn          return false                .click .parents.fadeOut          return false                    */       ]]\n      \n                                                                                                                                        \n                      \n      \n        \n\nNorthern Constitution\n\n        \n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n          \n\nMagherafelt\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\n\n\n        \n          \n\nAntrim\n\n          \n\nBallymena\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\nThe Chronicle\n\n        \n          \n\nBallycastle\n\n          \n\nBallymoney\n\n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n                  \n                           username.focus            return false           else if              password.focus            return false           else                      ]]\n      \n      \"\n        \n          \nSubscriber Login\n          \n            \n              \nUsername:\n              \n            \n            \n              \nPassword:\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n          \n        \n      \n            \n               return false\" title=\"View The Leader online!\"\n\n\n                          \n\n\n            \n banner\" title=\"Advertise with Us\" /\n\n                      \n\n\n          \n  \n    \n    \n\u0026copy Copyright 2018 Alpha Newspaper Group\n    \n\n          ?

The Skoda man felt the format incurred unnecessary expense in terms of fuel costs.\n\u0026#8220The fuel isn\u0027t cheap and the cars run on it whether you are driving a stage or the road sections, said Bogie.

will be able to travel on-board the Glider vehicles during the last days of testing before the service goes live on Monday. \n\nShadow running will see both Glider and  vehicles operating along the Glider routes for three days. Glider services are on schedule to launch on Monday 3 September on cross-city routes between West and East Belfast  and the city centre to the Titanic Quarter .\n\nWith Monday being the day the schools go back after the summer holidays – which always leads to an increase in traffic – many drivers are bracing themselves for delays along the main arterial routes in West Belast.\n\nRobin Totten, Translink’s Glider Senior Project Manager said they are entering the final phase of testing which will see most of the infrastructure, vehicles and off-board ticketing systems tested by their passengers before they go live on Monday. \n\n“During this final week of testing, passengers travelling on the East – West route will be able to travel on Glider on Thursday 30th August with a valid ticket or Smartcard,” he explained.\n\n“ services will continue to run the scheduled timetable, with Glider ‘shadow running’ more infrequently along the route, calling at Glider halts. \n\n“Glider services during these three days will operate half-hourly from approximately 7am to 7pm. Passengers who have a valid ticket or validated Smartcard will be able to use either  or Glider, if waiting at one of the new Glider halts.\n\n“We have trained around 60 helpers from Volunteer Now, who will assist Translink staff at halts during this final phase to support passengers to get familiar with the exciting new service and ticketing system.  The volunteers will also be in place for the initial introduction of the service to boost passenger confidence and ensure a smooth transition to the new Glider service.\n\n“We have also completed over 150 public information and engagement events along the Glider routes, meeting many community groups, disability groups, businesses and local stakeholders to show them how to use the new services and ticketing, this will now be the an opportunity to try the service for themselves.\n\n‘‘We are delighted that communities and stakeholders right across the city see Glider as a positive development, and are enthusiastic about the introduction of this iconic new service and the benefits it will bring for the city.\n\nTranslink have also published ‘how to use’ guides and short videos on You Tube to help direct and make the service easy to use for passengers.

My disappointment about Chequers is it actually denies us a large part of that opportunity.”\n\nOn his successor Dominic Raab, he added: “He will do the best he can on the Chequers deal, but unfortunately the Chequers deal is not one which is going to be good enough for the UK.”\n\nMr Davis said he would “certainly not” support the People’s Vote adding: “The point about referenda is that they are once in a generation.”\n\nReferring to the Treasury, Dr Fox told the BBC: “Can you think back in all your time in politics where the Treasury have made predictions that were correct 15 years out, I can’t, they didn’t predict the financial crisis that happened, no-one could.\n\n“So this idea that we can predict what our borrowing would be 15 years in advance is just a bit hard to swallow.”\n\nHe added: “To say what a GDP figure would be 15 years ahead is not a predictive power that I’ve known the Treasury to have in my time in politics … I don’t believe it is possible to have a 15-year time horizon on predictions on GDP.”\n\n\n“I’m happy to see people in the Conservative party who believe what we believe” says International Trade Secretary \n@LiamFox\n speaking on \n@Arron_banks\n \n#marr\n \npic.twitter/y3rfNQeilI\n\n— The Andrew Marr Show  \nSeptember 2, 2018\n\n\n\n\nHe added: “I can’t imagine many things worse than remaining in the EU.\n\n“There’s a lot of talk about the leadership of the Conservative Party, changing the leader doesn’t change the parliamentary arithmetic.”\n\nAsked if Arron Banks was welcome to rejoin the Tory Party, Dr Fox said: “That’s up to individuals, are they willing to believe what we believe, if they do, they are welcome, the Conservative Party is a broad church.”\n\nIt was reported that the election strategist who helped Boris Johnson win the London mayoralty was involved in a bid to scupper the Cabinet’s Chequers compromise.\n\nSir Lynton Crosby, who also advised Mrs May in last year’s general election when the Tories lost their majority in a shock poll result, is manoeuvring to derail the PM’s EU withdrawal agenda with a co-ordinated national campaign, according to the Sunday Times.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"mays brexit trade proposals strongly criticised by michel barnier","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n

You cannot play with it by picking pieces. \n\n\"There is another reason why I strongly oppose the British proposal. There are services in every product. In your mobile phone, for example, it is 20 to 40% of the total value.\" \n\nMr Barnier also told EU car manufacturers they would have to use fewer British parts after Brexit in order to keep to tariff export rules. \n\nThe tough comments came as former Brexit secretary David Davis poured scorn on Mrs May\u0027s claim that she would not be \"pushed into accepting compromises on the Chequers proposals that are not in our national interest\" as that risked becoming an \"an incredible open sesame to all\". \n\nHe told BBC One\u0027s The Andrew Marr Show: \"In my view, the Chequers proposal ... is actually almost worse than being in. We will be under the rule of the EU with respect to all of our manufactured goods and agri-foods, that\u0027s a really serious concession, what about take back control, it doesn\u0027t work?\"\n"},{"url":null,"title":"former kincora boys home building on market for","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

We also sub-let offices to a range of tenants.\n\n\"In over 20 years, we had only one visitor who called and was fully aware of the history of the building as a boys\u0027 home.\n\n\"After 2010 we formulated plans to refurbish the building. \n\n\"However, in April 2015 these plans were thrown into the air by statements made by Mr Peter Robinson, then First Minister, calling for the building to be \u0027razed\u0027 more than 40 years after its period of notoriety.\"\n\nMr Black said that a series of protests followed and the new focus on the building led him to decide to put the redevelopment plans on hold.\n\n\"We no longer consider that retention of the existing building with the planned development is commercially attractive due to its history having been thrust back into the public eye.\n\n\"Consequently, we have decided to apply for planning permission for 12 apartments on the site and gauge interest from developers.\"\n\nNews of the sale came on the same day a law firm said Kincora should form part of official efforts to address the legacy of the Northern Ireland troubled past.\n\nKRW Law represents Richard Kerr, who alleges he was abused by \"very powerful people\" with links to Kincora and does not accept the conclusions of the four-year Historical Institutional Abuse  inquiry.\n\nThe inquiry dismissed claims that senior politicians, civil servants and businessmen were complicit in a paedophile ring that operated at the home in the 1970s and for which three staff members were jailed. \n\nPublishing the HIA findings in January, inquiry chairman Sir Anthony Hart said of Kincora: \"It was not a homosexual brothel, nor was it used by any of the security agencies as a honey pot to entrap, blackmail or otherwise exploit homosexuals.\"\n\nThe retired judge added: \"It is now time to finally lay these unfounded myths to rest.\"\n\nBut a statement from KRW said: \"On his  behalf, KRW is considering issuing legal proceedings over failings in the Kincora investigation by way of a judicial review.\n\n\"In addition to proposed legal proceedings, KRW will argue that the Kincora scandal must be considered as part of the legacy of the conflict.\"\n\nThe 2,299 sq ft property is listed by Frazer Kidd estate agents.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"karen bradley must call halt to groundhog day says uups swann","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC |

Well done to all involved!\"\n\nWith no confirmation of any talks so far, Alliance has urged other parties to get around the table this week.\n\nIn the absence of a local Executive, paralysis is growing in the political arena, with civil servants unable to sign off key decisions.\n\nThere have been calls from both the UUP and the DUP for the Government to make more decisions, but it refuses to do so.\n\nMr Swann said he was \"frustrated and angry\" at the current political impasse.\n\n\"The mutual public positioning and rhetoric from both  has meant that Northern Ireland ministers are missing while their Scottish and Welsh counterparts are at the table for Brexit discussions - which may suit them as they can avoid any responsibility,\" he said.\n\n\"But maybe it suits the Government as well - they have less hassle as they don\u0027t have a troublesome Northern Ireland voice at those tables and that is the real reason we see so little action from the Secretary of State.\n\n\"She needs to dispense with hesitancy and lay out plans for all-party talks regardless of the Brexit timetable or the RHI inquiry. Now that the politics of protest has returned to the DUP and Sinn Fein, those of us who still believe in the power of politics to deliver for the people of Northern Ireland are as equally frustrated and angry about the current situation.\n\n\"The almost perpetual cycle of it being a political groundhog day in Northern Ireland must be broken and the Secretary of State has the power to do that if she acts decisively.\"\n\nA Government spokesperson said: \"The Secretary of State shares the frustration of the people of Northern Ireland and is working on options to resolve the current impasse.\n\n\"The UK Government\u0027s priority is to secure a basis for political talks and re-establish a locally-elected, democratically-accountable devolved government at the earliest opportunity.\"\n"},{"url":null,"title":"northern ireland traffic alerts latest delays","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Here we look at what the restrictions will mean.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n– What is being banned?\n\n\nDrinks with more than 150mg of caffeine per litre, like Red Bull, Monster, and Relentless, will be affected.                    \n\nOne regular 250ml can of energy drink contains around 80mg of caffeine – equivalent to almost three cans of cola.\n\nMany popular energy drinks now come in 500ml cans.\n\nSales will be restricted to either over-16s or over-18s, depending on consultation responses.\n\n\n– What are the concerns?\n\n\nThere are fears children’s health and education are being harmed, with the drinks linked to behavioural issues and poor classroom discipline.\n\nMany also have very high amounts of sugar, contributing to tooth decay and obesity.\n\nStudies have shown regularly consuming large quantities of caffeine can result in increased blood pressure, sleep disturbances, headaches and stomachaches.\n\nCampaigners have also criticised how much children can get their hands on with just pocket money, with four cans of generic 250ml energy drink available for as little as £1.\n\n\n– Why is it relevant to Britain?\n\n\nBritish children consume energy drinks way above the European average, contributing to emotional difficulties and tiredness, public health minister Steve Brine has said.\n\nNearly 70% of UK children aged 10 to 17 years old consume energy drinks, according to the Government’s childhood obesity plan.\n\nAnd those who do so are drinking on average 50% more than the EU average for that age group.\n\nJenny Oldroyd, deputy director for obesity, food and nutrition at the Department of Health and Social Care, has previously warned: “Around a quarter of adolescents are consuming more than three energy drinks in one sitting, so it’s that high level of consumption that concerns us.”\n\n\n– Why has the issue gained prominence?\n\n\nA boom in the energy drinks market, high-profile calls from figures such as TV chef Jamie Oliver, and the relatively low cost of some types compared with general soft drinks.\n\nWhile many major retailers already do not sell to under-16s, just 21% of the UK grocery market, including corner shops, are signed up to voluntary restrictions, No 10 said.\n\nUK energy drink sales jumped by around one-fifth  between 2012 and 2017, with total sales estimated at £1.65 billion last year, according to analysis from market researchers Mintel.\n\nA further 10% growth for the energy drinks market is expected for 2017-22, it added.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"revealed how much dentists earn in northern

There have been some enlightening appearances, but much of it has been too heavy on technical detail to command the public\u0027s attention.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.push\n\n\nThe fire on cash-for-ash hasn\u0027t quite gone out, but the flames have burned a lot less brightly. Well, all that\u0027s about to change.\n\nFormer DUP minister Jonathan Bell will give evidence to the inquiry on Thursday and Friday. It was Mr Bell\u0027s explosive claims against Arlene Foster and party advisers in December 2016 which turned up the temperature on the scandal.\n\nEither very courageously or mischievously - depending on who you believe - he broke ranks to speak to BBC broadcaster Stephen Nolan and call for a judge-led public inquiry into RHI.\n\nThis week, the very inquiry he called for will scrutinise his claims. It will not be an occasion for broad brush strokes. Mr Bell will be asked in minute detail about his allegations.\n\nQuestioning will focus on the former Enterprise Minister\u0027s claim that two senior DUP figures \"were not allowing this scheme to be closed\" as costs spiralled out of control in autumn 2015.\n\nThe men at the centre of the allegations are Timothy Johnston, who was then the special adviser to First Minister Peter Robinson, and is now the DUP\u0027s powerful chief executive and Dr Andrew Crawford, an adviser to the then Finance Minister Mrs Foster.\n\nMr Bell claimed they secretly tried to \"cleanse the record\" of references to her. The alleged attempts to alter papers were made \"without my knowledge, without my consent\" and an email trail exists to prove his claim, he told the BBC.\n\nBoth Mr Johnston and Dr Crawford deny the allegations.\n\nDr Crawford, who appeared before the inquiry earlier this year, will return to give evidence on September 13 and 14. He resigned at the height of the cash-for-ash scandal but remains employed by the DUP.\n\nMr Bell will also be grilled at the inquiry this week over what he has described as a very stormy meeting with Mrs Foster early in 2016.\n\n\"I was ordered to appear in front of the First Minister ... in the strongest terms both in volume and in force, Arlene Foster as First Minister overruled me and told me to keep the scheme open,\" he told Mr Nolan.\n\n\"She was highly agitated and angry because I had been refusing the whole way for the last period and telling them I wasn\u0027t going to do this.\"\n\nHe claimed there was a \"hostile\" atmosphere of \"fear\" and added: \"She  walking in and shouted at me that I would keep this scheme open.\"\n\nMrs Foster has strenuously denied Mr Bell\u0027s allegations and has accused him of making them to mask his own alleged failings over RHI.\n\nShe has said that he was the one acting aggressively in the meeting, something she claimed was a character trait - \"plenty of people know what Jonathan Bell is like\".\n\nMrs Foster said she had a witness to prove \"how he spoke\" to her. She added: \"He used his physical bulk to stand over me in quite an aggressive way.\"\n\nThese completely clashing accounts of what happened will be examined by the inquiry. The DUP leader is expected to return to give evidence later this month.\n\nAnother key event under scrutiny when Mr Bell appears this week will be a blazing row he had with his special adviser Timothy Cairns in June 2015.\n\nIt began over dinner in a London curry house and continued over breakfast the next morning, ahead of a key meeting with then Energy Minister Amber Rudd.\n\nThe argument was in part about Mr Bell\u0027s ability to take decisions on his own without consulting others in the DUP. It ended with the Enterprise Minister telling Mr Cairns he wouldn\u0027t be attending the meeting with Ms Rudd. The special adviser took an early flight back to Belfast.\n\nMr Cairns is himself due to appear the following week before the inquiry led by retired judge Sir Patrick Coghlin.\n\nThe inquiry is expected to hear of the very difficult relationship between Mr Bell and his special adviser.\n\nFormer Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment permanent secretary Andrew McCormick will be the first witness called after the inquiry\u0027s summer break.\n\nHe will give evidence on Tuesday and Wednesday. But it will be Mr Bell that all eyes will focus this week.\n\n\"I have had to do one of the most difficult things in my life tell the Northern Ireland public the truth and shine a light and deal with a major problem,\" he said in his extraordinary BBC interview.\n\n\"The facts are documents, emails, times and dates. You will not find one single thing that is not the truth. I have done my duty.\n\n\"God does not punish people for telling the truth. Let\u0027s see how it plays out.\"\n\nIt will be a riveting watch on Thursday.\n\nThe five things that we have learnt so far... \n\n1. Arlene Foster didn’t read the legislation which set up the RHI scheme. Asked if she had read the regulations when she brought them to Stormont in 2012 as Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment Minister, she said: “No, I don’t believe I would have read them at that stage. I probably would have only read the explanatory note, but not the regulations involved.”\n\nUnder questioning, she said with hindsight “one wishes one had asked more questions”.\n\n2. The DUP leader feels she doesn’t bear personal responsibility for the scheme, even though it was set up on her watch as minister. “I didn’t do anything wrong,” she said. The way the scheme ended up was “a matter of deep regret for me politically and personally”, she stated, but it was “difficult to see what I could have done differently at that time”.\n\n3. Mrs Foster’s special adviser Dr Andrew Crawford told a relative that the lucrative RHI subsidy would soon be ending. He sent his cousin Richard Crawford, a poultry farmer, an internal document which had not yet been released to the public. He told the inquiry that was “wrong” and apologised for it.\n\n4. Dr Crawford also leaked a confidential legal letter to the lobbyist son of former first minister Peter Robinson. He sent the correspondence — linked to a controversial planning case involving a John Lewis store at Sprucefield — to Gareth Robinson, whom he admitted giving preferential treatment to over other lobbyists.\n\n5. The head of Northern Ireland’s civil service David Sterling said some Stormont meetings were not minuted as it was “safer” not to have a record which might be released following a Freedom of Information request. He said the DUP and Sinn Fein were very “sensitive to criticism” so senior civil servants “got into the habit of not recording all meetings”.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"former psni deputy harris takes up his new role as garda chief","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

The expanding gas is forced upward, creating the large ‘cloud’.\n\n“In this case, the innermost of the three plastic vessels shattered and the force of the reaction between the liquid nitrogen and hot water propelled it upward.\n\n“The middle vessel also broke but remained contained in the larger white vessel that surrounded the inner two vessels.”\n\nBass, who said the museum had done the experiment “dozens if not hundreds of times”, added that the outer vessel was there as a safety measure to protect visitors and that it “worked just as it was supposed to, absorbing the shock and directing everything upward”.\n\nThe incident didn’t seem to diminish the enjoyment of the visitors in attendance one bit.\n\nSara, who was there with her husband, said: “People were having a good time and enjoyed the show. I didn’t get the indication that anyone was hurt or afraid by any means.\n\n“The Museum of Discovery is supported and adored by the locals.”\n\nAs for why the inner container shattered, Bass said it was down to “thermal shock”.\n\nBass added: “We believe the innermost trash can failed due to thermal shock from the liquid nitrogen sitting in the bottom end of that vessel while our educators donned their safety gear.\n\n“The best news here is that the precautions with the demo protected the museum guests and no-one was injured.”\n\nHe said that the museum would review its safety protocols and “share this experience with other science museums here in Arkansas and nationwide”.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"watch the moment an evasive duck stopped play at an la galaxy game","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

forced to wait six and seven months to have their applications processed by the Housing Executive.\n\nA local councillor has explained how one woman living in the city has been waiting since March, during which time she suffered a ‘suspected heart attack’ due to fraught living conditions, and there is still no timeline in place for when points will be allocated.\n\nUnder the Housing Selection Scheme people are prioritised in terms of points, which are awarded for ious reasons such as having dependent children or having an overcrowded house.\nThe final bracket of points is for those deemed to have ‘complex needs’.\n\nThis falls under the health and social wellbeing category and incorporates people experiencing domestic violence, those who have been threatened or have serious health difficulties.\nThese applications have to be regulated and verified by the PSNI or other statutory services.\n\nIndependent Councillor Darren O’Reilly said it is leaving the ‘most vulnerable’ people at risk.\n\n“A lot of these people are going through intimidation in their homes. \n\n“These are people who can’t stay in their own home due to intimidation and health implications, people I’ve dealt with who have come from Apex and Habinteg are having to wait six or seven months. One lady I’m dealing with who is looking for a house in the Waterside sent her application at the start of March.\n\n“Since then her situation has gotten worse as she was taken into hospital with a suspected heart attack brought on by the pressures of living in the environment she’s in. More evidence has to be sent, and neither the first or second part of the application have been looked at.\n\n“She has been told by NIHE that they don’t know when the points will be added and these points are the difference between her getting housed and not.”\n\nHe said the Housing Executive is in desperate need of more resources as two or three people are having to work through a ‘heavy case load’.\n\n“There seems to be a backlog with all these cases lying on somebody’s desk and this has to be cleared. That is then impacting the most vulnerable people here in Derry.”\n\n\n\n        googletag.cmd.push                 .addSize                .addSize                .build            slot = googletag.defineSlot                .defineSizeMapping                                                            .setTargeting                                            .setTargeting                                            .setTargeting                                                    .addService            googletag.display            googletag.pubads.refresh            \n\n\n\nThe NIHE website states in special circumstances applicants may have needs which mean they require intensive care and support. \n\n“This need may be met in a specialist housing scheme,” it states. “Where additional support or care services are provided or in general housing where a tailored support and care package has been arranged.\n\n“A detailed assessment of support and care needs will be carried out where necessary. Where a specialist scheme is considered appropriate, applicants will be placed on a separate, non-pointed waiting list.\n\n“Where support and care can be provided within general housing, applicants may be awarded additional points under the health and social wellbeing category.”\n\nHowever, there have been issues processing applications in a timely manner which occurs when the Housing Executive has to manage cases from other Housing Associations or referrals from a Health and Social Care Trust which have to be assessed at its Regional Office.\n\nA spokesperson for the Housing Executive acknowledged that it has been experiencing ‘temporary’ delays in assessing complex needs cases.\n\nShe commented: “The Housing Executive manages applications for social housing under the Housing Selection Scheme.\n\n“The vast majority of applications and transfer applications are assessed by our local office staff with no delay. However, there are a limited number of cases that require applicants with intense care and/or support needs – complex needs – to be assessed by Regional Office staff. This includes transfer applications from housing associations identified as requiring complex needs assessment, as well as direct referrals from the Health and Social Services Trusts.\n\n“It is difficult to determine timescales as there may be several agencies or departments that we must consult during the assessment process.\n\n“The Housing Executive can confirm that we are experiencing a temporary delay in assessing complex needs cases in our North Region office. We apologise this may be causing distress to some applicants, and are working to have this resolved as quickly as possible.”\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"newtown all the pictures from the get newtown moving event","story":"\nGet Newtown Moving last Saturday 18th August, 2018..Pictured are Newtown Rocks!

Following the failure of management to respond to this offer, the unions have been left with no choice but to proceed to a consultative ballot on industrial action.\u0026nbsp\n\n\u0026ldquoThis is a historic mark of shame for the council as this is the first time that all four unions representing the workforce have jointly balloted for action.\n\nIn a statement issued yesterday the council said that it was disappointed to learn that the trade unions had issued the press statement without giving pre-notice.\n\nIt says: \u0026ldquoThe statement issued by the Joint Trade Union Side came as a surprise, not least because the council had been in discussions with the unions up until Friday, August 24, where it was agreed by both sides that a meeting would take place on September 3, to be chaired by the Labour Relations Agency.\n\n\u0026ldquoWe were disappointed then to see the unions issue a pre-emptive statement on Bank Holiday Monday that we were given no notice of, nor were we contacted to respond to its contents.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\n\n\u0026ldquoTrade Union representatives have been part of the job matching process for every post, except one where they declined the invitation to take part.

Such was the demand that people were even contacting me on Saturday night to see if we had any spare tickets, he said.\n\nLocal priests who attended the mass were Fr Gerry McCloskey from Ardglass and Fr Brian Brown of St Patrick\u0026rsquos in Ballynahinch.\n\nChurch of Ireland Dean Henry Hull from Down Cathedral travelled on the coaches with the pilgrims and tweeted after his experience \u0026mdash \u0026ldquoSafely home after a very blessed and uplifting day in Dublin #PapalVisit.\n\nDespite the visit being viewed a difficult one as Pope Francis was being called upon to address the many instances of institutional abuse and clerical sexual abuse of children and women in the island\u0026rsquos recent history, parishioners were still excited to see and eager to listen to the words of their spiritual leader.\n\nDownpatrick man Jackie Breen, who attends St Patrick\u0026rsquos Church, says that the experience of seeing his spiritual leader will stay with him for a lifetime.\n\nHe made sure to make the visit special for his family by personally attending the earlier Festival of Families events on Thursday and Friday, attending the Croke Park concert with his wife Tracey and daughter Lucy and then the Phoenix Park mass on Sunday with his son Dylan.\n\n\u0026ldquoPope John Paul gave us the blessing of peace in Ireland when he spoke here and that was also\u0026nbsp seen in Europe a few years later and I believe that Pope Francis has left us with the special blessing of hope and healing in his visit, said Mr Breen.\n\n\u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a message of hope and healing not just for Catholics but for all Christians.\n\nHe added that the entire Festival of Families and the Pope\u0026rsquos words helped to underline how crucial the role that families have in global society.\n\nMcCartan Digney , says that he felt very emotional about the entire experience.\n\nHe travelled with his mother Louise to Phoenix Park and proudly carried the yellow and white Papal flag that she had when she went to see Pope John Paul at the youth Mass in Galway.\n\n\u0026ldquoEver since I watched a TV documentary about nine years on the 30th anniversary of Pope John Paul\u0026rsquos visit, I\u0026rsquove wanted to see our Holy Father myself and kept the flag for my chance and I couldn\u0026rsquot believe that I got the chance to do so, he said.\n\n\u0026ldquoIt was very emotional from all the singing and the long walk there. There were tears of joy and tears of sadness\u0026nbsp when Pope Francis acknowledged for the first time the hurt that has been done, but it really needed to be said and it was good to hear the words from the head of our church.\n\nFor Mark Ferris from Drumaness and his partner Kathleen Oliver, their attendance in Dublin during the entire Papal visit was the highlight of a very religious week.\n\nEarlier in the week while holidaying in Portugal, the couple visited the Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima.\n\nMr Ferris was a boy of eight when he last saw a serving pope in Ireland when Pope John Paul II visited in 1979.\n\nHowever, he watched the mass at Drogheda, estimated to have nearly attracted 1.3m people, on the television at home with his family.\n\nFor this visit, Mr Ferris says he was determined not to miss out.\n\n\u0026ldquoMy partner had arranged for us to go to Dublin for the Pope\u0026rsquos visit as a birthday celebration but I would have been there no matter what.\n\n\u0026ldquoThis experience was something that I would never will forget and well worth the blisters I have on my feet in walking the five or six miles to Phoenix Park.\u0026nbsp\n\n\u0026ldquoWhen the Pope did his tour of Dublin, we were really close when he pass by and I believe he looked directly at me.\n\n\u0026ldquoThe concert was absolutely brilliant as was the Mass and we really enjoyed the entire weekend.\n\nSouth Down MLA Colin McGrath also attended Sunday\u0026rsquos Papal Mass.\n\nWhile he represented the SDLP along with deputy Nicola Mallon, he travelled down as part of the Downpatrick and Lecale parish group.\n\nHe said that the event was notable for the number of young people who attended.\n\n\u0026ldquoThe atmosphere was electric and it was a special moment when the Pope arrived.\n\n\u0026ldquoThe overall theme of his visit was obviously \u0026lsquofamilies\u0026rsquo and it was great to see so many families there together too. There was a great connection amongst the Downpatrick Parish group with over 200 travelling together. \n\nHe added: \u0026ldquoPope Francis also sent a special message of forgiveness and healing for the Church\u0026rsquos involvement in difficult matters in the past which was important too.\n\n\u0026ldquoAll together, it was a fabulous event which will be remembered for a generation.\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t.ready.prettyPhoto\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n"}]
