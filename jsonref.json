You have an intention set to really do something to change the world, and you have to keep it up. \u0027It makes me so emotional. You\u0027re doing really, really good work and I\u0027m so happy that we\u0027re here. We give you our full support.\u0027 The couple\u0027s \u0027surprise\u0027 appearance at the school on Friday turned out to be the worst-kept secret on campus.As Gladys Berejiklian, the Premier of New South Wales, teased them about being overexcited to see her, the teenagers fizzed with anticipation until the Duke and Duchess were finally introduced. Then, cheers and excited screams filled the air as they walked outside to meet the well-behaved girls, who had been sitting neatly for assembly. Invited to sit on a park bench in the centre, the couple watched a ballet-inspired dance performance from students to the song \u0027Power of Love\u0027 before heading inside for the workshops.           The program aims to unite young people from erse communities to be \u0027advocates for positive change in their communities\u0027          Invited to sit on a park bench, the couple watched a ballet-inspired performance from students to the song \u0027Power of Love\u0027The couple earlier went to Bondi Beach, one of Australia\u0027s most famous landmarks, to meet a local community surfing group known as One Wave.It was founded by Grant Trebilco who suffered from mental health issues for a decade but felt unable to talk about them.He was eventually diagnosed as being bi-polar and hospitalised.When he came out, he said surfing was \u0027his saviour\u0027 and he finally felt able to open up to his closest friends, who were incredibly sympathetic to him and also shared issues of their own.He has now created \u0027Fluro Fridays\u0027 where people dress up in fluorescent clothes and go to the beach, with the aim of fostering an atmosphere where others can open up about their own mental health issues. Harry and Meghan, who was wearing a sleeveless Martin Grant dress with espadrille tie wedges, were both given brightly-coloured \u0027leis\u0027 - garlands of flowers - to put round their necks in order to enter into the spirit of things.Accompanied by Trebilco, they kicked off their shoes on the edge of the beach and walked barefoot to sit in a group with some of the colourfully-dressed surfers.          Among others, Meghan spoke to fellow expectant mother Charlotte, who is pictured with her two-year-old son Finn          Meghan shared with a group of yoga performers she does yoga to stay grounded, while Harry prefers to talk openly          Harry revealed her prefers informal chats about mental illness, hoping to reduce the stigma around them          The  couple met with members of a local surfing community called One Wave, which aims to raise awareness for mental health          The community group One Wave aims to raise awareness of mental health and wellbeing, saying it\u0027s a strength to ask for help    The couple spent around ten minutes listening to the experiences of other members of the group and sharing their own           Meghan told them yoga helps ground her and that she tries to find the time to make it part of her daily routine          One Wave founder Grant Trebilco said the couple\u0027s openness about mental health will help people across the globeTrebilco, 37, of Bondi, said the couple\u0027s openness about mental health would help people around the world.\u0027To have the Duke and Duchess down at Fluro Friday helped make mental health visible around the world,\u0027 he said.\u0027And it let people know that mental health doesn\u0027t descriminate.\u0027One thing that really stood out for me was that Prince Harry said asking for help is not a sign of weakness.\u0027It\u0027s a sign of strength.\u0027Mental health is invisible. You can\u0027t see when people are struggling.\u0027Wearing the bright flouro helps start conversations that never usually happen around mental health\u0027It reduces that barrier.\u0027Those bright colours show we can make it visible and we don\u0027t have to go through it alone.\u0027    The couple donned floral leis as they met surfing and yoga members of the community          Members of the sharing group said the royal couple were relatable, open and honestDabriella Quayle, 37, said afterwards: ‘Oh my goodness, they were just so real, so relatable. They shared their own experiences, which was amazing.\u0027Harry said seeking help was the best thing he had ever done. He was really open and honest. He said it doesn\u0027t matter who you open up to, they don\u0027t have to be professional. Anyone can be there for you. It could be your best mate or a stranger. You just need to open up to them.\u0027She added: \u0027They talked about the strangeness of their own situation and the lives they lead but that at the end of the day they are just real people. They are just human beings.\u0027They said they were just like us in that people say lots of positive things to you and then they say one negative thing, and that\u0027s what gets you down.\u0027Meghan said how she did yoga at 4.30 this morning because of the jet lag. She says she is feeling OK, not too bad. They said they hadn\u0027t really had time to settle down and get their heads round thing, and they have another 70 odd engagements to go.\u0027          One member of One Wave said Meghan had a \u0027double whammy\u0027 of jet lag due to her pregnancy          Meghan revealed she had been up at 4.30am that morning practicing yoga when she couldn\u0027t get back to sleep           Meghan said yoga was her \u0027leveller\u0027, with the couple still having another 70 odd engagements to goAfter the circle the royals walked over to a group practising yoga. Nio Poniatowski, 25, said: \u0027Meghan said it was her leveller, it\u0027s what keeps her grounded, like surfing does for us. She said it was her escape.\u0027Chatting with another group of surfers, Harry said he had never waxed a board before, so he and Meghan both had a go.Surf instructor Sam Schumacher, 31, said the couple both revealed they had surfed, adding: \u0027The circle time was great. Two or three of us shared our personal stories.\u0027This visit will really raise the profile of what we are trying to do and the fact that mental health doesn\u0027t discriminate. \u0027It can affect anyone and that we all need to try and look after each other. \u0027I can see the passion in their eyes.\u0027Trebilco said the couple had been \u0027so nice, so friendly\u0027.          One member of the circle said he could \u0027see the passion\u0027 for awareness of mental health in the couples\u0027 eyes          Chatting with another group of surfers, Harry said he had never waxed a board before, so he and Meghan both had a go          The royal couple pictured with garlands of flowers, or \u0027leis\u0027, dangling around their necks as they walk through the sand          Thousands of well-wishers came out to Sydney\u0027s iconic Bondi Beach to see the royal couple on Friday morningStuart Klees, 34, of Bondi, said: \u0027Harry shared his views on mental health towards everyone.\u0027\u0027He\u0027s a big believer in normalising the conversation around mental health.\u0027He feels fortunate that he\u0027s in a position to get the right people together to spread that message.\u0027He\u0027s a big supporter of small community groups like One Wave.\u0027Prince Harry talked to the group about his own issues with mental health.\u0027He said he\u0027s seen a couple of counsellors before and never found one that suits him,\u0027 Klees said.\u0027He\u0027s a big believer in having normal conversations with normal people.\u0027He was pretty genuine, real honest, real open, real relaxed.\u0027He wasn\u0027t trying to put on a show. He was really genuine in the way he came across.\u0027As she left, Meghan told the group that she was \u0027loving\u0027 her first experience of Australia. \u0027It is so great to be here,\u0027 she said."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/10/21/05/517FFF5800000578-0-image-m-28_1540094925820.jpg","title":"Karlie Kloss Joshua Kushner married","story":"Say \u0026#39I do\u0026#39 in a beautiful Dior wedding dress like KarlieGet the look belowSupermodel Karlie Kloss revealed on Instagram that she\u0026#39s tied the knot with her beau Joshua Kushner!The beautiful bride chose a stunning wedding gown by Dior, featuring a fitted bodice with long-sleeved lace overlay and a full skirt.

I love the smoky, sophisticated atmosphere of the image. This feels very right for now — escapist and sensual...

It\u0027s definitely NOT fair,\u0027 Wagner-Assali tweeted October 15. Since then, McKinnon has taken to Twitter to defend the validity of her win, while being targeted by trolls and other who believe that she has no business competing against women since she was assigned male at birth.  In a tweet Saturday, McKinnon answered the question of \u0027Why do you race with women?\u0027\u00271. I am a woman. 2. Every single piece of identification I have, including birth certificate, says \u0027F\u0027 on it. 3.

We are all born babies.

But you don\u0027t even say that there is NO question whether I meet the criteria. So why name me if you don\u0027t take a stand? This is a bizarre press release. Poorly worded, too,\u0027 she wrote. \u0027Trans women are not Men-Women. What do you think that even means? To you mean \u0027male-to-female\u0027? Even that\u0027s not great. Also, what purpose does this serve? Supportive? Not?\u0027 McKinnon asked.           Before Wagner-Assali\u0027s tweet, McKinnon had celebrated her win as the first transgender female world champion          McKinnon took on trolls, stating that second-place finisher Carolien van Herrikhuyzen was her friend. Van Herrikhuyzen herself said that it was an \u0027honest\u0027 race and that Wagner-Assali should not have taken part if she had a problem with the rulesFinally, she tweeted, \u0027The backlash against my @UCI_cycling world championship victory is unprecedented in its size and the level of vitriol. Trans athletes are worried, but This is what happens before the breaking point. Have faith. We\u0027ll get there #SportIsAHumanRight\u0027 Following the backlash against her original tweet, Texas-based UCI Masters Track World Championship bronze medalist Jen Wagner-Assali issued an apology of sorts for her public comment that garnered lots of attention.\u0027After having some time to reflect, I realize my twitter comments earlier this week unintentionally fanned the flames on a controversial situation, and that I regret,\u0027 she wrote Thursday. \u0027I made the comments out of a feeling of frustration, but they weren\u0027t productive or positive.\u0027  \u0027They were just inflammatory, and that\u0027s not who I want to be or am. While I may not agree with the rules, when I pin on a number I agree to race by them. I also respect @rachelvmckinnon \u0027s right to compete within the rules.\u0027However Wagner-Assali\u0027s comments seemed to take an insensitive turn as she reinforced her opinion that McKinnon is not female.She seemed to suggest having the winner take part in the race was akin to having a man compete and contradicted her harsh stance by then seemingly stating she needed to learn from her earlier reaction which did not go down well with those who support the trans community.\u0027I\u0027m sure there are men who don\u0027t agree with the USA cycling rule that women can enter their races, which I do all the time,\u0027 she wrote on the micro-blogging site. \u0027I appreciate those that have reached out to support me, but please stop directing hateful or derogatory comments toward Rachel or trans people in general.          Days later, Wagner-Assali tweeted out an apology of sorts for her original statement, while simultaneously stating that she wanted the sport rules changed          McKinnon hit back by saying Wagner was only sorry she was caught out in public\u0027At the end of the day, we are all just people trying to find our way in this world. I\u0027m going to continue educating myself and hope this conversation continues in an open and positive way.\u0027 Wagner-Assali\u0027s last tweet was, \u0027For those of you who think I have \u0027folded\u0027 I have not. There\u0027s a group of us working on getting the rules changed but we are going to fight it offline, not in the name-calling angry world of social media. I\u0027m choosing to move on in a positive way.\u0027   McKinnon retweeted this last tweet and added the comment that, \u0027This is why the apology is not accepted: she still thinks what she said. She merely apologizes for being caught saying it publicly. She wants to ban trans women from competing.

He has denied stories claiming that Doria revealed the news to him before the official announcement. She is understood to be planning to move to Britain to help care for the baby.Mr Markle refuses to say anything negative about his daughter and Prince Harry, and said he was only speaking out publicly in the hope it would alleviate some of the intense media scrutiny that continues around him. He says: ‘I have seven cars outside my house with reporters and photographers in them – it’s a gross invasion of my privacy.’It may strike some as unnecessarily cruel and unkind that Meghan’s mother was included in the official statement while her father was left to find out along with the rest of the world, given the controversy that has surrounded Mr Markle .He became estranged from Meghan days before the Royal Wedding in May after hanging up on Prince Harry – the prince had called to chastise him for co-operating with paparazzi pictures which showed, among other things, Mr Markle being ‘fitted’ for a wedding suit.Then he was unable to walk his daughter down the aisle at St George’s Chapel, Windsor, after suffering two heart attacks. In an interview with this newspaper – one of only three he has given – Mr Markle apologised for his lack of judgment in co-operating with the paparazzi.     Dad and daughter on a family outingIt was, he said, a misguided attempt to improve his image after being hounded as he went about his daily business.Mr Markle is yet to meet his son-in-law.But he said: ‘I don’t want anyone to feel sorry for me. Me not getting a call is most likely a misunderstanding about my two back-to-back heart attacks and me missing the wedding.‘There has been so much misinformation and lies that perhaps made them mistrust me.’But he congratulated the couple and said his daughter would be a wonderful mother.‘I wasn’t surprised by the baby announcement. Meghan loves children and she and Harry have been talking about wanting a family from the start. I’m delighted for them both.‘She’s always been wonderful with children and most of her friends have families so she’s used to being around kids. She will make a fantastic mother.’Mr Markle added he was ‘full of pride’ for the way his daughter was handling her first overseas tour, saying: ‘She’s doing so well winning the hearts and minds of everyone in Australia.’After the news of Meghan’s pregnancy, Mr Markle is clearly revelling in his happy memories of the little girl he affectionately called ‘Meggie’ and ‘Bean’. He says some of his happiest times with Meghan as a baby were the ‘quiet’ moments they spent together.Mr Markle was 37 when Meghan was born and was already a highly successful Emmy award-winning Hollywood lighting director, working on the top-rated TV soap General Hospital.He and Doria, who is 12 years his junior, raised their daughter in the affluent Los Angeles suburb of Woodland Hills.With a heavy work schedule, Mr Markle relished his time with Meghan. He said: ‘My greatest joy was coming home from work, picking her up and just walking back and forth with her in the kitchen. Holding her in my arms. She would listen to the hum of the refrigerator and it would lull her to sleep.‘My other favourite memory is of walking outside with her in the garden and I would point up at the moon and say, “That’s Meggie’s moon.” I did that for so long that eventually she was able to look up, point and say, “Meggie’s moon.” ’    Mr Markle and reporter Caroline in Mexico Although Mr Markle split with Ms Ragland when Meghan was three, he remained closely involved in his daughter’s upbringing.‘I would see her all the time. I had her every weekend. We lived close and Meghan went between the two homes very happily.’Meghan lived full-time with her father from the age of 12 until she was 18.He said: ‘I would take her to school every morning because it was on my way to work at the studio. If I could, I would pick her up in the afternoon or I’d send a limo or one of the crew to pick her up and bring her to the set.’Suits actress Meghan, 37, has spoken in the past about how her father instilled in her a love of acting and showbusiness.In one touching Father’s Day post on Instagram, which was taken down after she met Prince Harry, she posted a picture of herself as a baby laying on her father’s chest and wrote: ‘To this day your hugs are still the very best in the whole wide world. \u0027Thanks for my work ethic, my love of Busby Berkeley films \u0026amp club sandwiches, for teaching me the importance of handwritten thank you notes, and for giving me that signature Markle nose. I love you xo – Bean.’Mr Markle, who retired to Mexico six years ago, said: ‘I love my daughter and always will. She will be a great mum. I wish her and Harry nothing but the best.’Mr Markle neither asked for nor received any payment for this interview."},{"url":null,"title":"Our fathers health bear isolation Meghans sister Samantha pleads letter","story":"    Samantha Markle Visits Kensington Palace to hand a letter over to her half sister, Meghan MarkleThe photograph of her handing it over was published in newspapers and magazines around the world but the contents of the letter were not known – until now.Addressed to ‘Dear Duchess Meghan’, the emotional two-page letter in elegant script implores Meghan to heal the rift with their father Thomas, 74, who has had two heart attacks and is in poor health.Meghan and Harry attend glamorous private Invictus reception...Thomas Markle: When I heard my daughter Meghan\u0027s baby news...Share this articleSamantha was born to Thomas’s first wife Rosalyn.

What is most critical here, is the fact that Dad suffered a real heart attack, not just once but twice                         Revealing the contents of the letter exclusively to The Mail on Sunday last night, Samantha explained: ‘I know Meghan and I know she has a kind heart.‘Her rift with our father makes no sense at all.‘The Palace spin doctors have put out that Meghan feels she can’t trust Dad because of all the stories that have been written about him but Meghan should know better.‘Because of my illness, my hands don’t work so I wrote the letter on my computer in an elegant script. Meghan is into calligraphy and I wanted to send her something beautiful and from the heart.          A photograph posted on Twitter by Meghan\u0027s half sister Samantha (left) shows them in happier times‘Now that she is about to become a parent herself I was hoping this letter would cut through all the misconception and explain to her the hurt and isolation the family felt.’The letter implores Meghan not to believe reports suggesting Thomas faked having a heart attack to avoid walking his daughter down the aisle because he was embarrassed about colluding with paparazzi pictures before the wedding.Samantha writes: ‘What is most critical here is the fact that Dad suffered a real heart attack, not just once but twice, as a result of the stress from all of the misperception, the breakdown in communication with you and his being forced to be reclusive and inactive to avoid the limelight.                            I know he loves you very much and has made several attempts to reach out to you... I don\u0027t believe that his health can bear this isolation on a continual basis                         ‘His attempt to avoid the tension created just the opposite… he loves you very much and has made several attempts to reach out to you both privately and publicly at his fragile age of 74.‘I don’t believe that his health can bear this isolation on a continual basis. He has been loving and self-sacrificing to you over your whole life, even raising you on his own for a significantly large part of it.’The letter criticises the way Mr Markle was left to fend for himself at his home in Mexico when news of Meghan’s relationship and subsequent engagement to Prince Harry became public.While Meghan’s mother Doria was given support – at one point representatives from the British Consulate in LA were photographed visiting her house – Samantha says their father was ‘hung out to dry’ and given no guidance, security protection or advice on how to deal with the ‘deluge’ of attention.                             You know you were not raised as an only child... and this family is and always was supportive of you even though we have said some unfavorable things clumsily...                         ‘He should have been able to speak directly with his daughter,’ she writes, while imploring her sister to have ‘a broader understanding of these very unique circumstances’.‘You have been wished well and supported (by us) from afar throughout all of this, even though we expressed frustration at times. And so much did not make sense.’The letter continues: ‘You know you were not raised as an only child, contrary to public attempts at painting the picture this way, and this family is and always was supportive of you, even though we have said some unfavorable things clumsily, out of self-defense and hurt feelings… and only as a last resort.

Dressed in a T-shirt, jeans and socks, he seems utterly unruffled.          But a brief look at high street shelves reveals that the crudest examples are the work of one man, Dean MorrisIt turns out that the fine arts graduate is a fan of gardening and National Trust properties.

I think even my detractors would approve of these.’Harry shares his and Meghan\u0027s \u0027personal joy\u0027 of forthcoming...Share this articleBut Mr Morris is also a man with a sharp appreciation of the balance sheet. And, as he puts it, whatever his personal tastes and background: ‘Smut, filth and swearing does sell cards.’It certainly does, which is why The Mail on Sunday wanted to ask Mr Morris about the tide of obscenity infecting many high street card shops. Does he think it’s right to force that language down the throats of families looking to send a simple ‘thank you’ card? And what does he think of the effect on children of such crude sexual terminology?Mr Morris is not prepared to answer these and other questions right now, he tells us, commenting only that, ‘I wouldn’t have a business if my cards didn’t sell’, before ushering us out with a cheery goodbye.  It turns out that the fine arts graduate is a fan of gardening and National Trust properties, and he doesn’t particularly like the cards he producesCard design is essentially a cottage industry fed by hundreds of one-man bands. A single design might earn just £150 from chains that make a 100 per cent mark-up, but it certainly seems to pay well for the prolific Mr Morris, whose company, Dean Morris Cards Ltd, is sitting on a cash pile of £236,000, according to its published accounts.He can certainly afford to be a regular visitor to New York with his husband, a masseur, describing it as his favourite city. Not bad for scribbling ‘F***’ and ‘b******s’ on a folded piece of cardboard.A designer since 1999, Mr Morris gained a foothold in the industry with the help of the Prince’s Trust.Two decades on, he spends his days dreaming up mottos that are cruder and crasser than anything seen before. In this arms race of bad taste, nothing is off-limits.There is no need to bother with anything so laborious as innuendo or the double entendres so beloved by fans of the saucy seaside postcards of Donald McGill. A single entendre will do.Mr Morris’s stock in trade is to juxtapose filthy language with images mined from the 1950s and 1960s, of smartly dressed men and smiling ‘wholesome’ housewives with beehive hairdos. But when his muse escapes him, he has been known to simply fill his cards with expletives – and that’s it.He started out in the business with rather more innocent creations, hand-sticking sequins and adornments to tastefully handcrafted cards.Then he had a twin revelation: that creating printed card designs was much less labour intensive than making them one by one and that the language of the gutter makes money.          As a nation, we buy a world-leading average of 33 cards per person per year, and 85 per cent of buyers are femaleThe market is huge.As a nation, we buy a world-leading average of 33 cards per person per year, and 85 per cent of buyers are female – mucky cards being far from a laddish preserve.Although coy with this newspaper, Mr Morris is more forthcoming on his blog and company website.‘I’m very proud of my place in the industry but I’ll always feel like the naughty young offspring,’ he says.Customers, he suggests, have a better sense of humour than many of the retailers believe. He also says that more than half his collection – which includes the Keep Calm And Carry On series – is clean.Mr Morris justifies his work by arguing that one person’s offensive greeting card is another’s display of affection, adding: ‘There are times where people want to push the boundary with their friends a little. It is important to remember that... while one card may be offensive to one customer, ten others may want to buy it.’He does, though, admit there are some shops which see his creations as so disgusting they ‘have small lockable display cupboards with a notice to ask for the key’.Even Scribbler, which has built its reputation on ‘adult’ cards, has sought to head off criticism by fixing PG (Parental Guidance) to some display shelves in its branches.But they serve only as a fig leaf – the crude cards are mixed in with mainstream ones, meaning it is difficult for customers to avoid them as they move around the shop.Scribbler was created by the husband-and-wife team of John and Jennie Procter in 1981, and employs 220 staff. They ide their time between London and a beautiful, thatched Grade II-listed former parsonage near Lulworth Cove in Dorset.Speaking in his sitting room with an open fire and black and white portraits of his children, where the windows look out across manicured lawns, Mr Procter is without a shred of remorse. ‘We don’t set out to be gratuitous,’ he says.          Mr Morris believes customers have a better sense of humour than many of the retailers believe‘We like to think of ourselves as following in the great tradition of bawdy English humour, like the racy seaside postcard.‘We don’t get complaints from anyone, young or old. If anything, we have rowed back from some of the stronger expletives.‘I think humour is a great force for good and we could do with more of it in this world,’ he adds, stretching the definition of comedy beyond where some might see it. It might seem strange, then, that Scribbler’s own website discourages shoppers who want to create their own cards from being too crude.Indeed, it seems anxious to protect its patrons from themselves.‘We have an online duty of care to make sure that all our customers don’t receive unwanted content,’ the website says.‘Therefore, any cards of a sexual nature... are not permitted.’Scribbler reserves the right to reject orders if the design contains nudity, drug use, racism, violence or harassment.It also reserves the right not to print anything else it deems inappropriate, which critics of Scribbler might say covers half its stock.A source at one Scribbler branch told this newspaper: ‘Filthy cards have become more and more popular, particularly in the last three years. Everybody buys them – there is no specific age or gender to it. I would say they are about half of what we sell.’American tourists buy the cards in batches, because there is nothing like them back home.And Scribbler is now trying to draw in younger and more impressionable customers. Scribbler Kids, a new brand, involves dedicated bays in branches which display cards for the junior market.But given the small size of some shops, these bays must inevitably be sited near the ‘adult’ stock.Back in Wolverhampton, Mr Morris is busy working on his collection for December 2019 and its predictable star offering: ‘Happy C***ing Christmas."},{"url":null,"title":"Royal Marines living quarters reduced female facilities","story":"    Marine Commandos on the assault course at the The Royal Marines Commando Training CentreTo date, every female candidate to attempt the four-day Potential Royal Marines Course has failed.One marine in training said: ‘We’ve been assured there won’t be any drop in standards to get women through the door, which is great, but they’re building facilities in our block for female recruits who don’t exist.’\u0027We\u0027re not a bunch of military monks\u0027: Ex-SAS commander...\u0027They\u0027ve been violating it for many years\u0027: Trump says U.S....Share this articleMale marines have been told to stop complaining or face being hauled before top brass.

Van Herrikhuyzen herself said that it was an \u0027honest\u0027 race and that Wagner-Assali should not have taken part if she had a problem with the rulesFinally, she tweeted, \u0027The backlash against my @UCI_cycling world championship victory is unprecedented in its size and the level of vitriol.

While I may not agree with the rules, when I pin on a number I agree to race by them. I also respect @rachelvmckinnon \u0027s right to compete within the rules.\u0027However Wagner-Assali\u0027s comments seemed to take an insensitive turn as she reinforced her opinion that McKinnon is not female.She seemed to suggest having the winner take part in the race was akin to having a man compete and contradicted her harsh stance by then seemingly stating she needed to learn from her earlier reaction which did not go down well with those who support the trans community.\u0027I\u0027m sure there are men who don\u0027t agree with the USA cycling rule that women can enter their races, which I do all the time,\u0027 she wrote on the micro-blogging site. \u0027I appreciate those that have reached out to support me, but please stop directing hateful or derogatory comments toward Rachel or trans people in general.          Days later, Wagner-Assali tweeted out an apology of sorts for her original statement, while simultaneously stating that she wanted the sport rules changed          McKinnon hit back by saying Wagner was only sorry she was caught out in public\u0027At the end of the day, we are all just people trying to find our way in this world. I\u0027m going to continue educating myself and hope this conversation continues in an open and positive way.\u0027 Wagner-Assali\u0027s last tweet was, \u0027For those of you who think I have \u0027folded\u0027 I have not. There\u0027s a group of us working on getting the rules changed but we are going to fight it offline, not in the name-calling angry world of social media. I\u0027m choosing to move on in a positive way.\u0027   McKinnon retweeted this last tweet and added the comment that, \u0027This is why the apology is not accepted: she still thinks what she said. She merely apologizes for being caught saying it publicly. She wants to ban trans women from competing. They will fail: the IOC openly allowed us in 2003 and revised their policies in 2015. #MoveOn.\u0027       Dr. Rachel McKinnon on Twitter: \u0026quot\u0026quotWhy do you race with women?\u0026quotjen wagner-assali on Twitter: \u0026quotAfter having some time to reflect, I realize my twitter comments earlier this week unintentionally fanned the flames on a controversial situation, and that I regret.

He has denied stories claiming that Doria revealed the news to him before the official announcement. She is understood to be planning to move to Britain to help care for the baby.Mr Markle refuses to say anything negative about his daughter and Prince Harry, and said he was only speaking out publicly in the hope it would alleviate some of the intense media scrutiny that continues around him. He says: ‘I have seven cars outside my house with reporters and photographers in them – it’s a gross invasion of my privacy.’It may strike some as unnecessarily cruel and unkind that Meghan’s mother was included in the official statement while her father was left to find out along with the rest of the world, given the controversy that has surrounded Mr Markle .He became estranged from Meghan days before the Royal Wedding in May after hanging up on Prince Harry – the prince had called to chastise him for co-operating with paparazzi pictures which showed, among other things, Mr Markle being ‘fitted’ for a wedding suit.Then he was unable to walk his daughter down the aisle at St George’s Chapel, Windsor, after suffering two heart attacks. In an interview with this newspaper – one of only three he has given – Mr Markle apologised for his lack of judgment in co-operating with the paparazzi.     Dad and daughter on a family outingIt was, he said, a misguided attempt to improve his image after being hounded as he went about his daily business.Mr Markle is yet to meet his son-in-law.But he said: ‘I don’t want anyone to feel sorry for me. Me not getting a call is most likely a misunderstanding about my two back-to-back heart attacks and me missing the wedding.‘There has been so much misinformation and lies that perhaps made them mistrust me.’But he congratulated the couple and said his daughter would be a wonderful mother.‘I wasn’t surprised by the baby announcement. Meghan loves children and she and Harry have been talking about wanting a family from the start. I’m delighted for them both.‘She’s always been wonderful with children and most of her friends have families so she’s used to being around kids. She will make a fantastic mother.’Mr Markle added he was ‘full of pride’ for the way his daughter was handling her first overseas tour, saying: ‘She’s doing so well winning the hearts and minds of everyone in Australia.’After the news of Meghan’s pregnancy, Mr Markle is clearly revelling in his happy memories of the little girl he affectionately called ‘Meggie’ and ‘Bean’. He says some of his happiest times with Meghan as a baby were the ‘quiet’ moments they spent together.Mr Markle was 37 when Meghan was born and was already a highly successful Emmy award-winning Hollywood lighting director, working on the top-rated TV soap General Hospital.He and Doria, who is 12 years his junior, raised their daughter in the affluent Los Angeles suburb of Woodland Hills.With a heavy work schedule, Mr Markle relished his time with Meghan. He said: ‘My greatest joy was coming home from work, picking her up and just walking back and forth with her in the kitchen. Holding her in my arms. She would listen to the hum of the refrigerator and it would lull her to sleep.‘My other favourite memory is of walking outside with her in the garden and I would point up at the moon and say, “That’s Meggie’s moon.” I did that for so long that eventually she was able to look up, point and say, “Meggie’s moon.” ’    Mr Markle and reporter Caroline in Mexico Although Mr Markle split with Ms Ragland when Meghan was three, he remained closely involved in his daughter’s upbringing.‘I would see her all the time. I had her every weekend. We lived close and Meghan went between the two homes very happily.’Meghan lived full-time with her father from the age of 12 until she was 18.He said: ‘I would take her to school every morning because it was on my way to work at the studio. If I could, I would pick her up in the afternoon or I’d send a limo or one of the crew to pick her up and bring her to the set.’Suits actress Meghan, 37, has spoken in the past about how her father instilled in her a love of acting and showbusiness.In one touching Father’s Day post on Instagram, which was taken down after she met Prince Harry, she posted a picture of herself as a baby laying on her father’s chest and wrote: ‘To this day your hugs are still the very best in the whole wide world. \u0027Thanks for my work ethic, my love of Busby Berkeley films \u0026amp club sandwiches, for teaching me the importance of handwritten thank you notes, and for giving me that signature Markle nose. I love you xo – Bean.’Mr Markle, who retired to Mexico six years ago, said: ‘I love my daughter and always will. She will be a great mum. I wish her and Harry nothing but the best.’Mr Markle neither asked for nor received any payment for this interview."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/10/20/03/51774DCA00000578-0-image-m-237_1540002312763.jpg","title":"Theresa plans radical overhaul election laws","story":"    Theresa May is set to block all foreign spending on UK Elections amid evidence that thousands of Moscow-backed Twitter accounts rallied behind Jeremy CorbynUniversity academics say more than 6,500 Russian internet robots – known as bots – masquerading under English names were bombarding voters with anti-Tory messages during the 2017 campaign.More than 80 per cent of the automated accounts were set up in the weeks before the Election.Harry shares his and Meghan\u0027s \u0027personal joy\u0027 of forthcoming...Harry\u0027s Blues and Royals uniform: Everything you need to...Share this articleBy making it an offence to fund such campaigns, the Tories believe social media companies such as Twitter would be forced to shut down ‘bot’ operations funded by ‘Moscow gold’.

He has been loving and self-sacrificing to you over your whole life, even raising you on his own for a significantly large part of it.’The letter criticises the way Mr Markle was left to fend for himself at his home in Mexico when news of Meghan’s relationship and subsequent engagement to Prince Harry became public.While Meghan’s mother Doria was given support – at one point representatives from the British Consulate in LA were photographed visiting her house – Samantha says their father was ‘hung out to dry’ and given no guidance, security protection or advice on how to deal with the ‘deluge’ of attention.                             You know you were not raised as an only child... and this family is and always was supportive of you even though we have said some unfavorable things clumsily...                         ‘He should have been able to speak directly with his daughter,’ she writes, while imploring her sister to have ‘a broader understanding of these very unique circumstances’.‘You have been wished well and supported (by us) from afar throughout all of this, even though we expressed frustration at times.

I was constantly thirsty, and hungry.And so on one sunny day, with Christmas around the corner, I sat waiting to be seen in a doctor’s office.To persuade me to go without making a fuss, Dad promised me I wouldn’t have to have any injections.The rest of the day is a bit of a blur – although I do recall quite a few injections, which I wasn’t too happy about.A doctor said to me: ‘I’m really sorry, but you have type 1 diabetes.’I didn’t understand what I was being told, but I could see from the worried expressions on my parents’ faces that it was serious.          Without insulin, sugar builds up in the blood and causes damage. So we type 1 diabetics have to inject a synthetic version of the hormone after eating. And then there is the constant finger-pricking to draw the blood needed to test sugar levelsThere was a stuffy grey lift which stank of disinfectant, and when the doors closed, the sounds of the hospital – the beeping noises, the crying babies – were gone.A musical melody played in the background, my parents were squeezing my shoulders, and a nurse was with us. After a while she looked at me and asked: ‘Did you ever want to be a pilot anyway?’The tension broke. My parents laughed. ‘Not really,’ I told her, blushing slightly, as the doors opened, and the noises recommenced.Back in my bedroom, I remember thinking it was all over. It wasn’t, of course. Life changed, but it did go on. I slowly discovered more about my condition.My pancreas had packed up – doctors still don’t know why it happens – and so I no longer produced my own insulin, the hormone that helps the body’s cells use sugar for energy.Without insulin, sugar builds up in the blood and causes damage. So we type 1 diabetics have to inject a synthetic version of the hormone after eating. And then there is the constant finger-pricking to draw the blood needed to test sugar levels.It’s a balancing act. You need to take enough insulin to keep blood sugar normal because if it’s high, it starts to cause irreversible damage throughout the body.But if you inject too much, blood sugar can plummet. This is called hypoglycaemia, or a hypo. You feel very wobbly, and confused, and it can even lead to blackouts.Womb cleanses, healing drums and crystals... why do...Share this articleThis is why type 1 diabetics, it was later explained to me, weren’t allowed a commercial pilot’s licence. It is no longer a disqualifying factor – the law changed in 2012 – but I still don’t want to be a pilot.Since the age of about nine, I’ve used an insulin pump, which is an electronic gadget that’s permanently attached to me, delivering insulin as and when I need it, so I don’t need to inject myself.I don’t need to prick my finger all the time either, thanks to my Freestyle Libre, a tiny sensor stuck to my arm which sends my blood sugar levels, wirelessly, to an app on my mobile phone. The Prime Minister, Theresa May, who also has type 1 diabetes, has one too.Ten years on from my diagnosis, the condition doesn’t stop me from doing anything.When Mrs May announced she had type 1 diabetes, my dad wrote that she was proof I could grow up to be whatever I wanted to be, even the PM.And he’s right, but instead I’d quite like to be a writer, or a film director, or an actor.I’m taking a gap year right now, currently working to save up for a bit of travelling in January – where to, I’m not sure.Next year I’m going to read English literature with creative writing at the University of East Anglia.And life at university will have it’s challenges. For a start, I don’t eat pizza. I could if I wanted to. But pizza contains slow-release carbohydrates, which makes it harder to control blood sugar with insulin after eating it. So I tend to avoid it.I also don’t really drink alcohol, and I definitely don’t get ‘sloshed’. Alcohol puts a strain on the liver which has a knock-on effect on blood sugar control, causing it to fluctuate. Mixing booze with my insulin medication means there is a risk that I could have a hypo. If this happens at night, it can be particularly worrying.On the plus side, diabetes has forced me into making healthier decisions about what I eat, and what I avoid. But feeling disconnected from the social scene can be quite upsetting.My twin sister Martha lives a very different life to mine: she drinks and eats normally because she doesn’t have diabetes. It’s tough, but there is no escaping this disease.A close friend handed me a shot of tequila at a party recently and shouted: ‘Down it! Down it!’ I wanted to have fun, but I would be taking a huge risk.          A big part of managing diabetes is handling how other people feel about it, whether that’s friends who may or may not think I’m being boring, or my parents’ worriesI looked at my friend, and said ‘No thanks’, and gave him the shot. He looked disappointed, but I know I made the right decision.A big part of managing diabetes is handling how other people feel about it, whether that’s friends who may or may not think I’m being boring, or my parents’ worries.Thanks to the Freestyle Libre, Dad is also able to remotely monitor my blood sugar levels via his smartphone. I don’t see it as in invasion of privacy, or feel I’m being watched over.You see, I know I’m OK, but it helps him to know that too, which is a good thing. Once I’ve left home, he might stop, but if he doesn’t, it doesn’t bother me.It was strange to read the first piece my Dad wrote for this newspaper in 2009 about my illness.He feared for my future, which I never have.Treatment advances mean that this once fatal disease is now manageable with a bit of effort. Yes, there are days when it can feel almost impossible to deal with, but that just motivates me more in the end. Diabetes is a challenge, not a catastrophe. It is difficult, but never impossible.Perseverance is essential.  Justin\u0027s story He is still alive! And so are his parents, though only just. Ten years after Sam’s diagnosis, a young adult is ready to leave home and ready to find his way in the world. And my wife Sarah and I are ready for a rest.Not a physical rest. Sam has looked after himself for years now. But mentally: from the constant out-of-one-corner-of-the-eye monitoring, chivvying, worrying. You cannot help yourself: ‘What’s your blood sugar number?’ ‘Is that a bit high, or a bit low?’ ‘How many carbs in a peach?’I said in my piece for this newspaper all those years ago that a chronic illness in a child changes everything, and it does. It tightens something inside you that can never be loosened again.I also said that I was all too aware that other parents have received worse diagnoses.And after ten years of coping with Sam’s condition I am even more aware that, as he puts it, type 1 diabetes is a challenge, not a catastrophe.I talked about a cure. Well, there is no cure and, frankly, little prospect of one in Sam’s lifetime.But (and it’s a huge but) as Sam says, there is massive progress on the kit and caboodle that can help you cope with type 1 and control it in a fashion that gives a more decent chance of a long and healthy life. So there is progress.And we have brought up a boy who has a sense of humour and a love of literature and travel a boy who must struggle to keep well and has much more to cope with than most young men, but who is not defined by his condition.Ten years ago, if I could have settled for this, I would have taken it like a shot. Here’s to the next ten. And if you have type 1 diabetes in your life: good luck. "},{"url":null,"title":"Straight stars portray gay characters Cate Blancett insists","story":"    Cate Blanchett, above at the Rome Film Festival, has defended straight actors playing gay characters, vowing she will ‘fight to the death for the right to suspend disbelief’But Miss Blanchett, a two-time Oscar-winner who played a lesbian in the 2015 film Carol, said she disagreed that a performer can form a deep bond with a character only if they have shared experiences, saying it defies the point of acting. Speaking at the Rome Film Festival, the 49-year- old Australian star added: ‘It also speaks to something that I’m quite passionate about in storytelling generally, but in film specifically, which is that film can be quite a literal medium.

Dressed in a T-shirt, jeans and socks, he seems utterly unruffled.          But a brief look at high street shelves reveals that the crudest examples are the work of one man, Dean MorrisIt turns out that the fine arts graduate is a fan of gardening and National Trust properties.

And, as he puts it, whatever his personal tastes and background: ‘Smut, filth and swearing does sell cards.’It certainly does, which is why The Mail on Sunday wanted to ask Mr Morris about the tide of obscenity infecting many high street card shops. Does he think it’s right to force that language down the throats of families looking to send a simple ‘thank you’ card? And what does he think of the effect on children of such crude sexual terminology?Mr Morris is not prepared to answer these and other questions right now, he tells us, commenting only that, ‘I wouldn’t have a business if my cards didn’t sell’, before ushering us out with a cheery goodbye.  It turns out that the fine arts graduate is a fan of gardening and National Trust properties, and he doesn’t particularly like the cards he producesCard design is essentially a cottage industry fed by hundreds of one-man bands. A single design might earn just £150 from chains that make a 100 per cent mark-up, but it certainly seems to pay well for the prolific Mr Morris, whose company, Dean Morris Cards Ltd, is sitting on a cash pile of £236,000, according to its published accounts.He can certainly afford to be a regular visitor to New York with his husband, a masseur, describing it as his favourite city. Not bad for scribbling ‘F***’ and ‘b******s’ on a folded piece of cardboard.A designer since 1999, Mr Morris gained a foothold in the industry with the help of the Prince’s Trust.Two decades on, he spends his days dreaming up mottos that are cruder and crasser than anything seen before. In this arms race of bad taste, nothing is off-limits.There is no need to bother with anything so laborious as innuendo or the double entendres so beloved by fans of the saucy seaside postcards of Donald McGill. A single entendre will do.Mr Morris’s stock in trade is to juxtapose filthy language with images mined from the 1950s and 1960s, of smartly dressed men and smiling ‘wholesome’ housewives with beehive hairdos. But when his muse escapes him, he has been known to simply fill his cards with expletives – and that’s it.He started out in the business with rather more innocent creations, hand-sticking sequins and adornments to tastefully handcrafted cards.Then he had a twin revelation: that creating printed card designs was much less labour intensive than making them one by one and that the language of the gutter makes money.          As a nation, we buy a world-leading average of 33 cards per person per year, and 85 per cent of buyers are femaleThe market is huge.As a nation, we buy a world-leading average of 33 cards per person per year, and 85 per cent of buyers are female – mucky cards being far from a laddish preserve.Although coy with this newspaper, Mr Morris is more forthcoming on his blog and company website.‘I’m very proud of my place in the industry but I’ll always feel like the naughty young offspring,’ he says.Customers, he suggests, have a better sense of humour than many of the retailers believe. He also says that more than half his collection – which includes the Keep Calm And Carry On series – is clean.Mr Morris justifies his work by arguing that one person’s offensive greeting card is another’s display of affection, adding: ‘There are times where people want to push the boundary with their friends a little. It is important to remember that... while one card may be offensive to one customer, ten others may want to buy it.’He does, though, admit there are some shops which see his creations as so disgusting they ‘have small lockable display cupboards with a notice to ask for the key’.Even Scribbler, which has built its reputation on ‘adult’ cards, has sought to head off criticism by fixing PG (Parental Guidance) to some display shelves in its branches.But they serve only as a fig leaf – the crude cards are mixed in with mainstream ones, meaning it is difficult for customers to avoid them as they move around the shop.Scribbler was created by the husband-and-wife team of John and Jennie Procter in 1981, and employs 220 staff. They ide their time between London and a beautiful, thatched Grade II-listed former parsonage near Lulworth Cove in Dorset.Speaking in his sitting room with an open fire and black and white portraits of his children, where the windows look out across manicured lawns, Mr Procter is without a shred of remorse. ‘We don’t set out to be gratuitous,’ he says.          Mr Morris believes customers have a better sense of humour than many of the retailers believe‘We like to think of ourselves as following in the great tradition of bawdy English humour, like the racy seaside postcard.‘We don’t get complaints from anyone, young or old. If anything, we have rowed back from some of the stronger expletives.‘I think humour is a great force for good and we could do with more of it in this world,’ he adds, stretching the definition of comedy beyond where some might see it. It might seem strange, then, that Scribbler’s own website discourages shoppers who want to create their own cards from being too crude.Indeed, it seems anxious to protect its patrons from themselves.‘We have an online duty of care to make sure that all our customers don’t receive unwanted content,’ the website says.‘Therefore, any cards of a sexual nature... are not permitted.’Scribbler reserves the right to reject orders if the design contains nudity, drug use, racism, violence or harassment.It also reserves the right not to print anything else it deems inappropriate, which critics of Scribbler might say covers half its stock.A source at one Scribbler branch told this newspaper: ‘Filthy cards have become more and more popular, particularly in the last three years. Everybody buys them – there is no specific age or gender to it. I would say they are about half of what we sell.’American tourists buy the cards in batches, because there is nothing like them back home.And Scribbler is now trying to draw in younger and more impressionable customers. Scribbler Kids, a new brand, involves dedicated bays in branches which display cards for the junior market.But given the small size of some shops, these bays must inevitably be sited near the ‘adult’ stock.Back in Wolverhampton, Mr Morris is busy working on his collection for December 2019 and its predictable star offering: ‘Happy C***ing Christmas."},{"url":null,"title":"Royal Marines living quarters reduced female facilities","story":"    Marine Commandos on the assault course at the The Royal Marines Commando Training CentreTo date, every female candidate to attempt the four-day Potential Royal Marines Course has failed.One marine in training said: ‘We’ve been assured there won’t be any drop in standards to get women through the door, which is great, but they’re building facilities in our block for female recruits who don’t exist.’\u0027We\u0027re not a bunch of military monks\u0027: Ex-SAS commander...\u0027They\u0027ve been violating it for many years\u0027: Trump says U.S....Share this articleMale marines have been told to stop complaining or face being hauled before top brass.

I was at university in the days when students held sit-ins but I was far more concerned with my new Fiorucci jacket than I was with squatting on the floor of the student union in the company of hairy guys who looked as if they should be in Jethro Tull.But due to the chaos of the Brexit negotiations – and a conviction that the information the country voted on in 2016 is not the same information before us now – I felt compelled to join yesterday’s People’s Vote march in London.I’m well aware of the fact that we’ve already had a People’s Vote – it was called a referendum – and I would have been happier had the march not taken place under such a sappy name. I also wish its aims were a little clearer in terms of exactly what that vote might be.However, I decided to overcome those reservations and instead concentrated on the detail of my participation. After all, the lack of detail is what got us into this mess in the first place.Firstly, who was I going to march alongside? I’ve been receiving rallying emails and texts for weeks but I wasn’t affiliated to any particular group and felt queasy about marching under any one banner. However, the prospect of trolling along on my own was daunting, so I decided to behave as if I were a royal at a cocktail party, moving between groups of people to avoid getting stuck with a bunch of bores.

Demos are an occasion where it is not necessary to suffer for the sake of beauty so, in the end, I stuck on a pair of trainers, green corduroy trousers with big pockets to avoid carrying a bag, and a three-year-old velvet jacket hoping the rain held off.Sadiq Khan tells \u0027biggest protest since the Iraq War\u0027 that...\u0027Let\u0027s be havin\u0027 EU\u0027: Delia Smith leads luvvie army as...Share this articleIn fact, I had been photographed in the same outfit for a newspaper article on Ageless Style last year, but I don’t suppose any of my fellow marchers noticed.Sadly, I had to leave the march before it finished to rush to the London Film Festival premiere of the biopic A Private War in which Rosamund Pike plays my close friend Marie Colvin, the Sunday Times war reporter who was slaughtered in Homs six years ago.Had she still been alive, Marie would have been marching too.

These kind of female members’ clubs are on the rise in many large cities.The audience was 100 per cent working women in their late 20s and early 30s. They were ambitious and curious but with a great sense of humour.How times change. I compared this group with my friends at that age. I doubt any of us would have considered an all-woman evening, discussing how to make the best of our lives, a night well spent.Although in the late 1980s women occupied far fewer senior roles than now – we thought that it was by getting on with the men at work that we were most likely to succeed.It didn’t mean we weren’t close to our female colleagues but after work we were far more likely to be in the pub (or more likely wine bar) forging relationships with guys, both professional and personal.Instaboasting, the new social menace  Prince Andrew was furious that Meghan told the family she was pregnant on Eugenie\u0027s wedding day, says Alexandra Shulman By all accounts, Prince Andrew was fit to be tied over Harry and Meghan announcing her pregnancy at his daughter’s wedding.Totally understandable.

Instaboasting – posting up the news of an offspring or partner’s triumph on the social media site – means that nowadays, guests will often arrive far more interested in that second’s gossip than they are in one’s own long-planned moment in the spotlight.Blonde addictionBlonde is known as the crack of hair colour in the trade.

Now a major expansion secures its futureWhen La Piscine Museum opened in one of the poorest towns in France’s depressed northern post-industrial belt, the number-crunchers predicted 60,000 visitors in a good year.From the start, there was something magical about the art deco swimming pool with its intricate mosaic tiles and enamel brick shower cubicles, all bathed in the gentle light of its sunburst stained-glass windows. Around the poolside, statues and sculptures were reflected in the water, like frozen bathers about to take a dip, among them Hope, Faith, Charity and Tenderness by Alfred Boucher, a friend of Auguste Rodin.But who would come to Roubaix unless they had to?As it turned out, 200,000 came in 2001, the year it opened. And they kept coming. When visitors swelled to 250,000, and the Journal des Arts named it France’s best museum outside Paris, it seemed that La Piscine would become the victim of its own success, fast running out of space for the public and the exhibits.Instead it embarked on a two-year, €9m (£7.9m) extension into a neighbouring former mill factory, to house a growing collection that sets out to confound the distinction between industrial and applied art and the beaux arts.Preparing for La Piscine’s grand reopening on Saturday, the museum director, Bruno Gaudichon, believes this eclectic mix reflects the spirit of Roubaix itself, where La Piscine has long been the pride of the town.“Roubaix was deeply hurt by the decline in the textile industry, and unemployment is still high in this area. Given this situation, the museum plays an important social role,” he told the Observer during a guided tour of the extended museum. “Having this magnificent pool has certainly helped its success and we have people come from everywhere, but many visitors are local, because La Piscine is deeply rooted in the memories of people in Roubaix.“Local people visit and tell us they came here as children to swim. Some even remember their favourite changing room. I saw one man walk in and burst into tears. He saw the pool and it brought back all those childhood memories for him.”In a bleak economic landscape, La Piscine Museum of Art and Industry has emerged as an oasis of hope, culture and regeneration. The pool and municipal baths opened in 1932, commissioned by the Socialist mayor Jean-Baptiste Lebas, later a second world war resistance fighter who died in a Nazi concentration camp, to encourage hygiene and sport among the mill workers and combat the spread of tuberculosis. It remained popular for decades, but closed in 1985, crumbling, riddled with damp and needing major repairs.A new swimming pool was built, but Roubaix councillors were reluctant to order the demolition of La Piscine and, in 1990, decided to transform the by then dilapidated art deco building into a museum while retaining the spirit of its original design.The architect Jean-Paul Philippon, who transformed Paris’s Gare d’Orsay into a museum, was chosen to oversee La Piscine’s metamorphosis in 2001. He has also supervised the recent extension, which has created an entire new wing, much of which was paid for by donations.“The idea of a public pool and baths was a very social one and a mixture of people from different classes from all over the region came here to learn to swim. The original idea was to restore the place and keep the pool and water, but make the volume smaller,” Philippon said. “The principle of architectural work is to have an eye on the past, present and future.”Today the museum’s core collection – figurative works from the 19th and 20th centuries – includes sculptures by Giacometti, Rodin, Claudel and Picasso, as well as paintings, ceramics, glass, furniture, jewellery, fabrics and fashion exhibits.The reopening features temporary exhibitions centred on Pablo Picasso’s famed protest statue Man with a Sheep, and Giacometti’s Portrait of a Hero, but both Gaudichon and Philippon admit the scene-stealer is a magnificent watercolour panorama depicting the opening of Roubaix’s town hall in 1911.“It was found in an attic at the town hall rolled up and being used to stop leaks in the roof. And we should be grateful that it was being used in that way, because otherwise it would probably have been thrown out,” Gaudichon said.Gaudichon, who came to Roubaix in 1989 to oversee La Piscine’s renaissance and has never left, does, however, have one regret: that he cannot persuade David Hockney, famous for his swimming-pool paintings, to exhibit at La Piscine.“We’ve written several times, but never had any reply. It is a pity, because his work would be perfect here, but also because he is from Bradford, which is twinned with Roubaix.“We would have liked him here for the 10th anniversary or for this reopening, but who knows?”, he said. “Maybe the 20th anniversary? If we can get a reply.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e0652246cbc67b77a028c7d41ab51b244b728d3b/113_101_2381_1429/master/2381.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=41cbadd0e3f68007908639c2ff4d79a2","title":"good grief artists reimagine peanuts in pictures","story":"From 1950 to 2000, Charles M Schulz’s daily comic strip Peanuts took the adventures of Charlie Brown, Snoopy, Linus and Peppermint Patty around the globe.

But where is the former prime minister who called the referendum that will blight Britain for as far ahead as anyone can see? Whatever happened to that likely lad? David Cameron doesn’t want to talk about it, one of his friends tells me. “He doesn’t defend the referendum, but won’t say he made a mistake either. Europe is like a family scandal. We know what’s happened but we don’t say a word: it’s his no-go zone.”At a personal level, the consequences swirl around him. I may be exhausting your capacity for compassion but the smallest of the casualties of Brexit has been the good fellowship of the Chipping Norton set. Naturally, the Cotswolds’ wealthy Leavers are grateful. But Cameron must resent them. He must know that he has been the useful idiot who succumbed to the demands of Rupert Murdoch’s Rebekah Brooks, a member of the local nouveau gentry by virtue of her converted barn, in the crashingly stupid belief that no harm would come from his surrender.Invitations to “kitchen suppers” from Remainers, however, can only include Samantha Cameron’s name – if, they are extended at all. Tania Rotherwick invited the Camerons to her pool at the magnificent Cornbury Park estate before she split from her husband and Cameron split Britain from Europe. She is now particularly contemptuous, I hear.Cameron’s memoirs were meant to be published this month but have been delayed until next year. The early signs are ominous. A book has to be coherent if it is to find a readership: its opening must prefigure its conclusion. As described in the publishing press, Cameron’s effort will have no consistency. He will tell the story of the formation of the coalition, his contributions to economic, welfare and foreign policy, his surprise victory in the 2015 election and then – as if from nowhere – the conventional memoir will end with the author carelessly deciding he will settle the European question, without planning a campaign or preparing an argument and, instead, launching a crisis that will last for decades. Nothing will make sense. Nothing will hang together. It’s as if a romcom were to conclude with serial killers murdering the cooing lovers or Hilary Mantel were to have aliens invade Tudor England on the last page of her Thomas Cromwell trilogy.The book Cameron cannot write would accept that his political battles and achievements were as nothing when set against his decision to appeal to the worst of the Tory party. It would begin with Cameron honouring the decision that won him the Conservative leadership in 2005. He would confess that he should have known better than to pull the Conservatives out of the centre-right group in the European parliament and align them with Law and Justice, the know-nothing Polish nationalists who are reducing their country to an ill-governed autocracy. The manoeuvre was pure Cameron: tactics above strategy appeasement instead of confrontation.The pattern continued throughout his premiership. He thought he could buy off the right by refusing to explain the benefits of EU membership to the voters. At one point in 2014 he threatened to leave the EU. He then turned around in 2016 and asked the public to believe that leaving would be a disaster and was surprised when 17.4 million men and women he had never treated as adults worthy of inclusion in a serious conversation ignored him.If he were being honest, Cameron would admit too that Brexit ought to bring an end to a British or, to be specific, English, style that is by no means confined to the upper class, but was everywhere present among the public-school boys who ruled us.I mean the ironic style that gives us our famously impenetrable sense of humour (which we will need now the rest of the world is laughing at us). The perfidious style that allows us to hide behind masks and has made England superb at producing brilliant actors for the West End but hopeless at producing practical politicians for Westminster. The teasing style of speaking in codes that benighted foreigners can never understand, however well they speak English. The cliquey style that treats England as a club, not a country, and allowed Jeremy Corbyn to say that Jews cannot “understand English irony”, however long their ancestors have lived here.The deferential style that allowed one Etonian to lead the Remain campaign and another to lead the Leave campaign and for the English to not even see why that was wrong. The life’s-a-game-you-shouldn’t-take-too-seriously style that inspired Cameron to say he holds “no grudges” against Boris Johnson now the match is over and the covers back on the pitch. The gentleman amateur style that convinced Cameron he could treat a momentous decision like an Oxford essay crisis and charm the electorate into agreeing with him in a couple of weeks, as if voters were a sherry-soaked don who could be won round with a few clever asides. The effortlessly superior style that never makes the effort to ask what the hell the English have to feel superior about. The gutless, dilettantish and fatally flippant style that has dominated England for so long and failed it so completely. The time for its funeral has long passed.A politician who bumped into Cameron said he thinks the referendum result must be respected, but that Britain should protect living standards by going for the softest Brexit imaginable and staying in the single market. This is a compromise well to the “left” of Theresa May and Corbyn’s plans and is worth discussing. Whatever his critics say, David Cameron is a former PM. He not only has the right to offer his solution but a duty. If he is to earn the right to a hearing, however, he must first find not only self-knowledge and courage, but an un-English seriousness of purpose he has evaded all his life."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/af0bd35cfaf095d393fb2bbca0fe5efb3ffafa8c/0_102_3228_1937/master/3228.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3a31c4d8a72ba3c3cbd75d6dfb0aa3d5","title":"if youre on the side of democracy why are you going to work for facebook","story":"When you take the Zuckerberg shilling, you’re leaving your principles behind youDear Nick, congratulations on the new job. Finally, some real power. Deputy prime minister is so last century. You’re now vice-president of global affairs and communications at Facebook, a company that, as Mark Zuckerberg points out, is less a traditional firm than a full-blown nation state. And not just any nation state – the most powerful nation state on Earth, ever, home to 2 billion people and with nothing as inconvenient as elections to get in the way of “progress”. Suck up to the supreme leader and you’re set. Think of it as something like the coalition, only set in Pyongyang in 2022.And you’re relocating to the real centre of global politics – Silicon Valley. So double cause for congratulations. You won’t be around to enjoy the after-effects of Britain’s historic Brexit vote. You married a Spaniard, worked in Brussels, describe yourself as a passionate European, propped up David Cameron’s coalition for just long enough for him to call a referendum and announced your new job on the eve of the People’s Vote march that you campaigned for. Here’s hoping you’re not going to take the pay cheque and keep your mouth shut, Nick.Can I call you Nick? I disapprove of Mark this and Sheryl that (there in your public statement) – they’re Zuckerberg and Sandberg to me. Part of the reason for the mess we are in is this cosy over-familiarity with distant power figures, but you were one of us, Nick. That was your job, to represent us and if you’re going over to the other side – and yes, it is the other side – I’d like you to remember that. Because the rest of us can’t just walk away leaving Jacob Rees-Mogg the keys.Because what you don’t seem to have grasped is that the crisis gripping Britain and the one gripping Facebook are one and the same. They’re manifestations of each other. It isn’t technology that has blown apart our world – it’s Facebook’s business model. It’s the monetisation of fear and hatred and lies. And what we’re witnessing here in Britain is a compromised government colluding with a compromised technology platform to cover up the truth of what happened in the EU referendum.We know Facebook that was the key to the vote. That almost all the money spent was funnelled through the platform. That spending limits were exceeded. That electoral laws were broken. That campaigns were illegally co-ordinated. That Russia targeted us. And that Facebook facilitated all this. Your company is refusing to hand over evidence, according to the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport select committee. And Zuckerberg has refused – three times – to testify to parliament.Which is where you come in. I don’t know why Zuckerberg hired you – oh no, wait. Yes I do. You’ve hobnobbed with every European commissioner of note and last September you wrote an op-ed, headlined “In defence of Facebook and the Silicon Valley giants”. Nick, that piece was poor. In it, you suggest journalists like me are “disingenuous” because Facebook has destroyed the business model of traditional publishing. And that we “need to avoid a kneejerk condemnation of the disruption and potency of new technologies and embrace the idea that technology can improve our lives”.If you want to use the comment pages of a paper whose business model has been threatened by Silicon Valley to pitch for work there, you may want to call it what it is. You’ve taken the money. That’s your call, though I refer you to John Grisham’s 1991 novel, The Firm. Remember the young protagonist and that job that was too good to be true? “When Mitch McDeere qualified third in his class at Harvard, offers poured in from every law firm in America,” ran the blurb. “Bendini, Lambert and Locke were a small, well-respected firm, but their offer exceeded Mitch’s wildest expectations: a fantastic salary, a new home and the keys to a brand new BMW.”Though not even Bendini, Lambert and Locke faced the sort of accusation Facebook did last week – that genocide was incited on the site. The New York Times published evidence that the Myanmar military had deliberately provoked violence against the Rohingya by flooding the platform with fake posts about fake atrocities. Kneejerk condemnation, Nick? Or a failure on your part to acknowledgelet alone understand the ways your new company is undermining democracy worldwide. See the reports from Brazil of how WhatsApp has been flooded with disinformation before its election.Or consider the ramifications of the situation in which the select committee published more evidence that your company has, even now, been hosting ads from a shadowy unknown outfit – “Mainstream Network” – pushing a hard Brexit to north of 10 million people. We have no idea who is paying for this.That’s the same day that you wrote in the : “Instead of the impact of Brexit, I will now be focused on the impact of tech.” Nice try. But they are intimately entwined. And this must be the number one priority on your desk . It’s the parliament that you served in that is asking these questions, attempting to bring to light the dark money and dark forces that we know were at work. Facebook’s deliberate obfuscation is helping the government to avoid hard questions about the legitimacy of the vote, its own ministers’ role in the biggest electoral fraud of modern times and the question it has been desperate to avoid of Russia’s role.You cannot collude in this. You are better than that, Nick. You’ve been hired to say Euro-friendly things to European commissioners who wish to rein in Facebook. But guess what? You’re a Brit, still. You were elected to serve us. And as deputy prime minister, you had the highest level of security clearance. You had access to the Five Eyes intelligence alliance during the crucial years 2010-2015, when we know, via special prosecutor Robert Mueller, that the Russian government sought to subvert and infiltrate America’s tech platforms.The FBI targeted Mitch McDeere. Do you remember? The same government agency that’s currently circling Facebook. Why has the company hired you, Nick? Where do your loyalties lie? And what are you going to do? Are you really going to collude in a cover-up? Or did your promise to the voters of Sheffield Hallam mean anything at all?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d5fe9d5964ee314cb2e0e47ecfeccafdf65b2006/117_109_1268_761/master/1268.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=df1c94c2c7bccb2f79713675f0a9f16e","title":"is it ethical to raise a royal baby in captivity prince harry","story":"Plans to exhibit Prince Harry’s offspring in London Zoo’s disused penguin pool raise disturbing moral questionsRoyal babies are baked to order, like lucky pies, to provide gurgling distractions in times of crisis. Last week, the world’s scientists agreed we have 12 years to limit the worst climate change damage or face mass extinction. Within days, as floods washed away the villages of the Aude valley and their delicious French wines, we began fracking in Lancashire in the face of heroic protest and a dismissive Donald Trump accused scientists of having a “political agenda”. Nothing changed. But look! A baby!! A baby!!! A bouncing royal baby!!!!Like many former Class War subscribers now approaching late middle age, I belatedly find myself quite a fan of the Queen, largely due to Dame Helen Mirren’s amazing acting in the film The Queen, in which she invested the eponymous heroine with imaginary depths and assumed feelings.Michael Parkinson is such a fan of Dame Helen Mirren’s talents that he keeps a stuffed toy of Nyra, the magic owl Mirren played in The Owls of Ga’Hoole, under his pillow. Sometimes, in the restless night, Michael Parkinson sneers at the felt owl for its voluptuousness and accuses the woodland creature of trying to bewitch him. But the Yorkshireman is from a different time and must not be judged by the owl-respecting standards of today.Monarchists’ last line of defence of the royal family boils down to the fact that they, and specifically their newborns, are good for tourism. But if this is the case, then surely we as a nation are guilty of failing to fully monetise the royal babies’ tourist appeal. Can we afford to be so profligate with our assets in the forthcoming era of Brexit-driven financial uncertainty?For the last four-and-a-half years, I have worked on my laptop most days in the cafe of London Zoo, where I am unknown to the tourists. The zoo’s marketing people persuaded me, over an enchilada one lunchtime, to provide the recorded voice of an ennui-stricken black widow spider in the Bug House, but other than that I am virtually invisible in my cafe corner. And so I am able to eavesdrop on the staff.Plans are afoot, so it would appear from the brown-coated huddle I overheard last week, to repurpose Berthold Lubetkin’s iconic 1934 penguin pool. While recognised as a 20th-century design classic, in 2004 the enclosure was emptied of penguins, who didn’t like swimming in it as, like Boris Johnson, it was too shallow to be of any use to anyone.Having frustrated generations of sea birds for more than 80 years, Lubetkin’s white elephant now languishes drained and dry, too famous to demolish and too impractical to function, the Millennium Dome of marine aviaries. Now it is to be inhabited again but only, it would appear, during usual zoo opening hours. Would the normal keepers be doing the feeding or would the zoo’s latest addition have its own handlers, the hushed staff asked one another. Would they be allowed to look it in the eye? Would there be special protocols? And above all, how was the zoo going to cope with the tourist numbers when the next royal baby was put on permanent public display in Lubetkin’s empty penguin pool.Everything had been thought through in meticulous detail, the possibility of public objections overruled in deference to our desperate need for tourist dollars. Tickets will be auctioned to the highest bidder and income projections were already off the scale, knocking pregnant pandas into a cocked hat.Royal chefs will prepare the child’s food on site, but the normal zoo keepers will be required to hurl the luxury dinners from buckets towards the royal baby, encouraging it to leap and caper for the paying public’s delight.When the royal baby reaches school age, a tutor will sit in the enclosure with it all day, to make sure it is properly educated, though he or she will bring their own packed lunch, which must not contain nuts. The royal child will be permitted to do its main toilet on tabloid newspapers in the private penguin nesting area, but everything else will happen in public view, thus preparing it, perhaps more successfully than with any previous royal, for a lifetime of spotlit scrutiny.And should the royal baby, heaven forbid, suddenly choose to dress as a Nazi stormtrooper and parade around the penguin pool saluting, or to show its bottom to partygoers, the child will learn the hard way what it means to live a life in full public view, as the camera-phones of those surrounding the enclosure flash into social media integrated life.And at the end of each working day, the royal child will be airlifted by helicopter to Kensington Palace, where it will then live a completely normal existence as a member of the royal family, waited on hand and foot, opening hospices and being stalked by photographers.But once I saw a gang of young men leaning over the Asian short-clawed otter enclosure wall to feed Starbursts™ to the animals. I told them that the sweets would surely be very bad for the otters and to their credit the boys went off, horrified, to find a keeper to confess to. And everyone knows the implausible, but not necessarily untrue, urban myth of the amorous Florida zoo employee who died due to his over-familiarity with an alligator.Can we expose a member of the royal family to these kind of risks in the name of national solvency? We need to take a long hard look at ourselves, as a society, if we are prepared to prioritise the generation of money over the mental and physical wellbeing of a child, even if that child is a member of the royal family. Call me unpatriotic, or a snowflake, call me what you like, but I for one, will not be queuing up to see the newborn royal baby leaping around for food flung from buckets into a disused penguin enclosure. I think it is wrong."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/360f02f44d3698e118364b8e4b018317561639d0/0_96_3643_2186/master/3643.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a7804a95fa5d34682b8888b4c212d38f","title":"prince harry and meghan markle show right royal turn off","story":"I really don’t want to know what the royal couple did on their holiday – or even what you did on yoursHey everybody, did you realise that the Duke and Duchess of Sussex were touring Australia?

She is a TV regular on shows such as QI, Have I Got News for You, which she has also hosted, and in Countdown’s Dictionary Corner. She co-wrote the Bafta-winning hospital sitcom Getting On with co-stars Vicki Pepperdine and Joanna Scanlan, and its spinoff, Going Forward. Brand’s latest book, Born Lippy: How to Do Female (Hodder \u0026amp Stoughton, £20), is out now.Girl from the North Country by Conor McPherson at the Old VicI really enjoyed this musical, which took some of the lesser-known songs of Bob Dylan and wove them into a story. What I loved about it was the parity between the fantastic singing and the level of acting. It’s set in 1930s America, after the crash, and centres round a downmarket hotel and some of its guests. I love Bob Dylan, and it was great to hear different voices and orchestrations for his songs. For my money, Shirley Henderson was the star – she’s got that slightly surreal, elfin quality about her. She has that thing some actors have, where they mesmerise you a bit by their presence. Wish I had that.The Shepherd’s Life by James RebanksThis is an autobiographical account by a guy who was brought up on a rather lonely mountain sheep farm in Cumbria but ended up going to Oxford, so it has that interesting duality of something harsh and working class described by someone very intelligent. I was brought up in a small village in Kent and a lot of my friends were children of farmers. I found the book really absorbing, even when he was talking about sheep diseases and the bleakness of winter. I found it heartwarming that he went off to Oxford but came back, and he’s now running a farm with his wife and kids.About three months ago I watched this Canadian police procedural set in a very rural, forested area. It’s about the indigenous population who – understandably so – harbour resentment towards other parts of the community for having ended up on reservations. There’s some pretty awful violence in it, which I didn’t like, but what I liked was the relationship between the two main characters. You do get a sort of disgruntled middle-aged man, the Cardinal of the title, but his partner, a younger woman, is interesting: she’s quiet, and not very showy or beautiful. She just sort of gets on with it – I really like her.This is set in a pretty unremarkable town in Russia. The story involves a married couple who are splitting up, and they have a 12-year-old son. The woman and the man are both unpleasant people, and the son hears them arguing one night – he’s standing outside the door – about the fact that neither of them wants him. It’s a harrowing film it’s incredibly beautifully directed, it’s dark, it’s fascinating. I think it actually does show you Russia, as opposed to the slightly cartoonish view we get of it in the west. I’d imagine that Putin didn’t like it much. In my book, that’s a good thing.Space Shifters at the Hayward Gallery, LondonI’m a complete philistine, art-wise.

Schools will get a share of a £320m fund to help boost swimming lessons, he said.While the Department for Education has not proposed any new measures to compel private schools to open their pools, Hinds said he was personally determined to “make sure our children grow up safe and water confident”. “Many independent schools are already doing this, but others can and must do more to help every child in their community,” he said.The issue is likely to reopen the debate on whether private schools’ ability to claim charitable status should be predicated on their willingness to share their sports facilities with state school pupils.This year’s figures from the Independent Schools Council, which represents 1,326 private schools in the UK, show that of 603 of its member schools that have pools, 304 already share them in some way with state school pupils.In 2015, Lord Moynihan, the outgoing Conservative chairman of the British Olympic Association, moved an amendment to the Charities Bill to require private schools that have charitable status to share their sports facilities. It was defeated 156 to 105.The Charity Commission updated its guidance in 2015 to encourage independent schools to report how they are opening up access to their sports and arts facilities, but stopped short of requiring that they do so to keep their charitable status.Julie Robinson, general secretary of the ISC, said that there was “much goodwill from schools fortunate to have facilities that may be in short supply locally”. She added that “raising awareness of partnerships helps more state schools and independent schools develop mutually beneficial programmes”.“Headteachers who have opened up their facilities tell us it’s a win-win for the schools and the community,” said Charles Johnston, director of property for Sport England, a public body under the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport. “It allows facilities to be used at times when otherwise they’d be empty.”But Ali Oliver, chief executive for the Youth Sport Trust, said that “much more needs to be done to remove barriers to sport and play and ensure that people are not deprived of opportunities based on their gender, ability, background or where they live. It is vital that programmes to raise levels of activity are targeted at those most in need.”Tom Watson, Labour’s deputy leader, who is responsible for sport, said: “This barely moves the dial on the pressing need to improve the health of our children, when six out of 10 are leaving primary school either overweight or obese.“If you really want to improve children’s health, make guidelines on nutrition in schools mandatory, not voluntary.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b3e16865dbd7c151101e2b65951bb22f2ced99d7/125_0_1875_1125/master/1875.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=19806061886c650391a4749e6f969096","title":"headless chicken monster deep sea cucumber seen in southern ocean for first time","story":"Creature filmed off east Antartica using technology developed by Australian researchersA deep-sea cucumber known as a “headless chicken monster” has been filmed in the Southern Ocean for the first time using camera technology developed by Australian researchers.The creature was filmed off east Antarctica and it is the first time the species has been seen in the area.\u0026nbsp“Some of the footage we are getting back from the cameras is breathtaking, including species we have never seen in this part of the world,” Australian Antarctic Division program leader Dr Dirk Welsford said.Enypniastes eximia has only been seen in the Gulf of Mexico previously and was captured in the Southern Ocean by cameras developed by the ision.“The housing that protects the camera and electronics is designed to attach to toothfish longlines in the Southern Ocean, so it needs to be extremely durable,” Welsford said. “We needed something that could be thrown from the side of a boat and would continue operating reliably under extreme pressure in the pitch black for long periods of time.”The data collected from the cameras are being presented at the annual Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources meeting starting in Hobart on Monday.Australia’s commissioner for the meeting will push for a new east Antarctic marine protected area.\u0026nbsp“The Southern Ocean is home to an incredible abundance and variety of marine life, including commercially sought-after species, the harvesting of which must be carefully managed for future generations,” commissioner Gillian Slocum said.The 10-day meeting will also include proposals on how to respond to climate change."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e18df1b107396e82d489d3fb24eaeee16790026d/0_212_3173_1904/master/3173.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cf5445f0930b79c23181e2a9e98bcd62","title":"the week in wildlife in pictures","story":"A 1,000-metre spider web and a hellbender devouring a snake are among this week’s pick of images from the natural world"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/36a6823f7a5b0e9bb6cec39e97697b59a7f8596f/46_115_2073_1244/master/2073.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7f6b294425f3f3efb71520dad325ac30","title":"women go wild for leopard skin to show they are not prey","story":"This autumn’s trend goes beyond fashion as women of all ages dare to wear animal print to give them an edgeThere are trends, the seasonal diktats that filter down from the catwalks and on to the high street, and then there is the mass proliferation of an idea so big that it transcends fashion. Welcome to the zoo! In this, the autumn of 2018, leopard print is no longer just a look – it has become a bona fide movement.Cast an eye around your local pub, work do or big night out and consider the safari-load of animal prints on show: cheetah, snake, tiger and yes, the sleekest of them all: the leopard. Where before coats and shoes had the fashion monopoly on animal prints, allowing women to gently accessorise their way to the jungle, now entire wardrobes are rotating around animal skirts, animal shirts, animal tights and animal shoes. Sometimes bravely, sometimes brilliantly, all at once.Soaring sales of animal print clothing helped Asos post a £500m rise in sales last year, the firm revealed last week. The online fashion retailer sold 1.3 million animal print garments across both menswear and womenswear, offering 2,000 options during the period.Of course, the fashion lot has been telling us this for months: leopard print never really went away. But thanks to the February shows in which Tom Ford’s sublime collection led the pack, a roaring trade (sorry) was to be expected for the colder months. And so Réalisation’s leopard Naomi skirt became “the most viral clothing piece of the year”. Reformation, \u0026amp Other Stories and Zara have been selling out of their leopard-y pieces week in, week out. Guides on how to correctly clash your animal patterns were churned out by the industry all summer long.I see the eye roll, I hear the scoff: who cares? Women have gone wild we’re dressed as a collective pack it’s “just” fashion move on.But let’s paws for thought (sorry, again). Usually, once a look has been so thoroughly mainstreamed (and there is more to come – we’re far from peak animal print yet) it would be declared dead and over by the editors, bloggers, influencers and fashion buyers who have helped make it so chic, so desirable. Not so for animal power. Everyone seems to be wearing it: the older, the younger, the cool, the less-so. More is more, but why?At a time when female sexuality, power and vulnerability have never been more talked about, there is a comfort in this subtle, subconscious subversion: no matter how many times you read a fashion editor coolly declaring that leopard skin is now a wardrobe neutral akin to a black polo neck or blue denim jeans, animal print retains a gratifying edge. In his 1954 manual, The Little Dictionary of Fashion, Christian Dior famously wrote that “to wear leopard you must have a kind of femininity which is a little bit sophisticated. If you are fair and sweet, don’t wear it.” And so the connotations have always been that it’s sexy, a bit raunchy, a bit daring, a bit wild.Class and money complicate things further: Mrs Robinson allegedly gave it a pussycat allure while Pat Butcher was seen to make it common. Now’s the time to rewrite the rules and own it being both.Yes, women can wear leopard-print blouses to the office and claw down raised eyebrows. No, they don’t have to stick to the demure flashes of animal skin on shoes, handbags or a well-wrapped scarf. It is a print that has gone beyond being a current fashion statement to establishing itself as a wardrobe perennial. Elegant, knowing, arch – and as stylishly savage as it gets."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ecb714834db18244ef43d9238bfe6e152eea7191/0_170_1764_1058/master/1764.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f8e3c2da67c919db8dfa508a515df3c4","title":"tell us how does it feel to watch a classic film on first release","story":"As audio of frenzied audience reactions to the original Halloween has gone viral, we want to hear your stories of seeing defining films at the cinemaThe much-hyped release of the latest Halloween installment (tipped to break records with a $70m opening) has led many to think back to the film that started it all back in 1978.While there have been rankings aplenty, there’s also been a rather fascinating video going viral that gives us an idea of what it would have been like to see the original on the big screen.

Starting with George Romero’s 1968 Night of the Living Dead, Simon unpicked the rebellious socio-political threads of films such as Last House on the Left, The Texas Chain Saw Massacre and Shivers before arriving at the more conservative inflections of Carpenter’s ruthlessly efficient modern morality tale.A stylishly suspenseful thriller in which teenagers indulging in illicit sex and intoxication are stalked and slashed by a relentless killer, Halloween was a funhouse ride with a puritanical narrative edge. (“I didn’t mean to put an end to the sexual revolution,” Carpenter laughingly told Simon, “and for that I deeply apologise.”) Yet it also had a punky power that inspired a slew of titillating teen-terror slashers. Friday the 13th may have lifted its gory riffs from Mario Bava’s A Bay of Blood (just as Carpenter looked back to Bob Clark’s Black Christmas), but it was Halloween that paved the way for its blockbuster success.A string of inferior sequels and reboots followed Carpenter’s low-budget hit, from Rick Rosenthal’s 1981 Halloween II (written by original screenwriters Carpenter and Debra Hill) to Rob Zombie’s dreary 2007 “reimagining” and its dispiriting follow-up. Now David Gordon Green, whose career has swerved from Terrence Malick-esque indie-hit George Washington to the stoner comedy of Pineapple Express and Your Highness, retreads familiar ground with added PTSD.Like the 20th-anniversary outing Halloween H20, which effectively overrode instalments four to six (the superior Halloween III: Season of the Witch follows an entirely separate narrative), this latest incarnation effectively dumps the sequels and simply picks up 40 years after the events of the first film, with surprisingly sprightly results.Former knife-wielding maniac Michael Myers (James Jude Courtney, with contributions from the original’s masked-madman Nick Castle) is now in a mental institution, serving his incarceration in silence. Meanwhile, survivor and “final-girl” archetype Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis, terrific) is living in a remote home-cum-security-compound. Haunted by the murderous spectre of Myers (aka “the shape”), Laurie’s paranoia has taken its toll she’s seen her marriages collapse, become estranged from her daughter, Karen (a sharply cast Judy Greer), who was taken away as a child, and now fears for the safety of her teenage granddaughter Allyson (Andi Matichak). As Laurie tells the annoying podcasters who show up looking for a story: “I’m a basket case.” When Michael escapes during transfer to a maximum security prison (a nod to Halloween 4?), Laurie is hardly surprised. “He’s waited for me,” she says. “I’ve waited for him…”Sharing writing credits with Danny McBride and Jeff Fradley, Green delivers a slickly packaged modern slasher that balances wry humour and knowing genre call-backs with moments of 18-rated gore and some efficiently executed showdowns. There are plenty of homages to the first film, from the signature floating shots that follow Michael’s killing spree to Carpenter’s insistent 54 semitonal score, revisited here by the maestro in collaboration with his son, Cody Carpenter, and godson Daniel Davies. But while the Shape’s iconic visage (originally a William ShatnerCaptain Kirk mask) may have been elegantly aged and decomposed, the “pure evil” of Michael’s quasi-supernatural quest retains a quaintly unreconstructed retro feel.What has changed is Curtis’s avenging angel, pitched somewhere between the reborn strength of a Terminator 2-era Sarah Connor (vests and shotguns to the fore) and the obsessive madness of Donald Pleasence’s now deceased psychiatrist Dr Loomis. While Haluk Bilginer’s Dr Sartain may be sarcastically dismissed by Laurie as “the new Loomis”, it’s Strode herself who actually wears that mantle. And, in the absence of Pleasence, she wears it well. “If the way I raised your mother means that she hates me but she’s prepared for the horrors of this world,” Laurie tells her granddaughter ominously, “I can live with that.”Fans will enjoy the smart inversion of key scenes from the original, with cinematographer Michael Simmonds repeatedly framing Laurie and Michael as interchangeable mirror-images – hunter and hunted – intertwined. Whether or not the new Halloween is actually scary is a matter for debate there’s nothing here as shocking as the opening act of Hereditary, or as original as Wes Craven’s New Nightmare, which brilliantly resurrected the long-moribund spectre of Freddy Krueger in 1994. Yet after four decades of diminishing returns, the fact that a guy in a mask can still take an entertaining stab at a somewhat jaded audience is oddly reassuring."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/449a5f4d640c9f8041915291e8b8f2f4d5e80efe/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a0d7e44bcecb8252e1e113c57d205323","title":"mike leigh peterloo massacre interview you ask the questions","story":"The acclaimed director talks to Tim Lewis about his new film, Peterloo, and, further down, answers questions about creative freedom, beards, James Bond - and what Rada didn’t teach himMike Leigh sits before me, in his Soho office, a man without regrets – certainly with regard to his work, but probably in most aspects of his life, one suspects. If this doesn’t make him unique in the film industry, then he’s certainly in a tiny minority. The 75-year-old British director has made 20-odd films – from his TV work in the 1970s up to his latest release, Peterloo, perhaps his most ambitious and certainly his most expensive project yet – and he has never once had his arm twisted to compromise on his creative vision. He chooses the subject, handpicks the actors and the version we see on the screen is exactly the one that Leigh intended.“I’m open to people who are happy for me to do what I do,” he explains. “I’m not open to anybody who tries to tell me what to do. I have on many occasions walked away from a project where there’s been even the suggestion that, ‘Well, we’ll back the film so long as there’s an American star in it.’ Walk away.”Really, he’d walk away? “Of course,” Leigh replies, clearly considering the question either idiotic or mad. “And I have done on a number of occasions. It’s like a novelist being told what the novel should have in it. Or a painter being told, ‘It must include a lighthouse.’ And that’s the polite version.”So Leigh is no people-pleaser, and yet, of course, at the same time he has become one of our best loved film-makers. He was raised in Salford and when he started making plays, and then films, he always imagined he would focus on contemporary issues. A particular inspiration was Jack Clayton’s 1959 film Room at the Top, a story of love and class set in a Yorkshire mill town, which came out when Leigh was 16.Is born in Hertfordshire and raised in Salford by his mother Phyllis, a midwife, and father Abraham, a doctor from a Jewish family (originally Lieberman) that fled Tsarist Russia in 1902.Wins a scholarship to train as an actor at Rada, which he dislikes. Later takes courses at the London School of Film Technique, Camberwell art school and St Martin’s.Directs two plays for the stage – Little Malcolm and His Struggle Against the Eunuchs, and The Box Play – in which he first experiments with improvisation.\u0026nbspAfter staging it in 1970, he adapts Bleak Moments for the screen with funding from Albert Finney’s Memorial Films. Roger Ebert calls Leigh’s cinematic debut “a masterpiece, plain and simple”.Marries actor Alison Steadman, who stars in seven of his films, including Abigail’s Party, adapted from a stage play in 1977. They have two sons, Toby and Leo, but orce in 2001. Now lives with actor Marion Bailey, who is in four of his films.Meantime, a black-humoured take on Thatcher-era recession and unemployment, stars unknowns Gary Oldman and Tim Roth.Founds Thin Man Films with Simon Channing Williams. From its Soho office the company will produce all of Leigh’s subsequent pictures, beginning with Life Is Sweet in 1990.Wins best director at Cannes for Naked, featuring a ferocious central performance from David Thewlis. The film is criticised by some for justifying misogynist behaviour.Secrets \u0026amp Lies, with Marianne Jean-Baptiste and Brenda Blethyn, wins the Palme d’Or at Cannes and is nominated for five Oscars including best director.Vera Drake, featuring Imelda Staunton as an illegal abortionist in 1950s postwar London, wins the Golden Lion at Venice and bags Leigh a Bafta award for best director.\u0026nbspIs elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature, and releases Happy-Go-Lucky, starring Sally Hawkins.Following his 2014 biopic of artist JMW\u0026nbspTurner, Leigh returns to the early 19th century for Peterloo. Having premiered at the Venice film festival, the film opens in the UK next month.“Now when I saw it, which was in a local cinema in north Salford, what was exciting about it was if you walked out of the cinema into the street, it was the same world as was in the pictures,” recalls Leigh. “I’d spent all of that time up till then sitting as a kid thinking, ‘Wouldn’t it be great if you could have a film where the characters in the film were like real people?’”Leigh developed a method whereby he would begin each project without a script – only after months of rehearsal and improvisation would one emerge. The process would lead to a varied canon that includes Life is Sweet, Naked, Palme d’Or winner Secrets \u0026amp Lies, and Vera Drake, which earned him a Bafta for best director. Away from work, in 1973 he married the actor Alison Steadman, a frequent collaborator on plays and in films, and the couple had two sons. They orced in 2001, and Leigh now lives in north London with the actor Marion Bailey.In 1999 Leigh moved into “period” pieces with Topsy-Turvy, a study of Gilbert and Sullivan’s creation of The Mikado. He has since made Mr Turner in 2014, following the final years of the painter JMW Turner, and now Peterloo, which had its premiere at the Venice film festival. (Peter Bradshaw, in his five-star  review, wrote that it was a story that “needs to be heard right now”.)“A long time ago, I remember reading about it, thinking, ‘That would make a good film’, but that’s in the days before I thought I would make a period film at all,” says Leigh. “So I didn’t really think I would do that.”Leigh changed his mind about five years ago. As always the process began without a script. Casting was particularly arduous this time round: there are about 160 actors in Peterloo. Leigh is wilfully mysterious about his auditions, describing them as “a trade secret”. He explains: “There are plenty of very good actors whose bag this isn’t, who don’t do character acting, who aren’t particularly interested in issues and the world. Apart from anything else, every actor in Peterloo was really on to it and into it. You know there are intelligent actors out there. And there are loads of actors out there who are very good actors but they are thick. And none of them are ever in my films.”Leigh approaches the Observer’s You Ask The Questions interview in much the same resolute way that he makes films. He is sincere, often very funny, but when he has finished a thought, he lets you know and there’s no budging him. He’ll say: “That is all I have to say on the subject.” Or: “Moving swiftly on.” And if he doesn’t like a question, as will become clear, he certainly lets you know it.Sometimes in our work the stars align and we create something that we feel is personally complete, true and represents the best of ourselves. Is there a film or play in your career for which you feel this is true and why?It’s slightly like being asked which of my two children I prefer. I love them both. And in a way that’s how I feel about my work when it boils down to it. Obviously, some of my pieces resonate in particular ways. For example, Meantime, which came out of wanting to say something about unemployment at a certain stage four years into Thatcher’s reign, I’ve got a kind of soft spot for that, but it isn’t that I really think it’s better or more what Lesley’s asking about than any of the other films.How did you first learn about the Peterloo massacre? They don’t teach you about it at school…Well, we did it for four seconds for O-level, in 1959, along with the Cato Street Conspiracy and all that, but there was no sense of “it happened here.” And when we were making the film, a lot of people ranging from early 20s to my age didn’t know about it. Where I grew up in north Salford, you could get to where it happened on the bus in 15 minutes and I never knew about it. My dad was a socialist, never mentioned it. My primary school could have taken us down to where it happened, marched us around and got us back to school by lunchtime, it was that close.Do you think that those who fought for a radical and democratic reform of the British political system after the Napoleonic wars would be satisfied with the progress we’ve made since?Good question, Angela. If their time machine dropped anchor in 1945, they’d have been ecstatic. If they got back into the time machine and moved forward to 2018, I think they’d have mixed feelings. Of course they’d have been enervated by the universal franchise, but they would have found it horrifying that people have the vote and don’t vote. They would have found that extraordinary, that working-class people, all sorts of people, don’t manifest their rights.The other thing you get in the film – this is what happened – is you get these working-class radicals, young firebrands, who are not only making articulate speeches, they’re quoting the classics. Don’t forget, there was no education, so they’ve been either self-taught or taught through Sunday schools. Now those people, again, if they got out of the time machine now would be horrified that people have education and they don’t take advantage of it, they are cynical about it.Are you happy?Yes, I am very happy. I am delighted to have lived as long as I have. Not least because my father died after many heart attacks at 71, so I’ve already beaten him by four ye ars. His eldest brother died of a heart attack at 39, his elder brother died of a heart attack at 59, and his sister died of a heart attack at 55. So I’m happy to be alive and I’m happy to have had what I regard as a privilege of having made 21 films without any interference from anybody, which is amazing. And a lot of plays. I’m happy to be a grandfather. I’m happy in my domestic situation. And I’m more than anything eternally gastronomically happy. That is the answer to that question.The wonderful thing about democracy is that everyone counts, everybody has a voice. Making Peterloo, was it difficult to find those inidual voices, and did original accounts and source material help you tell the personal stories and fates that must have been caught up in this epic struggle?Original accounts were very important and very helpful. And it isn’t difficult to find them because a great deal of material is documented: 300 witnesses of the actual event all testified after the event. All the newspapers of the period exist, both in the British Library and the National Archive at Kew, and they were all at our disposal. And although this is not what the question is directly about, I hope that the film that we’ve made gives you a sense of the importance not only of community and society but the strength of iniduals, the inidual humanity, which is what I try and do in all my films.How much did growing up in Manchester shape your politics and the radical tradition?It did, but more by osmosis than by indoctrination. You grow up in Manchester and Salford, you grow up in a world where people tell it like it is – and don’t bullshit. And that has informed not just the way I am, but the way I look at things to some degree. I suppose it has shaped my politics, but I can’t really articulate that.I once heard of a person writing a thesis entitled ‘Beards in the work of Mike Leigh’. How important are beards to you?Beards? Fucking silly question. Beards are not especially important to me, but I do think that shaving is a filthy habit. And I’ve had a beard continuously since March 1967, and my children, who are now in their late 30s and early 40s, used to say they would creep into the bedroom in the middle of the night and shave me. They’ve never seen me without a beard except in photographs.Why did I stop shaving? Well, at that time, if you really want the details, I had occasionally shaved off my beard because I occasionally did a bit of acting. But at that point in the proceedings I was 24 and was working as the assistant director at the Royal Shakespeare Theatre in Stratford, and I knew that I was just going to be a director for ever. And although I don’t have a beard because I think you look more like a director if you’ve got a beard, I do think shaving is a time-wasting, filthy, irrelevant and resource-wasting habit. And I was gagging to stop shaving and I did at that point.Given how long Mr Turner was in your mind before you could bring it to the screen, what’s the next great Mike Leigh film we haven’t seen yet because you’re still waiting for the funding?This is a question with no answer, because the vast majority of my films – the exceptions being Topsy-Turvy, Mr Turner and Peterloo – have been films where I have not said anything about what they were going to be, because they’ve evolved during the process of manufacture. And any future projects come under that heading and there isn’t a nurtured project that hasn’t yet happened.You’ve given me brilliant advice in the past, but what’s the best advice you’ve been given?It’s probably, “Fuck off and don’t waste my time!” Now, that’s a really hard question. If I’m totally honest, Francis, I actually don’t know the answer to that question, so without wanting to sound arrogant, I don’t remember ever having been given what I would regard as brilliant advice. I’m afraid that’s the answer. Peterloo appears to be a bigger, broader film than any you have attempted before, and on an important subject that other directors have avoided. Were you daunted or overwhelmed at any stage about the task you took on? What drove you to see it through?Dick Curtis, posted onlineI was daunted because it is a daunting subject, but the important thing is that, unlike novelists and painters and potters and poets, you don’t make films by yourself. And I work with a really creative and talented and committed team of people – on both sides of the camera, crew and actors. So I was daunted, but overwhelmed no, because I think once you reach the state of being overwhelmed then things have got on top of you and things are going wrong and I don’t think that happened.Your films have contained many career-best performances from actors (Timothy Spall, Alison Steadman, David Thewlis). Did your Rada training inform the way you work with the actors on your films – either positively or negatively?PercyThrills, onlineIt absolutely informs the way I work with actors: it was the starting point and the starting point was negative. In other words, when I went to Rada – and Rada is very different now it has to be stressed, it’s a good school – but when I went there in 1960, what you did there was a very old-fashioned kind of acting. Very external, technical, you never investigated anything, you never asked questions about, “Who are these people?” You never even talked about what happened previous to this action, you never did any research, any improvisation. And I spent my whole time there before I graduated thinking, “It could be better than this.” So it was the starting point for my whole approach to acting and completely fed into how I work with actors.Coming from such an “establishment” middle-class background (father a GP, attended a grammar school and then Rada, then St Martins, then the RSC), why do you think yourself qualified to tell the experience of the working classes when you yourself have never had to struggle?Likewhatever, onlineFirst of all, I don’t come from an “establishment” middle-class background. I come from what you could call a middle-class background because my old man was a doctor. Secondly, I grew up in a working-class area and went to working-class schools with working-class kids and so on. Thirdly, and this is the important answer to the question, I would consider that I am – as any decent artist should be – capable of understanding, sympathising and empathising with all kinds of people. So the idea that because I’ve never struggled – and who’s to say that I’ve never struggled? The questioner doesn’t know enough to make such an assertion, but let’s accept for argument’s sake the premise – that does not disqualify me from making stories about people of all shapes and sizes.You have said: “My job is to liberate the actors and give them immense scope to be creative.” How did this manifest itself in Peterloo? How much creative licence did you afford the actors?Cathy MorrisWell, in spirit I gave them as much creative licence as ever I do, because that’s how it works. It may be that an actor is standing up and saying lines that come from a speech that somebody said 200 years ago, but there’s more to it than just saying the lines in the speech. The question is, “Who is the character? How does the character behave? What is his or her experience? What is the context in which this is happening? How are other people reacting?” And those things have all been arrived at by exactly the same means that I would arrive at any action in any of my films.There’s a scene in Topsy-Turvy where Gilbert and Sullivan are sitting on a sofa and basically Sullivan is trying to say to Gilbert, “I don’t want to compose any more of these trivial works. I want to compose truthful things about life.” And quite a lot of what they say to each other in that scene has been taken from letters they actually wrote to each other, but we’ve made it organic, we’ve stitched together. So rather than just improvise and fix the lines, we’ve assimilated actual dialogue. And famously, JMW Turner apparently said, “The sun is god,” at the moment that he kicked the bucket. It’s obvious that Timothy Spall didn’t improvise, “The sun is god,” because it’s written everywhere you care to look that that’s what he said. But that’s easy, that’s just saying it. The question is, what about the characterisation? The performance? The context? And that can only be approached in exactly the same way that I’d approach characters we are making up from scratch and situations we are evolving from scratch.When choosing a theme to explore for a film, what are the elements you need before you decide it is worth doing?David BuckinghamThis is an impossible question to answer, it really is. Because what I don’t do, that other people making different kinds of films do do, is to say, “This is a theme, let’s build a story around this theme.” Because it’s about people, looked at in various different kinds of ways. What the themes are sort of emerge. Now, of course, I’ve made films that started from a particular thematic premise: Secrets \u0026amp Lies came out of wanting to do something with adoption, because I knew people who had adoption-related experiences. Vera Drake comes out of the fact that I’m old enough to know what it was like before the 1967 Abortion Act when people had unwanted pregnancies and there were illegal abortionists around.But both of the themes implicit in those choices are obvious immediately, without even thinking about it. You just know they come ready made in the human experience, on all kinds of levels. So I suppose I’m saying, I don’t really think in terms of themes, but about people issues. Relationship issues. Society issues. Coping issues.Do you have any movie that you regret making?Taco DiCaprio, onlineNo. It’s the same question as which is my favourite film. To have a film that you actually regretted making, it would have to be a film where the content or indeed the quality of the film-making was so bad that you didn’t want anyone to see it. Or that it was afflicted by so much compromise that, again, you feel you’d rather it didn’t exist. Again, without being smug, I have the privilege of never having made such a film. No film I’ve made has been interfered with.Your films have, at least on one occasion, been compared to Yasujirō Ozu, in the sense that they concentrate on quiet and quaint real-life stories. What were your early directorial influences? And have they changed over the years?Alexander Turner, onlineUntil I was 17, and came to London, I never saw a film that wasn’t in English. I only saw Hollywood and British movies. And I saw a lot of films, I went to the pictures a lot. So my early formative perception of cinema was westerns and other kinds of Hollywood movies and musicals and British films, a lot of British war films. At that stage I was very influenced by Ealing comedies and a bit later by Boulting brothers, and by Powell and Pressburger.Given that most directors work in a very different way from yours, do you find the majority of films unwatchable for being stagey and fake?tommyboy79, onlineNo, I don’t, I enjoy watching films. At this moment, we’re a few days away from the London film festival where I have a free pass, and I clear my diary and watch films of all shapes and sizes because I love watching films, and watching films is as important a part of being a film-maker to me as anything else, just as you would expect novelists to read books and painters to look at art. Of course there are films every so often that I do find fake or stagey, but that’s not an endemic condition of the fact that it wasn’t directed by me.How do you manage to make such depressing films and not end up jumping off a bridge? I do like your films by the way._plank, online_Well, first of all, I can’t swim. Although not all bridges, it’s true, are over water. But I would reject the idea that my films are completely depressing to the exclusion of all else. My films are about humanity and there’s always love and warmth and humour and things that are sad and depressing as well. I’ve never made a film that is exclusively, relentlessly bleak and depressing. So if there is a reason why the reader actually likes my films, despite the question, that’s the reason.I know it’s supposed to be private but did you vote Remain or Leave? What made you go for your choice?compayEE, onlineWhat do you think the answer to that is? Guess! Of course I voted Remain. It was obvious at the time of the referendum that Brexit was a ridiculous, dangerous course of action. But now, two-and-a-half years on, it becomes abundantly clear on a daily basis that this is proved. We are on a disaster course, that’s all I have to say on that.1819: The Peterloo massacre 1919: The Battle of George Square 2019… Where will the riots start?AlexMontrose, onlineThis is a question that is probably more Brexit-related than we care to think. We can’t know where those riots will start, but if they do start it won’t be good news. And I derive no pleasure from constructing the sequence of 1819, 1919 and 2019.Peterloo is released in the UK on 2 November"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/84496f6dc977eba42e2cf061c353b4c930fb4116/0_1901_4616_2768/master/4616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9cba7f9fea45e9ae44f0e8e7db85396b","title":"nigel slater prune recipes","story":"Rich and dark, prunes add a hint of gooey sweetnessSimmered in a good chicken stock, the prune’s dense flesh becomes silky. It was probably the old devils on horseback I had in mind when I added chunks of smoky, fat-marbled bacon and prunes to a chicken soup-stew the other day. A slightly butch version of the classic cock-a-leekie soup, but with the chicken pieces left on their bones, and the skin browned intensely to sweeten the flavour of the broth. We had a thigh and a drumstick each, soft, some caramelised shallots and sweet green leeks with a deep bowl of broth that had both prunes and bacon at its heart.Prunes appreciate dairy produce, which is probably how prunes and custard became a thing and that cream cheese canapé thing came about in the 60s. I have made a prune mousse that worked well, and a prune panna cotta that didn’t. I have often wondered what would happen if you matched prunes and chocolate in a soufflé. Last week I made a prune sauce, with cream and vanilla, to pour over pears I had cooked with star anise and cloves.Get the halved shallots, carrots and chicken a deep, nutty brown in the pan before you add the stock. The flavour of the finished broth will be better for it. Good though this is, I like it even more reheated the next day, once it has time to sit and think, so to speak.Warm the olive oil in a deep, wide saucepan or stockpot set over a moderately high heat.Season the chicken pieces and place them in the pan, turning them from time to time as they turn a deep, even, golden brown. Transfer them to a plate then dice the bacon into short fat pieces and add to the pan, letting it cook until the fat turns gold. Remove from the pan and set aside.Peel the shallots and cut them in half lengthways. Scrub and roughly chop the carrot, then cut the celery into short lengths. Add the shallots, carrot and celery to the pan, leaving them to brown lightly over a moderate heat, turning them occasionally so they colour evenly. When the vegetables are a pale, toasty brown, pour off any excess fat and add the stock, stirring as it comes to the boil, scraping at any delicious sticky goo in the pan so it dissolves into the stock.Return the chicken and bacon to the pan, add the peppercorns, bay leaves and thyme and leave to simmer. Cut the leeks into 2cm lengths and wash very thoroughly in deep cold water to remove any grit trapped in the layers. After the soup has been simmering for 40 minutes, add the leeks and a generous seasoning of salt, then the prunes and continue cooking for 20 minutes.Check the seasoning, then ide the chicken between 4 large shallow bowls, ladling over the vegetables and prunes and stock as you go.As the leaves fall, there always seems to be a plate of pears ripening in the kitchen. I turn them daily, as you would a mango, eating them only when they reach their brief window of perfection. Those that steadily refuse to submit to my pampering end up in the pot, in a light sugar syrup, with cloves, orange peel and a vanilla pod.For the pears:pears 4, large and slightly under-ripe pearsstar anise 2bay leaves 2water 500mlginger syrup 6 tbspFor the prune sauce:prunes 100g, soft dried, stoneddouble cream 100mlcandied orange peel 2 tbsp, choppedPeel the pears, leaving the stalks in place, and lower them into a deep saucepan so they fit snugly. Add the star anise, the bay leaves, water and ginger syrup. Bring to the boil, then lower the heat and simmer for about 30 minutes depending on the ripeness of the fruit. Keep an eye on the pears, piercing them from time to time with a skewer. The flesh must be completely tender, but it is important to catch them before they collapse.Carefully lift the pears on to a serving dish. Turn the heat up and let the syrup reduce to about 150ml then add the prunes and simmer for 5 minutes. Tip into a blender or food processor and reduce to a soft purée. Using a spatula, scrape into a small pan, add the cream and warm slowly over a low heat. Serve the warm pears on plates with the prune sauce. Scatter with the candied orange."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fc7592100259a55930cc442e008b354e4427d0fd/0_0_6582_3949/master/6582.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9db206346ae23f8efa9a62a02cbfa022","title":"busy philipps ive been on three big tv shows but was broke by the age of 28 ","story":"The actor and former teen TV star talks Instagram fame, coming to terms with trauma and how she became Hollywood’s most powerful BFFAs guilty pleasures go, there are some that are painful to admit even to yourself. Not because they’re shameful, but because they’re so mindless that they make you question why you ever even bothered learning to read. Here’s one of mine: every day I go on Instagram and watch Busy Philipps, who is possibly the most famous Hollywood personality you’ve never heard of, doing her workout routine. I don’t follow along at home or anything – this is something she only posts in a 15-second video clip, on Instagram Stories, every LA morning. I just sit there on my London arse while the camera gazes up at her, pushing and sweating and grunting from above, sweeping her blonde hair out of her eyes. And I’m gripped. Why?Well, the good news (or perhaps the bad) is that it’s not just me. A million people now follow Philipps, who first tasted fame acting in teen dramas Freaks and Geeks (as the character Kim Kelly) and then Dawson’s Creek (as latecomer Audrey Liddell), and who more recently played Amy Schumer’s best friend Jane in the film I Feel Pretty. The best-friend zone is where she has been, in acting terms, for two decades, while seemingly becoming the actual best friend of half of Hollywood along the way. (Michelle Williams is her actual BFF.)Yet she never became the lead until Instagram Stories appeared a couple of years ago, and Philipps, who was by now a married mother of two daughters, didn’t need to wait for an audition, and instead began to talk to the camera about her daily life. Not the starry stuff, but the everyday domestic dramas. “You guys,” she always begins excitedly, her best-friend confessional manner treading a fine line between vacuity and brilliance.The New Yorker, a publication that does not tend to obsess over social media stars, declared Philipps to be the pioneer who had made the Instagram Stories format her own. This has led to her writing a memoir, and being given a talk show on the E channel (home of her friends the Kardashians), both of which are about to be launched. And this is where I want to say that one of them, the book, has stopped me in my tracks completely and made me rethink everything we think we know about shiny, sunny social media stars.Reading it felt like a punch in the guts, which is why I have come to Los Angeles to interview her about it, but before we can talk about it properly I have to get through that shiny, sunny personality stuff. Which is tricky because I’m literally halfway through the word “hello” in the café in Los Angeles where we have agreed to meet, when a random woman interrupts to ask me where I got my stripy dress from.I hurriedly tell her it was Zara, thinking I need to get rid of her and start the interview, but Philipps does not mind at all. “I have that dress, too,” she says, before telling the woman that it was last year’s Zara range, though, so if she wants one now she might want to… and so on. I suggest we find a quieter café, so Philipps guides us to a much less popular one down the street, where we head for the shaded back yard which looks empty – oh, apart from two women who immediately jump up to embrace Philipps, because they know her from her work with their LA libraries organisation, one that she actively supports, because her grandmother was a librarian “and the literacy rates in this country are abysmal…” and so it goes on.Busy is busy. Her real name is actually Elizabeth, but her parents nicknamed her Busy and it stuck. This is something you find out at the start of her book, This Will Only Hurt a Little. She continues with some cute childhood anecdotes, how she really wasn’t one of the popular kids at school, the usual rise-to-fame stuff. You think you can see exactly where it’s going, except the childhood stuff then turns, seamlessly, into a description of her mother’s rage, her sister’s rage, of young Busy’s mouth filling with blood in the passenger seat after being smacked across the mouth by her mum, who is driving the car. The part about teenage popularity angst then leads into a description of the boyfriend who ripped the skin off her back by pressing down so hard into her to rape her. How all she could do after it happened, while not even sure if rape was a word that she was allowed to think, was listen to the Tori Amos album Little Earthquakes again and again. She was 14 years old. “And I was a slut. And I was a slut. And I was a slut,” Philipps writes, before saying the memory has messed her up ever since, coming back in the form of night terrors before her wedding, or while pushing her baby out of her vagina with no pain relief. The book’s title is a cipher: it seems it only hurt a lot.We talk about a few other things and Philipps is forthright, chatty, animated. Then I bring up the rape and the different tones in her voice all merge into a crushed monotone.“It was intense,” she says quietly. “It was hard writing a book. It was hard going through that stuff again. Even though I’ve gone through it for many, many years. And then sort of more difficult was that I had never told my family. I just had kept it inside for my entire life. I mean, my husband knew – as an adult I had told people – but I had to have a conversation with my parents about it, and it was really painful, especially for my mother who,” she pauses, “was just devastated, that… she felt like she had failed me.”Hollywood’s engagement with the #MeToo movement began one year ago, after many women spoke out against Harvey Weinstein. Consent has since become a huge topic far beyond Hollywood, and not a straightforward one, as our societies begin to examine and discuss its shifting boundaries. One reason Philipps’s book interests me so much is that she is fearless in examining her own agency in what happened. She no longer blames herself for what her boyfriend did, but she is also quite clear that she was the one who initiated the sexual activity, that she was trying to play tough, and that she tried to continue the relationship with him afterwards. This story will be familiar to so many women who have quietly felt that if they called the guy afterwards, it can’t have been rape, right? Wrong, says Philipps.“I think, culturally, we have come so far since 1994,” she says, referencing the year it happened. “I mean, we’re talking about a time when, you know, Bill Clinton put a cigar in a girl’s vagina and she was the slut. Consent wasn’t talked about in the same way that it has been recently. It has shifted so drastically, which is incredible and fantastic, but it means that until recently, I had taken on a lot of the onus for what had happened. I just felt like it was mine to hold. It wasn’t anyone else’s. I had done this thing.”Several names had to be changed before she could publish the book. “But maybe at some point that guy will recognise himself in the story and maybe he’ll think about it, and, you know, come to terms with my experience. Maybe he won’t. I truly believe that he and I probably hold completely different recollections of the events. And for me, at this point, I understand that. But it has taken me… wait, how long?” – she thinks back, counting through her age – “it has taken me 25 years to understand.”Philipps grew up in Scottsdale, Arizona, in a pretty normal family, far away from the bright lights of celebrity that she craved. She was massively keen to take acting classes as a child, and worked her way into what might sound like a grim job to many – pretending to be a live Barbie doll at a toy convention in her town – but which would prove to be her big break, as the CEO of Mattel turned up with Sharon Stone, who told Philipps that she was very talented and going to be a big star some day.She applied to various colleges in Los Angeles and got into the Jesuit college Loyola Marymount with good grades, but not quite the exceptional ones they required. This was because she hand-delivered her application, and walked straight up to the head of admissions, who took a shine to her.While in college she was cast in Freaks and Geeks, in which James Franco played her boyfriend. He does not come off well in the book – at one point during a rehearsal she describes how he throws her to the ground unexpectedly and she weeps in pain. The crew were shocked. “But James is a movie star,” she writes. “He was horrible to me, yes, but he’s also gorgeous and charming as hell.”She tells me that she came into acting around “a bunch of male actors who had read the book Easy Riders, Raging Bulls, and they thought, ‘Oh that’s the way to be a man and an actor.’ It’s about those sort of golden years of, you know, manly man actors, De Niro and Al Pacino and the making of Taxi Driver and The Godfather, and their immersion into the roles and their whatever.” She sighs. “Sometimes I think male actors just take issue with the fact that their job is putting on make-up and pretending.”Acting was never a solid income for Philipps, whose husband, screenwriter and director Marc Silverstein, is also dependent on the same wavering industry. She writes in the book about her money fears, which is why she now does paid posts for brands, for which she has taken some flak. “People fundamentally have a really misguided idea about your wealth because you were on a huge TV show. I’ve been on three big TV shows and I was broke by age 28. I’d be stupid not to do paid posts, I think.”She says she had a “weird sort of stalkery troll at one point that was upsetting me and making me feel like, ugh, I shouldn’t do this at all”. Then there’s the fact she puts her kids on there, too. “Sometimes I question Marc and my early decision to allow our children to be on my social media. But ultimately, I’m OK with it and they’re OK with it.” She thinks about this. “I go back and forth. I think everyone has that inclination, at one point or another, to delete everything and disappear.”She will turn 40 next year, and she has this whole new chat show to herself. Julia Roberts will be among the first interviewees, and Busy is also longing to get Oprah. Does this finally feel like her big moment? She says no, it’s just one of a lifetime of moments. “I think my friends and I have had discussions lately where we’re waiting for life to get easier,” she says, “and we’ve all had the recent realisation that it never does, not for anyone. And once you have that realisation, it’s incredibly freeing.”Of course we’re all old enough to know that Instagram influencers don’t really have the perfect lives they seem to, but it sure helps to hear one of them admit it. Her book doesn’t end with her marriage being all rosy, but with the couple going into therapy and Busy admitting she recently almost had an affair. Philipps also admits she started talking to Instagram because she was a new mother, lonely and lost. “I wasn’t looking for millions of eyeballs,” she tells me. “I was sort of just looking for one. You know what I mean? Just someone. We’re all just floating out there in the ether. Is anybody out there?”The last chapter in the book is her favourite. It also contains her discovery that her highly intelligent mother, who lived with a lot of simmering anger, had actually wanted a whole other life, but her dreams had been shut down in a job interview after college, by a man who put his hand on her knee and said she was too pretty for a career. “The humiliation – I just, I really feel for her still. Like it’ll make me tear up” – she looks like she might cry – “that she put her dreams on hold because she was told by some dude, ‘Nope, not for you, honey.’”Suddenly everything makes sense. I look at Busy Philipps advertising a pizza with her kids, and I know she’s doing it to wield her own money and power. Because underneath even the smiliest of online influencers lie generations of women’s fury. And those gym videos? I no longer see a perky blonde in a crop top. What I see is a woman looking down from on top, the female gaze not the male one, while she builds muscle memory to replace her body’s other memories. I see a woman strengthening her arms so that nobody can ever throw her down and crush her again.This Will Only Hurt a Little by Busy Philipps is published by Sphere at £16.99.Production by Stephanie Porto styling by Erica Cloud set design by Cooper Vasquez hair by Kristin Heitkotter at TMGLA makeup by Jamie Greenberg at Wall Group using Chanel hair by Kristin Heitkotter for TMG using Oribe and T3."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c92a3f220bdd1c99c8cb10d823b6bc1fa1eda3e9/0_87_1733_1040/master/1733.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f1cef98ebb03bf4e9f0aab975a46e79f","title":"is my child old enough for a mobile phone","story":"No matter when parents choose to entrust their offspring with a smartphone – and it very much depends on the child in question – there’s agreement that boundaries about usage must be establishedThere are many milestones in the relationship between parents and their children. The first step. The first word. The first time they turn to you and say: “Please stop, you are embarrassing me.” To these, we can now add the moment a parent solemnly hands their child their first mobile phone. But what’s the right age for this to happen? According to Dr Linda Papadopoulos – a child psychologist and ambassador for Internet Matters, a not-for-profit organisation dedicated to children’s online security – the beginning of secondary school is a good starting point. “It makes them contactable and means they can get in touch with their parents if things go wrong,” she says. “A lot of their peers will get a phone at that age, so it means they can communicate with their friends and feel part of that.” Some believe that the right age may be even earlier. The moment when children start travelling alone on a regular basis is a commonly recommended start point for a phone – which in some cases could be a year or two before or after they start secondary school. Sean Hargrave, a tech journalist and father of three, says: “It’s when your children are spending more time on their own. Their independence and geographic borders start to widen, so it makes sense to trust them with a smartphone.” Statistics suggest that most parents tend to agree that secondary school is the right age for a phone, with a July 2018 survey of 1,000 parents by Tesco Mobile concluding that the mean age most think a child should have their first phone is 11. But a mobile is more than just a phone, it offers access to a multitude of information and ideas. Much of this is positive – a child can use the phone to look up bus timetables and talk to friends, as well as let adults know when they require the parental taxi service – but parents still need to remain engaged, continually talking to children about their internet use and monitoring the sites they access and the amount of time they are online. For this reason, some experts suggest that there’s no such thing as a right age for a phone, with it depending entirely on the inidual child, the parents and the circumstances.  “When a child first receives a smartphone is a parent’s choice,” says Andy Burrows, head of child safety online at the NSPCC – which has introduced a guide to children’s online safety called Net Aware. “What’s most important is that mums, dads and carers have early conversations with their children.” For Papadopoulos, it is essential to have these conversations. These shouldn’t be lectures, but instead should encourage a child to think critically. “Until now, they will mainly have communicated face-to-face now they are communicating using texts, memes and emojis. What does it mean if they send a picture to one friend and not another? How do group chat dynamics work? Invite them to talk to you and think about these things.”  Having seen three children reach an age where they are entrusted with a phone, Hargrave has had some testing moments, but also feels children get a lot from their new devices. “They are using them for so many different things – they might be playing games, making films, watching TV, chatting to friends, researching homework,” says Hargrave. “It’s not just sitting in an armchair tapping screens. One of my kids makes films, another does arty stuff, one researches astronomy. They are a force for good, it’s just about having parameters.” And once the boundaries are established, children will be better equipped to enjoy their new device no matter what their age. Encouraging a healthy dynamic around mobile phone usage might even be easier if children get their first phone at a younger age. Hargrave believes that retaining parental access to the phone is essential, which is easier to do with an 11-year-old than a teenager. “The phone is a great safety device and it’s also great for them to communicate with their peers, but you need to keep an eye on it,” he says. “You need to have a conversation, let them know you will look at their phone periodically. You should only do it when they are there and the phone is in front of you. It’s not right to rifle around behind their backs.” It’s natural for parents to worry about their child in any new situation, and mobiles are no exception. While that can be mitigated by the use of parental controls and location tracking, these technological solutions don’t absolve parents from the responsibility of parenting. “We know that this is something parents worry about,” says Papadopoulos. “Up to now, everything the child has done the parent will have done first. But now the child will be using apps the parents have never heard of. It can make us feel insecure. But you do need to engage. You can’t just say: ‘I don’t understand.’ That’s not good enough. You need to understand, you need to get on the apps and figure them out for yourself.”Visit Tesco Mobile for more information and content on families and mobile"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cdbf79728fe1b052ae2e3d67fb45248b0ae7a5fe/0_2099_4672_2803/master/4672.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0120a147f680ba3ba1b92962b23427f5","title":"switch off your phone and start bonding great ideas for family nights in","story":"Cutting down mobile usage is a great way to create family time. Here are the best TV programmes, films and games to enjoy with your family this autumnTrying to find more family time together by limiting your mobile phone usage is a good thing, and experts increasingly agree that it’s important to establish family ground rules for phone usage. Family tech expert Andy Robertson and Tesco Mobile’s new contract for mobile phone usage is designed to help families set healthy limits. It’s a great way to increase the amount of time you have to spend together, particularly as there are absolutely loads of brilliant new family-minded games, films and TV to enjoy on a night in this autumn. Here is our pick of the best.Keep Talking and Nobody ExplodesGame, PS VR  Oculus Rift  HTC Vive  Samsung Gear VRStrapping on a VR headset sounds like a fairly efficient way off blotting out one’s family entirely, but there are a few games designed with social, on-couch multiplayers in mind. Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes puts the headset-wearer in the reinforced boots of a bomb disposal technician. They must then describe said explosive to their teammates, who issue increasingly tricky instructions to disarm it from a manual. Cue much filmic “the red wire!” “which red wire?!” bickering and a fair bit of genuine tension. With VR headsets now affordable to those without hereditary peerages, this could be a fine reason to invest.Monster HuntFilmYou could settle for the latest po-faced superhero smash-em-up that plops from Marvel’s blockbuster-peristalsis machine, but it doesn’t hurt to go off-piste with your movie-watching from time to time. And Hollywood is far from the only place producing epic family movies. Spirited Away or Howl’s Moving Castle – any of Hayao Miyazaki’s oeuvre, really – offer just the right balance of whimsy and menace, but for sheer epic scale, try Raman Hui’s charmingly weird action-comedy, and its barmy $150m sequel (Monster Hunt 2). The plot about monsters and humans happily coexisting until they don’t is basically nonsense, but you get a lot of bang, fart jokes and spectacle for your buck.Wynona EarpTV show, Netflix  SYFYThink Buffy on a budget and you’re in the right area. Wild west moustache enthusiast Wyatt Earp was in fact a demon hunter, you see. His curse – the curse of having to shoot demons in the middle of the face – was then passed down through his heirs, until it landed in the lap of Wynona, a wisecracking, leather-jacketed ex-juvie tearaway with a penchant for booze and thumping people. The show’s tone is on the mature end, but is light enough for most young teens, keeping its scares, sexual references and profanity just on the correct side of Mary Whitehouse. It’s a ton of knockabout, demon-slaying fun.PandemicBoard game, 2-4 playersThere is nothing – nothing – more certain to trigger a weeks-long Christmas-ruining family row than a “friendly” game of Monopoly. But the award-winning Pandemic is not your classic, dog-eat-dog board game – it places its emphasis on cooperation, rather than crushing your enemies before sullying their honour with a thumb-and-finger L on the forehead. The setup, admittedly, is bleak: four diseases have ravaged the Earth, and it’s the players’ job to work together to find the cures. You may just save the world. At the very least, by leaving Monopoly languishing in the cupboard where it belongs, you’ll definitely save your family harmony.Brooklyn Nine-NineTV show, NetflixThe Lonely Island’s Andy Samberg is Jake Peralta, an affably man-childish detective in the fictional 99th precinct’s weird melting pot of eccentric coworkers, pop culture references and inept crooks. The gags come thick and fast (Google “Brooklyn Nine-Nine I Want It That Way” for an idea of what to expect) the characters are all lovable and, refreshingly, kind and content and tone never ventures beyond 12A. Plus, the majestic Terry Crews is in it. Oh, did we mention it’s funny? Well it is. Very.Mario Party SwitchGame, Nintendo SwitchFor anyone unfamiliar with the series, this is essentially a virtual board game whose cutesy wickle graphics disguise a brutal crucible of tactics, skill and white-hot rage, as you battle through its dozens of infuriating, competitive mini-games until a winner is finally crowned. You will laugh. You may cry. Be warned, though, you’ll probably also swear.Lost in SpaceTV show, NetflixA Netflix original that seems to have been buried by the critical adoration achieved by some of its stablemates, Lost in Space is a beautiful, mega-budget 4K TV production aimed squarely at the family market. The Robinson family are part of an expedition to find humanity a home beyond the stars, until all manner of problems leave them ... yep, you guessed it. Far superior to the iffy 90s film, this reboot delivers family drama, a delectably evil baddie in Parker Posey’s Dr Smith, and a giant robot saying: “Danger, Will Robinson!” And, crucially, Matt LeBlanc is nowhere to be seen.Visit Tesco Mobile for more information and content on families and mobile"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/53efb5bcbe0e31b0cd8cd53a12a39d55b697f039/1167_388_793_476/master/793.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a83244ae88d43ef66f040b233427c664","title":"teens without screens one familys attempt to rein in mobile phone usage","story":"How would writer  John Lewis and his family fare when they tried to limit their mobile phone usage? We challenged him to limit his family’s mobile usage for a week. Could it bring them closer? This is his diary.SaturdayWe are sitting down to dinner, all four of us, something that only happens a few times a week. My 13-year-old son Harry has his headphones on and is giggling at a YouTube video on his phone, occasionally getting cables caught up in his fork. My 16-year-old daughter Laurie is also multitasking as she eats, scrolling through memes on Instagram and getting flecks of fish curry on her screen.This is no way to eat a meal.My wife and I once tried restricting mobile phone use. We turned off the wifi at night, but my children used their phones in bed and ate through their data allowance in a couple of days. Looking at my family, though, it’s obvious we need to address the situation again. This time, we’ll do it using the “contract” about family phone usage that Tesco Mobile has devised with family tech expert Andy Robertson.“Right,” I announce, in my best Victorian Father voice. “The entire family is going to reduce its reliance on mobiles.”After much mocking laughter, we eventually agree on some basic rules. No phones at the dinner table. We will try to limit our mobile phone use. The children won’t accept friend requests from – or talk online to – anyone they don’t know. And this time, to avoid nocturnal data problems, everyone will leave their phone in another room when it comes to bedtime.SundaySitting on the sofa, I realise that I am baffled by what my children really do while pretending to watch their favourite TV shows.“What are you actually looking at?” I ask my daughter, whose face is glued to her phone.“Just … stuff. Instagram. Tumblr. WhatsApp. I can’t actually watch TV on its own. I have to have something else to do.”“This,” says my wife, “is why I used to smoke.”To distract our children from their phones, we play board games for the evening. It actually works – although, after an hour of hilarity and excitement, the game descends into rage, bitterness and tantrums.MondayWe are on holiday abroad. Within minutes of stopping at a restaurant or museum, the children have worked out the wifi password and are busy scrolling through Instagram and watching YouTube videos.So we pledge to completely avoid phone use when out and about. For a couple of hours, this is great – they engage with the sights, photograph buildings, ask questions and patiently listen as I bluff my answers. And then we get hopelessly lost and end up having to resort to Google Maps to navigate our way around the city.TuesdayIt is evening in the holiday apartment, and we play cards. As the only games we can actually play are Snap and Go Fish, we try to learn the rules to poker. Of course, we have to look them up online, on our phones, and have to repeatedly check back on whether a flush beats a straight.WednesdayWe continue our lengthy poker session. My wife and I are surprised when my son clarifies some of the more arcane rules and then explains, in great detail, how to play a variant of poker called Texas hold ‘em. It turns out that he has been playing a Texas hold ‘em app on his phone for much of the day. We have unwittingly created a gambling expert.ThursdayThanks to this experiment making me engage with my children’s phone usage far more, I realise that I now know what my children actually do on their phones. My son plays ridiculous shoot-em-up games, discovers obscure music on Spotify and YouTube, and watches endless drumming tutorials. He is also adept at quickly looking up information to use as ammunition in an argument, making him invariably right about all sorts of things.My daughter is scrolling through endless memes on social media and watching episodes of John Oliver and Trevor Noah giggling at comedy videos about history or playing logic puzzles or quizzes on the Sporcle website.During our holiday she read an entire playscript in German on her phone. Frankly, this is a relief. My wife and I have long lived in fear that dark forces on the internet could be preying on her, so we’re far happier with the German theatre discovery.FridayThe week is now over. Cutting down on phone use has not been easy. You realise how reliant we are on them for things such as maps and basic information.But I’ve realised something: there’s no problem with this. The problem is the kind of listless, passive reliance on your mobile for the sake of it. Restricting phone use actually reminds you that the internet is quite amazing. You could be learning Italian on Duolingo, teaching yourself how to change the oil in your car using an online tutorial, reading thousands of academic papers, or watching countless arts documentaries.I pick up my phone, flick through social media and consider getting into a furious political argument with someone on Twitter. Instead, I put the phone away and start reading a book. I should do this more often.Photography: Laura McCluskey for Visit Tesco Mobile for more information and content on families and mobile"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f6f7e9bb2f89fb18b7f1ef29ef458154fa425f8d/0_300_1893_1136/master/1893.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=79bf84af48974f093f7638373272bfc7","title":"art of speaking up for yourself","story":"In an age of blanket social media use, getting your voice across has never been more important or difficult. But what are the secrets of winning over your audience?Over the years, comedy scriptwriter Heidi Ellert-McDermott must have put thousands of words into mouths more famous than hers. But even she didn’t find it easy to stand up and make a speech at her own wedding.“Even though I felt like I’d written a good one, I was still surprised on the day that I was nervous,” she recalls. “I suddenly found myself thinking, ‘Whoa, it’s my turn’ and the nerves overwhelmed me. It’s only now that I understand a few techniques people should use – and one of them is not alcohol.”A wedding is one of the few times even those genuinely terrified of public speaking can’t decently get out of, a time-honoured trial of nerves for the self-conscious. But the growing willingness of women to opt in even when tradition allows them to duck out – think Meghan Markle proposing her own toast after marrying Prince Harry this spring – suggests a wider cultural shift. To have a voice, to speak up rather than sit there mute, feels increasingly charged and significant. And not just for women, but for anyone who might previously have struggled to be heard in public life.“The good thing about a bride’s speech is there are no rules. You can choose to take on some of the duties of the groom or just do something off the wall – tell a story, do a poem, whatever,” says Ellert-McDermott, who now runs Speechy, an agency producing bespoke wedding orations that is receiving an increasing number of inquiries from brides-to-be. “We all know the statistics about how few female speakers there are at conferences. Well, this is one area where women actually do have the control and can put themselves on the lineup – and that’s why it’s disappointing when brides don’t even consider it.”Public speaking can sound like a rather stuffy skill, redolent of dreary Rotary Club dinners and those polishing future ministerial CVs at Oxbridge. (William Hague, Boris Johnson, Michael Gove, the education secretary, Damian Hinds, and universities minister, Sam Gyimah, are all former Oxford Union presidents for the sake of ersity, former leader Michael Howard was president of its Cambridge equivalent.) This kind of formal oratory isn’t dead, of course just think of Johnson packing in the crowds on the party conference fringe or the hitherto obscure attorney general Geoffrey Cox QC’s positively Shakespearean warm-up speech for Theresa May a few weeks ago. But the bad news for the one in four who (according to a 2014 survey by Chapman University) is frightened of public oratory is that speaking and presentation skills matter well beyond the obvious fields of politics and the bar. They regularly come close to the top of employer wishlists when hiring and, if anything, matter more for the self-employed when pitching for work, money or just a higher profile in a world where the art of self-promotion is constantly evolving.Twenty years ago, TED was a fairly obscure annual technology conference held in Vancouver. Now it is a global brand, its 20-minute talks from experts on everything from architecture to the female orgasm downloaded more than a billion times. From podcasts and vlogs to pop-up feminist salon nights where anyone can take the mike, Generation Z is developing new ways to speak, debate, argue and raise professional profiles.“Some people are wary of being the person who loves the sound of their own voice, but I think that has become quite old-fashioned now,” says Viv Groskop, the standup comedian and author of the forthcoming How to Own the Room: Women and the Art of Brilliant Speaking, who runs workshops coaching businesswomen on public speaking. “Now that you can broadcast 247 on YouTube or Instagram Stories, there’s a whole generation who are not afraid of their own voice and wouldn’t even understand the sort of 1950s concept of ‘don’t be the one who’s always talking out of turn’. People want to own the room but not be obnoxious about it, let other people have their turn too.”What they do worry about, she says, is doing it memorably enough to be heard. “In this particular post-#MeToo moment, women don’t worry so much about what they’re going to say. They know exactly what they want to say and they’re going to say quite a bit about it. But they want to say it in such a way that it’s powerful.”And that raises serious questions about who has the skills and the opportunity to speak up. In theory, anyone can just nominate themselves to do a TED talk, or chip in at a meeting. In practice, it’s rarely that simple.It’s a long time since Margaret Thatcher was advised to lower her voice by an octave if she wanted to be taken seriously but women may still have to work slightly harder than men to sound authoritative on a stage, according to research suggesting a lingering subconscious association between deep voices and leadership. (One study of 792 male chief executives, in affiliation with Duke University, found the ones with lower voices led larger companies and made more money.) Prejudice also lingers around regional accents, with the BBC political correspondent Chris Mason recently admitting he was told as a young journalist that he’d never get on the radio with his Yorkshire Dales burr, while the shadow education secretary, Angela Rayner, is dogged on social media by people suggesting her Mancunian vowels somehow make her sound “thick”.Planning in advance for how you’ll cope if something goes wrong helps considerably, says Groksop, as can simple tricks such as speaking more slowly than feels natural or doing breathing exercises before going on stage. But arguably the best means of conquering fear is practice, and the earlier it starts the better. Rhetoric, or the art of oral persuasion, was taught to ancient Greek and Roman students as an essential tool for taking part in a civic life, in a culture where written texts were still relatively new forms of communication. To this day, a nodding acquaintance with Cicero or Demosthenes remains a staple of a classic public-school education (the old Etonian Tory MP Jesse Norman once explained his alma mater’s dominance of politics by arguing that it excelled both at letting pupils take the initiative and at “things like rhetoric and poetry and public speaking and performance”).Schools such as Eton no longer have a monopoly on perhaps the most valuable skill gained from learning to debate – developing the critical thinking skills needed to formulate an argument in the first place. Godwin junior school is a large primary school serving a relatively deprived area of Forest Gate, east London. More than a fifth of its pupils have free school meals and more than a third don’t have English as a first language. Yet, two years ago, it won the national schools debating cup organised by Debate Mate, a not-for-profit organisation that sets up debating clubs, hosted by students from top universities, in inner-city schools.“Our school is about preparing pupils for lifelong success and a lot of research shows that it’s not just academic results that count. They’re very important, of course, but it’s also about children and young people being confident and articulate,” says the headteacher, Sine Brown. “Whether it’s job interviews, university interviews, starting your own business and wanting a loan to do so, it’s not just what you put on paper – it’s how you present yourself. The debating club helps develop confidence and articulacy and we’ve really seen the difference it’s made to our children.”The club is popular, with about 80 children enrolled, and Brown thinks it has boosted their self-esteem. “It’s about our children knowing that they’re as good as anyone else, as capable of holding a room. To be 10 or 11 and stand up in front of a roomful of people you don’t know and present an argument not only teaches them a skill but gives them a mindset. The shift is, ‘I can do this.’ Those children you might not naturally think would gain a lot, you can see it in their confidence, in the way they hold themselves. You can see they feel they have a right to be heard.”The bonus, she says, is that learning how to marshal evidence, and how to predict and counter opposing arguments verbally, has also improved the children’s written work. The advantage of teaching children not merely to speak in public but to debate is that it encourages different ways of thinking, according to Jessica Rolfe-Dix, a former teacher and managing director of Debate Mate.“We have a thing called points of information – interruptions from the other side – and if you don’t accept them then you don’t get as high marks,” she explains. “You see them listening and then having to respond. That skill is one they’ll take into university or the workforce – it’s being able to not fold under pressure and to take a challenge in a non-confrontational way.” For some older children growing up in London’s “postcode wars” between rival gangs, she says, debating competitions are one of the few chances they have to mix safely with teenagers from other estates. For others, learning to anticipate and rebuff the opposition is an early exercise in staying one step ahead of the argument, which is perhaps why university debating clubs have traditionally been such a training ground for politicians.The Labour MP and former education minister Kevin Brennan doesn’t have the traditional background some might expect for a former president of the Oxford Union. The son of a steelworker and a school dinner lady, both of whom left school before 16, he was the first child from his school to get into Oxbridge. But as Brennan puts it, “Being from south Wales I was used to the idea that you should be able to orate, to speak, to use language to persuade people. And one thing I did feel going into that environment as a young man was that most of the people who went to university weren’t geniuses, but a lot of them had been imbued with a great degree of self-confidence, not always justified, by their educational backgrounds.”He resolved, he says “never to let that group of people lord it over others because of that confidence”. What the union gave him was the chance to learn from the cream of guest speakers. Brennan still remembers the former Tory MP Matthew Parris giving a “brilliant” speech about being gay, without ever specifically mentioning that he was gay (this was after all the early 80s), and the formative experience of debating alongside Neil Kinnock: “I learned from him how to use a little bit of humour to make your point – Neil was very good at that – and something about the rhythms of speech. He was of that old-time, chapel-preacher-from-the-valleys tradition, brilliant at speaking without notes.”Brennan taught for a while after graduating and introduced a debating club to the comprehensive he worked in. “What I tried to do was to say, ‘Yes, it’s important to be able to present your views on world peace or whatever, but actually what really matters is if someone challenges your views, can you defend them?’ Because that means you understand them.” It is this ability to confront and dismantle counter-arguments, rather than simply clinging to the line, that arguably distinguishes political sheep from goats.The classicist Mary Beard once argued, in a lecture for the Almeida theatre’s Figures of Speech series, that political oratory in the strict sense died when politicians stopped writing their own speeches. Audiences could, she argued, tell the difference between a leader articulating their own thoughts and one speaking someone else’s lines.No modern leader has time to write all their own material, of course. Arguably, though, big set-piece political speeches no longer matter as much as we tend to think. Croaking through a party conference speech while the set collapsed around her did not finish Theresa May off in 2017, while this year’s infinitely better performance hasn’t magically revived her either. Donald Trump is a terrible speaker but, if anything, his fanbase sees that as a mark of authenticity.Yet shining in a televised debate – as Nick Clegg famously did in 2010, or Nicola Sturgeon in 2015 – where politicians have to think on their feet can still be a game-changer. Short, highly emotive outbursts in parliamentary debates increasingly have the capacity to go viral, too. (Think Anna Soubry furiously pointing out that Brexiters on her own side won’t be the ones losing their “gold-plated pensions” if it all goes wrong or those clips of Jeremy Corbyn at prime ministers’ questions that do so well on Facebook.)The prepared speeches that still make the hair rise on the back of one’s neck, meanwhile, tend to be those that aren’t just selling a policy or playing to the gallery, but actively confronting elements of the audience. Kinnock’s extraordinary denunciation of Militant Tendency Hugh Gaitskell’s “fight, fight and fight again” speech on nuclear disarmament Margaret Thatcher’s declaration that the “lady’s not for turning” Robin Cook’s resignation speech over Iraq – all are examples of speakers tackling more than just an abstract argument.“Speeches where you’re genuinely trying to persuade and change the opinion of the room are more electric,” says Brennan. “If you’re just preaching to the faithful and pushing their buttons, that’s a different thing from when there’s a transformational issue at stake and the leader is trying to lead people somewhere they didn’t know they wanted to go.”And that’s perhaps the difference, in the end, between giving a great speech and genuinely owning the room. The former is nerve-racking for the speaker. But the latter is not wholly comfortable for the room. And that’s what makes the question of who gets to be on the podium in the first place so significant. Who, exactly, is now afraid of whom?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/22a8c82bef2c3138e0fb16eae73d0fd615b643c7/0_227_6734_4041/master/6734.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4e0b9350e474fa1c5a3a614d2ae79b4a","title":"if only our love of all things camp was more than skin deep","story":"The mainstreaming of camp must not smother our bigotry with a piece of chiffonThe category for next year’s Met Gala is… CAMP. I gasped, theatrically, with joy when I read this news, despite having been NFI for the past three years and indeed ever, and despite my only interaction with this annual fashion party being a feverish bitchiness the next morning scrolling bitterly through Instagram. I am, however, very good at fashion parties, please note this, Anna Wintour. I’m very complimentary of other people’s shoes and happy to eat most canapés. Once, when I was aged approximately 21 and slightly high on mini burgers and free cocktails, I shot flirty smiles to a handsome guy on the other side of the party for hours before realising he was a catwalk model projected on the wall. My eternal catchphrase: “Dignity, dignity, dignity.”2019’s Met Gala theme, which relishes ironic irreverence, has a particular resonance today, when international politics appear to be hurtling as one into the toilet from Trainspotting, and when it’s not just the guy with a sandwich board outside Topshop promising the end is nigh. In 1964, Susan Sontag was the first to write seriously about the meaning of camp. “The essence of camp is its love of the unnatural: of artifice and exaggeration.” Camp embraces dissent. Like a kitten with a mouse, it plays with serious things until they become “dethroned”. And, today, it can be found everywhere, from the obvious places, like smash TV show RuPaul’s Drag Race, to the more surprising, like Ikea, where I stood for some time last week in front of one of its new 80s-influenced floral Ektorp sofas, performing a thinking pose. Not only has Ikea brought back the chintz it once urged Britain to “chuck out”, but it has collaborated with a ceramics artist on the funky Foremal collection, which it describes as: “Pretty. Ugly. Lovely.” Ikea is embracing bad taste, and so, camp.But for most of us, the word is most commonly used to mean “obviously gay” – a man that isn’t performing masculinity in an approved way. I’m reading Quentin Crisp’s autobiography, The Naked Civil Servant, at the moment, and there it is on the first page – in the 1930s he describes himself as a “self-evident” homosexual. He wore make-up – he took violent risks. “Camp is esoteric,” Sontag continued, “something of a private code, a badge of identity even, among small urban cliques.” It’s because of this that the mainstreaming of camp bothers me, just a little.Camp culture, once a refuge for people that were unwelcome in public life, has become accessible to all. Like the drag balls that started as havens for black queer people (minorities within a minority) but have now become so popular (with Drag Race and Ryan Murphy’s Pose) that their language of fierceness and queens has been co-opted by straight whites across the western world. Which is fine and lovely, as long as we straights acknowledge the bigotry that meant these places, now held up as glamorous and aspirational, were the only rooms in which some were allowed to be themselves.We can’t have it all. This summer the biggest ever survey of the UK’s LGBT community reported that more than two-thirds of respondents had avoided holding hands with their partner in public despite the public’s love affair with camp, homophobia is alive and well beneath the surface. It is easy to embrace camp as a straight white person, to play with it, try on the feathers – we risk nothing. Before the straight world is allowed unfettered access to gay culture, we should earn it.But as fashion party themes go, this is far more interesting than this year’s tarts and vicars experiment. And, as feminist theorist Judith Butler argued, drag stars and as reveal the “hyperbolic status of the norm itself”, the fakeness of gender roles, the depths of our everyday performances, with the make-up, the smiles.Will the 2019 Met Gala cause a mass realisation among its guests and on Instagram, as the very weight of campness that night topples everything we thought we knew about our own identities, about what it means to be a woman? That would be nice. More likely, but no less excitingly, we will see Rihanna as Louis XIV, and Lady Gaga will wear a wig that looks like Putin, and there will be meaningful commentary about fashion as a powerful political tool and also some fabulous gossip from the smoking area about you-know-who’s you-know-what.Despite my discomfort at the way many of us swish through gay culture, taking what we please and disregarding the rest, I can only hope that this mainstreaming of camp does not sanitise it, or rid it of its essential tension, nor simply cover our remaining bigotry with a piece of chiffon. Instead, may it work to confront homophobia and throw us forward into a time when prejudice is dead and intolerance dissolved. But, a word of warning across the years, addressing the army of models lining up to be dressed in dresses printed with pictures of a dress, from Sontag herself: “You can’t do camp on purpose.”Urban Outfitters is selling an ‘Influencer’ Halloween costume. It consists of 1 x bra-top and 1 x leggings. Brings new meaning to the term ‘ghosting’.Opening this week at the Studio Voltaire gallery in south London is the Oscar Wilde Temple. It’s half art show, half church, and visitors are invited to use the temple for LGBT rites, including vow renewals and transgender naming ceremonies. Proceeds go to the Albert Kennedy Trust, a charity that helps the LGBT homeless. Get married in a gallery of martyrs, beneath the deity of Oscar Wilde.A week before the royal baby announcement, Princess Diana’s psychic, Simone Simmons, told the Daily Star Meghan was pregnant – ‘something about the look on her face’. In past conversations with Diana (deceased), Simmons learned ‘she doesn’t believe Meghan’s the one’ and that she would’ve backed Brexit.

A week later he wanted me back and expected me to jump at the offer and so began a long summer of him emotionally abusing me. We eventually stopped talking altogether but, after a while, I reached out as I wanted him back in my life. I arranged to see him and I told him everything that was going on in my head. He ended up kissing me which I did not expect. We had such a good day, everything felt natural and I was so happy. He came back to mine and kissed me again – he was initiating everything.He then left mine and went to the pub where he got with someone else. He posted on Instagram a pic of the two of them together and has still said nothing to me, three days later. He left me on such a high, thinking we could be getting back together. I haven’t been able to sleep. I’m going crazy. It’s destroyed me. I want to scream and shout at him, but I also have nothing to say. He clearly doesn’t care about my feelings. What do I do?Mariella replies You know the answer, don’t you? There’s no way you can have typed out that letter to me, forcing you to dwell on recent events, and not realise that there’s absolutely nothing about this man that’s worth clinging on to. Clearly there’s a physical attraction, but if he remains the puppet master, plucking away at your emotional strings without a care for your wellbeing, there’s zero chance of ever achieving happiness together.It’s startling how quick we are to condemn the behaviour of others – but even swifter to forgive the trespasses of those we’ve linked our emotional fortunes to. Even after describing his behaviour as emotional abuse you still can’t give up on him. What is it you are hoping for? Happy ever after? Total change of character? Contrition for his selfishness and betrayal?The truth is we’re all fools for love because our insecurities shout so much louder than rational thought when it comes to matters of the heart. If someone treats us badly, the easiest thing in the world is to allow their behaviour to merely confirm our own poor opinion of ourselves. You won’t be the first or last person to make excuses for a lover who has brought you down so low you believe it’s your destiny to survive on scraps of affection. But it’s not good enough to act like a bystander in your own romantic life, mentally or physically.Expressing surprise about this guy kissing you is offloading responsibility for your own complicity. You’re right that his interest in you is natural, but whether he’s a loyal, respectful and reliable man is entirely different. If you’re not prepared to make your needs clear and stand by your principles, you leave scope for philandering fools like him to break through your defences.In this instance I’m afraid you’ve netted a big fish. You’re not going crazy – you’ve been treated badly by someone whose sole focus is his own immediate gratification, which is bound to cause sleepless nights and emotional agony. That’s hardly the foundation you want to build a relationship on or the sort of guy you want to “hitch your wagon to”, as the saying goes. So I hope you haven’t written to me in the hope that I’ll dissect his recent behaviour and come up with plausible excuses for why he would carry on thus. We both know that the answer is simply because he can.Through her art her pain was writ large, not just because of her near fatal accident and subsequent disability, but because she’d hitched a ride with a man who was passionate about her, but loved himself more. When I first watched the movie I was captivated by the charismatic and corpulent Rivera and moved by the tragedy of his insatiable weakness for female flesh. Watching it again with my daughter I felt my reaction then – to accept that such a man needed to sate his desires – had been primitive. In the film, equality between them was illustrated by Kahlo embarking on the odd liaison of her own, proving she could do likewise. My daughter was not similarly understanding and kept asking, why did Kahlo put up with that big, fat, lascivious fool? I didn’t have an answer.Our world is no longer ruled by power-abusing men and their desires are no longer what we shape our lives around. In this landscape, mooning around over a guy who isn’t worth an hour of your thoughts, let alone three sleepless nights, is simply not OK. There are billions of better men to choose from on our overcrowded planet, so you don’t have any excuse for settling for less than you deserve."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fb44dfbecec2ae14aa804d6a3622101b981d5617/474_945_4232_2539/master/4232.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b6be6177664f38f032cddc2b084e1fd2","title":"j laverack bicycle review wonderfully poised and balanced ride titanium","story":"Titanium-framed and built for adventure, the bikes of this young British firm are as tough as they are good lookingJ LaverackPrice from £3,550, jlaverackFrame titaniumGears Shimano UltegraWeight 9.2kgIn the early 80s, there was an advert for Ford’s Sierra. It featured a laughably square-cut box on wheels plunging down a steep mountain road. A gravelly voiceover told us: “This aerodynamic car has been shaped by the wind.” As the Sierra roared off into the sunset, the voice summed it all up: “It’s man and machine in perfect harmony.”Last month I took part in Revolve24 – an endurance event in which 82 deluded souls rode round and round Brands Hatch for 24 hours in search of… I’m really not sure. Some sort of oblivion, I suppose. That tagline from the Sierra ad kept floating into my mind. One of the more esoteric pleasures of cycling is the unbreakable bond you form with your bike. That probably sounds weird, but ask any rider and they’ll tell you they experience moments of pure communion with their machine. I know people who genuinely love their bicycles. After a nasty orce, one friend told me that there were times when he was riding when the unsullied rapport he experienced with his bike was the one true relationship in his life.The bike I rode during Revolve24 was a J Laverack. From the get-go you can immediately see it’s a stunning machine. If you were to have only one true relationship with your bike, this would be a good one. J Laverack is a young British company set up by Oli Laverack and Dave Clow a couple of years ago. It’s based in Rutland.Oli spent a lot of his time building and perfecting his own bikes and finally decided to take the plunge and turn his hobby into his career. He took inspiration from the heroic era of cycling at the turn of the last century when riding 24 hours would have been no big deal. Oli’s grandfather Jack Laverack, after whom he named the company, was one of those granite-hard Yorkshiremen who relished riding on rough, potholed roads and tracks to discover new places and adventures. He’d set off early in the morning from Great Horton, West Yorkshire, on his own or with friends, and carrying water and some jam sandwiches. He’d return late in the evening having often ridden more than 100 miles to the coast and back.It was this sort of riding that Oli and Dave wanted to pay homage to when they created their own four-season bike. The frame is made from aerospace-standard titanium. The top tube flattens slightly in the middle, while the seatstays and chainstays arch towards the rear axle. It’s all very shapely, but this also, crucially, provides clearance for wider tyres and mudguards. Mounts for a rack can also be provided. Once you are in the saddle, you’ll find it a wonderfully poised and balanced ride. At just over 9kg it’s a little heavier than some bikes out there, but its all-round comfort and bump-swallowing abilities are remarkable. Componentry is of the highest order – you can work with Oli and Dave to have your bike fitted out just as you would wish – right down to personalised graphics and even bespoke frame painting.Special mention has to go to the Brooks Cambium C15 saddle. It looks rubbery and unforgiving, but even after sitting on it for 24 hours my backside looked… well, less baboon-like than I feared. Oli is full of small helpful details. He told me, for instance, that the best way to give the titanium that special lustre is to rub the frame with baby oil. I told you cyclists really love their bikes…Email Martin at\u0026nbspmartin.love@observer\u0026nbspor follow him on Twitter\u0026nbsp@MartinLove166 This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

She tells Rachel Cooke how she found her true sense of selfIt goes without saying that there’s more to Mary Portas than her hairstyle. But her Belisha beacon bob makes for an arresting sight at the open-plan offices of her communications agency in Bloomsbury, London. Surrounded by desks, computers and smiling younger people, she strikes you as by far the most fascinating thing in the room – and that’s even before you get to her wacky jeans, their legs as wide as sails, and her knuckle-duster, satellite dish-sized rings that might have come from an auction of the effects of Dame Edith Sitwell. “No, it is not,” she says, when I joke that her hair is her superpower. Nevertheless, she knows precisely the effect it has both on herself (energising) and other people (mesmerising). She can’t work when it’s not right – though when she shakes her head to demonstrate what this state of affairs might look like, it’s impossible not to notice that every hair returns instantly to its place, as if by special command.Portas travelled here this afternoon on a Limobike, a mode of transport she favours for its efficiency and, perhaps, its style. She isn’t always in the office these days, but her new book is about work, and she wanted me to see the light, airy, strictly non-hierarchical space she describes in its pages. “Why would anyone not love coming here?” she asks, waving a jangling arm in the direction of her colleagues. Portas the agency, whose clients include Westfield and Mercedes-Benz, and which has 52 employees, specialises in shopping. “Our goal is to connect you to a brand emotionally,” she says, jabbing a finger at the table at which we’re perched on stools for everyone to see (there are no side offices she works alongside everyone else). “But it’s not just a case of getting you to buy more. It’s about getting you truly to love a brand.” Her clients, however, shouldn’t make the mistake of thinking she and her company are two separate entities. They aren’t. “They won’t see me often because I’m behind-the-scenes creative, and they shouldn’t expect me to network and have nice lunches with them because that’s a waste of time, and something that I hate, and I’m not going to do it just to make them feel good.”Work Like a Woman is a memoir-cum-self-help manual in which Portas aims to show how businesses might become less “alpha” and more woman-friendly, a process she began to put into practice at her own company five years ago, when she stepped down as its CEO, having decided she would be better deployed as its chief creative officer. Henceforth, she and her colleagues would work more meaningfully, with profit no longer the bottom line. Her book is full of advice for working women, some of it practical (she has much to say about improved flexible working and how it might best be achieved) and some of it – as even she admits – just a touch Oprah Winfrey (there’s quite a lot of goofy stuff about taking your “whole self” to work). At its heart, however, lies a personal crisis, one born of fame and success – and it’s this story that will perhaps most pique the interest of the reader, however much you might be looking for advice as to how to secure a hefty pay rise and a seat on the board.“Look, I’m not going to do an Arianna Huffington,” says Portas, with a grin and a camp eye roll. “I didn’t fall over and bump my head and wake up with these ideas overnight. It was a gradual process. But yes, it began after I went on the telly. I was in the public eye, I was making more money, it was extraordinarily exciting. But at the age of 48, I also found myself crying every day. Obviously, I thought: ‘What’s the matter?’”At first, Portas had relished her television career, which began in 2007 with Mary Queen of Shops for the BBC, in which she helped to turn around struggling fashion boutiques (she was discovered by the late Pat Llewellyn, who brought us Jamie Oliver). She knew she was good at it. She was also, at 46, old enough for it not to turn her head (she still had her business, then called Yellow Door).“But they just want more and more of the same,” she says. “I fell out of love with it.” As she notes in Work Like a Woman, the nadir came in 2012, when she fronted a show for Channel 4 in which she and Gordon Ramsay ran a hotel (celebrities worked for them, as well as 14 unemployed young people, two of whom would get a job with her or Ramsay at the end of it). It was broadcast live over five consecutive nights, and on each and every one of them she would get home to find her partner, Melanie Rickey, looking miserable. “Her expression said it all: ‘What on earth are you doing?’” Feeling she was in danger of becoming a caricature, she reached her crisis point.She did do some television after this, but much, much less than before (today, she still gets four TV offers a month her agents are always begging her not to turn everything down). Meanwhile, after some deep thought and a lot of scribbling in an orange notebook, she set about rearranging her life and her business. For the agency this meant, among other things, creating a profit share, bringing in a “menu” of options for working parents (the company provides emergency childcare and even night nannies), and encouraging the practice of “radical candour” the boardroom table would now be round, rather than rectangular.For Portas herself, however, it was all a bit more fuzzy. “I am a woman,” she says. “So it’s a question of how do I want to work as a woman? What is that internal vibrancy that makes me happy when I work that way? You could say this is about being yourself.” In the 1990s, when she worked at Harvey Nichols as the department store’s creative director, joining its board even before she was 30, she adapted to “alpha culture” in order to get on (she also, incidentally, wore flat shoes whenever she was with particularly short male colleagues).But she knows now that this isn’t for everyone that alpha culture prevents some “incredible talents” from rising to the top. Nor does it allow men to express their “feminine traits”. What are these feminine traits? Having read her book, a lot of it seems to have to do with intuition and gut feeling. It seems not to occur to her that this might be just another form of stereotyping.Can the high street be saved? “It completely can, but we need politicians to understand its role, and we need to create destinations people love. Don’t start with the shop. Start with the crèche that’s perhaps attached to a shop. The council could give it a tax break. Then a coffee shop will grow up beside it. When we opened Harvey Nichols in Leeds we were paying no rent at all, we were so wanted. I looked out of the window and thought: ‘What have I done?’ But of course the others soon came in their droves.”She sounds so confident as she tells me all this, even a little bullish. You would never know how bruised she still is by the press she received after the government asked her to look into the issues affecting Britain’s high streets in 2011 (the Portas Pilot Towns, where her ideas were tested, were widely criticised shops in many of these places closed rather than opened, and some thought the budgets had been misused). “I was really hurt by it,” she says. “Of course I’m glad I did it. The issues did join the public agenda. I mean look at Margate now. It has totally changed. But… I went in with a touch of hubris when they said they’d call them Portas towns.”No wonder she cleaves to her vastly more successful project for Save the Children, a new type of charity shop designed to inspire and work as creative community spaces (Mary’s Living \u0026amp Giving Shops). “I’ve got 26 of those now. Save the Children has made £15m from them.” The only TV project she really longs to do – this one is her idea – would involve setting up Britain’s first charity department store in, say, an empty House of Fraser.Her honesty about the high street project is, I think, all of a piece with her straightforwardness and warmth. If Portas is bossy and occasionally controlling, she is also generous and kind, stoical and brave. The defining event of her life came when she was a teenager in Watford. When she was 16, her mother died suddenly of meningitis. Two years later, she lost her father, too, at which point she and her younger brother, Lawrence, became homeless, their stepmother having thrown them out. Portas turned down a place at Rada to look after him – her three older siblings were at university – and embarked on what would become her long career in retail. (She worked first in window displays at Harrods and then Topshop.) “It made me,” she says, of this period in her life. “It just totally did.”The other day, she went to the funeral of a friend of her father’s, someone she knew as Uncle Harry long ago, the two men had come to England together from Ireland to work on the buses. It was with Harry that she and Lawrence lived for a year after her father died. “You don’t forget that. They put us up in their tiny council house, and they had four kids of their own. At the funeral, I experienced such a huge tug.” People she spoke to that day remembered her as the “naughty one”, but when push came to shove she simply got on with what she needed to do. What’s odd is that she never felt resentful. “I don’t think I’ve ever resented anything. I was just trying to survive. I was petrified: this horrible, nervous energy.”Telling people in her world wasn’t particularly easy. “I had to tell my family, and they had seen me only as one thing,” she laughs. “I could see this slight disappointment in my sister. I think she’d thought I was going to end up with some high-flying businessman.” And, of course, people talked – even in the supposedly liberal realm of fashion. At a charity dinner, she sat next to a well-known tycoon. Just before she went on stage to give a speech, he turned to her and asked: “Tell me, Mary: how do two women fuck?”When she and Mel converted their civil partnership to a marriage, one of the first lesbian couples in the UK to do so, most of the letters she received were from women thanking her for her openness and honesty.The couple lives in Primrose Hill, north London, and have recently bought a second home in the Slad Valley in Gloucestershire. In her book, she refers several times to her Catholic working-class roots – her mother was so devout she once genuflected in the aisle of a cinema by mistake – but she isn’t one of those people who likes to insist that, no, she has not really changed at all. In fact, she can hardly recognise the girl she once was.“If you had told Mary Newton at 15 what life she would end up leading, she would not have believed you. I am a completely different person now. I genuinely do think that a person can have more than one life.” Again, she shakes her head again, every last hair snaps to attention. And, as I watch this happen, I realise she is that rare and marvellous thing: at once both a brilliant invention and yet, somehow, so completely and utterly herself.We don’t need suits to be part of the tribe, says Mary Portas in this extract from Work Like a WomanI’m tempted to take off my whole outfit and start again as I stand in front of the mirror, dithering. Do the flowery trousers work? Are the rings too much? Do I need to tone the whole thing down? I really need to decide because I’m running late. It could be 1978 all over again.But I’m not a teenager about to go on a night out. I am a 50-something mother of three who has run her own business for years, and is now often asked to give business talks because I’m an expert on the retail sector. I’m doing one today and will go on stage after Liam Fox MP. He’s sure to be wearing a grey suit and most of the audience will be, too. Grey suits are the accepted uniform of working men in positions of power. The most daring it gets is a purple stripe in a tie, perhaps a flash of a coloured sock. So what I’m wondering is this: what will they make of me when I appear on the podium in floral trousers and a cobalt blue jacket?Will I fit into the tribe? Then I find I don’t care. It’s taken me a long time not to care, to come to understand who I am and feel confident enough to look the way I do. I leave the house knowing that what I’m wearing is a reflection of me: colourful, confident and slightly flamboyant. This is my kind of outfit and I’m good at what I do and sure of what I’m talking about. I don’t need a suit to impress people or feel part of their tribe.But we all grapple with questions like these almost every day. Humans are tribal. Even if we’re not a complete fit for the group we’re part of, we like to create social groups with rules we understand and can work to.Similarly, when MPs examined what was holding women back in the intelligence services, they identified an immovable layer of middle management with a traditional male mind set. They also saw an alpha male management culture that rewarded those who were loud or aggressive in pursuing their career, leaving others behind.But alpha culture is not always found in the most obvious places. It can hide itself well, too. TV production or tech offices might be full of free-thinking creatives who enjoy the onsite yoga studio and napping pods, but don’t mistake a progressive top layer for real change.Just ask Apple. In 2017, the company unveiled its new California campus, for 12,000 employees, which had taken eight years to build. It was so carefully thought out that even the stone covering the gym walls in the 100,000ft fitness and wellness centre was ‘from just the right quarry in Kansas, and has been carefully distressed, like a pair of jeans’. Fabulous attention to detail, Apple. Imagine how long it took to dream up that one. Strange, then, that no one managed to think about putting any childcare facilities on site. The combined minds of 250 architects and countless Apple bosses didn’t think to build any. And what they implicitly communicated to their employees by focusing so heavily on design and gym facilities was that beauty – be it the building’s or the staff’s – was important. The ability of their employees to integrate their working lives with those minor, messy responsibilities called children was not.But let’s be clear here: women don’t get a free pass on all this. Alpha culture might have been put in place by men, but we’re also working alongside them and, in many cases, perpetuating the status quo.Now if there weren’t many women working, I might be able to understand why the culture of how we work hasn’t really changed over the past few decades. If, say, there were just a few of us in the workforce and the rest of us were sitting around posting pictures of cushion covers on our Pinterest boards I could maybe grasp why adapting our working culture to better reflect and reward women’s strengths might not be considered a priority.But we’re half the workforce and only a third of its managers, directors and senior officials. That’s rubbish by anyone’s standards. The workplace is still working against us and, as much as I respect Sheryl Sandberg, who argued that women need to adapt their behaviour to better suit the status quo, I’m more of a Gloria Steinem fan. ‘It’s not about integrating into a not-so-good system,’ she said. ‘It’s about transforming it and making it better. If women have to acquire all the characteristics of a corporate world, it’s probably not worth it.’ Too right, Gloria. I don’t want to lean into a system that is entrenched in a working world that’s quite frankly dated, limited and controlling. It’s bloody well time it changed.Work Like a Woman by Mary Portas is published on 1 November by Transworld at £12.99.

And it’s not that it isn’t tempting…When we had our baby, a lot of our family and friends started asking if we’d return to Ireland. Some skipped the doubting phase altogether and plainly asserted they’d see us back before long, as if the mere sight of his cherubic brow would cause us to quit the misery of England, the packed streets and our little flat. It was alarming to hear this refrain come from so many mouths, but more alarming still was the fact I started considering the question myself.To some extent, it’s a hangover from the bad old days, when Irish expats had it harder than we do, and the long bound homeward was all they ever wanted. Every Irish person had an uncle who’d moved to England in the 1960s, and ended up living with 20 other lads in an electrical box in Clapham, forced to shave four times a day just to give himself room enough to smoke.England, we were told, could be fierce cruel, and made it hard on decent young skins who only sought to escape the stresses, depression, and leaping contests which blighted rural Ireland at that time. This was the generation of hardy Irish souls who earned their tuppence cleaning quarries, or folding pylons together with their bare hands. And it was these who pined for home, telling anyone who’d listen how much they missed the old sod, via heart-breaking love letters or long, drunken, 4am phone calls that often broke out into stirring ballads.It’s fair to say my wife and I have it easier than our forebears, but the question now is less about hardship and more about seeking those comforts of home. To be closer to family would be great, but the pull of home is, to some extent, a pull toward my own childhood.Imagining my son living on my old road, or going to my old school – and I can’t avoid seeing him doing so with my old school friends, crudely squashed to toddler size in my imagination – is a function of my fear of not being up to the task of fashioning for him a life so different from my own.As it begins to dawn on me, however slowly, that I will be in charge of this small man for a long time, the mind reels for ways to lighten the load. How reassuring it would be to find a version of parenting in which I always had an existing blueprint to consult, a template over which I could trace his every milestone, each a fuzzy facsimile of my own. Rather than carving a whole new path, I could pop him on those same familiar rails, give a gentle nudge, and retire to a safe distance with a podcast and a cup of tea.There are many good reasons to consider moving back, this just isn’t one of them. The fuel of nostalgia is the fear that any future you make for yourself can never live up to the past. In truth, wherever you settle, you can build your life anew, even if that means starting small in Hackney. Our home may not be an electrical box, but we can scale up to that eventually."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0d926f6fddc4d5daa76b16f2e3d69d067e31b894/0_636_4480_2687/master/4480.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b0090e7fc1cba546701f7363cb24fe9c","title":"beastie boys book memoir interview","story":"Between breaks from goofing around, the two surviving members of the band talk about writing a new memoir, their rollercoaster career and coming to terms with the loss of Adam Yauch• Read an extract from Beastie Boys BookTo call someone a “boy” when they’re over 50 is disrespectful. Except that Mike “Mike D” Diamond and Adam “Ad-rock” Horovitz, the two remaining Beastie Boys, are almost parodically boyish. They don’t look or act middle-aged at all. Diamond, 52, has slightly spiked dark hair and is so skinny, his waistline appears to be the same size as a normal man’s upper thigh. Horovitz, 51, is grey, but his hair sticks up any old how, and he also has a teenager’s habit of yanking his face about, pulling stupid expressions to make himself look ugly (which he is not). Both are dressed in leisure wear – T-shirts, loose-ish trousers, trainers – and both are defiantly, hilariously un-adult. This interview is like having a conversation with my 12-year-old son and his mate. Meaning it’s really fun (I’m often almost crying with laughter), but it’s scattershot, and rarely serious. Everything the Beasties say is true, but most of it is jokes.We’re in a suite at the Bowery hotel in New York, to talk about Beastie Boys Book, a new memoir of their time in the band. The book opens with a lovely piece from Horovitz about Adam “MCA” Yauch, the third Beastie, who died from salivary gland cancer in 2012, aged 47. Yauch was, writes Horovitz, the kind of friend “that gets you motivated. The one that not only gets themselves going and doing great things but says: ‘We should all get together and do this’… The friend that makes it happen. The friend that inspires you to go big.”The former hardcore punk band exchanged one sound of rebellious partying for another – hip-hop – and created a frequently hilarious debut album with producer Rick Rubin. With hits like (You Gotta) Fight for Your Right (To Party), a VW-symbol-nicking but knowing frat-hop was born. It was the first hip-hop album to reach No 1 in the US charts.The band’s second album was guilty only of maturing too quickly for fans who wanted Mike D, MCA and Ad-Rock to keep playing dumb. A lush mesh of samples and crate-digger aural collages courtesy of like-minded helpmeets the Dust Brothers, the eclectic and seminal\u0026nbspBoutique\u0026nbspremains a high point of Beastie musicality.Having expanded their brief to include a label and magazine, the Beasties’ commitment to visual culture hit a lofty peak when director Spike Jonze made the clip for probably their most exciting song. Starring the band as mustachioed 70s cops foiling a drug deal, the Sabotage video inspired, among other things, the opening of\u0026nbspTrainspotting.One of two Buddha-facing tracks on\u0026nbspIll Communication, this Yauch punk-hop tune reintroduced the Beasties not as public nuisances but as spiritual badasses. On the same album, Sure Shot featured a rapped apology for past sexism. In 1996, Yauch organised the Tibetan Freedom Concert the trio would continue to espouse progressive causes. Yauch practised Buddhism until his death in 2012. Al-Jazeera affectionately called him “Muslim Americans’ hero, and America’s personal Jewish Gandhi”.Another inspired pastiche video for another classic single, this time off the\u0026nbspHello Nasty\u0026nbspalbum, which brought dub reggae and Brazilian tropicália into the band’s palette. Intergalactic, though, was pure dumb Vocoder-assisted electro-pop that borrowed from Stravinsky and went on to win a Grammy, one of three the Beasties accrued. The video marked the directorial debut of Nathaniel Hornblower, Yauch’s visual alias.This late record was, in part, the Beasties’ homecoming reaction to 911 and the gentrifying original capital of hip-hop. It was political, but fun. Right Right Now Now contains perhaps the most Beastie lyric ever: “I’m a funky-ass Jew and I’m on my way,” brags the ever-nasal Ad-Rock, “And yes I got to say ‘fuck the KKK’”. Lean and uncluttered, TT5B was the beginning of the end for the Boys, with just one more album to come: Hot Sauce Committee Pt II - a parting shot delayed by Yauch’s battle with cancer.Go big is what the Beastie Boys did. Against all expectations, three white middle-class New Yorkers with mixed, mostly Jewish, heritage and a punk-rock sensibility became, for a 1980s moment, the biggest rap band in the world. And after that – this is the really strange bit – they managed to continue making music and create a 30-year-plus career. “Lucky?” says Horovitz. “Yes. Our music is weird. It’s not pop. I don’t know why so many people buy our records.”The book took them four years to complete and tells the Beasties’ story from pre-1981, when Diamond formed a hardcore band with friends, including Yauch. Packed with photographs, diagrams, maps, cartoons, recipes, lists (some great music ones), as well as some brilliant writing from them both, Beastie Boys Book is a delight. But, God, getting either Diamond or Horovitz to talk about it is nigh-on impossible.Mostly, the interview goes like this: I mention an anecdote, or a particular time in their career, and then they mess around. So, when I ask about Diamond’s late-1980s habit of wearing a Volkswagen badge as a medallion (as he does on the book’s cover), he and Horovitz have a lengthy debate as to whether either of them actually wrote anything specifically about the VW badgemedallion thing. Then…Diamond: “It was just one of those things that happened… Adam and Adam showed up at my apartment in the West Village with one and they were like: ‘Here, you’re wearing this.’”Horovitz: “That’s not really how it happened. Didn’t you steal it? You kind of stole it.”Diamond: “From you? I stole it from you? Is that what you’re saying?”Horovitz: “Well, I stole it from… Maybe we should not talk about this.”Diamond: “Just because there’s a lot of thievery involved.”Horovitz: “And the down coat…”Horovitz: “Who are you describing right now? Who is that?! What happened to your arms?”See? They’re like kids avoiding a have-you-done-your-homework question. Especially Diamond. His mind bounces between subjects like a well-flipped pinball. In any other profession, Diamond would be seen as an eccentric.“Mike is the craziest person,” says Horovitz. “He’s scattered, he’s all over the place. When you hold him down and tell him: ‘This is what you’re doing,’ he’s fantastic. But you have to hold him down. Like when he had to write his verse for Hello Nasty, we had to take his phone away to get him to do it. That’s what he was like about writing this book. We hid his phone.”Diamond: “I have a short attention . It’s because I’m used to making records. That gratification. You press play, and you listen back and you’re like: ‘Oh I could dance to this,’ or: ‘God, really? I spent two days doing that?’ Immediate feedback. But when you just sit there on your laptop writing for two days…”Perhaps unsurprisingly, then, although the writing is shared pretty equally at the beginning of the book, Diamond’s contributions drop away towards the end. He kept finding excuses. He has two teenage sons (he shares custody with his ex-wife Tamra Davis) and likes to spend time with them. He lives in Malibu and they all do a lot of surfing: “Surfing can actually monopolise all my time,” he says gravely.“Look, getting my sons out of bed and out of the house every day is such an effort that I feel I’m done by 8.30am,” he says. This makes it seem as though he’s too exhausted to do anything else, but actually, Diamond is really busy. He’s into wine (he curated a wine list for a new LA restaurant), he’s designed expensive “grown man bags” (he shows me a leather wallet from his collection), he’s made music for fashion-house art events and has been a cultural ambassador for Mercedes-Benz. He produces other bands (Slaves and Portugal. The Man), he recently did a DJing tour, he has a weekly Beats 1 radio show, The Echo Chamber. Though he’s a master of distraction (he spends 15 minutes at the start of our interview wondering what to get for breakfast: “Order eggs, Mike,” says Horovitz wearily), Diamond actually enjoys being absorbed, transported by something that moves him creatively. When he’s excited, he’s all in.In contrast, Horovitz enjoyed the writing (“It was very easy, I really liked it”), and has concentrated on completing a lot of the other legwork: sourcing photographs, tracking people down. Aside from all that, he has a little boy with his wife, Bikini Kill’s Kathleen Hanna, and he and Hanna write screenplays together (they sold a pilot to Comedy Central). He’s played bass in Bridget Everett and the Tender Moments and he acts, much to Diamond’s amusement. “Did you know Adam was in a semi-pornographic movie in 1984?”When I ask Horovitz how he spends his days, he bristles, a teeny bit. He’s naturally more private than Diamond. “Well, I don’t know about Mike, but I’ve been writing a book for the past three years,” he says. “I’m renting a house in Pasadena with a swimming pool, so take a guess… uh… I’m working on a soundtrack for a friend’s movie, which I don’t think he’s ever going to finish, so, if anybody needs like an hour’s worth of Casio music, I’ve got it.”Diamond: “Adam makes it sound like he does nothing. But he’s on a caffeine-fuelled rampage at 6.30am with his emails.”Horovitz: “First thing in the morning, boom. Get it done. Boom, boom, boom. After that, I like to hang out… Hey, you know what? We just got Jarvis Cocker to read for the audio book, the British section.”Back to the book. Their first idea was to have the whole of it written by friends, but “for so much of our lives it was just us three,” says Horovitz. So he and Diamond thought of all the stories they wanted to tell, “and then we’d look at each other and be like, ‘I don’t remember any of this.’” Because of this, their friends’ takes still feature heavily. Director Spike Jonze gives extended photograph captions. Kate Schellenbach, from Luscious Jackson, a Beastie Boy herself from 81-86, writes a truthful and lovely essay. Fashion guru André Leon Talley analyses their style, very dismissively. It all adds up to what Mike calls “a chunky tome”: a scrapbook of experiences, a multilayered non-definitive history. Not like a usual rock biography.“No,” says Diamond. “I read Graham Nash’s on holiday. You know, for research. He was embittered for like 7,000 pages… All these books are terribly serious. But when you’re in a band, so much of the time, honestly, it’s an absurd comedy.”Horovitz: “That, and hanging around waiting for everyone to decide where they want to eat.”All three of the Beasties grew up in New York, and all went to small liberal schools. (Horovitz’s was so liberal it was called the City-As-School.) Yauch was an only child Horovitz and Diamond were youngest children. They all had a lot of freedom. “By the time I came along my parents had had enough,” says Diamond. “It was just like, ‘Go do what you’re doing, just don’t get into so much trouble that I hear about it.’” Horovitz: “Nobody said, ‘You need to be home before 3am on a Thursday.’”New York at that time was rough, and most of the middle class moved out when they had kids. “We were the weirdos that grew up here,” says Diamond, who remembers being taught by his mum what to do when (not if) he got mugged. “She was always like, ‘Remember. Put the money in your sock.’ I was like, ‘Why? Won’t they check there too? Are feet just too gross even for muggers?’” No mobile phones back then, of course, but this, they feel, was key: everyone was more connected with their surroundings and Horovitz, Yauch and Diamond would hear music everywhere, coming out of cars, in shops, from boomboxes.“The only way that we could have become the band that we became is because New York at that time had everything going on,” says Diamond. “Now, you can get every song that ever influenced us on this phone, but at that time, New York truly was the only place in the world that had this confluence of all this different kind of music. New-wave stuff, no-wave stuff, post-punk, then the beginnings of rap. Dub, jazz, salsa, whatever.”The young teenage Beasties would go out downtown, meeting at gigs or clubs or a record store, the Rat Cage. “You’d cut school and go to the Rat Cage because you knew someone would be there,” says Horovitz. The next generation after the crowd containing Andy Warhol, Jean-Michel Basquiat, Keith Haring and Blondie, they were allowed into nightclubs such as the Mudd Club and Danceteria even though they were underage, just because people liked them. Inspired by hardcore bands such as Bad Brains, Diamond started a punk-noise band when he was just 14 that morphed into the Beastie Boys (Diamond, Yauch, guitarist John Berry, Schellenbach on drums). Horovitz was also in a band, the Young and the Useless, but replaced Berry in the Beasties in 1983. Soon after, hip-hop hit downtown, the Beasties saw Afrika Bambaataa DJ at a club, and, writes Diamond: “All we wanted was to be our own version of the Treacherous Three.”As they became more enchanted by rap, they realised that they needed a DJ. Through a friend, they became involved with Rick Rubin, a strange, long-haired Long Islander who was a student at New York University. Rubin had turntables, and a big record collection they all chose breaks and the Beasties began to rap over the top. Gradually, Schellenbach was eased out (Rubin didn’t like female rappers: all the Beasties later acknowledged that this was “shitty”), Rubin became their producer and onstage DJ, and the new Beasties persona began to emerge: a bratty, fratty mickey-take of adolescence, their nasal raps backed by big rhythms and noisy guitar riffs.Rubin introduced them to Russell Simmons, brother of Rev Run of Run DMC. Simmons and Rubin formed a new label, Def Jam, and brought out the Beastie Boys’ first album, Licensed to Ill, in 1986. With its single (You Gotta) Fight for Your Right (To Party!), the LP was like a call to arms for amped-up teenagers. The jokes became bigger and more stupid. The Beasties’ tour boasted an enormous hydraulic penis and go-go dancers in cages they were banned from a hotel chain the British tabloids wrote that they were the “world’s nastiest pop group” and that they made fun of children in wheelchairs (they didn’t). Horovitz was arrested for throwing a beer can at fans (he didn’t). The silly fun turned sour. Horovitz: “All of sudden we were the Sex Pistols.”They had thought that everyone was in on the joke, but the line between parody and truth is a tricky one to walk. Diamond: “At first, it’s really funny and totally sarcastic. And then it becomes reality and you become part of that. It never dawned on us that it would become our job. To be these guys throwing beers over each other night after night…”The Licensed to Ill era came to a sticky end in 1987, with all three of the Beasties unhappy and barely speaking to one another. Not only were they sick of being a no-longer-funny punchline, they were skint – whereas Rubin and Simmons had made a lot of money. Simmons tried to use this as a bargaining tool to get the Beasties to make Licensed to Ill Part Two.“Russell was like, if you don’t go in the studio, then I’m not paying you,” says Diamond. “His calculation was that we would all be like, ‘Oh we want our millions. OK, Russell we’re going to do it.’ But we were all immediately, ‘Fuck you.’”Now they have no hard feelings towards Rubin and Simmons. “But that’s because it all worked out,” says Horovitz. “Had it not worked out, had we broken up in ’87 – and we never got paid by Rick and Russell and Def Jam – it wouldn’t be fine.”It was a rough time. Yauch started another band. Diamond did too. And Horovitz went to Los Angeles, to make a film (Lost Angels). While there, he came across some musiciansproducers called the Dust Brothers. It was their music that got him excited and brought the others over to the west coast.The subsequent LA years were crucial ones for the band. Their follow-up album, the immensely expensive and now-much-loved Paul’s Boutique, was a flop, and Capitol, their record label, was no longer bothered. They were left to their own devices. “Paul’s Boutique was a bust, right?” says Horovitz. “That was a bummer. We didn’t pause on it for a long time, we didn’t go through therapy, but it was weird. And because it was a bust, we didn’t go on tour. So we just started making Check Your Head (their third album) at my apartment.”For a time, all three Beasties lived in a crazy Hollywood mansion, complete with swimming pool and a room full of 1970s clothes, which they wore to celebrity parties. But after a while, they split off: Yauch lived solo in an art deco-style apartment block, Horovitz in the Hollywood hills with his then-girlfriend Ione Skye, and Diamond in the Silver Lake neighbourhood with Davis. They all made music, but they also all skateboarded, and everyone smoked a lot of weed. I was vaguely friendly with Diamond in the mid-90s, and I remember going over to his home one afternoon after lunch. I had two tokes on a joint he rolled and couldn’t use the phone. “Oh yeah, that was the crazy strong pot, the one that we grew in the yard,” says Diamond. “Hippie Steve, our pot dealer, gave me the seeds and I just threw them in the ground.”Somehow, despite the omnipresence of weed, the Beastie Boys got things done. They wanted to be “entrepreneurial, but not exploitative”, and set up all sorts of side projects. Diamond created a clothing line, X-Large, which offered cargo trousers and logo T-shirts it had a spin-off for women, X-Girl, designed by Sonic Youth’s Kim Gordon. All three Beasties started a record label, Grand Royal, which released albums by Luscious Jackson and Atari Teenage Riot. And they also put out a brilliant, though shortlived magazine, also called Grand Royal, which featured articles on Bruce Lee, Lee Perry and the joy of the mullet haircut. Yauch became involved in the Free Tibet movement and staged several fundraising concerts. All of this creativity was germinated in an old plumbing factory they called G-Son (the “e” and “l” had fallen off the original Gelson sign). It had a big room with a skateboard ramp and half a basketball court, and lots of smaller ones that led off a corridor.During the LA years, the Beasties became more than just musicians. “We never thought we were musicians,” says Horovitz. “We just thought we were in a band.”What’s the difference? “Well, everyone in downtown New York was in a band,” says Diamond. “Nobody could play, but everyone was in a band.”Jean-Michel Basquiat came by when he was in LA, wanting to produce Check Your Head. He wasn’t the only one. You could link the Beasties of that era with Q-Tip, Spike Jonze, Sofia Coppola and more. An interview at the time said: “It appears as though everyone under 35 who is doing anything creative in New York or LA is at some point sucked into the Beasties’ vortex.” During the 90s, the Beasties’ downtown New York creative mix – music, clothes, film, magazines – came to fruition. New York created the Beasties, but LA let them flourish.And that way of life – working on music, but also other interesting side projects and political causes – became how the Beasties lived. After Check Your Head, there was Ill Communication, which gave the world the hit Sabotage, and then the blockbuster album Hello Nasty. The Beasties were, once more, one of the biggest rap acts in the world. The band became, as Horovitz puts it, “something that we could all come back to when we wanted and needed it”.Their last album, Hot Sauce Committee Part Two, came out in 2011. A year later, the death of Yauch changed everything, as you’d expect. They don’t write about this much in the book.Horovitz: “There’s a lot of personal shit that we just don’t talk about. I don’t talk about my mom dying and Mike doesn’t talk about his dad dying, or his brother. Because it’s nobody’s business, except who we choose to make part of that business. Do you know what I mean?”Diamond: “Also… it’s really hard. It’s a tremendously sad thing. We never anticipated experiencing this incredible loss of our friend and partner dying, and dying the way he did. It’s still sad. What can you possibly write beyond that? What can you write about that period of time? It’s this weird transition. They’re that person but they’re not the person they were... All you can say is, yes, you miss this person.”Our time is up. The Beasties are due to have their pictures taken. They delay, goof around, pretend to make themselves pretty.“Hey Mike, I have our whole record planned out for next year,” says Horovitz. “Our battle of the bands record.”“My people will get back to you,” says Diamond. “You know, there’s a real growing sector for middle-aged cop buddy movies right now. Or maybe a TV show. Fifteen-minute episodes.”Horovitz: “Do I have a really tiny head? I was walking here and I saw my reflection in a window and it looked like it was oddly small. I think I have a pinhead.”Diamond: “Maybe you need to wear more form-fitting clothes. To make your head proportionate.”We all look different as we get older, I say.“Ah, but you’re wrong there,” says Horovitz firmly. “I’m never going to get old.”• Beastie Boys Book is published on 30 October by Faber Social (£32).

It was the biggest outpouring of public opposition to government policy since the anti-Iraq war protest in 2003.The number who descended on the capital to call for a “people’s vote” exceeded all expectations of both the organisers and police. Addressing the crowds, which included dozens of MPs from all political parties, the TV personality and food writer Delia Smith said Brexit threatened to cause “unmitigated chaos”.“The only way we can avoid this total madness and win back our future has to be a people’s vote,” she declared to loud cheers.The Liberal Democrat leader Vince Cable said the march showed that British people were beginning to realise that politicians could not deliver a successful Brexit that would protect their jobs, livelihoods and their children’s futures. They were afraid of the havoc that would ensue, and wanted a chance to stop it.“People have woken up to the potential disaster,” Cable said. “We’ve realised there isn’t a good deal coming out of this and a lot of people are frightened, people are worried.”The march coincided with a call from a senior government minister for Tory MPs to drop their “ideological obsessions” over Europe, which he said were now threatening to drive the country “off a cliff”.Foreign Office minister Sir Alan Duncan, the de facto deputy to foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt, said Conservative MPs and ministers now had a duty to show people they could deliver a sensible, moderate Brexit that was in the national interest. But this would never be achieved if so many remained entrenched in different ideological camps and refused to compromise.“There simply is no ideal outcome that will suit everyone,” he said. “People have to step back from their ideological obsessions and accept a pragmatic compromise. Otherwise we risk inflicting on ourselves massive economic damage, as well as political damage, domestically and internationally, for years to come.”He added: “This is the biggest ‘get real’ moment of my political life. The fate of our country for decades will depend on this. It is as if we are driving towards a cliff, but won’t face up to the reality that the road we have chosen will take us over the edge.”This weekend, however, there was no indication that Tory infighting over Brexit was subsiding. Theresa May is being warned by pro-Brexit cabinet ministers that they will vote against any deal she proposes unless they see legal guarantees that Britain can make a clean break in the future from the EU. Ministers including Andrea Leadsom, Penny Mordaunt, Esther McVey and Michael Gove are among those with concerns that moves to solve the Irish border issue could tie the UK to the EU for the long term. Tensions are expected to surface at this week’s meeting of cabinet ministers and a key gathering of May’s inner Brexit cabinet on Thursday.With May’s authority on the wane, Eurosceptic MPs and donors have been openly discussing the prospect of installing David Davis, the former Brexit secretary, as a short-term leader. A leadership challenge is triggered when 48 Tory MPs submit a letter to Sir Graham Brady, chairman of the backbench 1922 committee, demanding a contest.The Observer has spoken to MPs considering submitting their letters this week. “It is entirely possible that Brady will be making an announcement this week – that is how bad things are,” said one MP. “I’m afraid the last week has rightly reopened questions about the leadership.”Demonstrators on the march brandished placards saying “Parliament’s ided, the people must decide it”, “Why the lies, Boris?”, and “Time for an EU turn”.John Bramich, who made a four-hour car journey from Stockport to take part, said: “We hold a general election to choose a new government every five years or less. Brexit is something far more important. Saying that it’s undemocratic to hold another vote on it is nonsense.”Rodolfo Hermans, a Chilean-German national and nanotechnology researcher at University College London, who joined the demo, said: “The climate towards immigrants such as myself has become terrible. This atmosphere is a true hostile environment, and it is affecting not just those from the EU but people from across the world.”A Downing Street source said there would be no second referendum: “We had a people’s vote in 2016. A second referendum would really be a politicians’ vote – politicians telling the people they got it wrong the first time and should try again. That would do lasting damage to faith in democracy.Another pro-remain rally took place in Northern Ireland on Saturday, which converged on Belfast city hall. The crowd, waving EU flags and carrying anti-DUP placards, heard Alliance party leader, Naomi Long, describe the EU as a force for peace.She said the Brexit debate was not about protecting the UK’s union or creating a united Ireland, as it has been characterised by some on opposite sides of the issue.Long said: “This is about the people of this place coming together and saying, just like the EU, we value cooperation, we value immigration, we value working together in the best interests of everyone in this society.“That is why we value the EU, it is not just a model of cooperation, it underpins the very cooperation that we need here.” A pro-Brexit counter-protest in Harrogate, organised by Nigel Farage, was attended by roughly 1,200 people."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b64a1d79522ad4553c0f41ea4b0d3a93ba15c3a0/449_41_3051_1831/master/3051.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0d7d4f9f21d5f68eb56449109b2156c8","title":"brexit industries ralf speth jaguar land rover cbi survey","story":"Ralf Speth calls for political action as CBI survey finds four out of five businesses have cut investment ahead of EU exitKey industries will be destroyed by a hard Brexit, one of the country’s most powerful chief executives has predicted, amid warnings that Britain’s imminent EU exit has dented investment by four in five businesses.Ralf Speth, the boss of Jaguar Land Rover, said that such an outcome would lead to the closure of plants and major job losses as he warned that some exposed industries would have “no way to survive a hard Brexit”.Speth stood by his claim that tens of thousands of jobs would be lost. “That’s correct,” he told the Your Money channel during a trip to Australia last week. “Everybody can do the maths. It is very open and very transparent. It is not only at Jaguar Land Rover, but it is also an element for the supplier industry and export industry in the UK.”It will be very, very critical if we see a hard Brexit or no deal. Companies will disappear, plants will be closed. There’s no way to survive a hard Brexit for many industries. But I hope again that the politicians see it and act for the benefit of their own population.”Speaking on the same programme, Hague said he believed that May was at the most precarious moment of her premiership. “That’s the realistic situation,” he said. “If everybody sticks to their current position, a deal won’t happen. There isn’t at this moment a majority in parliament.”British manufacturers have particular concerns over any introduction of border checks and delays. “The phrase ‘as frictionless as possible’ is no good to us,” said one industry figure. “We need zero friction, or we have problems.”Most companies said they would implement damaging contingency plans if there was no certainty over Brexit by December.Carolyn Fairbairn, the CBI’s director general, said that the prime minister’s negotiations were being “outpaced by the reality firms are facing on the ground”.“The situation is now urgent,” she said. “Unless a withdrawal agreement is locked down by December, firms will press the button on their contingency plans. Jobs will be lost and supply chains moved.“The knock-on effect for the UK economy would be significant. Living standards would be affected and less money would be available for vital public services including schools, hospitals and housing.“Many firms won’t publicise these decisions yet their impact will show in lower GDP years down the line. As long as ‘no deal’ remains a possibility, the effect is corrosive for the UK economy, jobs and communities.”John Longworth and Richard Tice, from the pro-Brexit Leave Means Leave group, dismissed the survey as no more than “political propaganda”.They said: “This lightweight survey, with a sample size of just 236 companies, is not indicative of the overall mood music of businesses up and down the country who just want the government to get on with it,” they said. “The CBI are crudely being the mouthpiece for ruthless multinationals and political elites who are prepared to sacrifice our long-protected democracy for their own pensions and profit margins.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1f38b99a4d2aa866c2d107e6a023faf18363dc1d/0_131_1600_960/master/1600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2be16c6c41ec048e83532c91d569b2d3","title":"peoples vote march brexit in pictures","story":"From Brexshit to a placard inspired by Banksy, protesters get creative"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/df1847a1c404add50c6cd04a3ed4801a5dda47fc/0_332_7238_4344/master/7238.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dd622611c1bff04e89d0ad7ba52126bc","title":"frances arnold interview ability engineer most complicated things on planet nobel prize enzymes chem","story":"This month, Frances Arnold, professor of chemical engineering at Caltech in California, was awarded the 2018 Nobel prize in chemistry, shared with two others. She’s the fifth female chemistry laureate since the prizes first began in 1901, and the only ever American woman to win in the subject. Where were you when you got the news you had won the Nobel prize? I was in deep sleep in a Dallas hotel room having arrived at midnight to give a lecture the next day. The phone rang at 4am. I was worried that it was some emergency at home. Then I saw that the telephone number was from Europe and I thought maybe I had better answer it.Though I had been given hints in the past, I certainly didn’t expect it. There are many wonderful chemists whose work deserves the Nobel prize and to expect one is rather silly.Were you always interested in engineering? I was always making things, mostly art projects, but I was also very good at and loved maths – especially geometry – and puzzles. And I was always interested in technology. My father was a nuclear physicist who revelled in the scholastic achievements of his children. I had four brothers who I loved to compete with and we were all equally encouraged. I took mechanical drawing, geometry and typing at high school, the latter because that is what they did with smart girls in those days!What turned you on to biotechnology? I studied mechanical engineering at Princeton and worked on solar energy after graduation.But the industry’s prospects changed for the worse in the early 1980s and I decided to do my PhD in chemical engineering at the University of California, Berkeley. I had initially intended to work on biofuels but I stumbled on this new field of biotechnology. The ability to engineer the most complicated things on our planet – biological systems – was too much of a draw to ignore.Your Nobel prize was awarded for the “directed evolution of enzymes”. What’s that? It is basically breeding, similar to mating cats or dogs to bring out desired traits, but at the level of molecules. The aim is to create new and better biological material in the form of enzymes, which are proteins that catalyse chemical reactions. And this allows us to use greener biological manufacturing processes to make the fuels, chemicals and materials we use in our daily lives.It starts with a gene, a stretch of DNA that encodes for the particular enzyme to be enhanced. In a test tube under error-prone conditions, the DNA is copied so a small number of random mutations are introduced. The hard chemistry is then actually done by bacteria – which read DNA and make beautiful proteins according to a DNA code. Those millions of genes each with a few errors in them are inserted into the bacteria, which make the enzymes with a few errors in them. The enzymes are then tested to see which are better than the original, for example more active in a particular environment. Their genes are then taken and the cycle repeated to acquire new traits. It is evolution guided and sped up by artificial selection.Enzymes developed by your method are used today to make everything from laundry detergents to biofuels and medicines. What applications are you most proud of? I never patented the basic technology, which was a good thing, because it meant use spread to other labs. One of the most compelling applications has been by the drug maker Merck \u0026amp Co, which developed an enzyme through directed evolution to make the drug Januvia, used to treat diabetes. That was formerly made using toxic metals, with a lot of waste products.Have you worked on any applications? I have worked on enzymes to make better biofuels, co-founding a company, Gevo, to do this in 2005. More recently, I have started a company, Provivi, with two of my former students to make nontoxic alternatives to pesticides that draw on the method.What are you working on in your lab at the moment? Evolution is good for optimising and that is well understood. But evolution also creates things that no one knew were even possible. In the test tube, I can make any DNA I want, recombining it from monkeys, worms, anywhere. So I can explore new rules of breeding with molecules.We’ve recently evolved enzymes that make chemical bonds not found in nature. For example, in 2016, we published the first enzyme to forge carbon-silicon bonds. Products ranging from paint to personal care items contain carbon-silicon bonds, all made using precious metal catalysts like platinum. This work opens up the possibility that biology could make them more cheaply and cleanly.Some people find it remarkable that there are two female winners this year of Nobel prizes because it is usually all men (Donna Strickland became the third woman ever to win a Nobel prize in physics). Are you supportive of the Nobel committees having written to nominators for 2019 to ask them to be more inclusive to make sure they don’t leave women or ethnic minorities out? It is remarkable – and wonderful. But also not surprising because there are women doing fabulous physics and chemistry. I predict this is the beginning of a steady stream. To ask nominators to think about this is a really good thing because it is when you think about it that you realise how many brilliant women there are.To get the prize, you first have to be nominated. That means someone has to care enough about you to take the time to explain your science to someone else. Men often have a good network of people who are willing to do that for them. Women need to cultivate those networks and often they are not as pushy about that as some of the men are. We have to learn how to be pushy or at least ask and I am gratified to see that my younger colleagues are starting to do that.Sexual harassment is rife in the sciences according to a report published this June by the US National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. Have you experienced it in your working life? Do we need female scientists to speak out about their experiences? In so far as stupid sexist remarks and behaviour, yes, but I am gifted with the ability to ignore those people and that has served me well. However, I certainly understand that many women are more sensitive than I am. I think that women should talk about their experiences to the extent it helps them come to terms with what they have experienced. And people need to listen and understand that these experiences can have a dramatic, negative effect on one’s career.You’ve been dealt some challenging and tragic events in your personal life – you’ve lost two husbands (your first to cancer, your second by suicide), one of your three sons was killed in an accident and you underwent treatment for breast cancer. Does your work provide certainty – some respite from the randomness and misfortunes of life? I certainly find respite at my institution, Caltech, where I have been for 30 years and have a wonderful group of close friends. I also find grounding in working with students. I have a steady stream of brilliant young people coming through my laboratory whose curiosity and love of science are tremendous positive forces. I have also learned how to be grateful for what I have rather than sorry for what I don’t. That helps me look at the good side of things.Where do you get your ideas? I had one good idea back in the 1980s and have been working on that ever since! I see my job as helping to promote the ideas of my students. They are looking at biology with this whole new set of eyes and their brains are full of possibilities. I am a very good editor of ideas and if I can help them hone those, that is immensely satisfying.What words of advice would you give young women who want a career in science or engineering? Don’t leave this wonderful, fun work just for the men."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c04e7b1c997db5c1695f000fe1025d5340a328d6/0_30_2970_1783/master/2970.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9bc4e8e7138f855df155cdcbb0aff46b","title":"danny cipriani sent off munster rory scannell gloucester","story":"Danny Cipriani capped a bad week with a first-half red card for a high tackle that sent 14-man Gloucester spinning to defeat against at Thomond Park. Cipriani, snubbed by Eddie Jones on Thursday when England’s autumn series squad was named, was sent off in the 28th minute by the French referee Alexandre Ruiz after the fly-half’s right shoulder made contact with the head of the Munster centre Rory Scannell.Tries from Mike Haley and Rhys Marshall then gave Munster a 15-3 half-time lead. The Irish province had their bonus point by the 55th minute thanks to Joey Carbery’s first European try in the red jersey and a Sam Arnold score.Andrew Conway added a fifth try in front of a 23,068-strong crowd but Munster’s poor discipline saw them end the game with 13 players – the replacements Arnold and Stephen Archer were shown yellow cards – as Gloucester rallied superbly with tries from the former Munster lock Gerbrandt Grober, Jason Woodward and the excellent Ben Morgan.Johan Ackermann, the Gloucester head coach, tried to focus on the fightback and spoke of the Cipriani incident only in general terms, saying: “I’m not going to get involved in a debate about red cards. Before the season started I gave out a full statement to the media back at Gloucester about my opinion about red cards. My view is simple. It is spoiling the game if there is no intent.”Gloucester’s captain, Ed Slater, said: “The referee said he felt there was shoulder contact to the head. For him that was enough to give a red card. He is the referee. Whether I agree with it or not doesn’t matter. There were a few high shots during the game. I’m trying to work out what makes that one a lot more serious than some of the others.”Cipriani’s departure came with his side 5-3 down. Munster had gone ahead after the match officials deemed Tom Savage’s shoulder-led clearout on Dan Goggin worthy of a yellow card. Gloucester were caught narrow in defence and Haley went over in the right corner. But Carbery missed the conversion and Cipriani soon turned a penalty into three points with a booming long-range kick.However, he received his marching orders a few minutes later, being caught too upright in a tackle on Scannell that also involved Ruskin.Carbery sent the resulting penalty over for 8-3 and he converted after Billy Twelvetrees was pinged for another high tackle and hooker Marshall struck from a lineout maul.Carbery wrapped around Goggin to raid in beside the posts in the 50th minute and the young No 10’s classy behind-the-back pass added momentum to an attack which ended with Arnold’s well-taken try.At 29-3 down, Gloucester were far from finished. Grobler scored from close range following a series of Munster penalties and Matt Banahan threatened before full-back Woodward crossed in the left corner. Conway claimed Munster’s fifth try, via Carbery’s soft hands, with the latter chalking up 16 points in total.However, the new Pool 2 leaders’ disappointing finish led to a little shine being taken off their victory as they allowed the resilient Cherry and Whites to dictate possession, Morgan burrowing over the line in the 78th minute, in between Arnold’s yellow for a deliberate knock-on and Archer’s for a high tackle."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ed6be2f4fe5b5cc911941c3acb7baa1b30e04dfe/0_72_3309_1986/master/3309.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=56b9829d5feb6738ea62f17dd4dcbe07","title":"lewis hamilton pole us grand prix","story":"With qualifying reaching its climax, Lewis Hamilton’s imperious march towards his fifth Formula One title threatened to hit a bump in the road in Texas on Saturday. However, the Mercedes driver is almost unbeatable on this circuit and responded to the unexpectedly stiff challenge of the two Ferraris by setting a track record to claim pole position for Sunday’s US Grand Prix.Hamilton set the pace but Kimi Räikkönen and Sebastian Vettel soon shoved him down to third place. It looked like the Briton might deliver his worst qualifying performance in Austin since 2013, the only year he has failed to win here, but he roared back in the third qualifying period with a time of 1min 32.237sec.“Clearly very intense,” Hamilton said. “Today in practice the Ferraris looked like they had made some improvements. Once we got to Q3 it was about not leaving a millisecond on the track, basically.”Hamilton’s title rival, Vettel, was second, and less than a 10th of a second slower but an intriguing duel at the head of the pack may not materialise since he will start in fifth position as the result of a penalty for breaking a red flag rule on Friday. That is an ominous sign for his prospects of extending the championship battle for at least another week, given that in its six previous years the Austin grand prix has never been won by a driver starting outside the front row.Still, Vettel was philosophical. “Surprisingly close. I don’t think we expected it to be that close,” he said. “Bit of a shame to just miss out.”Hamilton is chasing his fifth successive victory – a streak he also achieved en route to winning the 2014 title – and his seventh win in eight races. Among the potential outcomes that would see the 33-year-old champion retain the trophy is victory if Vettel finishes third or lower. Few would bet against the first half of that equation, at least, at a circuit where Hamilton has won five grands prix, including the past four.After dominating the first two practice sessions in wet conditions on Friday while Vettel struggled, Hamilton was only the third fastest in final practice under foreboding grey clouds. Vettel, meanwhile, clocked the best time, albeit only fractionally better than his teammate, Räikkönen, and Hamilton.Given that Mercedes have a faster car than Ferrari on wet surfaces, an unexpected improvement in the weather on Saturday was at least a welcome and much-needed piece of good news for Vettel. “The Ferraris are obviously really quick,” Hamilton said.Forecast earlier in the week to be rainy, race day looked likely to be dry – and sunnier than Vettel’s disposition on Friday. The German was given a three-place grid penalty for failing to slow sufficiently for a red flag during the first practice session while gravel was being cleared from the track.He railed against the verdict and the rule but it was the latest in a string of unforced Ferrari blunders that have all but handed the title to Hamilton, who, as last year, has grown stronger as the season has gone on. “After the weeks we had I’m pretty pleased we are back in range,” Vettel said.Hamilton has a 67-point lead with four grands prix remaining, meaning he needs eight more points than Vettel to seal his fifth title. That would draw him level with Juan Manuel Fangio and in sight of Michael Schumacher’s record tally of seven. Vettel, 31, has four championships but none since 2013.Toto Wolff, the Mercedes team principal, believes Ferrari may have the faster car. Räikkönen, third-fastest in qualifying, starts in second thanks to Vettel’s penalty. The Finn will be on ultra-soft tyres that may give him an advantage at the start, with Hamilton and Vettel on super-softs that provide less grip. “We’re lacking a bit of straight-line speed and it’s going to be very difficult to defend against the Ferraris. That’s my worry,” Wolff said. “I’ve always said you cannot write them off.”Hamilton, though, is relaxed. In the post-session press conference he initially appeared to describe his best lap as “perfection” before – in true perfectionist style – walking back that assertion. Near-perfect, though, would be fair comment.\u0026nbsp“I’m so happy,” he said. “It was a different feeling today coming in. I don’t know why. I don’t know if I slept longer or what but I was in a different headspace going into qualifying, which is weird, but it was a good one.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fae812e9396052d693e8d8ca798e8f9a102700f3/0_128_3640_2184/master/3640.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c7c925e7546b5748203b7eb08a4c7805","title":"ellie downie foot sensitive gymnastics world championships","story":"The Lilleshall National Sports Centre is buried in Shropshire woodland. It has the flavour of a public school crossed with an army base and is operated by Serco. It is also home to British Gymnastics and, in one of the satellite buildings on the campus, where Ellie Downie has been going through boot camp.Last year, at the age of 17, Downie became the first British gymnast ever to claim an all-around title at a major tournament when she won gold at the European championships. Then, just as she was taking off, the Nottingham teenager was grounded. A persistent ankle injury, through which she had competed at the Europeans, required surgery. Then, after the operation, the foot did not get better. Downie went back to training but things felt the same, as if the surgery had not made a difference.“It was a tricky time”, says Downie, now 19 and finally preparing to make her return on the international stage as part of the British team at this week’s world championships in Doha. “I’d done my Commonwealth trials and my foot wasn’t the best. I was kind of hoping that I could do the Commonwealths and then rest it, but then I wasn’t selected. That obviously was a shock for me, I wasn’t expecting it. I was a bit down, so we thought we may as well get the foot better. I was just like: ‘We need to find out the bottom of this because I can’t keep training on such a boggy ankle.’”And so this spring she went under the knife again. “It wasn’t a massive operation, it wasn’t rehabbing another tendon or anything. But it was still the process of having another surgery, letting your scar heel, getting your foot moving again. My foot’s still like … I wake up every morning and put ice on it straight away. It’s high maintenance.”Downie is talking after completing her first team “control comp” in the buildup to the worlds. To describe it as a dress rehearsal would significantly underplay the intensity with which Downie and her four teammates – her sister Becky Downie, Kelly Simm, Georgia Mae‑Fenton and Alice Kinsella – throw themselves at the apparatus. Downie completes the four disciplines she specialises in – beam, vault, uneven bars and floor – and while some take the breath away others, the beam in particular, contain moments of uncertainty.The mutual support is very much apparent as the women go through their control comp, with each athlete geeing on the others. Camaraderie is one of the reasons the teams come together at Lilleshall before competition, and that is especially the case now with the group competing together for the first time.“In the gym it’s hard work and we all push each other just to get the work done and get out,” says Downie. “When we’re out of the gym we just try and get to know each other because we’re quite a new team. We normally watch movies together, cheesy films or romantic films, we like Pitch Perfect.”Sometimes the boys will attempt a takeover of the shared “athlete lounge”, putting paid to the film club with a PlayStation session. But generally, says Downie, any competition between the teams is saved for the event itself.She insists she is going out to Doha as part of a team, to help build up her confidence after the injury. At the same time Ellie Downie is an elite athlete who has been deprived of top-flight competition for nigh on a year. As she talks, she cannot help but outline circumstances in which she might end up competing for an inidual prize.“I’m going out there to do a team job, get out there on the international stage”, she says. “But I know my routines are still potentially good enough for an all-around final, and it’s Georgia May, Kelly and me on all around as it stands. So if I had a mistake and they went clean they would probably make the final … but anything can happen on the day.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/206a02456b64c9e77d757923071611d9f9b257bc/0_105_4880_2927/master/4880.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c5a4f36c12706aff9555aa92796cceb9","title":"lewis hamilton ruthless phenomenon to treasure","story":"Perhaps, when Lewis Hamilton has his fifth Formula One world championship secured, he might allow himself to reflect on just how far he has come. The boy from Stevenage who loved karting is now a man breathing the rarefied air at the very top of his sport. If he closes out the title at Sunday’s US Grand Prix, the celebrations will be long and loud. He will deserve every moment, his performance this year should be acknowledged as capping one of the great modern sporting achievements.The arithmetic is simple. If Hamilton wins at the Circuit of the Americas, Sebastian Vettel must finish second to keep the title fight alive. If Hamilton finishes eight points clear of his Ferrari rival, he takes the championship regardless.There are other numbers, hard to ignore. His record 81 pole positions, nine this season, after his success on Saturday the 71 career victories, nine in 2018. Then there is the company he now keeps. With a fifth title he will have equalled Juan Manuel Fangio and will be only two behind Michael Schumacher’s record of seven.This achievement has been referred to repeatedly, to the extent that its impact has perhaps been dulled. It bears repeating and consideration. In the 69 championships since 1950 only two drivers have won as many titles. Two. Both are considered to be greats of the sport. Hamilton has said he never dreamed of equalling Fangio, such was scale of the Argentinian’s achievement. Now he is within range of catching Schumacher, a tally expected never to be matched.Comparing eras in motor racing is almost impossible, a speculative, subjective game. Yet perhaps it carries some weight when coming from one of the finest drivers of this generation. On Thursday Fernando Alonso was happy to place the British driver in exalted company. “Michael, Fangio, Ayrton Senna, Alain Prost and Lewis would be my top five,” Alonso said. “Lewis winning five titles and matching Fangio is a great achievement and, if one driver had to do that from our generation, then I am happy it is Lewis because he has shown the talent and the commitment.”Alonso is retiring from F1 at the end of this year and his opinion has the air of an honest assessment. Hamilton has earned it. His performance this season has been nigh on perfect. Ruthless and relentless, he has shown maturity, judgment, racecraft and decisive aggression at almost all the right moments.He took his first title for McLaren in 2008 but has won three for Mercedes in the past four years. They have had the dominant car for much of that period but this season attempting to dismiss his achievement as the driver with the fastest car winning will simply not stand. Ferrari and Mercedes were evenly matched at the start but as the development battle wore on it was the Scuderia who had the superior car for much of the campaign.It is Hamilton, however, who has made the difference. Vettel has only five wins, while Valtteri Bottas, the British driver’s teammate in identical machinery, has been comprehensively beaten. Qualifying was 11-6 in Hamilton’s favour before yesterday and he has beaten Bottas in 12 races (discounting Russia, where Hamilton benefited from team orders).Yet, again, the numbers do not really tell the story. While Vettel has repeatedly made costly errors, Hamilton has been impeccable. He has had meetings where he has not quite hooked it up – Bahrain, China, Baku and Canada – but ensured solid finishes in all of them. Indeed it is hard to identify a major mistake he has made all year. Perhaps the only real driver error was his wheelspin from pole at the British Grand Prix that cost him places and ultimately left him vulnerable to being hit by Kimi Räikkönen on the first lap.Yet even that proved instructive of how well he is driving. He has been repeatedly able to reset and reapply himself after setbacks. At Silverstone he recovered from the back to claim second. After a gearbox penalty in Bahrain he claimed third. Most significant of all, after a mechanical problem in qualifying at Hockenheim, from 14th on the grid he mastered the field and the wet to take a win – as Vettel crashed out on a slippery track. It was the race that perhaps summed up their seasons.Hamilton has combined this unceasing control with some sublime moments. His qualifying lap in the wet in Hungary was superlative and enough to ensure an unexpected win. It was bettered only by the lap of his career in Singapore to take pole and another win.At Monza, the Scuderia’s home circuit, he delivered a crushing blow: first by dancing round the outside of Vettel at the Roggia chicane, provoking another error from the German, and then by passing Räikkönen at the same corner to take the win. Hamilton said it was up there with his greatest drives and it was. Three wins in a row followed as, like the Aussies of old, he remorselessly crushed the hope from his opposition.Such has been his mastery of every aspect of his driving this season, it perhaps belies how hard he is working. Hamilton has displayed a disarming ability to make the exceptional look effortless yet it has required the greatest commitment, as he has acknowledged. “I have given my hardest throughout the year,” he said. “This has been the best performing year so far in my career.”Twenty-five years after he began karting at Rye House in Hertfordshire Hamilton has presented his best and it has been simply untouchable. The air may be thinner at the summit but, should he wrap it up in Austin, Hamilton has more than earned his right to share it with the greats."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f021d5d158195249562ab3c772c6589da6d2c44e/0_316_3813_2287/master/3813.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eecc7105eae582260c524015220b42b6","title":"armistice day 100 years on share your letters stories and photographs","story":"Whether your family members or friends were in active service, or in some supporting role at home or abroad, we’d like to hear their storiesSunday 11 November this year will mark 100 years since the armistice treaty was signed between first world war allies and Germany, bringing to an end four years of war in western Europe.On that day people in Britain celebrated by pouring out onto the streets and gathering in large places.

But hurdles remain before the change can be formalised.A referendum on the agreement several weeks ago failed to pass the turnout threshold of 50 percent, leaving it up to the Skopje parliament to settle the issue.The procedure to complete constitutional changes is lengthy and requires several rounds of voting, with Friday’s being just the first stage. The procedure should be completed by January at the latest.“Today is a historic day for the country,” Prime Minister Zoran Zaev said. “Macedonia will be part of the European family our dreams and visions for better life in a better country will be fulfilled.”Once Macedonia formally changes the constitution, the Greek parliament will also have to vote on the deal.Defence Minister Panos Kammenos, who heads a small right-wing party that props up the government in the legislature, has threatened to quit the coalition if the Greek vote goes ahead.“A great day for democracy in Skopje,” Johannes Hahn, the EU’s commissioner in charge of enlargement, wrote on his Twitter account.Russia and the US have traded allegations of interfering in Macedonia’s affairs.Last month Washington accused Moscow of running a disinformation campaign to sour the public on the deal ahead of a referendum on the changes.Russia, which opposes Macedonia’s NATO aspirations, on Thursday fired back.“There is a continuation of the crudest interference of the US and EU in Skopje’s internal affairs, the level of which has already surpassed conceivable boundaries,” the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3bbe7ef129de4be9d4237d63f3cf27317cda38ea/0_140_4809_2885/master/4809.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c72ab5d677e6f5c9029dad8f7adc300f","title":"climate change is exacerbating world conflicts says red cross president","story":"‘It’s obvious some of the violence we are observing … is directly linked to climate change,’ says Peter MaurerClimate change is already exacerbating domestic and international conflicts, and governments must take steps to ensure it does not get worse, the head of the International Committee of the Red Cross has said.Peter Maurer told  Australia it was already making an impact and humanitarian organisations were having to factor it into their work far earlier than they were expecting.“In many parts of the world where we work it’s not a distant engagement,” he said.“When I think about our engagement in sub-Saharan Africa, in Somalia, in other places of the world, I see that climate change has already had a massive impact on population movement, on fertility of land. It’s moving the border between pastoralist and agriculturalist.”Maurer, who was in Australia to speak about the changing nature of modern conflict, said concern about the impact of climate change in the Pacific was “enormous”.He said changing rainfall patterns change the fertility of land and push populations, who may have settled and subsisted in one area for centuries, to migrate.“It’s very obvious that some of the violence that we are observing … is directly linked to the impact of climate change and changing rainfall patterns.”He said it was up to governments, not humanitarians, to develop the policies needed to deal with the “root causes” of climate change.“For us we hope the international community will soon enough take necessary steps, so at the end of the day they won’t have to pay by increasing humanitarian impacts which, again, we already see in other conflicts.”Donald Trump said little about the IPCC report, having already pledged to withdraw the US from the Paris Agreement.This made things difficult for everyone else, Ola Elvestuen, Norway’s environment minister, said last month, but still called for countries to transition away from fossil fuels, embrace electric cars and halt deforestation.The Australian government largely dismissed the IPCC report and its recommendations – which included the rapid phase out of coal – as well as the pleas of Pacific Island nations.Australia has no formal energy or climate change policy, and the Coalition government at one point flagged pulling out of the Paris Agreement.MPs and ministers maintain that Australia is on track to meet emissions reductions targets, despite official government figures on emissions suggesting Australia will not, according to current projections.On Sunday Australia’s treasurer and former energy minister, Josh Frydenberg, rejected the suggestion it should get his government rethink its policies. He said the government did not intend to “reduce emissions at the expense of people’s power bills”.Anote Tong, the former president of Kiribati, was in Australia this week advocating for action.“It’s not about the marginal rise in price or reduction in price of energy, it’s about lives, it’s about the future,” he told  Australia.Maurer said there were now more people displaced than ever before, approaching 70m across the globe. Two thirds are displaced internally, and most of those who fled would go to a neighbouring country.“At the end of the day there is no single policy that allows in any satisfactory way a response to these issues, but there are multiple things which can be done,” he said."},{"url":null,"title":"college open","story":"Open days offer prospective students a unique opportunity to sample life on campusWhat you need to know to make sure you take full advantage of your open day opportunityOpen days give you a great chance to gauge how good a fit your course and college choice will be"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Airline says incident, in which man berates woman with disability, reported to Essex policeCasey says he will not pull out of campaign as two polls show incumbent has huge leadJim Nicholson tells UUP members he voted \u0026lsquowith the head not with the heart\u0026rsquoLabour to bring forward citizenship Bill in attempt to help people born in State remainUUP chief says Northern politics \u0026lsquodeeply broken\u0026rsquo with no return of devolution in sightVaradkar earlier said customs posts could cause risk of return to violence post-BrexitBepiColombo mission to examine closest planet to sun where temperatures pass 400 degreesMusician and painter embraced island life after being adopted from Dublin aged fourShepherd Machaya is due to be deported to Zimbabwe after his asylum application was refusedFor just 6km, the road from Castleblayney to Dundalk dips into Northern IrelandAbout 25 per cent of all sexual offences are carried out by children, conference hearsDelays reduced to between five and 10 minutes by 9pm on FridayMinister rejects allegations that housing policy is focused on \u0026lsquobenefits not bricks\u0026rsquoKerry farmer Michael Ferris convicted of manslaughter of Anthony O\u0026rsquoMahonyNational Transport Authority introduces changes to help reach BusConnects flat fareBorder businesses feel their way in the dark as \u0026lsquoBrexpo\u0026rsquo get-ready tour reaches MonaghanTravelling salesman jailed for five years for \u0026lsquoopportunistic rape\u0026rsquoT\u0026aacutenaiste asks Saudi envoy for \u0026lsquoindependent and credible inquiry\u0026rsquo into killingGarda\u0026iacute launch high visibility operation to reduce speeding"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3660278.1539269071!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit the truck driver and 20 tonnes of frozen chicken","story":"Simon Carswell travels with truck driver Stephen Heasley to find out how post-Brexit customs checks could affect food supplies. Video: Simon Carswell\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tHaulier Stephen Heasley  at Manfreight  in Portadown, Co Armagh. Photograph: Liam McBurney for The Stephen Heasley carries out a few final checks at the back of the lorry to make sure the load is secure.As a cold mist drifts down over him from the minus-22-degree air inside, he pulls at a metal bar that will keep the 20-plus tonnes of frozen chicken in his refrigerated lorry in place for the 620km journey – lasting 12 bumpy hours – to the east midlands of England.The chicken has come from a processing plant in Dungannon, Co Tyrone and before that from Northern Irish farms. Our destination is a cold-storage facility outside Grantham in Lincolnshire. Grantham is probably best known as the birthplace of Margaret Thatcher, but it’s also one of the locations where Northern Irish chickens are dismembered, sent for repackaging and distributed to supermarket chains such as Tesco, Sainsburys and Aldi across the United Kingdom and Ireland.It is another type of dismembering that Heasley and other hauliers fear most: the chopping-up of delicately balanced supply chains. These ensure that animals reared in one island and processed in another can be prepared for customers across both jurisdictions, guaranteeing that products maintain the commercially viable shelf life of five to six days that keeps supplies flowing and money changing hands.The UK voted to leave the European Union 28 months ago and yet, with less than six months to go to “Brexit Day” (the UK is scheduled to leave at 11pm British time on Friday, March 29th, 2019), British and European politicians have not agreed an exit deal. Such a deal would protect those supply chains while both sides hammer out a longer-term agreement governing future trading between the world’s second-largest economic bloc and its fifth-largest economy.Heasley – a 43-year-old from Lisburn, Co Antrim – knows the road ahead better than most. He has made the journey from Portadown, Co Armagh, across the Northern Ireland-Republic of Ireland Border and on to Dublin Port, Holyhead and then England many, many times in his two-decade career driving lorries.“Watch yourself, there’s a bump coming up,” he says, pointing into the distance to a ridge you still can’t see, minutes after we have pulled out of the haulage yard of Manfreight, the Portadown company he works for.You tend to feel most things on the road in a 44-tonne, 500-horsepower Volvo FH4 lorry, particularly with a load of between £40,000 (€46,000) and £60,000 (€68,000) worth of frozen chickens in the back.Heasley and hauliers like him feel Brexit more keenly than most of us, but they know too that the political road ahead is difficult to navigate.Transport companies such as Manfreight have developed decades-long supply routes, carefully managed on delicate profit margins and strictly regulated man-hours for the company’s 180 drivers. For these businesses, which rely on certainty, Brexit is chaos. Nobody knows what will happen, and planning ahead is complex.“There is nothing an average man or company can do because they don’t know what is going to happen,” says Heasley, 11 kilometres from what is right now an invisible border.“They don’t know what they can do. They just don’t want delays.”From Portadown, it is about 140km to Dublin Port. Heasley knows he can make the 8.40pm Stena Line to Holyhead in plenty of time. There is little traffic on the road this Wednesday evening.Less than an hour into our journey, as we approach the Border, the Volvo truck is powering ahead steadily at 56mph, or 90kmh. Suddenly, the continuous white line on the side of the road becomes a broken yellow one, and roadside signs turn bilingual, in Irish and English. Speeds and distances now appear in kilometres rather than miles. These are the only indicators that we have crossed the Border at Carrickcarnan, Co Louth.“Other than that, you wouldn’t know the difference,” says Heasley.Brexit has left a dark cloud of uncertainty over this border road and the rest of the 499km frontier from Carlingford Lough to Lough Foyle.While the EU and UK have said they want to avoid a hard border post-Brexit, they still have not agreed a plan to achieve this. Both have agreed that within the treaty covering the UK’s exit from the EU there must be a “backstop” – a guarantee to have no hard border unless and until a future trade deal offers a better solution to avoid one – but no backstop has been agreed.It has become the most intractable part of the Brexit negotiations, threatening to scupper an overall exit deal and heightening the pressure on EU and UK negotiators to agree some compromise for this week’s crunch EU summit in Brussels.“Nobody is actually sure what’s going to happen with the Border,” says Heasley, eyes fixed on the road ahead. “We’re hoping for transport companies’ sake and the customers’ sake that there are no border crossing checks and no security, because it will have an impact on us as drivers and the loads we are carrying.”He explains that under EU rules heavy goods vehicle (HGV) drivers must have a 11-hour rest every day, though it can be reduced to nine hours, three times a week. That means from the moment a driver starts driving, they have a 15-hour period – a “spread-over,” Heasley calls it – to get their goods to a destination.And there are plenty of goods heading to destinations on these roads. The Revenue Commissioners estimates that 13,000 commercial vehicles cross the Border every day. The UK’s Freight Transport Association has warned that a bad or no-deal Brexit could lead to “near-paralysis of freight” at the Border.Some Northern Irish hauliers have tried to Brexit-proof their businesses. Manfreight has opened an office in Clonshaugh, north of Dublin. Others are unwilling to invest without knowing what Brexit will likely bring.“It is that lack of clarity, people are unwilling to take a gamble,” says Seamus Leheny, policy manager at the Freight Transport Association in Northern Ireland.Driving across the Border, we have about an hour and a half to make the 8.40pm ferry. If we miss that boat, the next one from Dublin Port to Holyhead is at 2.15am. This would mean pulling out of the port at Holyhead on the other side of the Irish Sea at around 6.15am. With more than four hours driving still to go to reach Grantham – and with Heasley’s 15-hour spread-over expiring at 9am – he would not get there in time.“That is what a driver is up against,” he says. “If I was out of time, they would have to find another driver to lift that food. It might not be our man it might be a subbie. You have all that additional cost either way.”The margin of error is extremely narrow. Any kind of delay on the Irish Border after Brexit could knock a tight schedule for a haulier like Heasley out.“The boat waits for no man. It is not interested because some customs man kept me for an hour or two up the road,” he says.Heasley’s colleague Henry Totten, a 75-year-old who has been driving since he was 21, knows about delays at the Border better than most from his days transporting goods north and south at the height of the Troubles. Checks on the goods he was hauling had to be carried out by customs agents on either side of the Border, in both Newry and Dundalk, and then at the Border itself, adding up to five hours to a journey time.“You were wasting half a day no matter what way you looked at it,” he says.Carrying “groupage” – a mix of goods collected from different customers to create an economic full-load – made customs checks even more complicated, he recalls.“You could have sat there all day. The customs official could have said, ‘I want to see such and such an article,’ and you would have to take half the load off to get to it,” says Totten.Now he can complete a run from Northern Ireland to Cork and back in a single day.“It is the best thing since penicillin,” says Totten of the invisible border that has been in place for more than 20 years. “You have no stops to do.”We make good time to Dublin. There was just a two-minute slow-down at an M1 toll booth north of Dublin city and some light traffic heading into Dublin Port.Heasley drives into the holding lorry park at the port with 28 minutes to spare before the ferry leaves.The port is Ireland’s busiest for freight by some distance. Central Statistics Office figures show that 992,295 loaded freight vehicles and trailers passed through the port in 2017. It is a key transit point to access the UK from Ireland and over the so-called UK “land-bridge” to continental Europe.The Freight Transport Association estimates that 60 per cent of the 475,000 freight containers shipped to Britain have their final destination in Britain and that most of the remainder ends up being transported on to other parts of the EU.Welsh first minister Carwyn Jones said on a visit to Dublin this week that some 70 per cent of goods moving between Ireland and Britain pass through Holyhead and Pembroke Dock, the other Welsh port for freight transportation. “Any kind of delay is bad. It is not just bad in terms of being able to export from Ireland into Great Britain, but onward traffic going through Dover into the continent. This point has been made to me by Irish haulage companies,” Jones says.Any collapse in Brexit talks could hurt Ireland’s trade with the UK and the rest of the EU. There is lots at stake: Ireland exported €14.8 billion of goods to the UK in 2016 – 12.5 per cent of all the country’s exports, while it imported €20.5 billion – 28 per cent of all imports coming into the country, according to the Central Statistics Office.As Heasley drives his lorry into the port, an official tells him that all the “plug-ins” on the boat have been taken. This means he cannot plug into an electricity mains to keep his refrigerator running. Trucks are prohibited from running their own engines for the duration of the roughly 3½-hour sailing to Wales.Heasley’s chickens are frozen so it is not a problem on this trip, but if he was carrying fresh “just-in-time” products such as dairy items – yoghurts, ice cream and the like – or “something that is a bit vulnerable”, he would need a plug-in. Otherwise, “a lollipop would run off a stick,” he says.At the check-in hut at the port, Heasley discovers he is not booked onto the ferry. There has been a mix-up. He makes a phone call back to Manfreight and, a few minutes later, Heasley has our tickets in his hand.Eighteen minutes after arriving at the port – and with no checks of his goods on board – he drives onto the ferry at 8.30pm, the third-last lorry onto the boat with 10 minutes to spare before departure.Upstairs, we tuck into a meal of meatballs and chips in the Truckers’ Restaurant, surrounded by grey-looking drivers dressed in checked shirts, combat T-shirts and baseball caps.Heasley says that some of the chicken we are transporting will end up being served in fast-food restaurants back in Ireland after being processed and breaded in another factory before being distributed to customers. This is how circular supply chains work in Britain and Ireland. The economies are more closely intertwined than many consumers realise.He explains the meticulous choreography of supply chains: hauliers often have a set time to deliver food produce to a distribution centre in time for other lorries to transport it on to other processing centres.Brexit and border hold-ups could mean missing a crucial delivery window, landing additional costs on the haulier. Regular delays might even lead to the loss of contracts to suppliers operating closer to the distribution centre. It is all about maintaining the critical shelf life of products. Fail to do so, and costs could increase and availability of products could fall.“Down the line, everybody will pay for it,” says Heasley. “It is going to have an impact across the board.”A day before our journey, Heasley’s boss, Chris Slowey, Manfreight’s owner, explains that drivers are the biggest commodity in the haulage business, and a driver being delayed for one 24-hour cycle a week because of Brexit would mean a requirement for 20 per cent more drivers when there are shortages of drivers generally.“If each driver of ours loses a day, it would effectively mean we would have to renegotiate all our rates with our customers,” he says, explaining the havoc Brexit could cause freight operators.“From an exam to a marriage, you have a period of preparation because you know what is coming. With Brexit there are so many unknowns,” he says.On the ferry over dinner, Heasley explains other challenges lorry drivers face on the road: diesel stolen from tanks while drivers sleep in their cabs “curtain sider” lorries being knifed open and goods stolen toilet emergencies.An unintended consequence of Brexit-related delays at borders could lead to a boom in sales of Lucozade and Oasis drinks bottles, both popular with lorry drivers who have to answer the call of nature on the road. “They have a wider neck,” Heasley explains. He makes clear this is not something he resorts to himself.Four hours after driving onto the ferry in Dublin, Heasley drives down the ramp at Holyhead. Apart from a short delay as a result of congestion from hundreds of trucks disembarking from two ferries arriving at the same time in Wales, we are out of the port within 13 minutes. Only one piece of paperwork is handed in to a port official.“Everything’s smooth. Everything’s all right,” says Heasley as he heads for the dual-carriageway and the M56 to take us to the M6, the motorway spine running down the west of England from the Scottish border.Heasley explains that the majority of Manfreight’s traffic goes “over the top” via ports at Larne and Cairnryan, through Scotland and down into England. This route makes sense for deliveries in the north of England because there is less driving time required, but a lower speed limit in Scotland is a big downside.The strict limits on driving times determines everything, however.“Going through Dublin tends to be easier,” says Heasley. “If a man’s going to the south of England, it just means it brings you out in the middle of England so you have less driving time.”Barrelling down near-empty roads as we cross into England, Heasley says he was not among the 56 per cent of Northern Irish voters who elected to remain in the EU in the June 2016 referendum. He voted Leave along with other “lorry men” because of strict EU rules on drivers and their hours, and the heavy fixed penalties that enforce them.The damage he saw to lorries at Calais port in France during the migrant crisis also encouraged him to vote Leave. Information shared on lorry driver groups on Facebook about what was happening to the lorries and drivers helped to sway his vote, he says.“People never knew when they voted what the impact of Brexit was going to be,” he says.He points to the British morning TV interview with Brexiteer Nigel Farage the day after the referendum, when Farage admitted that the Leave campaign misled the public about EU money going to the health service post-Brexit.Does he regret voting to leave now?“Aye,” says Heasley. “I believe Brexit is going to impact on our cost of living, so I do. It is going to be more expensive for a man to run a haulage company now than it was previously. People don’t understand that. I never understood that at the time.”And if he had the opportunity to vote again? “I wouldn’t have voted Leave,” he says.As Heasley explains the challenges around the EU regulations, he grimaces – and it has nothing to do with the regulations. “That’s a rabbit I just killed there,” he says.Our early-morning discussion turns to roadkill, the perils of speeding, his advice for trainee drivers and his favourite route (dawn on the West Pennines, he says).“I killed a deer one time on the A75 in Scotland . . . bigger than a dog,” he says.Heasley pulls into a services stop near Crewe in England, still almost two hours from our destination in Grantham. He has hit his four-hour driving limit so, under EU regulations, he has to take a 45-minute break.Inside, we grab a tea and coffee and some chocolate. Heasley explains the dietary toll and the poor physical shape this gruelling work life leaves some lorry men in. Heasley sometimes likes to walk up and down factory yards for exercise after “tipping” his loads.After Heasley’s compulsory 45-minute rest-up and a quick check that the temperature around the chickens is still well below freezing, we are back on the road.Still in darkness, Heasley navigates a final dangerous junction, waiting a few minutes for a safe gap to cross two lanes of fast-moving oncoming traffic. The morning commuters are on the road. A little after 6am, we pull in to our destination: the cold store in Grantham.Heasley exchanges paperwork at a check-in hut and pulls around the back. He opens the back door for the first time since Portadown and reverses the six-axle lorry slowly up to a hatch for the chickens to be unloaded.It is completed in 19 minutes, leaving him with more than two hours still to go within his driving limit. That is enough time to head north and make his next collection point for his return back to Portadown “over the top” via Scotland.“Smooth and no delays,” he says of the 12-hour, 22-minute door-to-door trip.Brexit will likely make this journey rougher, he acknowledges, given the potential for delays at the Irish Border or at Holyhead once the UK is no longer in the the EU.“Come March it is a different story, all uncertain,” he says, before starting the next leg of his journey.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph: Alan Betson The N53 Castleblayney to Dundalk road slices through the southern tip of Co Armagh.Travelling from Monaghan, the road enters Northern Ireland where it crosses Ballnacarry Bridge straddling the Fane river. A mere six kilometres later, it leaves the North at the exact spot on the map where the boundaries of Armagh, Monaghan and Louth come together.For the six kilometres that the N53 is inside Northern Ireland, it is known as Concession Road and is festooned with no fewer than nine fuel outlets, enterprises ranging from substantial filling stations to small fuel depots selling commercial and agricultural diesel. There are other businesses too, including off-licences, car and tractor dealers, furniture and kitchen outlets and firework sellers.The name Concession Road comes from the fact that for decades – long before the modern Troubles and the Belfast Agreement – there were no customs checks at either end. Southern vehicles could enter and leave Northern Ireland along the N53 without being checked. That was the concession.Those living within the North, most of them on or around Concession Road and many clustered around the village of Culloville, were not supposed to cross the Border using the N53, though many surely did.Instead, with their NI vehicle registration plates, they were supposed to use a manned crossing with all the usual customs posts and checks.One such existed on the R179, the road that runs due south from Culloville to another small Border crossing, Kingham’s Bridge over the Fane, beside derelict 19th-century corn and flax mill buildings, about 400m from the village crossroads. On this road, the full bureaucracy of Border checks and inspections was applied to travellers.On the northern side, the Border post was blown up by the IRA in November 1971. On the southern side, what locals refer to as Culloville south, there is a ribbon of homes along the road but no commercial outlets. What used to be the Garda station is now a neglected, boarded up, two-storey house.“This used to be a flax hole,” Martin Watters says of the boggy, flood plain around Kingham’s Bridge and the Fane river valley. The flax was soaked for up to 14 days to separate the fibres that would be milled into linen.Watters and his brother Séamus run Watters Electrical, a substantial and successful appliance business on Concession Road with customers throughout Ireland.In the space of just a few minutes’ observation last week, many vehicles flew in both directions across Ballnacarry’s pretty six-arch bridge. Many of the drivers were probably oblivious they were crossing a frontier that is now taxing British and European Union negotiation skills.There were big articulated lorries, low-loaders with diggers, refrigerated trucks and transit vans, a huge scrap metal truck and numerous saloon and estate cars, with a roughly equal number of northern and southern registration plates.Noeleen O’Hanlon and her family look out across the bridge, the river and its flood plain from their well-kept bungalow and garden.“We don’t know what’s going to happen,” she says of Brexit. She’s not overly worried about the possible imposition of a Border and customs post where there never was one but is anxious nonetheless at the uncertainty of it all.Just around the corner from her and still in the North, is Mary McMahon, a renowned maker of Carrickmacross lace who has lived in the area for all of her long years. “I hope there’s no Border,” she says looking across her front garden and down at the busy road.Between Ballnacarry and entering Co Louth at the other end of Concession Road, the vehicles pass Hoey’s Fuels, Casey’s Top service station, R \u0026amp J Fuels, A \u0026amp N Fuels, CFL Fuels (clean energy, they promise), PLP Fuels (also offering Colombian coal for €14 a bag), Dev-Oil, Blessing’s and O’Neill’s Nisa Local (together with a supermarket in which half the wall space, plus a large part of the floor area is taken up with displays of spirits, wine and beer).The fuel outlets advertise kerosene (marketed as “kero”), petrol, diesel and red diesel (supposed to be used only in agricultural and construction machinery). Between the fuel outlets are various other enterprises.They include Ballytrain Plant Sales and yard filled with JCBs Watters Electrical (which shares a yard with Dynamite Fireworks Superstore that turns out to be a cargo container with a door) the Dev-Oil complex that includes a bar and lounge and off-licence O’Neill’s Tractors APS Auto Parts and Autocare. The general shops in Culloville include a Spar attached to the Top station, another fireworks outlet, Hughes Kitchens, GP Motors and Silkwood Furnishings.Dev-Oil is run by Eamon Devlin, a warm, irrepressible, larger-than-life character with a past to match.“I’m a kind of smuggler myself,” he says ushering me into his office having gotten a mug of tea from his filling station-cum-supermarket. A flashing sign advertises litres of spirits for €19.99 and a case of Prosecco for €31.99.Devlin drives a white Range Rover sports model with personalised plates (E17 DEV). A heavy smoker with a tanned face and on his second liver (“alcohol” he explains), Devlin has diamond rings on both hands, comes from Crossmaglen and is friends with businessman Sean Quinn, as well as IRA veteran and fuel launderer and smuggler Slab Murphy.There’s a photo in his office showing Devlin and Armagh GAA trainer Joe Kernan flanking Murphy who is holding the International Rules trophy. Devlin has taken part in demonstrations of support for Quinn, describing the Cavan-based businessman, formerly Ireland’s richest man, as his “best mate”.Other photos in the office show former taoiseach Bertie Ahern and former US president Bill Clinton in Dundalk in 2000 Devlin’s former home in Castleblayney (a 900sq m spread with an indoor swimming pool and a Rolls Royce in the drive), and – pride of place – his lawyer son Eamon, managing partner with MJ Hudson, a London-headquartered advisor firm to fund managers.“He’s about 150 solicitors working for him,” says Devlin – a nightmare vista for the father surely.Devlin’s other four sons work closer to home. One runs the farm, another the fuel station, and a third runs a waste recycling business behind it. At one stage in his career, Devlin, who left school aged 14, employed 300 construction workers building schools and factories.South Armagh and Concession Road is a place where people are often closely related and the Border, and all that is connected to it, is a backdrop to just about everything.Devlin’s sister Sue is married to Séamus Watters, and his own wife Kay is a daughter of Jack McCann, killed in the 1972 IRA bombing of the Newry customs clearing centre. The huge Dev-Oil fuel operation, hospitality service and off-licence does “90 per cent of our trade with the Republic”, he says.“Personally,” he says, “I think it’s going to be a hard border, customs back again and check points and the devil know’s what, which we don’t want.”But that said, he thinks technology will do away with most of the delays. He says the British didn’t think things through.Pointing to the hill that separates – by only a few hundred metres – Concession Road from the Border, he says, “EU migrants will come into the South and walk over the back of that and they’ll be in the UK”.He doesn’t think British prime minister Theresa May is up to the challenge.“I’d have her 100 times over Margaret Thatcher but it’s a pity David Cameron didn’t stay on,” he says.Now aged 69 and having survived in business for more than 50 years, using the hated Border to his advantage, Devlin reckons that whatever happens next March when the UK is due to leave the EU, life will carry on much as before.“It’s not going to hurt us that much,” he predicts.He fears that any restrictions on movement, such as customs posts or other frontier checks, will provoke an inevitable reaction.“Once you start hemming people in again, they won’t accept it. That’s ordinary decent people. I’m not talking about dissidents.”A roadside poster from Sinn Féin links the civil rights march of 1968 to contemporary issues. “Don’t let the DUPTories take away your rights through Brexit,” it says.Further down the road outside GP Motors, its owner Patrick O’Meara surveys the collection of small white vans, all bought from English leasing firms after about three years’ use and which he is re-selling. They’ll all go to buyers from the South, he says.As he chats about Brexit and the uncertainty of it all, an unmarked Mitsubishi jeep glides by, heading towards Ballnacarry Bridge.“The police,” says O’Meara, “they patrol up and down every now and then.”Just checking there’s nothing unusual going on along Concession Road.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph: Andrew MatthewsPA Wire.The UK would accept a possible extension to its post-Brexit transition period with the European Union if the bloc drops its demand for an Irish backstop, Britain’s junior Brexit minister Suella Braverman said on Sunday. Talks between Britain and the EU have stalled over a disagreement over the backstop - an insurance policy to ensure there will be no return to a hard border on the island of Ireland if a future trading relationship is not in place in time. “We would accept a potential extension by a few months subject to either a finite time limit or a mechanism to extricate ourselves from it if it meant breaking this impasse and avoiding the very unattractive proposal by the EU which is an indefinite customs union and a limbo period,” Ms Braverman told Sky News.She insisted progress had been made in the exit talks. “It’s not time for panicking, it’s time for staying calm and staying focused on the goal which we are all on track to secure,” she told Sky’s Sophy Ridge. Ms Braverman said a no-deal outcome was something the country would be able to survive. “It won’t be a walk in the park, but it won’t be a disaster either,” she said.Meanwhile, a leading Conservative Brexiteer is attempting to make illegal any backstop that would treat Northern Ireland differently from the rest of the United Kingdom. Former Brexit minister Steve Baker has put down amendments to a bill that would give senior civil servants more powers to make decisions while the Northern Ireland Assembly and Executive remains suspended.Mr Baker’s amendments would prevent officials from agreeing “that distinct arrangements are appropriate for Northern Ireland in connection with leaving the European Union” without the approval of the Assembly. Officials would also be forbidden from implementing any new EU obligations that could arise during an implementation or transition period or under a Northern Ireland backstop.If they are approved when the bill is debated next Wednesday, the amendments would kill off the backstop because even if the Assembly is restored, the DUP would block any action to implement distinct arrangements for Northern Ireland. Last July, Theresa May’s government accepted an amendment to a customs bill that made it “unlawful for Her Majesty’s Government to enter into arrangements under which Northern Ireland forms part of a separate customs territory to Great Britain”.The House of Commons approved the amendment without a ision and Downing Street has cited it in recent days as a reason why Mrs May cannot accept a backstop that would leave Northern Ireland in a different customs territory to the rest of the EU.If the Conservative government accepts Mr Baker’s amendments at this stage in the Brexit negotiations, the EU is likely to interpret it as a demonstration of bad faith. The British prime minister told EU leaders that she would work with them to find agreement on the backstop.She said she stood by the commitments she made last December, March and June that there would be a legally operable backstop that would remain in place “unless and until” a permanent solution was found to keep the Border open after Brexit.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph: Simon DawsonReuters.Hundreds of thousands of supporters of the European Union marched through London on Saturday in the biggest demonstration so far to demand that the British government holds a public vote on the terms of Brexit.The protesters waved the blue and gold flag of the EU and held up “Bollocks to Brexit” banners under sunny skies to call for another referendum on the eventual deal on how Britain will leave the world’s biggest trading bloc.The march comes after another tumultuous week for prime minister Theresa May in which she failed to agree a orce deal with EU leaders in Brussels and infuriated members of her own party by making further concessions in the talks.With just over five months until the UK is due to leave there is no clarity about what a future trade deal with the EU will look like and some rebels in Mrs May’s Conservative Party have threatened to vote down a deal if she clinches one.James McGrory, one of the organisers of the march, said voters should have the chance to change their minds because the decision will impact their lives for generations.“People think the Brexit negotiations are a total mess, they have no faith in the government to deliver the promises that were made, partly because they cannot be delivered,” he said.At the march, demonstrators carried placards saying “Brexit is pants”, “Time for an EU turn” and “European and proud.”Organisers said about 670,000 people took part in the march, which would make it the largest in Britain since a demonstration against the Iraq war in 2003.The “People’s Vote” campaign, which includes several pro-EU groups, said they had stewards stationed at regular intervals to estimate the size of the crowd. The police did not provide an independent estimate of numbers participating.Protesters originally gathered near Hyde Park and then walked past Downing Street and finished outside parliament where they listened to politicians from all main political parties.Britain’s 2016 referendum saw 52 per cent vote in favour of leaving the European Union. But the past two years have been politically fraught as the government has struggled to agree on a plan and there are fears that Britain could leave the bloc without a deal.Some opinion polls have shown a slight shift in favour of remaining in the European Union, but there has yet to be a decisive change in attitudes and many in Britain say they have become increasingly bored by Brexit.The prime minister has repeatedly ruled out holding a second referendum. The opposition Labour party’s Brexit spokesman said last month his party open to a second referendum with the option of staying in the bloc in certain circumstances.In Belfast, around 2,000 people gathered on Saturday to oppose Brexit.Brendan Heading, a 39-year-old IT worker, said he was worried the decision to leave the EU would damage the economy and could lead to the break up of the United Kingdom.“I feel that Brexit threatens prosperity and stability,” he said. “People should have the opportunity to vote for an alternative based on what we now know.”Brexit supporters held their own rally in the town of Harrogate in the north of England.Richard Tice, vice-chairman of Leave Means Leave and one of the speakers at the event, described the people on the march in London as “losers” and said a second referendum would trigger a constitutional crisis.“We had a vote, we voted to leave, the idea to have a second referendum would be incredibly damaging,” he said.“People need to be under no illusions as to how people feel about what is a significant potential for a total betrayal of democracy in this country.” - ReutersDeal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

We won’t be adding any chemicals to the wine so there are polite questions being asked when people remove their socks. “As people take off their shoes we can give a quick health and safety check looking out for athlete\u0027s foot, bunions, verrucas and so on. We would like people to be able to enjoy the wine over the festive season.” Shiela Coles and Rosemary Slater treading grapes Her husband, winemaker and vineyard tenant Kieron Atkinson, said that for any potential drinkers they could rest assured that no germs would be left in the wine, but highlighted prior to the stomping that “no minging feet are allowed”. He explained that during the juice and fermenting process bugs die off, adding: “All the sugars are converted into alcohol which again kills off any germs so people can be safe in the knowledge they are free to enjoy the wine.”The natural foot stomping method has not been used in any of the UK’s vineyards this year and it is the first time the practice has been used in the North of England, whilst some vineyards in the South have trialled it in the past. Mr Atkinson said that after the increased popularity of products such as craft beers in recent years it had become clear that people were looking to try something different and experiment with new flavours. “We’ve always produced good wine and the vineyard has been here for 46-years so it’s well established,” he said. “But we also want to keep offering people something different, and we think it’ll appeal to the local areas of Derbyshire and Sheffield where craft beer has been extremely popular.” This is the first time the vineyard has invited members of the public in to stomp their grapes, something Mr Atkinson said was as a result of the hot summer weather this year producing better quality and riper fruits. The juice generated will go on to produce a natural method sparkling wine, known as ‘Pet Nat’ - Pétillant Naturel.The wine will then be naturally fermenting and ready to sell by Christmas – two years earlier than traditional method sparkling wine takes to be ready for sale.Mr Atkinson added: “This wine will be a superb product to buy at Christmas. What better gift to buy someone than a 100 per cent pure, local, sparkling English wine made by entirely natural methods.”Red Funnel ferry collides with several yachts in Isle of Wight as witnesses hear \u0026#39cries for help\u0026#39 Modern Women\u0026#39s Institute meets on Skype and doesn’t have to sing Jerusalem, reveals national chairComment: Why not all casting shouldRoyal tour: Pregnant Duchess of Sussex pulls out of event after Harry urges her to \u0026#39slow down\u0026#39Comment: Write your letters of no confidence now, MPs.

It will probably be swapped out for another small and relatively cheap MacBook, updated to include newer features like Apple\u0027s retina display.Apple might also update the world on the Mac Pro that it said would be coming in 2019 but about which it has been surprisingly vocal.It will be held at the Brooklyn Academy of Music.

The audible vehicle alert system (AVAS) was designed to warn visually impaired pedestrians when an electric vehicle is approaching, as the cars are almost silent when operating at lower speeds. Jaguar had originally planned to make the I-Pace sound like a “sci-fi spacecraft”, but in testing the carmaker found that the sound caused pedestrians to look up at the sky, instead of in the direction of the vehicle. Electric vehicles already able to cut greenhouse gas emissions by halfUK needs six-fold increase in electric vehicle charging points by 2020Electric vehicle sales held back by ‘deceptive’ car dealershipsUK provides millions to help build more electric vehicle batteriesThe company then developed a new sound, which is emitted from a speaker located behind the front grille. The alert can be heard in every direction, and cannot be switched off. Jaguar engineers worked for four years to develop the AVAS, and consulted with charity Guide Dogs for the Blind to “ensure real people are at the heart of our product testing”.Iain Suffield, a technical specialist at Jaguar, said: “The absence of traditional engine noise from electric vehicles creates a problem for vulnerable pedestrians, such as the blind or visually impaired. This is especially true at low speeds in town centres and car parks. We developed the audible vehicle alert system for the I-Pace to ensure the safety of all road users.”Support free-thinking journalism and subscribe to Independent MindsShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

By 2010, the energy-producing kites were being built with rigid wings that could harness more power from a higher lift.The most recent version of the Makani kite was first flown in test flights in December 2016, performing loop-the-loops in a wide circle in the skies that produced up to 600 kW – enough electricity to power around 300 homes.It is estimated that wind power has the potential to meet the world\u0027s energy need 100-times over,\u0026nbspalthough currently only four\u0026nbspper cent of the world\u0027s electricity is generated from wind.Makani believes that it\u0027s possible to unlock additional wind resources that aren\u0027t accessible or cost effective today, the project\u0027s website states.\u0026nbspOur low mass opens up new possibilities for wind power in deepwater offshore sites. We continue to design, prototype and test energy kites so that more people around the world can have access to clean, affordable wind power.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

It also comes in a whole host of looks, with Apple re-introducing brighter colours to its range.Beyond the design, the features of the iPhone Xr are almost the same as its more expensive sibling. It still features the beefed up A12 bionic processor and the improved camera.But it also removes some of the more expensive features, too. The Xr has an LCD screen rather than the richer OLED found on the Xs, and features only one camera on the back instead of two.The Xr starts at $749 in the US, or roughly in the same in pounds and euros. The same carriers that offered deals on the Xs are doing so for the Xr.The handset will actually go on sale – and arrive with people who pre-order it – just a few days before Apple\u0027s next big launch event. On 30 October in New York, it is expected to show off new updates to the iPad\u0026nbspPro and its Macs.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The audible vehicle alert system (AVAS) was designed to warn visually impaired pedestrians when an electric vehicle is approaching, as the cars are almost silent when operating at lower speeds. Jaguar had originally planned to make the I-Pace sound like a “sci-fi spacecraft”, but in testing the carmaker found that the sound caused pedestrians to look up at the sky, instead of in the direction of the vehicle. Electric vehicles already able to cut greenhouse gas emissions by halfUK needs six-fold increase in electric vehicle charging points by 2020Electric vehicle sales held back by ‘deceptive’ car dealershipsUK provides millions to help build more electric vehicle batteriesThe company then developed a new sound, which is emitted from a speaker located behind the front grille. The alert can be heard in every direction, and cannot be switched off. Jaguar engineers worked for four years to develop the AVAS, and consulted with charity Guide Dogs for the Blind to “ensure real people are at the heart of our product testing”.Iain Suffield, a technical specialist at Jaguar, said: “The absence of traditional engine noise from electric vehicles creates a problem for vulnerable pedestrians, such as the blind or visually impaired. This is especially true at low speeds in town centres and car parks. We developed the audible vehicle alert system for the I-Pace to ensure the safety of all road users.”Support free-thinking journalism and subscribe to Independent MindsShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

But arguments as to where it begins rage quietly in the background all the time. Anywhere upwards of the Watford Gap, goes the hoary old joke, if you’re from London.Research last year conducted by Liverpool University suggested that the north now begins somewhere in Leicestershire, having moved south slightly from Derbyshire. To a northerner from Lancashire or Yorkshire, both those places seem to be more the Midlands… but aren’t Midlanders really just northerners anyway?The north-south ide in schools is real – and it’s more complex thanWe in the north wear northernness like a badge of pride. In 2005, The Wedding Present released a single called\u0026nbsp“I’m From Further North Than You”. The band is from Leeds, which is squarely in the north. Yet it’s considerably further south than Carlisle, the most northerly city in England.It would take you the best part of three hours to drive from Carlisle to Sheffield. Sheffield is indisputably in the north, yet skirts those Peak District lands, the Nottinghams and Chesterfields which form the gateway to the Midlands.iStock)Last summer, website The Tab drew up a map showing the north-south ide according to the number of shops of baked goods purveyor Greggs in any particular area, and according to this metric, Sheffield was put in the south.Ridiculous, of course, as anyone who watched the opening episode of\u0026nbspDoctor Who earlier this month will know. The new – and first female – Doctor is played by Jodie Whittaker, who hails from Huddersfield. The entire episode was set in Sheffield, and was as northern as you like – too northern, according to some commentators on Twitter. And heaven knows what the large contingent of American Whovians made of such joyous sight gags as a drunk throwing the salad out of his kebab at a menacing alien.If the boundaries are blurred, then northernness as a concept is perhaps even harder to pin down… at least from the outside. If you’re northern, you know it. If you’re not sure, then you probably aren’t.I have lived in the north all my life, first in Lancashire (and the bits re-designated Greater Manchester after local government reform in 1974), and then in Yorkshire. There is a rumour that northerners are warm and friendly, and we are. Or some of us, at least. We’re not exactly all dancing around like Munchkins there is still a fairly large contingent of people who will rip you off or rough you up or be generally as horrid as criminals are in London.But, by and large, the general populace does have what feels like a greater empathy for others than we, as northerners, often see on our sojourns down south. Up here in the north we genuinely smile at strangers on the street often even talk to them. I remember one of my first trips to the capital, to see Wigan play in the Rugby League Challenge Cup final at Wembley. A contingent of Wiganers were standing in Euston station, asking passersby how best to get to Wembley. They were roundly ignored, much to their puzzlement. A little while later I saw a different group handing out song sheets to stony-faced passengers on the Tube, offering to teach them some Wigan chants.We have space to breathe, in the north. The air’s a lot clearer than it used to be, thanks to various environmental acts and, oh, the fact that most of the heavy industry the country used to rely on us for has long since been closed down. We can get a decent-sized place to live. One of a northerner’s favourite TV shows is the famed comedy programme Location, Location, Location, which features Londoners with more money than sense cooing over properties the size of our toilets (which are all indoors these days, by\u0026nbspthe way) and which cost four or five times more than our actual houses.I am being facetious, of course. But it does feel that there is a thing we can call northernness, which might comprise warmth, and friendliness, and humour and grit, but which is much more than the sum of those cliched parts, and much harder to properly define.Oli Bentley is the creative director of a design studio based in Leeds, called Split. He has taken it upon himself to gather, like wool, various notions of northernness from writers and creatives for a project that was initially part of Leeds’ bid to become the European Capital of Culture in 2023.A bid which, of course, was thoroughly torpedoed by Brexit, and the news earlier this year that British cities will not be welcome to apply for the accolade after we leave the EU next year.Undaunted, those driving the Leeds bid decided to build on the legacy of the hard work carried out in the city by holding a year-long celebration of culture in 2023. One of the first projects out of the trap is the book Bentley has curated, called These Northern Types.Bentley is entrenched in the north. He studied design at Cumbria Institute of the Arts, up there in Carlisle, and while studying at Leeds College of Music after that he set up his Split business from his bedsit. So what is northernness?“Northernness is a myth,” asserts Bentley. “As a designer, I spend much of my time working with identities – specifically, visual identities for companies, institutions, iniduals, bands and arts organisations: brands. I think it is this daily involvement with the perceptions of identities that made me fascinated by this multifaceted, community-owned, slippery thing we call ‘northern identity’. That, and the realisation that, as a lifelong proud northerner, I was beginning to feel unsure about what that actually meant.”So Bentley went on a journey to rediscover, or perhaps discover for the first time, what northernness really is, if it actually exists, and he went to writers and artists and musicians for their take on it.That great northern actor\u0026nbspWarren Clarke\u0026nbsponce played the role of a corrupt copper in Red Riding, the TV adaptation of writer David Peace’s The Red Riding Quartet. The books are an astonishing slice of Yorkshire noir, interconnected narratives which weave in and out of the Yorkshire Ripper murders and the subsequent hunt for their perpetrator, Peter Sutcliffe.Clarke played chief superintendent Bill Molloy, a gruff, no-nonsense copper who you wouldn’t exactly say exuded warmth and friendliness, but instead another aspect of northernness: determination, and the recognition that London is a long way away. Presiding over a group of colleagues in a clandestine meeting, Molloy proposes a toast: “To the north, where we do what we want.”Molloy and his compatriots meant it for nefarious purposes, but it’s a mantra that endures for less sinister reasons. Here in the north we can’t rely on anyone else when we do, they rip the rug from under us. We commit with all our hearts and souls and lives to digging coal or tempering steel, and then someone in London closes the pits and the foundries and there’s nothing else for us to do. It is an irony that the north voted, on the whole, for Brexit a lot of European money was pumped, over the years, into communities ravaged by the death of industrialisation. But the majority Leave vote was born from that suspicion of outside forces exerting too much influence on a region that has been bitten and burned many times.The Capital of Culture being torpedoed and rising as a legacy project is an example of that determination, as is Bentley’s curating of the book These Northern Types. It is, as you’d expect from someone who trained in design, an artefact as much as a text it comprises 17 inidually-bound books, collected together, and created by some of the most interesting thinkers in the north today.In his introduction to the book, Bentley writes: “The focus of this project is, at times, less about location, and more about class – an issue that touches nearly every chapter. Or they are about what it is to be ‘other’ to ‘the position of civility... always taken by the seat of power’.“About living in the other half of the country from the centres of power, finance, media, intellectualism and culture – a situation shared not only with communities from Wales to Dorset to Scotland, but with communities all over the globe.”These Northern Types offers a taste of the north that is unparalleled since someone in Wigan decided to put a meat and potato pie between a barm cake. It is beautiful to look at yet uncompromising and direct. In the essay “Does It Still Matter Where We Come From?”, Dr Katy Wright addresses whether there is, in fact, any need to align yourself to northernness or anything else.She writes: “For many – though by no means all – northernness has involved a sense of marginalisation, abandonment and peripherality, which has often been accompanied by experiences of misrecognition, and stereotypes projected from outside. These have involved portraying northerners as, variously, uneducated, opinionated, mean with money, unsophisticated or conservative. Struggling northern towns and cities like Hull, Scunthorpe, Barnsley and Morecambe provide the punchlines to unfunny jokes about ‘crap towns’ and shitholes.”It is, after all, grim up north. At first it was grim because of the industry that roosted here like dark ravens, the sooty chimneys of Dickens’ Coketown (a thinly disguised Preston), the blackened faces of the miners, the clang-and-heat of the Hephaestan steel forges, the hypnotic rattle of the cotton looms. And then it was grim because the industry was torn down. Grim because of the grit and we have grit because of the grimness.Boff Whalley was the guitarist in agit-popsters Chumbawamba now he is a playwright and the founder of the Commoners Choir. His piece is about northern grit, and how the elements haven’t just formed our dramatic landscape, but do the same to us.“So much of northern culture – historical, social and political – has sprung from our weather,” he writes. “The Smiths were The Smiths and not the Beach Boys because they were born into a land of dripping raincoats and stone doorways that you huddle into. Ted Hughes thrived on the bleak grey swirl of Yorkshire uplands. Our favourite fiction, from the Brontes to Alan Sillitoe to Ken Loach, is peppered with the drama of rain. Many of Turner’s paintings are suffused with storms, mists and fogs (he climbed the hill above what’s now my home town at the foot of the Yorkshire Dales to make endless studies for his great painterly skies) English films – from Billy Elliot to The Full Monty – are drenched in the melancholy of rain. And what comes of all this dour, dull weather? Resilience. Resolve. Gritting your teeth. Grit.”Grim… grit… here’s another one for you. Graft. That means hard work. It’s also the name of the typeface Oli Bentley put together for the book and for anyone else who wants to use it. A typeface for the north. Bentley himself questioned the point of the exercise, other than being a nice little artistic project. Then he had another idea: “Let’s use the typeface to work with local community groups across the north. We bring the letters, they bring the words. Then we put these words up in the places they’re from. This led to the idea of printing giant outdoor posters – the sort you can easily and cheaply flypost. To work with local writers to amplify voices – not just listen, but help them be heard.”Because being heard is something the north struggles with. When we complain that we’re being left behind, we get thrown bones such as the Northern Powerhouse project, an admittedly ambitious plan to boost the economy of the north, put into place by the Conservative-Liberal coalition, much lauded and trumpeted, and then quietly… well, if not abandoned, then at least put on the shelf with the other exciting new initiatives that were going to transform the north, until such time as anyone south of wherever the north’s border is these days cares enough to put money into it. And meanwhile transport – one of the major tenets of the Northern Powerhouse – continues to struggle, with train services especially a bone of particular contention. They don’t call Northern Rail “Northern Fail” for nothing these days.Boff Whalley mentioned The Smiths and, indeed, music is part of the fabric of the north. Benjamin Myers is an author who this year won the Walter Scott Prize for his novel The Gallows Pole. It brought him £25,000, but his win was largely ignored by the London-centric publishing press. For the book, Myers writes about music, as well, and in doing so explodes a myth about living in the north that is prevalent. His piece is a paean to watching bands, and then forming one, a familiar rite of passage: “You gig round the north, the four of you, with your bad hair and bumfluff ’taches. You play es and established venues you play political benefits and school halls and nightclubs and student unions.Emmerdale\u0026nbsprolling hills, you know (Getty)“Being in a band forces you to be an adult at 15 as you deal with clueless promoters and jealous death metal bands, American rock stars and patronising regional DJs. You ward off stage-invading Nazi skinheads and cynical producers. You duck flying bottles and you get thrown out of your own shows for being underage.“You come from that part of the north that rarely gets written about – neither the gritty towns and cities of economic decline nor the dales and vales and uplands, but somewhere in between: the lower-middle-class suburbs. Here is a seemingly endless maze of culs-de-sac and alleyways, tarmac and green spaces, where aspiration exists, and creative seeds are sown, yet which broader culture barely seems to acknowledge, as if the north is either terraced houses or Dales farmlands, Corrie or Emmerdale. It’s not that black and white though most live in a grey-area Britain.”Are we seeing the resurgence of Nazism? This graphic novel thinks soSpoiler alert: Have fractured viewing habits ruined the suspense?Dacre Stoker on resurrecting his great-grand-uncle’s vampireThrough the works in These Northern Types, only a fraction of which are referenced here, several things seem to emerge. There is something called northernness, but it’s difficult to pin down. We’re just like everybody else, but completely different. We don’t even know where the north begins, nor can we agree on what it really means to be northern.It’s almost as if the ideas of northernness are laid down by other people, and none of them are what we really feel. But we can’t voice how we truly are inside, because to examine it too closely would make it seem less distinct, less real.The north is a place made up of iniduals, bound by an ethereal quality that is at once a myth and, conversely, as real as grit and graft. Northernness is perhaps something everyone here has, and is, but in subtly and uniquely different ways. The north makes us, and northernness is what we make it. So raise your glasses please, to the north: where we do – and can be – what we want.‘These Northern Types’ is out now, priced £32, from splitNorth of EnglandCapital of CultureShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Normally these kinds of structures are known at lower redshifts, which means when the Universe has had much more time to evolve and construct such huge things. It was a surprise to see something this evolved when the Universe was relatively young!The structure, which is known by scientists as Hyperion, was spotted by a team of scientists who used the European Southern Observatory\u0027s Very Large Telescope to peer into the early universe and look for galaxies forming. It was then they spotted Hyperion, a colossal mass that is more than a million billion times that of the Sun.Vast cosmic explosions could be flinging gold across the universeIt is not only huge but very complex. Hyperion is made up of at least seven high-density regions, which are strung together by threads of galaxies. That structure is different to the kind of superclusters we usually see closer to us, even though the size is similar.Superclusters closer to Earth tend to a much more concentrated distribution of mass with clear structural features, explains Brian Lemaux, an astronomer from University of California, Davis and LAM, and a member of the team behind this result. But in Hyperion, the mass is distributed much more uniformly in a series of connected blobs, populated by loose associations of galaxies.The difference is probably a consequence of the fact that the closer by superclusters have had billions of years of being pushed into denser regions by galaxies. Hyperion, which is much younger, has been subject to that process much less.Eventually, Hyperion will probably evolve into something similar to those structures: the kind that make up the Sloan Great Wall, or the Virgo Supercluster in which our own galaxy sits. Understanding how that process happens could allow us to peer into the past of our own galaxy and understand how it might have formed.Understanding Hyperion and how it compares to similar recent structures can give insights into how the Universe developed in the past and will evolve into the future, and allows us the opportunity to challenge some models of supercluster formation, said\u0026nbspCucciati. Unearthing this cosmic titan helps uncover the history of these large-scale structures.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Smaller craft have previously employed ion thrusters to reach asteroids and the moon.The ion drive will be used not to accelerate the spacecraft but to act as a brake as it falls into the grip of the sun\u0027s powerful gravity.A complex series of fly-bys past the Earth, Venus and Mercury will further reduce its velocity.Even so, BepiColumbo will reach a top speed of 60 kilometres (37 miles) per second.The European Space Agency\u0027s Mercury Planet Orbiter (MPO), which will survey the planet\u0027s surface and probe its chemistry, was built by satellite company Airbus Defence and Space in Stevenage.Airbus also constructed the power unit carrying the orbiters, the Mercury Transfer Module (MTM), in the UK. The ion thrusters were supplied by British defence technology company QinetiQ.One of the European orbiter\u0027s 11 instruments, the Mercury Imaging X-ray Spectrometer (Mixs) was designed and built at the University of Leicester.The Japanese space agency Jaxa\u0027s Mercury Magnetosphere Orbiter (MMO) will study the planet\u0027s internal structure and enveloping magnetic field.A major challenge for mission planners was ensuring the spacecraft could withstand searing temperatures of more than 350C so close to the sun.Protective measures include a heat shield, novel ceramic and titanium insulation, ammonia-filled heat pipes, and in the case of the Japanese orbiter, spinning.Dr Graham Turnock, chief executive of the UK Space Agency, said: UK scientists, engineers and technicians have played a vital role in developing BepiColombo and the incredibly sophisticated set of scientific instruments on board.The international collaboration involved in this mission shows how our leading role in the European Space Agency is ensuring the UK thrives in the new space age, bringing real benefits to UK companies and scientists.Only two spacecraft have previously visited Mercury. Nasa\u0027s Mariner 10 flew past the planet three times in 1974-75 and the American space agency\u0027s Messenger probe orbited Mercury from 2011 to 2015, taking photos of the surface.Dr Jerry Bolter, project manager at Airbus Defence and Space in Stevenage, said: The scientists describe Messenger as the hors d\u0027oeuvre and Bepi asThe spacecraft was named after the late Guiseppe Bepi Colombo, an Italian scientist and engineer who played a leading role in the 1974 Mariner 10 mission to Mercury.Paolo Ferri, head of missions at the European Space Operations Centre (ESOC) in Darmstadt, Germany, said: Mercury is a planet of extremes, and getting there requires some equally extreme techniques, navigation solutions and operations expertise.Additional reporting by Press AssociationShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

That means that experts can get money for discovering the loopholes but not use them to steal people\u0027s information.It was fixed within 12 hours of it being reported and Tumblr has taken extra steps to make sure that it is able to see and spot any similar bugs in the future.Russian hackers \u0027targeted Tumblr during the US election\u0027The recommended blogs feature usually does exactly what it says: showing other blogs that a person might be interested in, if they\u0027re logged into their account.But the bug meant that when a blog appeared in that module it could be hacked to find out information about the person who runs it.Tumblr said it wouldn\u0027t be able to find out what specific accounts had been affected by the bug, but that it was rarely present.It’s our mission to provide a safe space for people to express themselves freely and form communities around things they love, the company wrote in a blog post.\u0026nbspWe feel that this bug could have affected that experience. We want to be transparent with you about it.

We will take responsibility and sort out this mess with a people’s vote.”Speaking to The Independent beforehand, she said many Tory MPs were privately supportive of a second referendum amid bitter isions in the party.Liberal Democrat MP Layla Moran said the sheer scale of the event showed that “confidence is growing” in the fight for a fresh vote.To huge cheers, London mayor Sadiq Khan said the march marked a\u0026nbsp“historic moment in our democracy”.Over 700,000 protesters’ call for second Brexit referendumTheresa May told she’s ‘heading for dead end’ in Brexit talksThe collective spreading cheer to Brexit-weary BritsEx-cabinet secretaries condemn Tory Brexiteers for undermining MayFinal Say: Meet some of the people marching a fresh Brexit vote He told protestors: “We’ve heard some complain that a public vote would be undemocratic and unpatriotic. But the opposite is true.“There’s nothing more democratic – nothing more British – than trusting the people to have the final say on our future.”MPs from across the political spectrum addressed the rally, including Green MP Caroline Lucas, Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable, Labour’s Chuka Umunna and Tory MP Dr Sarah Wollaston, who drew huge cheers when she compared\u0026nbspBrexit to a botched operation.Christian Broughton, editor of The Independent,\u0026nbsptold the crowds: “Theresa May says that the Final Say referendum will be a politicians’ vote, not a people’s vote, but we can all remember what some politicians told us in 2016.“We, the people, can all now see what’s really coming. And from where I’m standing it looks like a people’s vote to me.”He revealed that The Independent’s petition for a Final Say had achieved more than 940,000 signatures, adding: “We have to keep on showing up and signing up.”People did show up in their thousands for the march, which was extremely cheerful, except for a handful of Ukip protestors who screamed\u0026nbsp“Losers”\u0026nbspat passers-by from outside Downing Street.An army of students, college pupils and young activists led the march in a sign of the impact of the Brexit vote on the younger generation, some 1.4 million of whom have become eligible to vote since the referendum.Femi Oluwole, from the youth group Our Future Our Choice, told The Independent: “What we are trying to do is bring people together, as nobody has any confidence in what the government is doing.”He said young people were going to be hit hardest by Brexit, both economically and in the opportunities to live and work abroad.Among the crowds was Piero Passet, a 71-year-old restaurant owner from Turin, said he was marching because he was concerned for the future of the younger generation.Created with Sketch.Brexit march for a final say - in pictures Show all 26Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Final Say campaigners take part in the peoples vote march for the future in London 20102018Final Say campaigners take part in the peoples vote march for the future in London 20102018Final Say campaigners take part in the peoples vote march for the future in LondonDemonstrators pass Trafalgar Square as they take part in a march calling for a People\u0027s Vote on the final Brexit deal, in central London on October 20, 2018. - Britons dreading life outside Europe gathered from all corners of the UK to London on Saturday to try to stop their country\u0027s looming breakup with the EU.Demonstrators wave Union and European flags and hold up placards as they pass Trafalgar Square, taking part in a march calling for a People\u0027s Vote on the final Brexit deal, in central London on October 20, 2018. - Britons dreading life outside Europe gathered from all corners of the UK to London on Saturday to try to stop their country\u0027s looming breakup with the EU.

He will be a loss to our political debate.”Mr Clegg has previously criticised Facebook for its apparent approach\u0026nbspto paying taxes\u0026nbspand “grating” culture.“I actually find the messianic Californian new-worldy-touchy-feely culture of Facebook a little grating,” he said in 2016.“Nor am I sure that companies such as Facebook really pay all the tax they could – though that’s as much the fault of governments who still haven’t got their tax act together.”The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

It was a joint enterprise between forceful campaigning and the internal rot inherent in the arguments for Leave.The seeds of the fightback were laid as early as August 2016, when the Open Britain campaign group was set up pledging to highlight the problems with Brexit, work out why the Leave campaign had won such support and shape the critical parliamentary debate to come.MPs who have publicly backed a second referendum on EU membershipIt determinedly chipped away at the dogma underpinning Brexit, but it was not until Open Britain teamed up with a string of other groups to launch the People’s Vote campaign in April this year, that it became clear there was now a formidable campaign network mobilising.That was then turbocharged\u0026nbspin July when\u0026nbspThe Independent launched its Final Say campaign, with hundreds of thousands flocking to its petition in days, proving that those wanting a rethink on Brexit had not only found a voice, but were prepared to stand up for the cause en masse – something any elected politician ignores at their peril.Since then unions, celebrities and political figures have increasingly come out in support of a new referendum. The number of MPs publicly backing the idea\u0026nbspexceeds 100, with others doing so privately and even more conceding it may be inevitable regardless of their own personal support.Labour as a party has been pushed to build the possibility of a new referendum into its overall policy plan, meaning the prospect of it now happening is impossible to ignore.Meanwhile, the weaknesses of those pushing Brexit forward have been continually exposed, sometime brutally\u0026nbspfirst by a general election, then by negotiations in Brussels and unceasingly by ision at almost every level of the Conservative Party.The prime minister may yet win a deal in Brussels, but she then faces the prospect of it falling to shreds as she drags it across the splintered backbenches in a bid to gain distant-looking parliamentary approval.It is not often that an MP comes out and calls his own party a “shit show”, but the contortions of Ms May’s Brexit policy led an angry Johnny Mercer to do just that this week.On Saturday thousands of people will also make their anger public as they take to the streets of London to demand another referendum,\u0026nbspsomething they believe to be a rare sensible option in the nonsensical era of Brexit politics.If it comes to pass, they will be able to say they were there on the day that secured Britain its Final Say.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

She also held bilateral meetings with the leaders of\u0026nbspSingapore\u0026nbspand Korea.The EU and Singapore are set to sign a trade deal that will reduce barriers between the two countries. Britain would have to replicate that deal if it wants to benefit from it once it leaves – a process that has so far not been straightforward.Created with Sketch.Brexit so far: in pictures Show all 31Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Boris Johnson MP, Labour MP Gisela Stuart and UKIP MP Douglas Carswell address the people of Stafford in Market Square during the Vote Leave Brexit Battle Bus tour on 17 May 2016.

That should be enough to focus minds on a sensible outcome.Ms May\u0026nbspsignalled\u0026nbspshe would consider extending the Brexit transition period to give negotiators more time to solve problems, including the vexed issue of the Irish border.However Mr\u0026nbspRaab said a longer transition period should be instead of a\u0026nbspbackstop on the Irish border, rather than an accompanying proposals.The prime minister has rightly refused to rule out considering different approaches - including extending the implementation period, as an alternative to the backstop, Mr Raab wrote in the Sunday .Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Anti-Brexit campaigners lowering a banner off Westminster Bridge in London before taking part in the People\u0027s Vote March for the Future in London, a march and rally in support of a second EU referendumMembers of a grooming gang who abused vulnerable girls in Huddersfield have been jailed for a total of more than 220 years.Theresa May leaves after a news conference at the European Union leaders summit in BrusselsPolice officers with a bomb disposal robot on Victoria Embankment opposite Scotland Yard police headquarters in central London after emergency services were alerted to reports of a suspicious packageScottish Power will become the first major UK energy company to generate the entirety of its power from wind after selling its remaining gas and hydro stations to Drax in a £702 million dealPrime Minister Theresa May peers into a hot water urn during a meeting at a social group in Vauxhall from a charity working to combat loneliness at the launch of the first loneliness strategy.

BUDGET BOOST: State borrowing falls to lowest level in 16 yearsBut because of EU rules VAT cannot be lowered again and much of the revenue raised goes to Brussels.Brexit campaigners have pointed out that once Britain is free of Brussels rule in April 2019 Mr Hammond will be allowed to reduce VAT and bring down the cost of living.Senior Tory MP Peter Bone, the founder of Grassroots Out, said: \u0026ldquoGoing out on a Super Canada deal or no deal will mean that Britain is hugely better off after Brexit.\u0026ldquoOne of the things that we are unable to dfo while we are trapped in the European super state is reduce VAT which affects everybody especially the worst off.\u0026ldquoBut once we are free of Brussels we can reduce VAT again and reduce the cost of living so I am completely in favour of this Brexit idend for hardworking British people.Professor Minford, who advised Margaret Thatcher, has also urged the Chancellor to seize the economic benefits of Brexit to cut taxes and spend more on public services, according to a major new report launched todaySUN.He has called for a Post-Brexit Fiscal Fund to demonstrate that \u0026ldquoBritain was open for business.The report sets out a very different picture to the one portrayed by the Chancellor and Treasury officials that taxes will have to rise.In a scathing analysis, it attacked the Treasury for \u0026ldquohaving learned nothing from its failed and widely derided Project Fear forecasts, it continues to embark on gloomy warnings of the effects of Brexit on the economy and so tax revenue\u0026hellipit steadfastly fails to submit its assumptions to public scrutiny or engage with economists outside of Whitehall.\u0026ldquoThe Treasury gloom fulfils two purposes: to dampen departmental spending demands and to push the government towards the \u0026lsquosoftest\u0026rsquo of Brexits, as close as possible to the status quo. \u0026nbspProf Minford added: \u0026ldquoThe inescapable conclusion is that the Treasury hopes to avoid any scrutiny of their methods (cynically referred to internally as \u0026lsquopolicy-based evidence making\u0026rsquo) so that they can bounce parliamentarians and the public into their negative view at the time of a Parliamentary vote on Brexit.

We will be unable to optimise regulations in major parts of our economy that will be subject to continued EU rule. All companies\u0026rsquo products will be subject to EU regulations, not just those that export to the EU. In addition, we will not gain control of our borders.

The Government could just start uprating pensions now and bring them back into balance.\u0026ldquoThe issue of back payments does not necessarily need to be a block to ending this issue.Tory MP Peter Bone, who is also on the all party group, suggested that the current rules had shown bias against those who live in Commonwealth countries mostly Canada and Australia.He said: \u0026ldquoIt is completely wrong that people who have earned their state pension with a lifetime of work should be denied part of it.\u0026ldquoBut it seems very odd that currently people in EU countries get the full amount but pensioners who have moved to places like Canada and Australia do not.

Singapore - very keen to strike an agreement with us.\u0026ldquoSo, we will according to the terms of this Withdrawal Agreement, during the implementation period have this freedom for the first time in 40 years to negotiate, sign and ratify trade deals.Ms Braverman was quizzed about the slow progress of negotiations after EU leaders agreed to push back a November summit until \u0026ldquodecisive progress is made in negotiations.The Brexit Minister said: \u0026ldquoIt\u0027s not\u0026nbsptime\u0026nbspfor panicking, it\u0027s time for staying calm and staying focused on the goal which we are all on track to secure.When pressed on the prospect of a Brexit no deal, Ms Braverman claimed it would not be a \u0026ldquowalk in the park but would not be \u0026ldquodisaster either.She said: \u0026ldquoWe will be able to get through it, it\u0026rsquos not the ideal outcome, let\u0026rsquos not beat around the bush on that, but definitely we can thrive in a no deal situation as well.Brexit Secretary has said the Prime Minister was right to \u0026ldquoto rule out considering different approaches \u0026ndash including extending the implementation period for a limited period of a few months, as an alternative to the backstop.Pro-Brexit MPs were furious after Mrs May suggested the transition period could be extended by\u0026nbspa \u0026ldquoa matter of months at the Brussels Council last week.Brexit news: Suella Braverman said the UK would officially leave the EU on March 29 2019 (Image: SKYNEWS)Brexit Minister Ms Braverman insisted that the UK \u0026ldquocannot sign up to something which is in perpetuity, vague and leaves us exposed to indefinite membership of the customs union.She said: \u0026ldquoDominic has been clear that we would accept a potential extension by a few months subject to either a finite time limit or mechanism to extricate ourselves from it if it\u0026nbspmean\u0026nbspbreaking this impasse and avoiding the very unattractive proposal by the EU, which is an indefinite customs union and a limbo period, which would cause complete uncertainty and not honour Brexit.We need a date or a very clear mechanism or clause in the agreement which enables us to get out of it.\u0026nbspThe Prime Minister has said the transition period would only be extended \u0026ldquofor a matter of months to ensure there was no hard border in Ireland if it proved impossible to implement the future partnership by the end of 2020.The Irish border issue remains a major sticking point in negotiations with Mrs May already categorically rejecting the EU\u0026rsquos proposed backstop arrangement, which would effectively place a border down the middle of the Irish Sea.Ms Braverman also claimed Mrs May\u0026rsquos controversial Chequers blueprint is a \u0026ldquopragmatic proposal which takes the UK forward in negotiations.She said: \u0026ldquoIt honours the referendum result in that it ends free movement of people.Towards the end of the\u0026nbspinterview,\u0026nbspMs Braverman sidestepped a question over whether former Brexit Secretary David Davis would make a good future Prime Minister.

It was those paid-for photos that led to him having “health problems” and failing to walk his daughter down the aisle.After appearing on every TV and radio outlet that would pay for her bile-fuelled rants, Samantha recently tried to gain entrance to Buckingham Palace to meet Meghan.She was, quite rightly, told by grim-faced security staff to bog off.None of Samantha’s vitriol has stuck and most of the world has fallen almost as head-over-heels in love with Meghan as her besotted husband — especially since the news broke that they are expecting.Given that no one is interested in Samantha’s hysterical attacks on her sister, she wants to bury the hatchet.She has apologised for any past tensions and exclaimed that she’s jumping with joy at the baby news.It’s too little too late, and I’m sure Meghan would agree.Samantha has crossed the line too many times to be forgiven now.If she had shown any loyalty she might have been invited to the ­wedding and welcomed into the royal fold. But instead of acting as a peace-maker, Samantha stirred bad feeling between Meghan and her estranged father.A loving sister would have tried to build bridges, unite family ­factions and show solidarity with Meghan.I’m sure the new Duchess of Sussex would have ­welcomed having family members around her as she adjusted to le in the royal goldfish bowl.In the end, Meghan had only ONE close relative at her wedding, her mum Doria.Along with the absence of the late Princess Diana, it was the day’s only sad note.Samantha could have had a starring role as a loyal sister helping Meghan adjust from successful actress to worldwide megastar.The media would have fallen over themselves to talk to her for insights into her famous sister, but not any more. We are all very tired of Samantha’s negativity and venom.No one has any time for her any more, and for such an attention-seeker that has got to hurt.If she had been kind to Meghan, Samantha would still be relevant. TV stations, magazines and newspapers would be asking her about the mum-to-be and she would be at the heart of all the pregnancy coverage.Instead of being a loyal, loving and supportive source of information about Meghan, Samantha is now ­dismissed as jealous, irrelevant and malicious. No one cares about her opinion any more.Meanwhile, Meghan has won over Australia with a charm offensive that shows no sign of flagging. She and Harry are a true partnership.Unlike the tension between his parents Princess Diana and Prince Charles, Harry is genuinely delighted to see the enthusiasm and love for his we during this tour.Charles would famously get the hump because everyone wanted to meet Diana on royal walkabouts.In contrast, Harry and Meghan are relaxed, spontaneous and genuinely adore each other. It has been good to see them having fun and giving hugs and smiles to the crowds.While Meghan grows in confidence and the public’s affection, Samantha is now an irrelevance.It’s her own fault and she has to live with it. She will always have her nose pressed against the window pane of whatever palace her little sister is in at the time.Still, Sam, there’s always panto, eh ONE of the great joys of my le was watching Disney movies with my daughter when she was growing up.We watched my childhood favourites Dumbo, Bambi and Snow White, then I sat through Beauty And The Beast and The Little Mermaid about two thousand and ten times.So I was bemused to hear that Keira Knightley has banned her three-year-old daughter from ­watching some Disney movies such as Cinderella because the characters are “rescued” by men.This is rather joyless.Cinders might have been wooed by a man dumb enough not to recognise the love of his le until her foot fitted inside a glass slipper, but Belle from Beauty And The Beast is a book-loving, independent girl who tells the handsome but horrible Gaston to sling his hook and falls for the Beast because of the man he is inside. Pocahontas, Tiana, Merida, Rapunzel and especially Mulan are all kick-ass, feisty females.Disney remade Cinderella in  and she was a very dferent character.Keira doesn’t have to let her daughter watch Cinderella when there are so many alternatives available, but she also doesn’t need to be so blinking sanctimonious about it.So Joanna in The Cry is actually in court accused of murdering her sleazebag of a husband after they faked the kidnapping of their dead baby.It’s the last episode tomorrow, when we will find out what the heck has been going on.ButJoanna, played by Jenna Coleman, left, really did kill husband Alistair, I reckon it’s justiable homicide.The ghastly toad sat with his eyemask on and earplugs in, leaving her to deal with a screeching baby all through that epic flight to Australia.Surely on those grounds alone no court would convict her.I ADORED Freddie Mercury and would have gladly given a year of my le to be a fly on the wall at one of his notoriously extravagant and outrageous parties.He was a complete one-off, so I was always rather sceptical and a bit concerned about any film that would try to depict his extraordinary le and capture his sheer showmanship.Thankfully, the makers of new film Bohemian Rhapsody found the ridiculously talented American actor Rami Malek.He doesn’t so much play the part of Freddie but rather inhabits his body and brings him back to le.It’s an Oscar-worthy performance that is both funny and deeply moving and Rami is backed up by the perfectly cast three other members of Queen.Gwilym Lee as Brian May is so uncannily like the ace guitarist that his we Anita Dobson thought she had actually gone back in time, as he’s the spitting image of Brian when the two of them met.The Live Aid sequence, recreating the moment when Freddie and the band blew everyone away with their barnstorming performance, gave me goosebumps.I blubbed a lot during this movie, as well as laughing out loud.It also had me rushing to download all the original Queen albums and rediscovering tracks like Keep Yourself Alive and Doing All Right, as well as the classics such as Killer Queen and We Are The Champions.It’s a cracking film and a love letter to one of the greatest entertainers and most charismatic rock stars of all time. WELL, what a shock and surprise that Girls Aloud’s Nadine Coyle and Cheryl were never best pals. . . said no one ever.It was clear that these two, below in , never really hit it off right from the start when the girls won TV talent show Popstars: The Rivals in  against boyband One True Voice.Back then Nadine was very much the star and lead vocalist, which led to tensions in the group.The girls split into two factions – Nadine and Sarah Harding on one side and Cheryl, Nicola Roberts and ­Kimberley Walsh on the other.Tellingly, Nadine said the girls have never had a big fall-out because they were never really friends in the first place.This is what tends to happen when boy and girl bands are thrown together in a reality show and don’t have a shared history. Cracks appear and there are resentments over who is ­perceived as being ­centre stage.A notable exception are the hugely ­likeable Little Mix, who put all their energies into their music and also to ensuring they give out positive messages about self-esteem and body confidence to their legions of fans.These girls have become genuinely good friends who have each other’s backs and who know that they are stronger together than they would bethey had to stand alone.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

In other words, will it give the UK a genuine opportunity to leave.Just putting the word temporary in front of the phrase ­”customs union” — a solution favoured by some at the heart of Government — won’t be enough for these Secretaries of State.One tells me that it has “got to be legally binding and enforceable. Something that is vague and not enforceable won’t get through Parliament”. All of this makes the newest face at the Cabinet table, the Attorney General Geoffrey Cox, absolutely crucial.Cox is a Brexiteer and one of the finest dozen legal brains in the country. Ministers will defer to him on whether this escape clause is worth the paper it’s written on.As one of those helping to ­coordinate the Brexiteers in government tells me, Cox values his reputation too much to try to spin ministers a line. They are confident he will give them an honest assessment of the escape clause’s worth.“Anything will have to go through the AG,” I’m told by one Government source.Cox’s influence will run throughout this process. I understand that the bulk of the Pizza Club of Cabinet ministers who met on Monday night have agreed not to back the final Brexit deal until they have seen the legal advice.I am told that Michael Gove made clear at Cabinet this week that he couldn’t back any Northern Irish backstop until he had been shown “clear, ­written legal advice” on it.This insistence on seeing the legal advice is meant to prevent a repeat of what happened last December when No gave Brexiteer Cabinet ­ministers assurances about what the backstop meant which were not borne out by events.So, the question becomes: Will the EU be prepared to engage with the UK or will Michel Barnier simply say “non, non” Well, there is a cautious ­optimism in No that the political will to do a deal is beginning to be there on the European side. There is a realisation thatthe EU rejects everything May proposes, there will be no agreement reached — and that will mean a hard border in Ireland, which is what everyone is trying to avoid.Interestingly, there is also a sense thatagreement can be reached on the backstop, then the deal has a better chance of passing through Parliament thanOne of those who has read the draft political declaration tells me that the UK EU future relationship is more to the taste of Tory Brexiteers than expected.May must find a way to get the EU to accept an escape clause, for without that she’ll lose more Cabinet Ministers and her position will be even more vulnerable.GAVIN BARWELL, the Prime Minister’s chief of staff, had the Government’s junior ministers in on Tuesday. He wanted to talk them through Theresa May’s domestic agenda as outlined in her conference speech.He wanted to emphasise that the Government would prioritise its domestic agenda as soon as the meaningful vote on Brexit was through the Commons.Barwell’s comments fit with an expectation in Cabinet that Mrs May will attempt to relaunch her premiership with a domestic focus as soon as the Commons has voted on her Brexit deal.The aim is to create a rationale for keeping May on as Prime Minister after Brexit day. Influential Cabinet ministers are also expecting Mrs May to reshuffle her Cabinet at that point.The thinking is that a freshened-up Cabinet would give the Government a new, post-Brexit feel without a need to replace the Prime Minister. But the chances of Mrs May staying on long after Brexit day in March  have lowered signicantly in the past few days.Before this week, some Tory MPs argued that Mrs May should stay until the Brexit transition was done in December . They said this would mean that a new leader would be able to come in as a fresh face after Brexit and in time for the next General Election.However, the news that the transition could be extended cuts against that argument, as the transition could take you to months away from the next election.Privately, Tories from the Cabinet down acknowledge thatthe transition can be extended, then the case for keeping Mrs May until the end of it is weaker.Rather, it would be better to get a new leader soon after March  to give them a chance to make an impact on both Brexit and domestic policy before the  General Election.THE European Union likes to say that an Irish backstop is needed to protect the Good Friday agreement.But what that ignores is that by changing the nature of Northern Ireland’s relationship with the rest of the UK without consent, the backstop risks being in breach of that agreement.THERESA MAY’S declaration in her party conference speech that austerity is over has raised expectations of big pay rises across the public sector.At Cabinet this week, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, Liz Truss, was keen to hose down this idea. She emphasised that public sector pay deals should be based on retention – eg. how many staff were leaving because the pay isn’t good enough, geographic factors and helping the lowest paid most.I’m told that Mrs Truss told the Cabinet that: “Some pay review bodies have ignored affordability requirements.”I understand Mrs May agreed the Government should get away from the idea of a single figure for public sector pay. Meanwhile, preparations for the Budget continue.This is meant to be a small Budget yet one ­Government source warns it is going to be “bloody contentious”.  Why  Because it will set the baseline for departmental spending ahead of next year’s spending review.THE biggest risk of a leadership challenge to Theresa May comes from cock-up, not conspiracy.The danger for her is not that Brexit ultras organise  letters and send them in simultaneously, forcing a confidence vote in her, but that enough despairing ToryMPs send in their letters and the party stumbles into a vote on Mrs May’s future. One of those involved in discussions about whether to try to remove Mrs May tells me the Brexit ultras “are not as organised as you might think”.If there was a confidence vote, Mrs May would probably survive it. But after this week, it would be closer than it would have been before.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We have failed to stand up to Barnier and his negotiators and at every twist and turn we have offered more concessions.First, they demanded we negotiate and sign a “withdrawal agreement”, setting out the terms under which we leave the EU on March , , before we discuss the trading relationship we want after Brexit.At first we said we wouldn’t accept such a demand, this was because the Conservative Manesto during the last General Election promised that the withdrawal agreement and our future trading relationship with the EU would be discussed at the same time.This was for a good reason, most of what the EU wants from us are in the withdrawal agreement and without them we would have little leverage to negotiate a trade deal, something even a child in the playground would understand.Yet despite our red lines, we caved in last December. That’s when, forgetting about our commitment to the British people at the election, we fell into the EU trap.UK Commitments on defence, intelligence and security – just given away. Then we agreed to leave but abide by the rules of the customs Union and single market in an ‘implementation phase’ and when they demanded money, we gave away £billion.Finally we made perhaps the greatest mistake of all we agreed thatwe didn’t get a trade deal with the EU then Northern Ireland would remain in the EU customs Union and some parts of the Single market.In effect, we were handing the power to the EU to break up the union of the United Kingdom, we gave it away.Now as insult piles on to insult, we hear our Government is prepared to extend the implementation phase by another year, beyond .I ask why would anyone do this  It is without rhyme or reason. It would mean we would be under the control of the EU for much longer and we would have to pay around £bn more, on top of £billion.This would be a disaster. After all, just imagine what we could do with that extra money for every £bn we could get , more doctors and , more nurses or , more police officers, the list goes on.Now just imagine what we could do with £billion, we could fund things like Universal Credit properly, schools, hospitals and other public services. Instead it looks like we will just give it away. Remember when we used to say no deal is better than a bad deal.After all,the EU doesn’t get our money, it would face real, financial dficulties It would have to cancel projects, or insist on securing more money out of the other member states of the EU.That’s why we must not pay something for nothing why, they haven’t even discussed a trade deal with us.And talking of trade deals, the  Conservative Manesto also said that we would implement a “deep and special partnership including a comprehensive free trade and customs agreement.”The EU agreed one with Canada and Japan and it has told us repeatedly that it wants one.So why aren’t we telling the EU that we will not agree any of these so called damaging commitments and we will only sit down with them when they stop messing us around and discuss future trade.Our country is full of extraordinarily talented, innovative and hardworking people.We really can forge an exciting, strong and prosperous future outside the EU. Yet at the moment government negotiators have no self-belief.As Mrs Thatcher once said of a colleague, their backbone doesn’t seem to meet their brain.Time to bin the Northern Irish backstop and stand up for British democracy and freedom or we will leave and they won’t get their money, their security, intelligence or defence help.At this rate, no deal with these European bully boys is better than this bad deal making us vassals of the EU.As the song has it, Britons never, never, never will be slaves.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The former Brexit secretary insisted we should not allow ourselves to be bullied by the EU and warned the bloc has plenty to lose from a no-deal Brexit. Writing in the Mail on Sunday, he warned: There have been claims that planes will not fly between the UK and EU. This is extremely improbable as it would undermine the Spanish and other European tourism markets as well as Mediterranean property markets. Furthermore, European flights would still need our airspace in order to fly to the USA. That should be enough to focus minds on a sensible outcome.  Critics of the PM claim the  letters needed to trigger a no confidence vote could soon be reached. Andrew Bridgen, a long-standing critic of Mrs May, told the newspaper she must attend a meeting of the Tory  committee of backbenchers on Wednesday.He said: This week Theresa May will find that she is drinking in the last chance saloon and the bad news for her is that the bar is already dry.If she doesnt turn up to the  that will only make the letters go in even faster.

In The Sunday , he wrote: The Prime Minister has rightly refused to rule out considering dferent approaches - including extending the implementation period, as an alternative to the backstop. But we wont sacrice Northern Ireland, and we must have finality to any backstop - whether through a time limit or a mechanism that enables the UK to leave, in case the EU doesnt live up to its promise to get the future relationship in place swtly. Meanwhile, former Brexit minister Steve Baker is attempting to block the backstop with changes to legislation being heard by Parliament. His proposed amendments to the Northern IrelandBill would make it a legal requirement for the Stormont Assembly to agree to any plan to treat Northern Ireland dferently to the rest of the UK.  The devolved legislature has not sat at Stormont since power-sharing broke down in January . The Bill is due to go before the House of Commons on Wednesday. The logjam in the Brexit negotiations has left the PM fighting criticism on several fronts, including from an MP seen as a rising star in the Tory party. Johnny Mercer, who earlier this week branded the Government a shitshow, said he had received overwhelming support from within the party after speaking out. He told The Sunday Times: I cannot continue to support an administration that cannot . Labour, meanwhile, warned Mrs May thatshe is hoping they will help pass her Brexit blueprint she can think again. Sir Keir Starmer said the current deadlock is a mess of the Prime Ministers own making and warned she is unlikely to surviveshe cannot secure support for her plans.

I was allergic, they made my skin crawl and my eyes blister. But my protests fell on deaf ears. Stephanie loved cats. I didn’t. I hated them. Stephanie tried to reason with me. Cats, she explained, were not the coldly indferent little psychopaths I assumed they were. They were full of character and joy, and once I was exposed to one my allergies would disappear. I had been anti-cat for as long as I could remember. My first memory is the terrying image of a lion urinating on my brother in Chessington Zoo . I tried to imagine me loving a cat, and a bit of sick came up in my mouth. But my children, Millie, now , and Lucas, now , joined in the campaign of persuasion until I capitulated and found myself in a cat breeder’s house in Surrey, flinching away from a tiny ball of fur that was rubbing against my shin. There were two kittens left from the litter. The other sat shaking in the corner, while the parents prowled in the kitchen. The father was a Bengal cat. Bengals are exotic-looking pedigree cats that result from the union of a domestic moggy and an Asian leopard cat. Despite my natural aversion, I couldn’t help but feel a few icy crystals in my heart melt.  The cat by my feet was cute. But I couldn’t bring myself to stroke him. The thought of contact made my eyes itch. He leapt clumsily at my leg, clinging to my jeans with his tiny claws. I shrieked and shook him off. ‘What do you think ’ Stephanie asked. In a snap decision that would haunt me in coming months, I pointed to the lively one and said, ‘If you’re getting one, get that one.’ My cat conversion had begun. We called the kitten Alvin, and during our first evening together Stephanie decided we needed to bond and sat him on my lap. He promptly urinated on me and jumped down. He had marked his territory and I had no idea whether I owned him or he owned me. The following months were a battle of wills between me and a clumsy bundle of fur. He was intent on sleeping in the bedroom and managed to push his way past bigger and heavier barriers until I gave in. He loved Stephanie and wanted all of her attention. He attacked me whenever I got close to her. He slept between us, sat between us and tried to get in the bath with us. I work from home, so for six months before he was old enough to go outside, Alvin and I were forced together in the world’s worst office sharein which my co-worker ran across my keyboard, chewed wires, disconnected peripheries from the back of the computer and pooped in a litter tray in the corner. I read up on Bengals and discovered they were energetic, demanding and excitable. To wear him out I played with him. He particularly enjoyed hide and seek. We’d take turns crouching behind furniture, jumping out at each other, him with claws extended. The allergies were always there, bubbling under, but over time I built up immunities that dulled the reactions. Stephanie was right. As the months progressed I began to realise, to my alarm, that I was becoming fond of him.  He was funny, sociable, plucky and fascinating. His jealous outbursts continued. His favourite method of attack was airborne assault – he would launch himself at my face with claws unsheathed. Once he was allowed outside he became a prolic mouser and the compost pit in the garden became a mass grave for the local rodent population. He also tried his luck on humans, mainly Lucas. Alvin pounced on my son like a lion trying to bring down a wildebeest. He tried the same move on a neighbour and hospitalised her when he hit a vein. He had a huge personality. He became my companion. Then, after he had been with us for  months and just as I started to understand our relationship, he disappeared. We tried everything to find him. I consulted pet detectives, pounded the streets delivering missing posters and even spoke to a psychic. I missed Alvin desperately. Every so often I’d find one of his hairs. He remained forever  months old, visiting occasionally when I scrolled through old pictures and videos. Each time I saw him he made me smile. Alvin had gone, but the feline fire he lit continued to burn and I immersed myself in the cat world. I investigated cat cloning, cat cafes, internet cats and the wacky world of cat fancying where I met some of the most pristine, preened moggies on the planet. I started writing a book, A Tale Of Two Kitties. A year after Alvin had gone, I was the one desperate to get another cat and insisted we got a pedigree Bengal. Barry arrived in February  and was a vocal ball of energy, full of weird quirks. He had a fixation for running water, a fetish for anything made from foam rubber, an aversion to flowers and a destructive streak when it came to cups, glasses and vases.  Barry would pick out the noise of a running tap in the house, race to the source and claw furiously at it. Twice he leapt through my legs as I stood in front of the loo doing my business, and landed in the bowl in front of me. He hated anything fizzy and would attack any glass or beaker with a carbonated drink in it. We lost glassware and china. He smashed a vase Stephanie had inherited from her grandmother, who had taken it with her when she fled the Nazis from her home in Poland. That vase survived the SS, the Holocaust and the Toxteth riots, but not Barry, who knocked it off the window ledge while chewing a carnation. On the one hand he was soppy and craved affection. He played fetch and slept nestled between my legs. Then there was the other wild Barry who was capable of violence and growled as he chewed my arm while his eyes rolled back in his head like a shark. Ironically for one so wild, he was a rubbish mouser and so lazy that one day he bought a trap home with a dead mouse in it. At the start of this year I was invited by a cat fancying contact to enter Barry into the cat version of Crufts , The LondonCats Show. Foolishly I thought it would be a bonding experience for Barry and me. I even spoke to a cat psychologist first to get some tips. Barry didn’t let me groom him or clip his claws, and things started badly when he raked his talons down the arm of the first judge. He competed in the household pet category and was repeatedly placed last. The other competitors, judges and organisers were sympathetic and patient, but Barry hissed and growled at the other cats like a bad-tempered pantomime villain. He finished bottom. But he is my cat, and I couldn’t be without him. It turns out cats do get under your skin. They are the perfect pets for the st century thanks to their independence and mobility. They have taken over social media and cat ownership is on the rise. Dogs have had their day, cats are now man’s best friend.

Carly Oughton said her son Kayne could have died as the infection spread through his abdomen when his appendix ruptured. She said Kayne has recovered but he has been left so upset by his ordeal that he starts cryinghis stomach hurts even a little bit. When Kayne began to suffer stomach pains, Carly said she wasnt too worried at first.But the next day he was still in agony and refused food and drink, so she took him to nearby South Tyneside District Hospital, reports Chronicle Live . They felt his tummy and said he was constipated, even though Id explained he was like clockwork, Carly, , said. Concerned, she then took him to Queen Elizabeth Hospital, in Gateshead, who she said again thought he was suffering from constipation. But as Kaynes stomach pains continued to get worse, Carly grew increasingly concerned that something was seriously wrong. She said: About six days later, I took him back to the hospital in Shields because he had a temperature. He was ten times worse, he had black rings around his eyes, he was pale, he looked like he was dying in front of us.  They kept him in overnight but in the morning they let him go home. When we left he was still crying and screaming in pain, but they couldnt get to the bottom of why. In desperation, Carly visited the nurse at her local GP practice, where she was ordered to take her son straight to hospital. Armed with a note from the nurse, Kayne was seen by doctors at Queen Elizabeth Hospital, where blood tests revealed he had an extremely high white blood cell count, suggesting serious infection. Diagnosed with a perforated appendix, he was then transferred to Newcastles Royal Victoria Infirmary for emergency surgery. Carly said: It was nearly two weeks hed been like that, crying out, and as soon as we got him there they rushed us into theatre. The surgeon came to see us afterwards to say that we were very, very lucky, andwe hadnt got him there he could have died. I had done right by trusting my instincts. Doctors explained Kaynes appendix had ruptured, spreading infection through his abdomen and causing potentially deadly sepsis .Six days later, he had to have further surgery to ensure all traces of the infection were cleared. Carly claims her worries over Kaynes condition were not taken seriously enough by doctors when she first visited hospital. Of course a doctor has medical knowledge, but you know your child better and you knowtheyre not right, she said. I know Kayne has a really high pain threshold, thats something I know as his mum, and when hes screaming in pain I know its something serious. Kayne has made a full recovery and has now ed to school, but his mum claims the trauma of his treatment continues to affect him. If his tummy hurts even a little bit now he starts crying, scared hes going to have to go to hospital, Carly said.  Its horrible to see, its heartbreaking. What still goes through my head is whatI had just given him some calpol and sent him to bed. If Id let him go to sleep, he wouldnt have woken up the next morning. Carly has now hired solicitors to investigate the case and find out whether it was negligent of the hospital to turn her son away. Bryony Doyle, clinical negligence solicitor from law firm JMW, said: I am concerned about the care provided to Kayne, that he was sent away from hospital on three occasions without appendicitis being suspected and he went on to develop the potentially fatal condition sepsis. This has been extremely traumatic for Kayne and his family and it is not the first time JMW has dealt with a case involving severe injury to a child after a parent’s concerns were ignored. Parents are very good at identying when something is wrong with their child and we would urge hospitals to properly heed their concerns. Unfortunately this does not happen enough and the consequences can be completely devastating. Dr Shaz Wahid, medical director for South Tyneside NHS Foundation Trust, said: Patient safety and care of the highest quality are our top priorities so we are very sorry to hear that this family were unhappy with their experience with us. Whenever issues are raised about a patient’s treatment we always investigate thoroughly to seethere is anything we can learn to make improvements for the future.

The company offered me , air miles which for me just didn’t seem enough to compensate what had happened. “We travelled to the resort in Kingston and quite a few of the people that were on the flight with us were also staying at the resort. The whole holiday I had people coming up to me to ask me questions about what had happened. “The cabin crew put my trousers in a plastic bag, but I was not able to wash them on holiday as there are no clothes washing facilities, so when I got back I just had to throw them in the bin.” He added: “The lady at British Airways who dealt with the complaint was very nice and everything but I really do not think that they were right to offer me air miles.  The jeans I was wearing were Armani and cost pound and they did not offer a replacement either. “As CEDR were then dealing with the complaint from then on, they eventually deemed that British Airways had offered a sufficient amount of compensation.” CEDR stands for Centre for Effective Dispute Resolution.

Meanwhile Kensington Palace has also confirmed that Meghan wont be fully taking part in tomorrows scheduled eventsas planned at Fraser Island.revealed last night how Harry has encouraged mum-to-be Meghan to slow down after she felt tired when the opening of the Invictus Games overran by nearly two hours on Saturday, royal sources have said. Meghan spent Sunday morning resting while Harry attended the road cycling event but the former actress looked rested and rejuvenated as she back by his side later on as they attended a reception hosted by Aussie PM Scott Morrison. And the pair were all smiles as looked loved up as they watched the sailing competition final from a luxury boat in the afternoon. The couple and their entourage took a rib out to a yacht – a -foot Hanse  model - where they met an American couple who were cheering on their son.  They were both wrapped up from the elements in black Invictus Games jackets and sported some black shades. Despite the slightly choppy water, the couple stood up to see the race in action – laughing and smiling as they held on to railings for support. Carrie and Bill Novack, from Illinois, had no idea that the Duke and Duchess would be joining them on their boat. Their son, -year-old Ryan, was a first lieutenant in the US air force, before suffering a spinal cord injury in . Mrs Novack said: They were so lovely. Harry asked what Invictus has meant to our family, about our son’s journey - and he also asked after his mental health. It was so easy to talk to them. Harry said it was good that he had been brought in to the programme early on - people can plateau or spiral downwards. We were watching the race and Australia was winning, he said: ‘Sorry about that’. Meghan was asking where we were from, she had gone to university in Chicago near us, and said that she loved Chicago.  Harry was struck by the vessel, saying: the boat is beautul. The team event was raced in elliott keel boats with a mixed gender four-person crew in the ‘open’ category. Each boat was allocated a World Sailing accredited instructor to act as a fth member of crew and provide guidance on safetyrequired. It is the first year that Sailing has taken place at the Invictus Games. Australia came first, Denmark second, Canada fourth, and USA fth.

Harry also told some of Invictus competitors that Meghan was resting back at home, being pregnant takes its toll.  Kensington Palace said the couple had decided to cut back Meghans schedule slightly ahead of the couples visit to Fiji, Tonga and New Zealand. A spokesman said: After a busy programme, The Duke and Duchess have decided to cut back The Duchesss schedule slightly for the next couple of days, ahead of the final week-and-a-half of the tour.

The Duke will continue with the engagements on Fraser Island as planned.”  Harry and Meghan are said to be “pacing themselves” during their -day trip down under as they prepare for parenthood. They will undertake  engagements during the trip. A source added: “We have to try to pace Meghan. We have to make sure she is well paced and not overdoing it. “She had a very late night last night. She wants to do everything, but Prince Harry is encouraging her to pace herself. “We want to make sure she gets enough rest at the beginning of the day and at the end of the day. “If it has been a very late night due to unforeseen circumstances, we have to adjust for that.” "},{"url":null,"title":"meghan markle prince harry royal","story":"Meghan Markle and Prince Harry Royal Tour - all the best photos from day six of their Australia adventurePrince Harry had a funny start to the day as he put on some tiny swimming trunks over his trousers as Meghan took the morning off to restShareCommentsByBilly LabrumElaine McCahill:,  OCT Updated:,  OCT NewsPrince Harry kicked off day six without we Meghan Markle by his side as he encouraged his pregnant we to rest following the busy start to their -day tour of Australia, New Zealand, Fiji and Tonga.

But maybe the biggest impact of all was made by a little-known product shydeveloper for Marks  Spencer. Cathy Chapman’s name does not shyappear in big-selling cookery books – but she transformed our lives by introducing us to what is now a firm favourite. In  she was convinced a dish shyinvented by a French chef for a th shycentury Russian tsar would be perfect as Britain’s first chilled ready meal. Chicken kiev, a breast filled with butter and flavoured with parsley and garlic, is now one of our most shypopular dishes.  It is in the Office for National Statistics basket of goods for working out inflation. And last year, in the Good Food Nation Survey, it came second only to trle on the country’s list of shyfavourite retro foods.  As Britain’s love of increasingly exotic grub grows it is easy to forget that our tastes used to be very unadventurous. Dishes such as curry, spaghetti shybolognese and chilli – now a mainstay of our diet – were dismissed by diehards as “foreign muck”. And Cathy’s plans were nearly thwarted  years ago by a cautious MS board who didn’t think the country was ready for garlic.  But she persisted and convinced them to put aside their reservations about continental foods. MS’s then chairman Marcus Sieff was told the dish was called chicken kiev.  He recalled: “I said, You’ll never sell it up there, in the North, with a name like that.’ I couldn’t have been more wrong.” It is true that the TV dinner, as it was first called, came from the US in . The firm Swanson hit on a way to use huge amounts of surplus turkey after Thanksgiving. The meat was added to all the other shycomponents of the traditional American dinner.  But the stroke of genius was packing it all into the shyaluminium trays used to serve food by airlines. The containers acted as both baking tray to cook the frozen meal and a plate to eat it off. With television taking a grip across the US, the company named its new product the TV dinner – one you could eat while you watched. The new meals were a staggering shysuccess, with ten million shyreportedly sold in the first year. But it was Britain that made the dish its own and, crucially, converted it from a cheap shyfrozen meal into a product for people who were going places.  Other chains have followed MS and now they all have their own ranges of ready meals sold in anything from ceramic shyramekins to plastic dishes. None of this would have been possible without supermarkets investing large sums in shycentralised chilled shywarehouses. Cathy, who started working at MS in her early s in , said: “The only real convenience food that was out there at the time was in the freezer. Most of it was boil-in-the-bag, so pretty grim. A restaurateur called John Docker had contacted the company with the idea of introducing restaurant-quality food to consumers. “Marks  Spencer had already been the first retailer to introduce chilled, skinless chicken breasts and the first to do a whole roast chicken.”  It was the dawning of the age of the shycelebrity chef, with names such Albert Roux coming to the fore and a time when more women began going out to work. After the pound. kiev, Cathy went on to launch the shycountry’s first ready-made lasagne, chilli con carne, Chinese spring rolls and chicken tikka masala. But the recipes weren’t a success with everyone. Now in her s, Cathy recalls a phone call from a customer who vowed she could improve on Marks  Spencer’s Indian dishes. “She told me, ‘I don’t think much of your Indian products, and I think I can do better.’ She was a housewe who had learnt to cook from recipes handed down by shygenerations in her family.” After agreeing to meet Shehzad Husain, who arrived in reception with a wicker basket full of homemade dishes in , the two went on to work together for  years.  Today Cathy is still expected to have her finger on the pulse but sometimes, she says, consumers are not always ready for her radical introductions.  Although Mexican food is the fourth biggest ethnic cuisine sector in the UK – after Indian, Chinese and Thai – she tried and failed several times to launch a successful ready-meal line. She has travelled over the world looking for inspiration, from barbecue joints in Texas to Japan’s sushi bars, but is constantly drawn back to Italy for her own holidays. And she never stops experimenting with dferent dishes. But with more celebrity chefs dominating the book charts, do ready meals have a future  Cathy said: “There is an ever-growing interest to reflect restaurant quality food in the home. And street food is getting a lot of attention. “It takes a lot of effort to prepare all the shydferent dishes. Most customers don’t have the time. The ready meal is evolving according to the trends. We’ll see people being able to serve shyseveral plates but without the hassle.” Does that mean chicken kiev is history  Apparently not. Today it is enjoying a revival in smart restaurant menus thanks to the trend for retro dishes. Star chefs including TV favourites Tom Kerridge and James Martin have all made space for it in recent recipe books.

Meghan, , showed off her growing baby bump yesterday as she and Harry, , opened the fourth run of his Invictus Games at a ceremony in Sydney.Giving a speech, the Prince told of his happiness at being able to share “the personal joy” of his we’s pregnancy with the people of Australia.The couple revealed on Monday that they are expecting their first child – just a day before kicking off their royal tour, which has  engagements. And Harry gave warm thanks for the welcome they had when they started their -day visit, which will also take in New Zealand and the Pacic islands of Fiji and Tonga. A senior Palace source said yesterday: “Their Royal Highnesses are absolutely relishing the tour and enjoying every moment.  “They have both said how much they are loving their time here and have been overwhelmed by the warmth of the welcome and the people. It’s a long tour and with so many engagements it’s a real undertaking, but they are feeling good and pacing themselves.” Harry stood in the shadow of the iconic Sydney Opera House as he delivered his speech to officially open the Invictus Games, addressing thousands of competitors, their families and guests. He said: “Thank you for the welcome you have given Meghan and I over the last few days. I have been so proud to be able to introduce my we to you and we have been so happy to be able to celebrate the personal joy of our newest addition with you all.” Harry earlier this week spoke of how he “couldn’t think of anywhere better” to announce to the world that he and Meghan were expecting their first child.  The Duke has a particular affection for Australia, first visiting in  with his late mother, Princess Diana. He travelled the country again in  during his gap year and three times in  and . Harry told how it was  years to the day that his grandmother, the Queen, opened Sydney Opera House. He said: “On this day in , my grandmother stood in front of this Opera House and declared it open. Forty-five years later, to the day, it is my honour to be standing in front of this iconic symbol of Australia’s place in the modern world at the start of the fourth Invictus Games.

The first games were in London in . Befog his speech, he and Meghan – thought to be around  weeks pregnant – laid a wreath at the city’s Anzac memorial to commemorate the shycentenary of the end of the First World War and honour Australia’s heroes in the conflict.  He later told the crowd: “Invictus was inspired by the experiences I had alongside our servicemen and women from many nations. “These Games were created for our men and women in unorm designed around their talents and their needs and built not just for them, but also for the friends and families that have supported their recoveries and had their lives changed for ever. “Our Invictus family has turned these games into a symbol of strength, honour and optimism for a new shygeneration. In a few weeks we honour the memory of the generation that fought the First World War – including the sacrices of the Anzacs whose ethos and heroic actions helped forge the character of this great country.” Royal observers have noted how Harry has been using this tour to demonstrate his ability to bring communities together and take on a statesmanlike role. Earlier this year, the Queen made him a youth ambassador for the Commonwealth, a role in which he will help youngsters across the former colonies tackle their challenges. The Duke and Duchess are today six days into their tour. They will travel to Hervey Bay before visiting Fraser Island, a World Heritage site that is the largest sand island in the world. Next week, they fly to Fiji and Tonga, then back to Sydney on Saturday for the closing of the games.

Harry encouraged mum-to-be Meghan to slow down after she felt tired when the opening of the Invictus Games overran by nearly two hours, royal sources have said.  Meghan, , turned up at a reception in central Sydney after missing a cycling event earlier in the day. The royal couple attended an official reception for competitors, their friends and family at an event hosted by Prime Minister Scott Morrison.

A spokesman said: After a busy programme, The Duke and Duchess have decided to cut back The Duchesss schedule slightly for the next couple of days, ahead of the final week-and-a-half of the tour.

On Saturday night, Harry officially opened the Games for wounded soldiers at a ceremony on the forecourt of the Sydney Opera House. The event was delayed slightly following thunderstorms in the city.

Nathan Phillips, , and Luke, , lost their mum Anita to cancer in . She was . The boys and their devastated dad, David, pulled together. But further heartbreak was to come when, just three months ago, shymotorcyclist David, , died in a head-on collision with a truck. Luke was on the back of the bike and was severely injured. Part of his foot had to be amputated and David’s fate was kept from him as he battled for survival.  In that cruel moment, le changed forever for the brothers. Yet it has drawn them even closer together. And for Nathan there is no more partying or going out with his mates. He says: “I’ve got to focus on looking after Luke now. “When he was first in hospital we had to keep telling him Dad was okay.  “The doctors saidwe’d told him straight away he’d have panicked and he wouldn’t have been able to go into surgery. “His foot got stuck under the wheel of the lorry. He had to have half his big toe and all of his little toe amputated. “He lost a lot of the skin on his foot, he needed a skin graft from the top of his leg on to his foot.” The accident happened in Mancetter, Warwickshire – a few miles from the family’s Nuneaton home. Luke was left in a coma at Birmingham Children’s Hospital. And even after he came round Nathan was only able to tell him about their dad once he had stabilised.  He adds: “It was pretty hard seeing Luke like that. “He thought Dad was okay when he was in AE. We had to keep telling him it was all right. “Telling Luke that Dad died was the worst thing I’ve ever had to do.” As he stands beside Luke, Nathan vows to take on the role of mum and dad – as well as big brother. His love and sheer shydetermination to help Luke cope would make Anita and David proud.  Nathan has nursed Luke on the path to recovery while still grieving himself. He managed to get himself a better paid job – swapping pot-washing work for a position at Aldi. Then he got to grips with running a household – paying bills, doing the chores, looking after them both. Speaking for the first time, Nathan goes on: “I think it has taught me to make the most of every day, don’t let little things upset you and just enjoy the days as they come. “I don’t want to be upset or angry about losing Mum and Dad. I’ve got to focus on looking after Luke now. “We respect each other a lot more, I think. I have to do things like wake him up early for school – but he’s all right about it.  “He still gets his moments where he says ‘I miss Mum and Dad’ or ‘I wish Dad was here’ – you know, to give him a hug before bed. “But we do stuff together to make sure things work out.” Household chores have included redecorating their home. Nathan continues: “I used to spend more time with my mates. “I’d be out in my car all the time or on my Xbox. I can still do those things now – but not so much. “I’ve got the washing up, to do, the laundry, the shopping, making sure Luke’s unorm and my work stuff is sorted. I feel asI have been left to do everything by myself.  “It’s nobody’s fault, it’s just how the world is. “It has just meant I’ve had to mature a bit quicker. “Before losing my mum I had a normal le – no worries, going around doing my own thing, not having to worry about anyone but myself.” The brothers have fond memories of mum Anita, who was a sales assistant at Morrison’s.  And the pain is still raw after losing dad David, who worked as a CADoperator. But somehow, the tragic experience of the past two years has brought the brothers closer, Nathan says. He explains: “It has been tough now and then. Our relationship was always good but has grown dramatically since then. “He’s always been a good lad and never misbehaved. We argue now and again, but nothing serious.”  Despite the physical and psychological trauma, Nathan says Luke is doing well. He is back at school – in Year Eight – and is off his crutches. As for Nathan, he has given up the le of a typical -year-old. He says: “It’s just not an option. I work, I look after Luke and I see my girlfriend. “Sometimes me and my girlfriend will go outLuke’s at a friend’s house. I get a lot less time to myself.”  Nathan is Luke’s , but does get help from aunties and uncles. However, grandparents on both sides have passed away. After hearing their story the local community has rallied round, setting up a crowdfunding campaign and donating thousands to help the boys. Kindhearted friends and family set an initial target of pound,. But that has been surpassed and the total currently stands at pound,. Nathan is hugely appreciative. And every penny will be put to good use.  He says of the appeal: “It’s been brilliant, it’s going really well. “My next door neighbour Wayne did a sponsored bike ride and raised pound, from that. “It’ll make le easier.

The UK is expected to see rain and moderate temperatures on Sunday, before a ‘shock to the system’ as temperatures are expected to plummet by more than  degrees after the weekend - bringing snow to some parts of the country. A rare weather phenomenon will then see Scotland and northern England battered by strong geostrophic winds through the middle of the week. The freezing conditions could last up to three weeks meteorologists have warned, with “mostly below normal” temperatures lasting through to November .  Met Office forecaster Sarah Kent said: “After mild temperatures, it will be time for woolly jumpers and hats. “Winds turn to the north from Thursday, bringing cold polar air and much cooler temperatures across all parts by the weekend. “There could be snow lying on high ground at the weekend, with temperatures low enough for wintry showers mainly in the north Pennines, north-east England and Scotland. If the wind direction changes, other areas could be at risk.” Weather charts show a huge gush of freezing air spilling into the UK from the North Pole during the second half of next week.  Bitter winds will see temperatures drop to -Cin Scotland with windchill temperatures of between freezing and -Cforecast across the north of Britain. Further south thermometers will drop close to freezing overnight with Arctic wind making it feel even colder. Some forecasters say November will likely be colder than usual and snow or snow showers arent out of the question in many places.

And jails are squeezed to the seams most Fridays, when the weekly statistics come out. Either we are sending too many people to prison, or we do not have enough places for those who need to be there. Whichever view you are inclined to hold, we should all agree that our jails are out of control. Just how out of control is clear from the shocking prison videos created by inmates that the Sunday Mirror publishes today. Mobile phones and drugs are openly on display. Prisoners are dangerously off their heads on spice, leaving them vulnerable to assault and humiliation. Tory austerity cuts mean prison budgets are  per cent lower than eight years ago. Although more officers have been hired, there are still , fewer than in . And young, wet-behind-the-ears recruits are no substitute for experienced old hands. Prison is not meant to be a punishment. The punishment is being sent there and the loss of freedom that goes with it.  But jails are not holiday camps either. We expect convicted criminals to be treated with discipline but dignity, with a firm hand but an understanding heart. And we want those who run our prisons to have the space to rehabilitate those who can be reformed, while keeping those who are a danger to society securely away from it. All that’s at risk when every day is an exercise in crisis management. If prison staff spend all their time trying to keep order, there is little left to do other worthwhile work. This will come down to money. Theresa May says austerity is over. Good. We expect her to spend some of the windfall on our prisons. That means decent pay for prison staff and proper facilities for prisoners to get an education or learn a trade. It’s the only way to break the cycle of reoffending.

It allegedly attacked Mr Khashoggi using a troll farm based in Riyadh and had a suspected spy within Twitter that the kingdom utilised to monitor user accounts to help its leadership. It was all part of a campaign to sway public opinion against the Washington Post columnist and other influential critics of the regime, it was reported. Mr Khashoggi, , was tortured and murdered after entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on October , it is claimed, and his body has yet to be found.  Saudi Arabias claims that he died in a fist fight have been widely rejected as Turkish officials say he was assassinated and dismembered by Saudi security forces. Saudi operatives began a social media campaign to harass critics in , the New York Times reported. Saud al-Qahtani, an adviser to de facto ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, created the strategy behind the effort, US and Saudi officials told the newspaper. Qahtani was one of five officials Saudi King Salman has fired, according to Saudi state media, following the global controversy over Mr Khashoggis disappearance.  Twitter declined to comment. On Saturday, Mr Khashoggis employer issued a blistering take-down of the kingdoms account of what happened inside the consulate, accusing it of a face-saving cover-up while putting further pressure on US President Donald Trump. Fred Ryan, publisher and CEO of the Washington Post, said in a statement: The Government of Saudi Arabia has shamefully and repeatedly offered one lie after another in the nearly three weeks since Jamal Khashoggi disappeared in their Istanbul Consulate. Offering no proof, and contrary to all available evidence, they now expect the world to believe that Jamal died in a fight following a discussion. This is not an explanation it is a coverup.  President Trump, Congress and leaders of the civilised world should demand to see veriable evidence. The Saudis cannot be allowed to fabricate a face-saving solution to an atrocity that appears to have been directed by the highest levels of their government. On Friday, Trump said ally Saudi Arabias version of events was credible and vowed to speak to the crown prince. On Saturday, he said he was not satisfied with the explanation, and warned against halting lucrative Saudi arms sales. He added that it was possible that the crown prince had been unaware of the death. Earlier, Germany and France called Riyadhs explanation incomplete, going further than Trump in pressing the kingdom over the disappearance and death of the journalist, a Saudi national who lived in the US.  Riyadh offered no evidence to support its claims, which were a reversal after repeatedly insisting that Mr Khashoggi had left the consulate alive the same day he entered to get documents for his upcoming marriage.The Saudi public prosecutor claimed that a fight broke out between Mr Khashoggi and people who met him in the building, leading to his death. Eighteen Saudi nationals had been arrested, the prosecutor said. A Saudi official told Reuters separately: A group of Saudis had a physical altercation and Jamal died as a result of the chokehold. They were trying to keep him quiet. Amnesty International said the Saudi explanation appeared to be a whitewash of an appalling assassination. Turkish sources told Reuters that investigators have an audio recording documenting the murder inside the consulate. Pro-government newspaper Yeni Safak claimed torturers cut off Mr Khashoggis fingers during an interrogation and beheaded him. A security source told Reuters that  Saudi nationals arrived in Istanbul in two planes and entered the consulate the same day Mr Khashoggi was there and later left the country.

In the latest version of events contradicting Saudi Arabias official story, Reuters is citing an official source which has now revealed that a member of the team which killed him dressed in Khashoggis clothes to make it look ashe had left the building as part of the cover up. There has been intense speculation as to what actually happened to the -year-old after he was spotted entering the consulate in Istanbul on CCTV on October . Some sources have claimed that his fingers were chopped off during an interrogation - said to have been recorded on an Apple Watch - while others have claimed his body was chopped up and smuggled out piece-by-piece. After denying any involvement in the disappearance of Khashoggi for two weeks, Saudi Arabia finally admitted on Friday nightthat he died inside the building during a fistfight. The anonymous insider has now told Reuters that a team of  Saudi nationals threatened him with being drugged and kidnapped.  The Saudi official attributed the death to a chokehold. Turkish officials suspect the body of Khashoggi, a Washington Post columnist and critic of powerful Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, was cut up - but the Saudi official said it was rolled up in a rug and given to a local cooperator for disposal. Asked about allegations that Khashoggi had been tortured and beheaded, he said preliminary results of the investigation did not suggest that. The Saudi official presented what he said were Saudi internal intelligence documents which appeared to show the initiative to bring back dissidents as well as the specic one involving Khashoggi.  He also showed testimony from those involved in what he described as the -man teams cover-up, and the initial results of an internal probe. He did not provide proof to substantiate the findings of the investigation and the other evidence. This narrative is the latest Saudi account that has changed multiple times. The authorities initially dismissed reports that Khashoggi had gone missing inside the consulate as  and said he had left the building soon after entering. When the media reported a few days later that he had been killed there, they called the accusations baseless. Asked by Reuters why the governments version of Khashoggis death kept changing, the official said the government initial account was based on  information reported internally at the time.  Once it became clear these initial mission reports were , it launched an internal investigation and refrained from further public comment, the official said, adding that the investigation is continuing. Turkish sources say the authorities have an audio recording purportedly documenting Khashoggis murder inside the consulate but have not released it. Riyadh dispatched a high-level delegation to Istanbul on Tuesday and ordered an internal investigation but U.S. President Donald Trump said on Saturday he is not satisfied with Saudi Arabias handling of Khashoggis death and said questions remain unanswered. Germany and France on Saturday called Saudi Arabias explanation of how Khashoggi died incomplete. According to the latest version of the death, the government wanted to convince Khashoggi, who moved to Washington a year ago fearing reprisals for his views, toto the kingdom as part of a campaign to prevent Saudi dissidents from being recruited by the countrys enemies, the official said.  To that end, the official said, the deputy head of the General Intelligence Presidency, Ahmed al-Asiri, put together a -member team from the intelligence and security forces to go to Istanbul, meet Khashoggi at the consulate and try to convince him toto Saudi Arabia. There is a standing order to negotiate theof dissidents peacefully which gives them the authority to act without going back to the leadership the official said. Asiri is the one who formed the team and asked for an employee who worked withal-Qahtani and who knew Jamal from the time they both worked at the embassy in London, he said. The official said Qahtani had signed off on one of his employees conducting the negotiations.  According to the plan, the team could hold Khashoggi in a safe house outside Istanbul for a period of time but then release himhe ultimately refused toto Saudi Arabia, the official said. Things went wrong from the start as the team overstepped their orders and quickly employed violence, the official said. Khashoggi was ushered into the consul generals office where an operative named Maher Mutreb spoke to him about ing to Saudi Arabia, according to the governments account. Khashoggi refused and told Mutreb that someone was waiting outside for him and would contact the Turkish authoritieshe did not reappear within an hour, the official said.  Khashoggis fiancee, Hatice Cengiz, has told Reuters he had handed her his two mobile phones and left instructions that she should wait for him and call an aide to Turkeys presidenthe did not reappear. Back inside the consuls office, according to the officials account, Khashoggi told Mutreb he was violating diplomatic norms and said, What are you going to do with me  Do you intend to kidnap me  Mutreb replied, Yes, we will drug you and kidnap you, in what the official said was an attempt at intimidation that violated the missions objective. When Khashoggi raised his voice, the team panicked. They moved to restrain him, placing him in a chokehold and covering his mouth, according to the governments account. They tried to prevent him from shouting but he died, the official said. The intention was not to kill him. Askedthe team had smothered Khashoggi, the official said: If you put someone of Jamals age in this position, he would probably die. To cover up their misdeed, the team rolled up Khashoggis body in a rug, took it out in a consular vehicle and handed it over to a local cooperator for disposal, the official said. Forensic expert Salah Tubaigy tried to remove any trace of the incident, the official said. Turkish officials have told Reuters that Khashoggis killers may have dumped his remains in Belgrad Forest adjacent to Istanbul, and at a rural location near the city of Yalova,  miles south of Istanbul. Turkish investigators are likely to find out what happened to the body before long, a senior official said. The Saudi official said the local cooperator is an Istanbul resident but would not reveal his nationality. The official said investigators were trying to determine where the body ended up. Meanwhile, operative Mustafa Madani donned Khashoggis clothes, eyeglasses and Apple watch and left through the back door of the consulate in an attempt to make it look like Khashoggi had walked out of the building. Madani went to the Sultanahmet district where he disposed of the belongings. The official said the team then wrote a  report for superiors saying they had allowed Khashoggi to leave once he warned that Turkish authorities could get involved and that they had promptly left the country before they could be discovered. Sceptics have asked why so many people, including military officers and a forensics expert specializing in autopsies, were part of the operationthe objective was to convince Khashoggi tohome of his own volition. The disappearance of Khashoggi, a Saudi insider turned critic, has snowballed into a massive crisis for the kingdom, forcing the -year-old monarch, King Salman, to personally get involved. It has threatened the kingdoms business relationships, with several senior executives and government officials shunning an investor conference in Riyadh scheduled for next week and some U.S. lawmakers putting pressure on Trump to impose sanctions and stop arms sales to Saudi Arabia. The official said all  team members had been detained and placed under investigation, along with three other local suspects.

Human rights campaigners demanded to know what happened as Turkish investigators insisted they would have proof of his murder in days. It followed Saudi claims he was killed in a fist fight after negotiations in Istanbul turned violent a fortnight ago. Samah Hadid, Middle East director of campaigns for Amnesty International, called on the United Nations to set up an independent probe.  She said: “On the nd of October Khashoggi walked into the Saudi Arabian consulate in Turkey to get some paperwork and never came out. “Saudi Arabian authorities claimed that he left the consulate but Turkish authorities reported that he was assassinated inside.” She added: “Without an independent investigation, we may never get the full truth about what happened to Jamal.” The kingdom had denied any involvement in the Saudi dissident’s disappearance after Turkish officials said he had been dismembered inside the consulate.  But yesterday the country’s public prosecutor announced Khashoggi had died in a fight with people who met him in the consulate. The statement added that  men had been arrested in connection with a “cover-up” and two senior officials had been sacked. Sources claim the Saudis do not know the whereabouts of the body after it was handed to a “local collaborator” to dispose of. Turkish police have widened their search from the consulate grounds to a nearby forest where unnamed officials believe his corpse may have been dumped. Investigators allege  men who arrived in Istanbul from Riyadh on private jets owned by the Saudi royal family were sent to kill him.

win at Hamilton – Dundee’s only league win of the season.And the Irish centre-back insists he wants to maintain those good displays under Macca as they look to rise from the foot of the table, starting at Livingston today.“With the new manager coming in it’s been quite positive and bubbly,” the -year-old said.“We had a quick chat with what the manager expects of us and what way he wants us to play.“We’ve had some good training sessions, full of energy and enjoyable.“As professional footballers we have to be ready for all kinds of situations and, either way, we knew we were going to be in on Wednesday morning and had games to prepare for.“From Tuesday when Neil McCann left there was no real indication the turnaround was going to be so quick but it was training as normal.“With the international break over the past week it was a bit of a surprise on Tuesday when the news broke but it’s just one of those things.“Neil was great at the time when he was here, in the short time I got to work with him.“We need to move on now, though, because we’ve got big games coming up over the next few days.”Newly-promoted Livi are flying high under manager Gary Holt and sit in fth place in the Premiership table on  points,  ahead of the Dark Blues.Their former-player manager Kenny Miller is now on the books of Dundee and Boyle admits the players have been using the hitman’s experience ahead of a game he feels they need to get a result from.He added: “Lads will probably speak to Kenny and ask him about what they’ll face in their dferent positions.“Since I’ve been here Kenny’s been brilliant, he knows the game very well and has a huge pedigree in the game so he’s a big help.“Livingston have the articial pitch and that will be dficult compared to what we’re used to but we showed against Hamilton that we can play on that.“We know it’ll be a test for us because, obviously, they have gone so well at the start of the season.“It’s a game we believe we can get a positive result from.”And the Dee will be hoping they can pick up some points as it doesn’t get any easier with current league leaders Hearts coming to Dens Park on Tuesday night.Although they’ve not had much of a chance to train as a group under Jim and have been out of the swing of regular matches because of the international break, Boyle feels they’ll be ready for the challenge of playing two games in four days.Boyle said: “As players you want to play as many games as possible.“You’d rather play games than train and the Saturday-Tuesday is a chance to get maximum points on the board and that’s the way we’ve got to look at it now.“It’s important now to get results and try to climb the table.“We’ve picked up of late and we have the confidence going into today that we’re more than capable of getting a result.“We’ll, hopefully, take that into Tuesday but today’s game is first and foremost.“It’s a massive game for us.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/10/5bc86768bcec3.jpg ","title":"former dundee goalkeeper derek soutar has forgiven jim mcintyre for dundee united goal","story":"Jim McIntyre broke his heart in one of the most crucial Dens Park derbies ever, but former goalie Derek Soutar is happy to deal with the now and gives his backing to the newly-appointed Dundee manager.During a playing career that saw him spend five years over the road at Dundee United, McIntyre made a habit of scoring goals against the Dark Blues.Few were more important than his April  winner that proved vital in the Tangerines staying in the top flight that season – at the expense of their city rivals.And it’s a painful memory for “Soapy”, who was in the home goal for that - defeat.For him, though, it’s all about what McIntyre can do for the team he remains an avid fan of and not about what happened in the distant past.He’s hopeful his fellow-Dee supporters adopt the same attitude and get right behind the new gaffer.“Thanks for bringing that up, it’s not one of the derbies I prefer to recall but I do remember Jim scoring that winner and it wasn’t a nice feeling,” he said.“He was always a dangerous player we had to watch out for in derbies and you have to be honest about it, a lot of Dundee fans won’t have forgotten that.“But now it’s about what he can do for our club and I’m surehe can get a few quick wins and get the team up the table a bit the fans will be right behind him.“He’s not the first manager, even in Dundee, who’s taken over at a team that were his rivals when he was a player, it’s part of football and it’s not something that stopped them going on to have success.“And going on to manage a club you were a favourite at is no guarantee of success – sadly we’ve just seen that with Neil McCann.“I was sorry to see him go because he’s someone I like as a person, who I knew had a real feeling for Dundee and wanted to play good football but things just didn’t work out.“Now the board have turned to Jim and, as well as being a manager whose teams can play attractive stuff, he’s one who knows the importance of results. Particularly right now, he’ll be working to get them and get Dundee out of this hole they’re in and, as time passes, he’ll worry about how it looks.”Soutar points outDundee drew up a profile of the man they needed, McIntyre would be one of those who came closest to ticking all the necessary boxes.“Jim’s now an experienced manager with knowledge of the Premiership and he’s been successful. I know he got the sack at another of my old clubs, Ross County, last year, but it was a harsh decision.“I’ve a lot of time for Roy McGregorand he’s a man who hasn’t made many mistakes up there.“Getting rid of Jim and Billy Dodds was one and I think when he looks back on that he’d probably agree.“As for Jim himself, he is a proud man who will work very hard to put things right a Dundee.“What happened at County will have hurt him and he’ll be determined to prove he still has a lot to offer – I think he has.“In the past he’s got the best out of players and while he’s inheriting a few good ones at Dens, I think it’s fair to say there are a few others who’ve under-achieved.”Soutar’s also convinced Dundee are getting a man whose stock in Scottish football remains high, and rightly so.“While he’s been out of the game he’s been linked with a few clubs andsome of them chose to go another way, I know he knocked back a few offers because they weren’t right for him.“He’s wanted to get back in at a club where he feels he can achieve something in the top ision and Dundee fans can be happy he thinks we fit that bill.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/10/5bc99e098fe91-846x564.jpg ","title":"found at car wheel with open buckfast","story":"A man has admitted getting behind the wheel of a car while more than four times the alcohol limit.Paul Milne, , was found slumped in his parked car with a bottle of Buckfast and vodka on Clepington Road on July  this year.He admitted being in charge of the vehicle after having  mics of alcohol in mls of breath, exceeding the limit of  mics.Dundee Sherf Court heard that the police were alerted to Milne by two delivery drivers who were concerned about his appearance while within the vehicle.Fiscal depute Charmaine Gilmartin told Sherf Alastair Brown: “Two takeaway drivers saw the accused’s vehicle parked on Clepington Road and they thought they had seen alcohol within the car.“They brought it to the attention of police officers who attended five minutes later who traced him within the car.“His head was slumped forward and the keys were in the ignition.“They could see an open bottle of Buckfast and a bottle of vodka in the car.“He smelled strongly of alcohol and was unsteady on his feet.”Milne failed a roadside breath test and later provided the reading at police headquarters.Solicitor Kevin Hampton said Milne, formerly of Strathmartine Road but now residing at Jericho House on Artillery Lane, had struggled with alcoholism and was taking active steps to tackle his drinking.He said: “There’s a long-standing alcohol problem which he now seems to be tackling and is doing quite well.“He got to the stage where he realised he was out of control.“He has taken the steps to move into Jericho House and that is where he is residing at the moment.”Sentence was deferred on Milne until November  in order to gather criminal justice social work reports.He was additionally disqualied from driving in the interim."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/10/5bc99da315efe-376x564.jpg ","title":"mums horror as brick misses baby by inches","story":"A young mum has described the terrying moment a brick smashed through her window and landed only inches from her baby’s head.Roxanne Montague was in her living room with her -month-old son Mason when the object came crashing into her home.The -year-old said she had heard shouting outside her house on Ballantrae Road in Douglas moments before the missile smashed through the glass.Roxanne said: “It was terrying.

So it’s proved with the former Scotland star at Dens Park.That he had very definite ideas on how the game should be played was clear, as was the fact he was unlikely to change them.He demanded his team focused on a passing game all over the pitch, making it clear he’d accept responsibilityit meant risks taken in playing the ball out from the back at times led to goals being conceded. Inevitably it did.In fairness to McCann, his arrival did bring about a speedy and necessary improvement and wins over Motherwell and Kilmarnock followed by a draw with Ross County were enough to save the team from relegation in the   season.Two defeats would follow before the end of the campaign and while they were largely irrelevant to a relieved support, they did perhaps suggest to the caretaker boss that, long-term, the changes he wanted to make were going to be too big an ask.That led to a confusing summer that initially saw him announce he did not want the job, moves be made for then-St Mirren boss Jack Ross, before McCann had a change of mind and was appointed on a permanent basis.Crucially, that saw time wasted in undertaking what was a clearly necessary rebuilding of the squad. That left him playing catch-up when it came to new signings.It meant despite talk of better to come, with the exception of a brief spell around February, hopes of a top-six challenge gave way to another battle for survival.It was achieved via three wins from the first four post-split fixtures but, even so, it was clear better was expected this season.Another summer of signings this year gave some hope that would be the case but, although progression from the Betfred Cup group stage was secured, a home defeat at the hands of Championship Dunfermline and a lack of goals were worrying.Performances in opening league games against St Mirren and Aberdeen were decent but both ended in defeat.Then an inept and ill-disciplined display against Ayr in the last  of the Betfred Cup that saw three goals conceded and two red cards had the alarm bells ringing.After that the defeats continued coming. There was brief respite via a solitary success at Hamilton last month but he departs having lost eight of his last nine fixtures.If that was not bad enough, his time in charge saw stories of discord in the dressing-room and bust-ups with ious players during his time in charge didn’t help.Most notably was the argument that led to star goalie Scott Bain’s time at Dens coming to an abrupt end.

It skips across to the trees below our window, closely followed by another inquisitive animal.The first arrival gives chase, picking up speed as its mate dances in its wake, enjoying the open space and cooler air at the end of one of the summer’s hottest days. Just as we were, in fact.Sitting together in our lodge at Macdonald Spey Valley Resort’s golf and country club, just outside Aviemore, we shared a little of the magic presented by a holiday in Scotland.When you’re a mum of emergent adults, you find their holiday availability is fairly slim.Both working and planning their own adventures, I knew their time for a few days away with me would be in short supply. vw, px\"  As it transpired, a couple of days in Aviemore was the perfect distance and timescale to capture their imagination – and with a home from home available at the resort for all of us, along with our dog Blue, we filled up the car and headed over the Lecht for a couple of days in the Highlands.The journey to Aviemore is a fun drive with plenty of pretty places to stop and give our labrador a run. We had lunch in Bellabeg – a picnic in the sunshine courtesy of the well-stocked local shop.The Spar is on the main road, has parking spaces and a picnic table and chairs outside which provided the perfect pit spot for our trio and half-baked dog. vw, px\"  Blue had a bowl of water and a plunge into the burn which cooled him off ready for the next  mountainous miles viewed from the back of the car, and after taking the obligatory photographs at the sign for Lost, we headed for the Cairngorms National Park, and our self-catering lodge.The chalets at Spey Valley are dog-friendly, and with their setting on the edge of the golf course, with a Costa at the club house within easy walking distance, everything was in place to make this frequent dog walker feel completely at home. Our evening and early morning walks round the resort were accompanied by birdsong, rabbit chases and the view of the snow-topped Cairn Gorm proving a surreal sight while we struggled on in the heatwave of one of the hottest summers in Aviemore’s recent history.Our lodge was, to my daughter’s delight, “an upside down house”, with two bedrooms and en-suite bathrooms downstairs, and a large open-plan living room, kitchen and conservatory on stilts upstairs. vw, px\"  This glass room in the sky gave views of mountains, forests and the comings and goings of wildle and golfers, and was the perfect place to sit for a television-free evening, windows wide open and a locally-distilled Kinrara gin and tonic in hand. The lodges are furnished with television, DVD and CD player –you remember such things – but with beautul scenery and gorgeous weather to enjoy, we decided against plugging in.Instead, we used the marble chess set, which is also part of the decoration, read books and talked over meals cooked at the modern and fully-equipped kitchen.

What’s more, eventhey don’t mutate as occurred in the case outlined here,released into the wild either by design or mistake these foreigners can cause havoc to local ecosystems.In a letter to the scientic journal Nature in , a group of German scientists began ‘it has been rumoured that an unidentied crayfish…of marbled appearance and uncertain geographical origin that was introduced into the German aquarium trade in the mid s, is capable of unisexual reproduction ’.The authors ended by warning that: ‘This crayfish…could become a menace to European freshwater systems, as the release of even one specimen into the wild would be enough to found a population that might out-compete native crayfish’.Now,  years later, this all-female crayfish has escaped into the wild.  Identied as a descendent of the fresh water slough crayfish from Florida, it is now called the marbled crayfish or Marmokrebs. So far it has invaded the waterways of at least nine European countries as well as Japan and Madagascar. Unravelling its origin reveals that a unique macro-mutation must have occurred in a single slough crayfish egg probably caused by heat or cold shock whilst in transit from Florida to Germany for the pet market.The resulting female hatchling possessed three sets of chromosomes per celland the ability to produce clones of itself without a mate and at very high frequency.Because of its warm climate and abundant freshwater habitats, Madagascar has seen the most rapid colonisation with Marmokrebs. Millions of the animals have invaded the countries lakes, rice paddies and swamps and are threatening its seven endemic crayfish species.It is only a matter of time before this scenario is repeated in other locations, destroying valuable ecosystems and eliminating indigenous species."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 37","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Sir,It is always a delight when a letter awakens a landowner.James F Lithgow#s insult about ‘blow-ins’ is a typical trait. I worked extremely hard to buy my farm, not being able to piggyback on my forebears’ efforts, and I didn’t ‘blow-in’, it took two forty-foot pantechnicons four days.It is clear he has an interest in wind turbines, and no doubt with a pair of wellies, a fish farm or two. His blinkered refusal to accept the huge body of evidence regarding fish farm contamination suggests he has an investment and it needs protecting. But only, of course,you don’t have a commercial interest.There is a huge amount of evidence that mechanical kelp harvesting does irreparable damage to the sea bed. Could I draw your readers# attention to the Facebook page #Stop Mechanical Kelp Dredging# The sea bed can’t be seen, but a bank statement can. No prizes for who is the loser. The  jobs in aquaculture will not last longmass kelp harvesting is allowed to decimate sub-sea environments and the only jobs on fish farms will be pushing barrows of diseased and dead fish.I’ve no doubt he knows that wind turbines have a -year le span and then the hugely disruptive process will start againan alternative has not been discovered. It has been calculated that the energy costs of a wind turbine will never be recovered during its lespan, but those receiving grants really don’t care.Why, given the amount of rainfall in Argyll, are hydro schemes not pursued  It used to be a mystery, until one looks at the vast sums of subsidy given by a gullible government to so called ‘alternative energy sources’, which actually means ‘alternative revenue sources’.There are any number of pretty glens that could be dammed, providing an extra environmentally-friendly leisure resource, create an opportunity for aquaculture and would not require a replacement somewhere down the line.Alexander Hamilton, Tayvallich.Sir,With reference to James Lithgow’s letter of September , it is important to make a couple of points.Mr Lithgow is right to say kelp has been sustainably harvested in Argyll for generations. There can be no comparison, however, with the current proposal to mechanically dredge up entire stands from the seabed together with all the fragile le that depends on them. This is not sustainable as evidenced in the few countries which have allowed this practice to take place.  Seaweed cultivation, on the other hand, is sustainable and more can be found on this through the Scottish Association for Marine Science.The  parliamentary inquiry into the environmental impact of salmon farming warned current methods could cause #irrecoverable damage#.  This is deeply concerning to those of us who live here, raise families and rely on the sea for our creel fishing, shellfish and tourism businesses. We also all have an inherent responsibility to care for our environment and there is increasing urgency to do this.Enterprises do need to be encouraged to grow and to provide opportunities and employment. This, however, must be done responsibly and with thought for the long-term viability of our communities.The profits of the predominantly multi-national salmon farming companies, who benefit from current loopholes in our environmental regulations, are well able to fund a responsible and researched approach for sustainability and erse employment opportunities. Norway, for example, is encouraging its salmon farmers to adopt closed containment and these methods are working well in a number of other countries, including the USA.The council has a legal responsibility for the environment and needs to take precautions for the future of Argyll, not just for job numbers today.If short-term interests are prioritised, all of our futures will be much the poorer.Will Self, on behalf of Friends of the Sound of JuraSir,Most schools in Scotland have pipers and drummers within their pupil population.Schools in Argyll are probably no exception.

Fish generate their own electricity by biological means, you see, and so have no need for charging points.Perhaps I shouldn#t even try to explain the joke to Mr Lithgow.I had hoped for a more cogent critique of the points I made, rather than the amateurish attempt to cover his lack of reasoning by smearing my origins and character, or what he erroneously imagines them to be, and by repeating the endless waffle of the wind industry#s PR department.One example: whenever a new wind farm is proposed there is a claim that it will provide electricity for a certain number of homes, say ,. What is not mentioned, however, except in very fine print at the bottom of the page, is that these figures are only achievable under perfect wind conditions, which rarely occur, and that the real output of usable electricity is a small fraction of the headline figure.What is also not mentioned is who is going to pay for the decommissioning costs when the wind farms inevitably turn into junk. Somehow, I don#t think it will be those who benefited financially. More likely, it will be us, the public, already being fleeced by inflated electricity bills, who will have to pay to haul thousands of tons of unrecyclable trash from our mountains or live forever with enormous eyesores.Let me restate the case for tidal power. The tides are generated by the moon as it orbits the Earth which creates gravitational pull on the oceans. These tides are predictable, both in power and timing, for centuries in advance, and will carry on being so until the moon eventually flies off into space some billions of years hence. There are two incoming tides and two outgoing every day, a total of four, each one involving an enormous quantity of moving water and thereby presenting the opportunity to generate electricity, totally free of carbon dioxide emissions.The UK, and especially Scotland, has an enormousof coastline. Scotland#s coast is about , kilometres, and Argyll accounts for a very high proportion of this because of the legacy of the last ice age which left us with such a convoluted coastline. So we have plenty of scope to exploit this resource.And we are doubly blessed because the complexity of our coastline results in the tides reaching dferent points at dferent times of the day. Therefore, by using several dferent sites, we could have an even amount of electricity always on tap.Wind and solar power cannot match this, either in quantity of power or dependability. They require a duplicate system of nuclear, coal, gas, and oil-fired generators always fired up and ready to kick in when the wind and sun refuse to co-operate # an enormously expensive system both in money and CO emissions.There is a case for subsidies during the infancy of any industry to get it started off.But the wind farm industry is not an infant # it is now a fully grown cuckoo. It has never has earned its keep and never will so it is time to chuck it out of the nest.Stuart White, Minard.Friday September  is World Alzheimer’s Day.There are , people with dementia in Scotland and , people with dementia across Argyll and Bute.

As he says, it is far too dependent on the vagaries of the weather.Tidal power can never fail and here in Mid Argyll we have potentially the most efficient and cost-effective tidal system under our noses. This, in turn, would open up additional tourist and recreational facilities at virtually no extra cost. This would be a win-win situation, but without, I suspect, sufficient profit to satisfy the usual parasitic financial interests.What is this simple and relatively inexpensive answer Simply build a sea wall or dam, call it what you will, across the relatively narrow entrance of Loch Gilp from the Lingerton promontary towards Ardrishaig via the rocky skerries, which would reduce the cost, and finish short of the Ardrishaig lighthouse harbour wall, thus funneling all the tides through a very narrow area.Then simply incorporate as many sea locks and gates as needed to allow passage of boats in and out of the harbour and the Crinan Canal.The additional locks would be used for either lower-able turbines or permanently submerged tidal units such as in the Pentland Firth. This would be simple and cost-effective, as the generating turbines catch the tides both in and out. After all, the Romans were using tide mills , years ago, so the idea is nothing new.In addition to this, Ardrishaig would finish up with an enhanced harbour  and marina and, with a few rocks removed from the beach, the wide open area at low tide back to Lochgilphead # now wasted # would make a splendid international course for activities such as land yacht racing.The other deceitful cuckoo that we should consider debunking is the very misleading fallacy that electric cars are helping to save the planet. Yes, it is ideal and justied for town or city use to keep the fume level down in densely built up areas where fresh air is in short supply among high buildings. But generally their use is unjustiable because pollution would actually increase considerably overall because to generate every single power unit of electricity it takes roughly two polluting units of other fuels such as coal, oil or even gas to produce that single electrical unit.So, unless the electricity is always generated from renewable systems such as hydro, tidal, solar or wind, then total pollution would go up, not down.One more cuckoo destined to be the sham of another expensive white elephant.Bob Henderson, LochgilpheadSir,We would like to say a huge thanks to all the bands who played on the Sunday of this year#s Tarbert Music Festival for making it a successful afternoon after the event had to be moved from the quay to the village hall # this has to be our most stressful decision.Thanks to all the hotels and pubs for organising the great music for the weekend.We raised just over £ at the coffee morning, so thanks to everyone who baked or donated and also to all the helpers # Anne, Gail,Jane, Allie, Nina and Zena.Many thanks also to the award-winning Mid Argyll Pipe Band, who entertained a huge crowd in the pouring rain and also the Loch Fyne Pipe Band who played to the Sunday survivors.To Mrs Brown, our very own collector extrondanaire, her wee buckets totalled £.Finally, and most importantly, thanks to visitors and locals for turning out to support our music festival.Thank you all.Margaret, Duncan, Barbara and Kirsten of Tarbert Music FestivalSir,The National Autistic Society is looking for people and organisations who have done something amazing for autistic children, adults, or their families.Perhaps it’s a teacher who has helped a child achieve something great, an autistic adult who has been campaigning tirelessly or a business that has put a lot of effort into making their workplace accessible.If any of your readers know of a person or organisation like this, please nominate them for our seventh annual Autism Professionals Awards.

An astute, respected and independent body, its remit would be to act for the long term greater good of the Ayrshire coast and its stakeholders - and issue unorm guidelines to prevent North, East and South Ayrshire councils peppering our seascapes with all kinds of piecemeal shoreline developments. Sadly, such a badly-needed supervisory power is still only a figment of my imagination. But had it existed – it would have poured over builder McCarthy and Stone’s ‘Legoland’ plans for the former Malcolm Sargent House site at Prestwick . . . before hobbing them into the nearest bin! As it is, neighbouring Prestwick Golf Club have taken the legal ‘ last resort’ and petitioned for a judicial review of South Ayrshire Council’s decision to grant planning approval. Successfully overturning SAC’s November  decision is the legal equivalent of holing a  footer on Prestwick’s th green. Only six per cent of inidual judicial reviews succeed. But they can take comfort in the classic  judicial review when planning permission for wind turbines was challenged because they were in the flight path of ospreys nesting hundreds of miles away! Lord Hope ruled that while no inidual with land interests had objected to the turbines, the “natural environment” is everyone’s interest. He memorably pronounced: “The osprey has no means of protecting itself. If its interests are to be protected, someone needs speak on its behalf”. Prestwick’s Golf Club’s members are scattered across the county, the country and the world. Not a single one of them has inidual land interests affected by the proposed development. But the  Tom Morris designed links - its fairways, dunes, greens, unique location, backcloth, traditions and history - cannot protect itself. In the spirit of Lord Hope’s ruling, its members are “speaking on its behalf”. And I say good luck to them. As I also said, their chances on paper are slim. Butit hits the Court of Session, and the man in the big seat has a Royal and Ancient tie under his robe – or bits of Muirfield on the golf shoes in the boot of his Jag - well . . . you just never know! Prestwick’s members are no fools either – they hope their legal move will get everyone back around the table for complete rethink on the scale of McCarthy and Stone’s plans. The builder will no doubt deny any adverse reflection on Prestwick – but you can bet the proximity of the historic links will be in the first paragraph in any of their sales brochures! McCarthy and Stone made a pound million profit in . Their average UK apartment price is almost pound, - and they’re planning  of them at Prestwick . . . that’s pound. million. With those numbers at stake – McCarthy and Stone will be putting all kinds of pressure on South Ayrshire Council not to cave in. Prestwick Golf Club doesn’t have a problem with the site being developed – but rightly ask that any development be appropriate in design and scale to its noble and historic surroundings. And that’s something McCarthy and Stone can easily afford. Prestwick Golf Club is a legendary place for winners.

It’s the tipple sought after and enjoyed by millions across the globe but made closer to home than you think – in the heart of Girvan. And it’s at the newly developed multi-million pound Hendrick’s Gin Palace where the magic and wonder begins. The most signicant development since launch in , Hendrick’s Gin has been impressively expanded to meet the global demand for the ever popular drink. William Grant  Sons, the family owned independent global spirts company, has invested pound million in the glorious expansion, adding six new distillers to work under Hendrick’s Master Distiller, Lesley Gracie’s watchful eye. Innovation has always been in the brand’s DNA, echoing the ethos of Lewis Carroll who cried “curiouser and curiouser”. And it’s this spirit of invention and Alice in Wonderland-esque manner that carries through to the custom-designed complex which is encased in an enchanted walled garden, leading to a magnicent “Victorian inspired” palm house.  Surrounded by two botanical hot houses, the palm house is used to “cultivate unusual botanicals and flora from around the world”. An inner sanctum that is Lesley’s laboratory features a “curious flavour library, a lecture theatre that encourages scholarly learnings and a suitably stylish bar”. And, of course, there are two stunning new still houses. The Hendrick’s family of stills now stands at a proud six – four Bennett stills including the original antique copper pot from  and three precise replicas. The Bennett stills were handcrafted by local manufacturers Carrick Engineering and construction of the distillery was all done by local contractors and builders helping to capture the home of Hendrick’s gin right down to the foundations. The three replica stills are guarded and overlooked by a stunning stained glass ceiling – perhaps spied by Alice herself as she keeked through the looking glass. Master distiller Lesley continues that sense of wonder with every drop she makes.  Lesley said: “I’ve been distilling Hendrick’s for almost  years and during that time, my team and I have had the opportunity to explore and experiment on a small scale. “However, I’m thrilled and excited to take full advantage of our wonderful new distillery and begin working on a line of experimental liquids, some of which will hopefully blossom into future releases and potential new expressions of Hendrick’s.” Pamela Selby, the Global Brand Director for Hendrick’s added: “The Hendrick’s Gin Palace in its design and experience, is intended to inspire curiosity, open minds and serve as a  for invention. “It pulls back the curtain on the wondrous production method and showcases the many layers of Hendrick’s that it has become celebrated for, some humorous, others curiously intellectual, detailed and deeply meaningful. “It represents the confidence we have in the brand that helped to kick-start the ginaissance and leading role it has played ever since.” And with no end in sight for the beloved ginaissance – long may it live. At Alice in Wonderland’s top table it’s time for tea, but at the glorious Hendrick’s Palace it’s always gin o’clock.

That has a signicant, long term positive impact on our local economy.ldquoMore than , affordable homes would go a long way to meeting housing needs in our communities over the next five years and would also help support the local construction sector, providing a further boost to the economy.ldquoIt is an ambitious plan and there are certainly some challenges, from land supply to funding, but we continue to work very closely with a range of partners, including registered social landlords and the Scottish Government, to maximise opportunities to deliver more affordable homes."},{"url":null,"title":"unemployment-soars-in-the-scottish-borders","story":"UNEMPLOYMENT in the Borders has soared by almost  per cent from last year.Figures released by the Department for Work and Pensions show a surge of benefits claimants in the past  months from  last September to a current figure of .The unemployment increase is across all age demographics, with a -person riserecorded in -to- year-olds.Although the year-on-year increase of  percent is disappointing, staff at local Jobcentres highlighted a long-term trend which has seen  percent reduction in claimants across the Borders since .Staff at Galashiels Jobcentre are also launching several courses in a bid to help more people back into work.Customer Services Leader Stephen Glen told us: \"We are currently running a Construction SBWA for customers in Galashiels Jobcentre Plus for our unemployed customers keen to work in the Construction Industry.\"It will provide the  participants with an opportunity to gain the necessary certication to work in construction.\"Funding has been applied for to run two -plus courses in the Gala area aimed at supporting our longer term unemployed customers aged  and over.\"These courses will be ready to start once a suitable provider in the area has been sourced.\""},{"url":null,"title":"st-boswells-store-in-the-running-to-become-britains-best-small-shop","story":"A COMBINED bookshop, cafeacute, deli and homeware shop in St Boswells is in the running to become Britainrsquos Best Small Shop of .The Mainstreet Trading Company, which is celebrating its tenth anniversary this year, is one of  independent retailers from across the country named on the prestigious shortlist.Over the years, innovations introduced by the business include the lsquoA Year of Booksrsquo subscription service, Book Burrows for children and the Love Your Indie book loyalty card.Rosamund de la Hey, co-owner of Mainstreet, told us: \"We are always looking for ways to engage with the local community.\"Whether thatrsquos through our Bookshop Van, which aims to ensure every child in the Borders meets an author through Mainstreet during their school le through our Summer Reading Diary where children review up to six books with the winners receiving their height in books or our noticeboard to publicise local arts events.The Best Small Shops competition, which is managed by the Independent Retailers Confederation sponsored by loyalty app booost, celebrates the commitment and creativity of independent retailers on the UKrsquos High Streets and the central role they play in their local communities.Mark Walmsley, chairman of the Independent Retailers Confederation, added: \"Despite all of the bad headlines and the high-profile closures of larger stores, we firmly believe that specialist independent retailers can thrive in this climate by delivering a truly unique retail experience.ldquoThe Best Small Shops competition enables us celebrate this unique industry, the passion, service, flexibility and knowledge of independent shop owners offer and show customers what makes independent retailers so special.The winner of Britainrsquos Best Small Shop will be announced at an event at the Houses of Parliament on November ."},{"url":null,"title":"great-adventurers-brought-to-book-by-jo","story":"OVER the past few years, Royal Scottish Geographical Society writer-in-residence Jo Woolf has immersed herself in the Societyrsquos archives.So much so, that last year she published her debut book The Great Horizon, which features  exceptional adventure stories from the last  years -

RoundThe Pupils never really got going in this cup-tie, ending the game as second best to a moderately talented visiting side.Kinross were fortunate to be confronted by a uncharacteristically tame performance from the McFadyen sponsored home favourites.Lacking the key elements of drive, determination and quick controlled possession, the home side, playing with a threadbare squad due to injury and call-offs  used the long ball far too often in the first half.During the first twenty minutes the Pupils had territorial advantage, but were never able to string enough passes together to make a telling impact on the game.With the visitors hardly an attacking force, the home crowd was shocked when Kinross unexpectedly grabbed the lead shortly before half time.It’s ironic given that the Pupils back four seemed to be on top of their game, that one mistake should prove so costly.There seemed little danger, but the ball was lost in a crucial area and turned across goal for the incoming forward to score with the visitor’s only shot of the whole first half.The second half began disastrously for the home side, a through ball exposing the last line of defence whose first real action was to pick the ball out of the net.Given what went before, it was unimaginable that the Pupils were two goals behind at this stage the visitor’s ‘smash and grab’ tactics a complete contradiction to their earlier failure to attack.With the confidence of an unexpected but comfortable two goal cushion, the Fe League side turned the screw by controlling possession from the back.Mistakes had cost the home side dear, and, for the first time in the match the visitors looked like a team heading for the next round of the Scottish Cup!The home side tried desperately to retrieve the situation, but gaps appeared at the back as they threw caution to the wind.The keeper, young Alastair Ferguson, saved the day by fisting clear inside the six yard box, a timely intervention which kept the Pupils in the game at a crucial stage.Almost immediately, the home side were awarded a penalty kick on the back of a wild challenge in the box, and Gary Grumoli drove the ball into the net.Sensing blood, the Pupils powered forward at last using the ball to good effect with some fine possession football.However, it proved a  dawn and only a prequel to another defensive mistake which resulted in the visitor’s restoring their two goal cushion via a poacher’s finish from point blank range.In a breathtaking finish, the Pupils gained a second penalty with minutes remaining however, resisting the urge to change the kicker, Gary Grumoli placed his second effort to the keeper’s opposite side, only to see his kick saved dramatically.It was the final act of an uninspiring, but ultimately exciting game.The Pupils will try to put the cup disappointment behind them when they travel to play old foes, Hillington, in a league fixture tomorrow.Ellis Robertson played a solid game in the centre. _cpupilsvkinrossRyan

My wee daughter wanted to have an ldquoapple shower and so we stood under the trees. The mere touch of a branch resulted in a cascade of fruit. It was a wonderful ritual of autumn and I loved my kidsrsquo joy in it all, but within me there was a nagging feeling. As Irsquove got older, the oncoming of winter has had a depressive effect on me.Is it a process that affects us more as we get older, with each autumn marking the slow closing of yet another year To be sure, autumn is a beautul time of year and many people tell me it is their favourite season. I can understand that. The woods are magical, the sunsets seem more spectacular than at other times and itrsquos a time of harvest and forage. Our house is full of conkers, apples and colourful leaves collected on walks.Another part of the magic is the migrating birds. I heard the geese above me the other day, honking and flying in formation as they headed for Aberlady. They arrive at this time of year with winter on their tails. The assembly of pink-footed geese there at this time of year is a truly spectacular sight and sound. Tens of thousands of them gather at Aberlady Bay during their migration south.It almost has the atmosphere of an airport countless numbers of honking birds arriving from Iceland and Greenland, joining an already crowded bay. There are thousands of excited geese mingling together, sharing flight stories and looking forward to the next stage of their journey. Many feed in nearby fields before taking off once again to venture further south.As they fly over us their honking sounds like cackling witches. I often hear them when in the woods, as I did the other day. I looked up to see them through the branches of balding autumn trees, flying in their characteristic V flight formations. It seemed their honking was warning me of something: ldquoWinter is cominghellipwinter is coming.Some people of course follow the example of the geese and head for a kinder climate as winter approaches. But for most of us itrsquos a case of ritual and preparation. Hallowersquoen, really a later development of the Celtic Samhain festival, is one such ritual.But for me now, despite my love of autumnrsquos display, it cloaks my senses with a sense of melancholy which I find increasingly dficult to throw off.I spend as much time outdoors as possible in the other seasons but the darkness of winter forces me to retreat into my home. Hence we will soon be decorating our wee house with cosy and colourful lights to ward off winterrsquos dark blanket. But this dark blanket can cover our emotions as well, not so easily warded off.Many people I know likewise dread winter because of its depressive effect on their mental health. They wish that, like the geese, they could find a way of escaping the worst of it. I have often wished I was a bear who could hibernate away the winter months.But we are not bears or geese, and in my own battles with the oncoming of winter I have come to understand more than ever the importance of social connections and preparing for them. The truth is winter can be a time of flowering and rebirth, just like spring but in a dferent way ndash the flowering of friendship and rebirth of social connections perhaps lost or waned in the flurry of summer activities.In the past it was so self-evident. People huddled in each otherrsquos homes around the fire, keeping each other company. Like so many things these traditions have now been commercialised, yet the simple antidote of social connection in the approaching dark times remains as powerful as it ever was for us.It should be a time for visiting and getting together making time for friends and coming together in defiance of the darkness.

Not even film crew or directors, screen writers or location experts.No, the answer ndash as it has been for decades ndash is film studios: several sturdy, capacious, weather-resistant, flexible film studios, ideal for both visiting Hollywood blockbusters, for making long-form dramas for online streaming s, for crafting indigenous movies or recording TV dramas.As one prominent MSP, culture committee convener Joan McAlpine, lamented earlier this year, the call for a film studio for Scotland has been made, and not answered, since the s.Scotland, at present, needs not just one, but several. Nearly all industry experts agree, with one lobbying group saying it is now ldquomore urgent than ever. The screen industries, boosted by tax cuts, are a proven boon for the UK economy, and Scotland too.The British Film Institutesaid last week that the UK film and TV industry generated a record pound. billion in , helped by Government tax reliefs.In comparison, Wales now has several studios, including a Pinewood extension that could have been in Scotland, as has Northern Ireland.Yorkshire has a studio, and last week the need for Scotland to compete with other parts of the UK was underlined when Steven Knight, the Birmingham-born screenwriter, film director and creator of Peaky Blinders, revealed plans to open a six-stage TV and film studio complex in the Midlands city.The -acre site, called Mercian Studios, will be located near Birmingham airport and include six sound stages.Scotland, by contrast, seems to have, when faced with the prospect of building film studios ndash Wardpark aside ndash been gripped by a case of soundstage-fright. Various plans, from prospective studios in the Highlands to plans for the outskirts of Edinburgh, have risen and fallen like apparitions.But is this situation about to change  It could be. It is understood the outline of a public-private solution could be unveiled before Christmas.The Herald on Sunday has learned that Creative Scotland, which has a new screen body, Screen Scotland, is shortly to put a private-public studio proposition, with a specic site in mind, to tender to interested companies.This will be a dferent proposition from , when the body and Scottish Enterprise put several suggested business cases out to tender, with little success.The plan received an ldquoapproval in principle from Fiona Hyslop, the Cabinet Secretary for Culture, on July , and a ldquoprospective landlord is in commercial discussions.Now Screen Scotland is to recruit a project manager to ldquodrive the next steps in the plan.Where this studio might be is not known, but the  EKOS consultancys report into the potential for film studio in Scotland, for Scottish Enterprise, suggested a site in the central belt with good transport links.Iain Munro, the interim chief executive of Creative Scotland, says that the new studio plan ndash still largely under wraps ndash could be a ldquostep change for the screen industry north of the border, and boost the already pound million the screen industries bring to the country.He says that, in combination with the new Screen Scotland unit, ldquopermanent, sustainable studio facilities are a particular focus. Munro said: ldquoThere is already studio provision in Scotland, but Screen Scotland recognises, in order to deliver that ambition, and the step change for growth in the sector, a studio remains a central proposition.ldquoWe shouldnrsquot overlook that there are other facilities in play, but this central proposition is the fact wersquove been working on a technical business case ... in order to deliver this central priority.ldquoWe are doing our due diligence ndash the important thing is that we are at an advanced stage, and are about to embark on the next stage.The next stage is putting the idea out to tender, and Munro said ldquowe understand that for some time, therersquos been a real desire for Scotland to take up this opportunity, and the potential for this sector is huge, and there is so much more than we can do.He added: ldquoOnce we go to tender, that will be about securing an operator for a facility, and that is quite an exciting new stage.He added: ldquoWe have Outlander here, production growth is up, but this signicant studio is a game-changing element that will be key to that development in the next five years.ldquoItrsquos a real priority, I cannot impress that enough.Producers, film-makers and location experts all agree a large-scale studio complex is needed in Scotland.At present, big productions come to Scotland for its natural beauty, its castles and mountains and beaches, its urban elegance and city-scape toughness, but rarely stay for their whole shoot: there is no ready-made studio space to hold them and keep them for long periods.Game Of Thrones, the hugely successful television fantasy drama, famously considered Scotland as a home, but was lured to Belfast by its Titanic Studios, one of Europersquos largest film studios.So although Glasgow, last year, benefited from poundm in film and TV shoots, and Edinburgh had a bumper year of pound.m, largely due to Avengers: Infinity War shooting some scenes in the city, the economic benefits of the movie, and, increasingly, televisions dramas driven by streaming services Netflix and Amazon, are nowhere near as high as they could be, experts say.It said: ldquoFor decades, Scottish film-makers have had a nomadic existence using buildings that have been discarded by other industries.ldquoTen years ago, Scotland had the largest screen industry outside the home counties, it is now far behind Northern Ireland, Wales and the English regions.ldquoThe screen sector is a multi-billion-pound global industry on the ascendancy, and the Scottish Government needs the will to encourage the local Scottish industry.The AFPTS, which includes directors, producers and technical crews, also notes: ldquoThere is dference between a studio and a stage: a stage is a big shed where you shoot the production. A studio has a lot more ndash it includes production offices, dressing rooms, prop storage, prop making, construction workshops, special effects, costume making, lighting companies, sound companies, camera hire companies, post-production, casting companies ndash and the list goes on.The Scottish Hollywood producer Iain Smith, whose films include Mad Max: Fury Road, The Fountain and Children Of Men, expresses a certain weariness over the lack of studio ndash he has seen many plans and schemes appear and evaporate over the years.He sees an opportunity for Scotland in the seemingly inexorable rise of streaming s.Smith said: ldquoIt is not just Birmingham, we are seeing initiatives all over the nations and regions, because people are beginning to get the picture ndash and yet Scotland seems somehow stuck.ldquoIrsquove personally been on two of these [Parliament] committees with MSPs, and they seem positive at the time, but nothing transpires, and I quite donrsquot know why.ldquoIt doesnrsquot have to be a massive spend, in fact I would argue it mustnrsquot be massive spend, it is about using facilities, amending and adjusting them so they are fit for purpose.Rosie Ellison is the head of film at Film Edinburgh. It is her job to draw movies, TV shows, documentaries and adverts to Edinburgh and the surrounding area.She was deeply involved with recent shoots such as Avengers: Infinity War in the city.Part of Avengers: Infinity War, when it was shooting in the capital, was filmed in a makesht studio in the Pelamis Building in Leith.The producers were able to erect a set there for some of the shooting in . However, once the location shoot in Edinburgh was done, including much filming around Cockburn Street, the Royal Mile, St Giles Cathedral and Waverley Station, the production ed to its base in Atlanta, Georgia.Ellison believes Scotland needs two major factors to make a studio happen: a private developer with the will to make it happen, and a collective ldquobelief.The lack of a large, permanent, film studio makes her job harder ndashproductions want to shoot in the capital, and its surrounds, but they also need facilities indoors.Scotland loses films, or can only be home for parts of them, because of the lack of capacity for indoor shoots, Ellison says. If there was a studio, it would create a virtuous circle. More productions would come for both locations and studios, more crew would move to, or stay in Scotland, and businesses connected to movies would also gather and grow.She said: ldquoWhat we find is that they really like the locations we have, and then they ask where are we going to build sets, and we need crew  We have stunning locations, but itrsquos very dficult to land productions without the studios.ldquoI think about [the forthcoming] Mary, Queen of Scots film, and how they came to shoot for a few weeks, to capture the Scottish landscapes and establish its Scottish nature, butwe had a studio, then thatrsquos the kind of productions which could have come to Scotland, lock, stock and barrel.ldquoA film studio would be an absolute game-changer for Scotland and it is essential Scotland keeps up with the rest of the UK.ldquoWe need the people to back it and the belief that we can do it.One hurdle, the Scottish Government and Scottish Enterprise have said, is the EUrsquos rules on state aid ndash that is, its strict rules against states distorting the free market by pumping public money into private business.A film studio in Spain backed by public money, Ciudad de la Luz in Alicante, had to close after legal challenges from commercial rivals.But after Brexit, will this hurdle be removed  Not likely, it seems.This week, a spokesman for the Brexit Department at the UK Government said the state aid strictures are likely to continue after next March. He noted: ldquoThe UKrsquos proposals for the future UK-EU relationship include committing to a common rulebook on state aid, to be enforced and supervised in the UK by the Competition and Markets Authority and ldquothe UK has been a leading advocate of the development of the EU state aid and competition regime, and has much to gain from maintaining disciplines on subsidies and anti-competitive practices.Two purely private efforts have led the way in recent years in Scotland ndashthe well-documented Pentlands Film Studios, which wants to build on the outskirts of Edinburgh, and the little less-known Guardhouse plan, which, its chief executive Surya Iacono, maintains, is still on track.Both have, in recent weeks and months, hit obstacles.The Pentlands plan, to build on land at Straiton, took a blow legally. The Scottish Land Court ruled a tenant farmer could not be evicted from his land which the developers want to use for the studio.PSL Land, which wishes to build the poundm film studio on the land, said it respected, but is disappointed by, the decision and is now considering its options ndash although it is not clear what these are.Guardhouse had initially wanted to build a studio on land owned by Heriot-Watt University but now it is looking where, near Edinburgh and in Fe. However, a statement from Guardhouse says it is waiting to see how the potentially calamitous Brexit process unfolds.It said: ldquoWhile these plans are very far advanced, a decision on the final scope of our investment into Scotland will very much depend on how Brexit unfolds and in particular on how the decision to exit the European Union will impact on the financial viability of our studio business models.ldquoIssues include the continuation of the UKrsquos successful incentive programme, the financial implications of any new tarf regime on the high-tech equipment imported to establish the studio, and our ability to seamlessly move management and production staff and crew between our Italian studio and our Edinburgh operations as required.BREAK OUT: The studio rivals to Scotland around the UK.Wales:Pinewood Studios, Wales.In Cardf Bay, the studio is part of the major Pinewood company and has , square feet of shooting space, and the same amount of production space.Also in Wales: the BBCs Roath Lock studio, Dragon International Film Studios, near Bridgend: Merlin and film Ironclad have been filmed there.Enfys in Cardf also has two studios, Bay Studios in Swansea is another facility, and Bad Wolf Studios is one of the largest studios in the country.Northern Ireland:Belfast Harbour Studios, has two , square feet sound stages.Titanic Studios, which includes three major sound stages.The Britvic facility has three sound stages, close to central Belfast.The Linen Mill, half an hour from Belfast, has a total of , square feet.Yorkshire:Church Fenton Studios, based in Selby District, is managed and developed by Screen Yorkshire.It as three stages, and Stage One, , square feet, was used for shooting ITVs Victoria.London:The centre of film making in the UK, with Pinewood Studios, Shepperton Studios, Twickenham Studios, and numerous others.Scotland:Wardpark Studios in Cumbernauld: currently home to the Outlander series.BREAK OUTThe Scottish Hollywood producer Iain Smith on the potential of streaming drama for the Scottish film and TV industry.\"There is Netflix, there is Amazon [streaming video] coming up fast, and there is Disney, coming up fast - they are preparing their own streaming channel.\"It is all moving to streaming, or SVOD as we call it, Subscription Video on Demand.

They have been addressed.A Whitbread spokesman said yesterday that the company is working with Highland Council to ensure \"all the relevant data and supporting information\" is made available.\"We understand the application will go before the planning committee in November,\" he said.The proposed hotel has attracted  representations from the public ndash both in favour and against.Local hoteliers and other accommodation providers claim a Premier Inn would affect trade and result in local job losses, while supporters say it would boost tourism and greatly improve the site which has been described as an eyesore.Earlier this year, Caithness Chamber of Commerce warned that the project would have \"a signicant negative impact\" on other businesses and the town centre.But retired local businessman Andy Bruce, who ran Far North Aviation at Wick airport for  years, supports the proposed development at the former mart site in Ormlie Road.Caithness is \"screaming out\" for more hotel accommodation, he said.Mike Potts, chairman of Thurso Community Council, also backed the plan. \"It will utilise the site properly, provide further amenities and will tidy up an area which desperately needs it,\" he said.\"I know theres opposition from other hoteliers and accommodation providers but Premier offers a very basic service which is cost-effective and would be accessible by rail.\"However, Mr Potts said the hotel plan could \"compound the existing traffic problem\" in that part of Thurso and says planners should address this.Whitbread has applied for a three-storey hotel with landscaping and car parking.If approved, it would be the most northerly Premier Inn in the UK.The development would represent a multimillion-pound investment and create around  jobs.The site was owned by Tesco, which planned to build a new supermarket, but the project was later scrapped.

Customer research by Scottish Water revealed tap is the water of choice for almost two thirds of people in Scotland , and currently over a thirdcarry reusable bottles always or often when out and about. But less than a thirdsaid theyd be happy to go into a cafeacute and ask for their bottle to be filled.On average a litre bottle of water costs about p, so topping up daily from the tap, could save pound. a day, nearly pound a year.The Top Up Taps are made from marine-grade steel and are connected to the mains water supply.* For further information visit www.yourwateryourleSunday  Oct  : AM"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"October ,  at : amAdvertorial: Christmas Display Open.

However, creating this blueprint for the town will help the council and community work together to achieve as much as we can.”The council is now working to help community groups to find external grant funding to bring forward their ideas.To read the full document and for updates visitwww.yourkirkwall and the Your Kirkwall Facebook and Twitter feeds.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It is a neurological disease which results in changes in animals# mental state, abnormalities of posture and movement and of sensation. The clinical disease usually lasts for several weeks and it is characteristically progressive and fatal.According to The World Organisation for Animal Health statistics very few cases of BSE — fewer than  each year since  — are reported in the UK.Rural Economy Secretary Fergus Ewing said: “Following confirmation of a case of classical BSE in Aberdeenshire, I have activated the Scottish Government’s response plan to protect our valuable farming industry, including establishing a precautionary movement ban being placed on the farm.“While it is important to stress that this is standard procedure until we have a clear understanding of the disease#s origin, this is further proof that our surveillance system for detecting this type of disease is working. Be assured that the Scottish Government and its partners stand ready to respond to any further confirmed cases of the disease in Scotland.”Chief Veterinary Officer Sheila Voas said: “While it is too early to tell where the disease came from in this case, its detection is proof that our surveillance system is doing its job. We are working closely with the Animal and Plant Health Agency to answer this question, and in the meantime, I would urge any farmer who has concerns to immediately seek veterinary advice.Ian McWatt, Director of Operations in Food Standards Scotland said: “There are strict controls in place to protect consumers from the risk of BSE, including controls on animal feed, and removal of the parts of cattle most likely to carry BSE infectivity.“Consumers can be reassured that these important protection measures remain in place and that Food Standards Scotland Official Veterinarians and Meat Hygiene Inspectors working in all abattoirs in Scotland will continue to ensure that in respect of BSE controls, the safety of consumers remains a priority.

It also can help people buy a new-build home from a council or housing association.Ms Mitchell said: \"A LIFT scheme would be the best.

The effects are literally knocking on our doors on a daily basis. The past summer#s extreme weather here in Europe seems to have increased public awareness and created a new openness for discussions on both inidual and political mitigation action. In my country, Sweden, a combination of a cold winter with abundant precipitation followed by droughts and an unprecedented number of forest fires made many of us think twice. We now also know that agricultural harvests in many cases were halved, and the question to be asked is what our response would beharvests were halved across the whole of Europe – or the world – at the same time  Two years ago, the leaders of  nations stood up as one in Paris, declaring that climate change is the most severe challenge mankind has ever faced. Promises were made and the Paris Agreement was signed.However, greenhouse gases have continued to rise to an all-time high. If a de-carbonisation of our economies does not happen quickly, scientists warn us that we are looking at a global warming of - degrees Celsius during this century. There is some positive work being done around the world with countries like mine, New Zealand and others setting ambitious goals for eliminating our contribution to climate change and developing pathways for others to follow. In Sweden, political discussions were intense ahead of the Paris Agreement. An inter-governmental investigation was set up with representation from all political parties. After two years of thorough analytical work, a new climate policy framework came into effect on  January. This rests on three pillars: . An overarching goal of becoming a climate-neutral country by .. A Climate Act, which requires every government to present an action-plan, including an evaluation of Sweden’s performance in relation to the long-term goal and,needed, launching complementary mitigation measures. . The appointment of an independent Climate Change Committee with the task of evaluating the government’s performance and suggesting alternative measures to meet the long term goal.It’s too early to know how this is working, but it’s obvious that already the “zero-signal” has become a driver both for business and local governments. We now see a very large number of local governments setting up at least as ambitious goals as the national government, and already during  more than  industrial sectors will have presented action plans to become fossil-free. Among them are economic giants such as iron and steel, cement and the forestry industry.The reasons behind this massive and rapid response to the new framework are multiple and dficult to assess exhaustively. Nevertheless, the following circumstances stand out:. The climate framework was supported by an overwhelming majority in the Riksdag : Seven out of eight political parties, representing  per cent of MPs, voted in favour. For markets, this means that political uncertainty and risk has been minimised since the framework will continue to constitute the basis for Swedish climate policy-making – independent of the outcome of future elections.. Recent developments in the energy sector have substantially lowered prices on renewables , facilitating decarbonisation within the important electricity sector. . A faith in the possibilities of new, smart, digitised technologies combined with specic technological developments such as the possibility of producing steel without CO emissions. The outcome of the Paris Agreement, which spread a fundamental understanding of the fact that there is no business on a dead planet.In its  assessment on global risks, The World Economic Forum pointed to the effects of climate change as being equal to those of a nuclear war. The stakes are high, and from Paris we also remember the words of President Barack Obama: “We are the first generation to feel the effect of climate change and the last generation who can do something about it”. Now it’s time for countries around the world to join us in aiming to eliminate our collective contribution to climate change.Stefan Nyström is director of the Department for Climate Change and Air Quality at the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4817709.1540067531!/image/image.jpg","title":"euan mccolm blind faith of leavers begins to beggar belief","story":"It was a display of such idiocy that, having performed it, any normal person would have locked themselves away to burn with shame for weeks. And, even when the first sting of humiliation had faded, it would haunt them, flickering into cringe-inducing memory, for years to come.Asked during an interview with BBC Radio Ulster about the impact of Brexit on the question of a hard border in Ireland, Tory MP Andrew Bridgen made the utterly baffling claim that all English people are entitled to an Irish passport.Bridgen, a Brexiteersaid: “We have a reciprocal agreement where I can go to Ireland and ask for an Irish passport, and someone from Ireland can come to the UK and ask for a British passport. We have that system. That’s the system we have, isn’t it ”Yet again, an enthusiastic advocate for Brexit is challenged on the detail and responds with a tissue of utter bollocks.In the interests of political balance, let me also, at this point, draw your attention to remarks made by the Labour Brexiteer MP Kate Hoey who tweeted her unique solution to the Irish border issue: “If a backstop is such a good idea to sort the border issue why do we not go for a backstop around the entire British Isles then Irish Republic can be part of it, too ”Brexiteers have talked a lot of rubbish over the past few years but Bridgen and Hoey have really distinguished themselves, earning their place at the top of the dolt-heap now clogging up progress in Britain.One wonders what point Bridgen thought he was making. If Brexit is a disaster, you can always become Irish, perhaps  That’s hardly the stuff of “taking back control” and “sovereignty”, is it Whatever his intention, Bridgen should be fully embarrassed by his contribution to the debate. Which of us wouldn’t be  You go on a national radio station as a member of parliament to discuss the subject of greatest importance to you and you display ignorance of such magnitude that, surely, every single thing you say from this point onwards will be met by scepticism… You’d lie awake at night, your muscles clenching, your mind racing, replaying your humiliation on a loop, wouldn’t you  Years later, it would come to you in a flashback and you’d wish your body could fold into itself and keep on folding until you were the size of a matchbox.But self-refection, like clarity on Brexit, is scarce, these days. Bridgen and Hoey blunder on, unabashed. Like all ideologues, this pair of numbskulls offer absolute certainty over clarity. They don’t care about details or facts. They just want to accomplish their wretched project. Who caresthey’re a bit woolly on the details Even the most ardent Brexiteer, hearing Bridgen’s remarks, should have been appalled – and concerned. If this is the calibre of thinking upon which Leavers are to depend during this period of great turmoil and uncertainty then God help them.I wonder whether we’re becoming so used to politicians lying to us that the time when stupidity such as Bridgen’s might have damaged his career are long past. A politician said something laughable  There’ll be another one along in a minute and what he’s going to say is a real doozy.The pathological inability of politicians in today’s tribes of Leavers or Remainers, Unionists or Nationalists to contemplate the possibility that they might be mistaken means an end to progress. Political debate is no more than two furious zealots screaming “No!” in each other’s faces.And still the charlatans brazen it out. Bridgen’s king over the water, Boris Johnson, has not the slightest concept of shame. The bold claims he made before the EU referendum in  have collided with reality and come off worst. But can you imagine Johnson pausing to reflect on whether he may have beenmistaken  Of course not. Instead, he thunders on, bluffing and backtracking and using the caulk of his tiresome Bertie Wooster schtick to cover the cracks in his arguments.It is now, surely, evident that every \u2028time Prime Minister Theresa May proclaims a Brexit deal benefitting both the UK and the EU is imminent,no such thing is the case. The leaders of the remaining EU countries continue to make it clear that they feel no obligation to offer concessions to the UK. This is just one of the warnings dismissed two years ago by Leavers as the stuff of “Project Fear”.Those who led the Brexit campaign and insisted departure from the EU could be achieved swtly, easily, and at huge benefit to the economy have long since been exposed as chancers. Confronted with evidence of their deceit – one could, for example, spend days watching footage of now No-Deal Brexiteers insisting in  that nobody was suggesting the UK should leave the single market – they do not flinch.The decision by a judge during a recent tribunal to agree that an SNP councillor’s belief in Scottish independence should be seen as a philosophical one, akin to religion, throws into sharp focus where we are, right now.In arguing that his political belief should be treated the same under the eyes of the law as a religion and not simply regarded as an opinion which deserves no protection, Chris McEleny laid bare the mindset of the modern political tribalist. No outcome could be so bad, no warning so dire that the faithful adherent would question his belief.Churches may be reporting dwindling congregations but the same blind faith that once filled pews now sustains political argument. One doesn’t require to see evidence that Brexit will lead to a bright new further for the UK, one simply has to believe it will and it will be delivered. It’s time, I think, to bring back the currently unfashionable idea of the long dark night of the soul. There is not, so far as I can see, currently a single senior political figure in the UK who would not benefit from a period of quiet contemplation.©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4817712.1540066625!/image/image.jpg","title":"dani garavelli remember who caused mess as glasgow women strike","story":"Who would want to be in the shoes of the SNP leadership of Glasgow City Council right now  Its  months in control of the country#s biggest local authority has seen it firefighting # in the case of the Glasgow School of Art, literally # a succession of crises, most of which were not of its own making.This is not to suggest those at the helm have not made mistakes there are questions to be asked about the way business owners in Sauchiehall Street were treated in the wake of that blaze, for example but it is also true that the stars have aligned against them. Yet their rivals continue to capitalise on their inability to resolve problems previous Labour-led administrations ignoredfor the best part of two decades.Later this week, Glasgow services will be severely affected as Unison and GMB members take part in what is being billed as the biggest equal pay strike ever seen in the UK. More than , workers, mostly women who work in catering, cleaning and caring, will forsake their posts for  hours in an attempt to force the council to settle their claims. It’s a historic moment. Not since the  rent strikes have the city’s women come together in such numbers to face down injustice and an injustice has certainly been done. These low-paid workers – the city’s linchpins – have been cheated out of their rightful earnings for most of their working lives. And now, when a resolution appeared to be in sight, the process has stalled again. According to Action  Equality Scotland, which represents most of the women,  months after the SNP-led administration began negotiations, the issue of comparators has still not been resolved. Add to that a deterioration in the working conditions of homecarers, and it is easy to see why anger has boiled over. I have nothing but admiration for the way these women are fighting their corner. At the same time, I can’t help feeling a degree of sympathy towards the SNP councillors now under attack from the very same unions and politicians whose refusal to recognise the value of women’s work led to the accruing of a £ million-plus debt. It was the decision in  by the then Labour administration to implement a discriminatory pay and grades structure, and the decision of later ones to oppose the women’s consequent pay claims, that created this shambles. Those decisions were facilitatedby male-dominated unions, including the GMB, which were all too happy to see their male workers’ pay and bonuses protected. When the SNP took control last year, it accepted the women had been underpaid and pledged to resolve the claims, even though it understood the issue would cast a shadow over its first term and potentially deprive it of a second.It may well be true, as Action  Equality claims, that it is failing to deliver on that pledge. The organisation says the council officers leading the negotiations – the very same council officers who advised previous administrations not to settle – are still proving uncooperative. And yet, the SNP has achieved three major goals: it ended the court action, it brought Cordia, the arms- organisation for homecarers , back in-house and it scrapped the discredited pay and grades scheme and replaced it with a new one. I am not cynical enough to suggest the GMB is only standing up for female members now because the SNP is in charge, though there were no equal pay strikes under Labour I prefer to believe it has more to do with the fact that the union now has two women – Rhea Wolfsonand Hazel Nolan – as regional organisers. In any case, it would be a strange thing to criticise a trade union for finally doing its job. But I do think some humility on the part of both the GMB and Unison, which was also slow to offer support, would be welcome. As for those Labour politicians attacking the SNP administration over equal pay: they are shameless and must take us all for fools. Do they really think our attention spans are so short  This same brass neck was on display in the wake of the announcement over the need for £m repairs to the Winter Gardens, the glass house attached to the People’s Palace, which could, potentially, see both close. Were that to happen it would be a blow to the city, but the council has already said it is working on a plan to create a new fire escape which would allow the museum to remain open.Despite this, Scottish Labour last week started a “Don’t evict the people from their palace” petition. While it engaged in petty tactics, Glasgow City councillor Mhairi Hunter resisted the temptation to take a cheap shot back, saying it wasn’t yet clear whether the damage to the Winter Gardens was the result of years of neglect or whether such structures have a finite shelfle.However, it is worth noting the glass house at Tollcross closed in  while Labour was in control and has not reopened, which surely means they should not be throwing stones at other people’s. It is also worth remembering every funding decision taken by the SNP is taken in the shadow of the forthcoming Equal Pay Bill.If Scottish Labour wanted to score political points, a fairer approach would have been to highlight Scottish Government cuts and the council tax freeze . It could have pointed out Glasgow’s museums, which rival the National Museums in prestige, and outstrip them in visitor numbers, receive no funding from the Scottish or UK Governments – and that way back in , the then culture secretary, Michael Russell, accepted that the current system failed to recognise the importance of the city’s attractions.In the long term, the crisis over the Winter Gardens might also feed into the debate on local government reform. One of Glasgow’s problems is that its most affluent suburbs lie outside the local authority boundary. The number of council taxpayers in Glasgow has dwindled over the years, while the scale of the social problems it has to deal with has increased.Earlier this month, an academic study suggested the number of authorities in Scotland should be reduced from  to , with a new Greater Glasgow council combining the city of Glasgow with Renfrewshire, East Renfrewshire and East and West Dunbartonshire. Other alternatives might be to allow councils to raise more of their own revenue.Of course, none of this helps Glasgow now. And the SNP leadership does have to take responsibility for fulfilling its manesto commitments. I hope this week’s strike focuses minds and that the women’s claims will be settled as quickly as possible.But I also hope, as the negotiations resume, that Scottish Labour will remember which party’s councillors were responsible for the city’s female workers being treated as second class citizens. And that, when the debt is settled, it will thank the SNP administration for clearing up the mess it made.©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4817667.1540068150!/image/image.jpg","title":"patrick harvie scottish greens targeting 2 seats in glasgow","story":"Green co-convener Patrick Harvie has outlined his party#s ambition to win its first Holyrood constituency seat to double its number of MSPs in Glasgow from one to two.Harvie announced the party’s target for the  Scottish election at a party conference that also saw activists urge their six MSPs to pressure the SNP government into reforming local tax.The SNP has so far failed to deliver council tax reform despite being in power for more than a decade and several long-standing pledges to do so. Speaking at the party’s autumn conference in Glasgow, Harvie indicated a change in Green election strategy, which in the past has seen election candidates focusing on Holyrood list seats rather than constituency seats. Harvie said: “In Glasgow, we’re already getting geared up for  and beyond. We’re working not just for one more regional MSP, but more not just for regional MSPs but for our first ever constituency seat too not just for more Greens, but for the chance to knock a Tory or two off the list as well.

These services employ , people but the staff and the public are suffering cuts and increased charges as SNP ministers keep a stranglehold on funding.”Harvie and co-convener Maggie Chapman also signalled support for the People’s Vote in a bid to stop the UK leaving the EU.©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"watch aerial footage new eric gray centre ","story":"The long-awaited Eric Gray Centre is nearing completion – as shown by aerial footage recently published by contractors DITT Construction.The project, costing around £ million, marks the culmination of years of planning with a feasibility study taking place in .

It is part of the Year of Young People activities.The youngsters involved will come up with ideas but they are also keen to hear what other young people would like to see on the mural.Year of Young People ambassador Jonathan Dorrat said: “We’d really like children and young people aged eight to  years to come forward with designs or concepts for the new mural. Some of the themes could be, #What do you enjoy about Shetland #, #What makes you proud of Shetland #, #What is Shetland famous for #.# Send any ideas, before Friday th July , to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.The SIC#s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.#This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station. It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People .”Are they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be doneI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish##.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc###and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of le or some other pointless title.Over the years art has very much lowered its standards signicantly to make and justy it becoming more commercially viable####.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called # limited edition rubbish #.I would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at###atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.No doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and le experience###..despite the fact everybody  looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.Love the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me .. Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!Why not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like    It#s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.There are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined. Next you#ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!I think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.If you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, #The Arts#, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved    SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, #Status Quo#, thanks, Malcomn Younger and #Scottish National Ballet, #Highland Fling #, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £ million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.Would not even need a bar!!!The Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass. Building methods change along with building materials.I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.Come on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.The Shard is a massive glass pyramid#.I#m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug##.Mareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.If I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used # There#s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.All the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.Call me old fashioned but I would love to see the modernbuilding business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of  to  tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles,all done  years ago.It#s true you really can#t get the staff nowadays. I wonderthe Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops # the British ways of one can#t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is aboutto finish offanother burgeoning industry.I’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up! As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in theirbucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.Aluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.I’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of theterm ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much inidentying the material nature of that being used but more an attemptto denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure Rather like calling a van a box on wheels  I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaningcomments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.@ Haydn Gear.When there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.Pretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.Unless you already know Mareel#s purpose and that its supposedly an #iconic# design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that#s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname #The Pagoda# as soon as it was built.Let us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for #Mareel# to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst#s #Pickled cow and calf.#, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel#s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.I have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel. What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kickout of venting there spleens in those directions.I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.Leaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man Those of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.Purely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda wasin any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it I wondertakeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architecturalsimilarities.The viking was a chippy when it opened.#What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.# Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, # is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments  #, #I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever# and # Pig ignorant prats.# Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!Well Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there  All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.Love hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of someby those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and tomaintaincredibility from the watchful public at large. In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.Look what happened!So let today’s critics mock onit makes them feel better.Paraphrasing MGM#s famous motto, the phrase #Arse gratia artis#, springs to mind. LOL 🙂As an artist myselfdoing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.I have been to many art exhibitions andart shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as # ripping off the customer # with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody  can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.It takes me about  hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.I have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit. Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spenceis an all too common feature in mostwalks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns isnot too far removed from theactions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!So talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.Nobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as #pig ignorant#. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such #arty things#.We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £ million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained consecrated.No doubt it was deliberate and theopportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !Had you checked out Ian#s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I#d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous #Sam the Eagles# among us. That said, it#s a concept I wouldn#t wish to see spread any farther!🙂No insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to #The Black Mountains#. Iwill try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found inMareel#s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing , nasty little creatures!!! .Fairenough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artistswhen it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds.

To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say # there is a strong likeness to themselves # and they are very pleased with the outcome.Alternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.I could always get away with this by saying # It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art # and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lolWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself andyou look at my products you would find this to be true. My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generatesympathetic responses.It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted.

The - scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.Molloy’s introduction  minutes into the second half obviously made a dference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubtanyone  in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.But the damage had been done in the first half – at - down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.Some have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.I felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.Two years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a - defeat in Kirkwall.There is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s th birthday.It’s just a pity we have to wait a whole  months until a chance of revenge.: : : : : : : :A couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.There are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.A score of - was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.The Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.A few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.I would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.: : : : : : : :Orkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday. Former Aberdeen striker Joe Harper, the evening#s guest of honour, is in the centre of the picture. Photo: John CouttsThe reception at the Pickaquoy Centre later on Saturday evening, attended by over  guests, was a great opportunity for former county football adversaries to meet up again.Unfortunately the meal was nothing to write home about – the main course of roast beef and trimmings was cold – and the acoustics of the building were downright awful.The speeches which followed,anyone could hear what was being said, were on the y side. And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.It was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow. Both Geordie Hunter, or the “big game Hunter” as Wood referred to him, and the inimitable striker Bert Sinclair certainly did their bit in years gone by.Sinclair in particular was in his element, reminiscing with Orkney opponents Alan Findlay and Eric Hutchison who also featured in the famous  game when he hit the back of the net five times in the - victory.: : : : : : : :And finally, as this week’s column is all about the inter-county weekend, it is surely fitting to end on a high note.On Sunday morning, although the match really should have taken place as a warm-up to the main Milne Cup encounter, over two dozen veterans took to the field again.Helped by the fact that one or two of the team are still turning out occasionally at B-team level, the blues were much fitter and faster than their opponents.Robert Adamson, who fills out his shirt rather better than he did -odd years ago, was on the scoresheet along with his former Thistle team mate Stuart Smith who netted a hat trick.The others came from Delting’s Stuart Hay and the aforementioned Main, who surely merited it after Saturday’s setback, and a penalty from the oldest man in the side Bruce Williamson of Spurs.The final score was a - win for Shetland, which as some wise guy put it made for an aggregate - football victory. But unfortunately not many will see it that way. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.It is rare enough for a local game to end -, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.Astonishingly, Delting’s - triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.The final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.Delting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.Devonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.This is the th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back  years for Southend’s solitary success.Apologies to older readersI’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in , but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.The quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw - with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay - away from home.The semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another - draw and another replay was necessary.After Delting won that one - at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.Delting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.Although it was tough ask to play two games in about  hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.So on Saturday th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.Goals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a - lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.Player manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.It was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.But it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.: : : : : : : :In professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.The benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the  clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.During the - campaign the clubs benefited from over £. billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £ million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £ million.Just where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.While players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.On the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Cha, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.In Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.Following Rangers’ - draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.It could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.That was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.Perhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes findsdficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.Rogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.There are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.: : : : : : : :One of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.Although the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and  runs.Much has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.Unfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.I’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.Maybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.The only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.Some apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.In answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"big turnout to welcome the eighth serene to whalsay ","story":"The latest Serene arrives at the pier at Symbister.

Given these turbines will be placed on high ground, to suggest they will dominate the landscape is an understatement # just what the tourists come to Shetland to see.As long as they#re not in Bressay or Sandness.Only one and a half times the size of big ben# just little things# pfffffff.Absolutely ridiculous!I’ve seen wind turbines with these extra large blades between Stirling and Edinburgh. They are enormous and look awful.Worth recalling that the perceived size of the blade sweepincreases as the square of the radiuse.g. increasing the bladeby . times doubles the perceived size of the blade sweep, or, increasing bladeby % increases perceived size by %John, the longer blades will increase the electrical power that each turbine can generate, giving VE more revenue.That’s as may be, but revenue does not equal profit, and by the time the unsustainable level of subsidy has been removed, the SCT have been suckered in to paying for the export cable, and SSE have ensured their pound of flesh is as great as they can get away with,Shetland will never see its money back.More of nothing is still only nothing.If they are increasing the height of the turbines,does this mean that they would need to increase the size and depth of the anchor points at what extra cost and who will pay Presumably, these are the latest models with towers and foundations redesigned, accordingly The changes should improve cost-effectiveness and presumably, VE’s intention is to improve competitiveness for the auction, which requires cutting costs to the bone and squeezing every last drop of revenue from the project to keep it viable.Given that the last round of auctions produced winning ‘strike prices’ of £. MWh, exactly half what VE insisted they needed for viability , it makes you wonder, would winning an auction capture their fabled “pot of gold at Rainbow’s End” or would it be merely a poisoned chalice that provides little or no# or worse# William, the size and cost of the foundations must be increased to accommodate more powerful wind turbines.Larger Turbines require loads more concrete poured into the blanket bog all previous calculations EIA are out the window.If turbine technology has #advanced considerably# why can#t they make them smaller, considerably The “technology advance” is to produce turbines with increased electrical capacity, requiring longer blades and larger fondations. The thought is that one MW turbine will cost less to install, own, and maintain than two MW turbines.Mr Innes, Project Director for Viking Energy, is quoted where as saying #Viking is now competing against a new generation of wind farms, including those offshore, where tip heights of m or more are now available.#In that case why doesn#t he just put these turbines offshore as well.Kay. Just a thought.Aircraft technology has advanced too and ‘planes get bigger and bigger. I suspect that miniaturisation , so beloved of the Japanese, whose watches, cameras , radios and a host of other products lead one to believe that for items to improve in performance , they need to get smaller. True in many instances but not all. That said, Japanese wind driven turbines might solve a few problems.A point of interest regarding Japan andCO free energy . Japan is planning on using nuclear, not wind power, as a major source of electricity production. One may understand that Japan has greater first-hand knowledge of nuclear atomic contamination than any other country on Earth having being subjected two atomic bombs and the Fukushima accident. Using that real information on real nuclear contamination, not the Green lunacy crank disinformation, so prevalent in Scotland. Japan has a knowledge-led, intelligent energy policy. As ofMay , there are  operable reactors in Japan. Of these, nine reactors in  power plants Additionally, five reactors have been approved for a start, and further  have start applications under review. It never ceases to amaze me how ignorance and fear shape energy policy. Japan is fully aware of the risks of nuclear I reference “the Liberal Democratic Party cabinet in April , calls nuclear power #the country#s most important power source#.[Japan is now aiming for #a realistic and balanced energy structure#. The Japanese Government targets for wind power deployment are set at only .% of electricity production by  . That is a total figure, onshore and offshore.What a huge shame The Scottish Government is unwilling to do the same, it would save our countryside from so much uglly devastation. Why #..Well you don`t need a rocket scientist to figure that one out.Ifthis horrendous project does go ahead it`ll be past its sell by the time it is finished and will be made obsolete by newer, more efficient and cleaner technology.When is the plug going to be pulled on this nonsense before any more money is lost to it If Viking want to increase the turbine size, it is not unreasonable to anticipate that the other windfarm developers will do the same.The floodgates are being opened and, instead of being a world-class destination for wildle  scenery, Shetland will become a world-class example of crass development without regard to the obvious damage to environment, health and wellbeing, not to mention income from tourism.Renewable energy should be pursued, but in Shetland’s case the cost of the VE project has already been far higher – in every sense – than the imagined benefits.I maybe wrong, but wind farm technology appears to be the cheapest form of producing electricityin regard to other alternative sources of producing electricity.I am pretty sure wave and tidal energy could also be tapped into within Shetland, but economics seem to be based on the cheapest alternative compared to wave or tidal resources being the better, possibly, and signicantly less intrusive than the massive wind turbines scaring the Shetland landscape and more than likely tourists remembering the islands not for its beauty but#.well, it is self explanatory.The potential economic damage caused by the wind turbines I am pretty sure would outweigh any positive contribution the islands may have in regard to tourism or other positive attributes the islands may have.Time, no doubt, will be the final answer#.. watch this space, as they say.David. Just to be a bit more optimistic about wind farms , there is every likelihood that visitors to Shetland will already be familiar with rotating blades .It is a fast growing energy generation procedure so would not come as a shock.The other thing is ,such equipment would almost certainly not be visible from all corners of Shetland.People would get used to them just as they are used to the island hopping planes.It’s a bit unfortunate that severe condemnation is a reactionto newish ideas and inventions.I take onboard your points, Haydn, but I think what is putting people off the VEP, is the shear cost of what it could possibly be. I have heard a figure not far short of kicking on the door of £. Billion, and possibly more, and how many decades would this take to bring VEP into the black in terms of revenue One should also look into the potential running and maintenance costs per year for such a project  Would the revenue created be enough to off-set such costs or would VE require more funding from the SCT, to balance its books It seems very evident, the more information people in Shetland know about VEP, the more people are put off the whole idea in terms of economics and what little benefit the islands may reap from it  I have heard a figure of around £ million a year###.poor investmentthe projected costs are to be believed. Aof around. of % does not bode well.I have to take issue with you here Haydn, The proposed VE turbines will now be meres high and constructed on hills. The high point some meters plus above sea level. That would be the line of sight from sea level of about  miles. Precious little of Shetland would not see the VE turbines!! I note you claim #that severe condemnation is a reactionto newish ideas and inventions#. I would respectfully point out wind turbines are hardly a new idea! Many consider them at the point of being an obsolete technologyNow for cutting-edge ideas, look to tidal generation and modular nuclear reactors. The latter , I believe you are openly condemning, something about us all glowing in the dark was your comment!!! Now that was Scaremongering nonsense. Rosatom,Russias vehicle for nuclear expansion,has about % of new nuclear plant contracts in the bag,mainly in emerging and third world countries .If Chernobyl is anything to go by and what Russia the culprit did in rectyingthe mess,novichok is going to be a piddle in the ocean in comparison.Read an article this morning.Wish I could remember which paper that said Germany#s  year old wind turbines are coming to the end of their usefulness and no longer qualy for subsidies. No recycling as the blades are made from fibre glass.Their plan is to dump them on third world nations so creating more waste rather than cleaning the mess up themselves. Viking energy should sit up and take not it but will have cloth ears when it comes to profit. Remember, as you sow,so shall ye reap.Germany, by nature of its fragmented political system with government by weak coalitions only resulted in the Green Partyexercising much influence beyond their electoral mandate. Nuclear power was cut back as a political gesture to the Greens, that had nothing to do with the science of the matter. The result was a massive increase in coal-fired electrical generation and also the importation of Natural Gas. Germany is now the worlds largest importer of Natural Gas! and the German motor industries disingenuous diesel emission data is almost legendary!!!.Deaths from atmospheric pollution in Germany are massive and this year the EU is taking Germany to court for breaking all EU guidelines. It is indeed very ironic that the Scotish Government does so much to praise the use of Wind power and exploit all its rural communities to that end while it does all in its ability to expandGas Exportation from the North Sea,. It likewise imports Gasto Grangemouth and at all times try and use North Sea oil revenue to promote Nationalist agendas. The logic escapes me, perhaps you could explain Grahm,!!!Billy , I understand where you are coming from when stating that  year old turbines in Germany are coming to the end of their lives , but is this surprising   Since technological advances in vast areas of activity are so rapid it would be most unlikely for things to suddenly stand still.Try selling a  year old car , TV. washing machine ,vacuum cleaner , racing bike etc etc. Virtually worthless . Fighter ‘planes cost £millions EACH so should we have stuck with the Tiger Moth to save money   Times change continuously.No doubt some would like the world to stop to enable them to get off so that they could abandon their mortgage and live in a cave in a cosy corner of the Moon. All very whimsical but I’m sure you get the drt.Interesting comment Haydn. I am unable to find any substantive advance in Wind Turbines as technology over the last  years. They are larger yes, but no less polluting and even more damaging to the environment. The most recent research would indicate that disturbance in airflow patterns and friction around the rotating blades not only creates more noise pollution but results in substantive heat creation. That heat creation in itself would and does contribute to global warming new research has shown. Reference #Hard University’s School of Engineering and Applied Sciences# would indicate wind power in theU.S. with wind alone would warm the planet a quarter-degree Celsius! If this research is proved correct, we will be decommissioning and scrapping wind turbines far sooner than the protagonist advocate. There are already far better ways of generating clean electricity than  meter high turbines, sadly too many have staked their reputations on the wind myth and will resist accepting they have been wrongFair enough Ian. I must confess that I was unaware of the likely height of the proposed turbine blades.I’m not so sure about Japan and others having a reducing intention to set up more turbines though. As for the comment I made about nuclear radiation causing people to glow in the dark —— you surely cannot be serious !!!!That was no more than a figure of speech.I hope you are merely poking fun at such a prospect.I know that glow worms emit light as do other creatures in the sea but it’s silly to think that the effects on iniduals who have been subjected to radiation for medical reasons would then walk about looking like Beacons.Give me a break Ian!Ian.—- Your comments on October th at -.Plenty of food for thought in your missive .Thanks.It is a balance between providing energy safely and economically, but our conventional methods of using fossil fuels has brought to the fore due to the impact such energy has had on the environment.However, whilst we are being side-tracked about the impact of fossil fuels, nobody has every mentioned the impact on the planet caused by agriculture. Agriculture, I believe, causes  times more green house gases than all of transportation put together Not only does agriculture produce more green houses gases than transportation, it is the greatest cause of environmental destruction than any other industry. As our population grows, this will become more evident, as we see species upon species being put on the # endangered species list # or # become extinct #. This man-made catastrophe will impact on other species and it will eventually impact the very existence of humans on the planet as nature takes revenge through disease, drought and other natural impacts.Progress in providing alternative energy may be a positive start, but at what price will this be to the planet and le,this progress is purely based on the man-made concept of monetary value and this of profit David Spence, the single most signicant threats to humanity are overpopulation and our leaders, scientic, religious and political leader#s, utter cowardice to dare to mention such an undeniable fact. World population is set to double in  years. Energy needs, food supply, pollution are all driven by human population density. It makes no odds how many windmills we build whatever their size! Atmospheric pollution, global warming or starvation awaits and will kill all our children#s children as long as human overbreeding continues. It is hard to take the Greens cranks, politicians and doom-mongers of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change seriously when their reports fail to state, or take into account the blindingly obvious.David. Your warning shots make me feel that I should grabfew bottles of whisky 🥃 go back to bed and snooze my way through the day even though there’s a hot Indian summer outside.!!Seriously , weare facing a dire situation which will impact on my grandsons far more than on me —— or you. When you say ‘Agriculture’ I’m assuming that you are including livestock.The greenhouse gas emissions from the planet’s animal le must be enormous and that’s whether or not they are raised for their meat .Also, to take your point, such vast amounts of money are tied into food production , it’s hard to seeany measures at all, however well intentioned, , will enable us to eradicate the decline of le in its widest sense.Time to grab that whisky bottle I think 🤔. Cheers.Is there going to be a remake of #Dad#s Army#  Only, a number of contributors seem to be vying for the part of Private Fraser: #Wur do-oO-MM-ED!# LOL 🙂# You stupid Boy, Pike##.sorry, John # lolI take your points Haydn and Ian, but according to predicted human population expansion, it is estimated the global population will be around  billion by the year  Other dynamics affecting population growth, as you know, is requiring more land not only for agriculture but for accommodation and expanded space for for other amenities related.Not doubt, I think, there may come a critical point where demand for the expansion of the population, not including technological advancement, will determine how we live and finding a balance between our own demands to this of the natural world and other le The driving force for this expansion is predominantly based on economics and technological advances, and as long as this is the precedent, this could bring into conflict what we want and what nature will will allow In the food chain, I suspect we will become more use to # processed food # as technological progress will find better ways of growing alternative foods, whether biologically or chemically, as an answer to keep a balance between our demands and this of a coexisting relationship with the natural laws which govern le itself, including humans.You are quite right John, there are people who seem to be dominating these columns and I fear that I am a guilty one —— as well as the others.Perhaps I should take a break and ease off.The trouble is, there are interesting and important problems out there which should be aired rather than be allowed to fester.Maybe a bit more humour would help to make the rough stuff a little more palatable.So, step forward anyone of a Dad’s Army disposition !! How about you John  Sadly my sense of humour is a little lacking here! £ million plus SCT funds gone.  meter high windmills on s of tons of concrete bases all over Shetland. All of this for what  The delusional idea that such a project will save the planet. VE is and always has been a money making project under the guise of the #Green Idyle#. The advocates being the usual shetland suspects, utterly unqualied in scientic justication and reason, highly qualied in political posturing and self-interest. No, there is nothing here of humour. I do believe we are rapidly destroying our planet bitthe findings of# The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change# are valid, windmills on Shetland are an irrelevancy, which will only increase our problems. Their construction will release vast quantities of CO their verywill warm the air around them. It goes a bit beyond Dad,s Army humour, about as funny as Donald Trump#s program of clean coal, Scotland importing fracked gas from the USA and Shetland shipping in wood for burning by deforesting Canada and Eastern Europe!!! It is long past a laughing matter. It is just Green idiocy at its most typical.Ian,I assume you mean “s of tonnes of concrete” per turbine base  Given that a single, typical .MW turbine needs over a thousand tonnes of steel-reinforced concrete , then VE turbines, whose blades will sweep  times the area , at . times the height, must surely need bases several times bigger than that # perhaps, - tonnes, each The accompanying destruction of the land these machines are sited on is also alarming # here is a quote from the link, again, for the small, .MW machine: Given the limited cerebral ability of most politicians this obviously did not prove too dficult LOL!Humour is a coping mechanism.If you can laugh 😆 in the face of adversity you become bullet proof. Only the brave and stoical can achieve that. Dwelling on negatives perpetuates negativity. Goodness knows, there are ample supplies of that in these columns.£ million plus SCT funds have not “gone” Ian. Money does not simply disappear. Whatever the total sum, a decent chunk will of course have found its way into the pay packet pockets of some of those with most to gain from the project. However, so long as the cash gets into the hands of the worthist members of the local community, deserving entrepreneurs intent on bettering their community, who could possibly disagree  Try to be more charitable Ian.If there was anything whfy about all this Tavish Scott would have long since ensured it was properly addressed. Just look how fearlessly he locked horns with the powerful vested interests south who were forever conspiring to keep Shetland in its box. Tavish has already clearly stated he is in favour of democratic reform of SCT, just notit requires him to stand up against anyone local.You`re right there Peter, the money hasn`t just gone it`s been squandered!Squandered or plundered John  Aren’t the controls on the access to Shetland’s charitable funds so weak that any dedicated self serving group with a plausible plan could arrange over time to help themselves  Viking by name#We’ve got to get away from the notion that the funds exist to secure Shetland’s economic future. They exist to ameliorate social disruption resulting from the oil era. Vast infrastructure projects in remote rural communities bring almost random redistributions in wealth and opportunity, drug dependency and a iety of other associated complex social issues and harms. Where is Shetland’s voluntary sector represented on SCT  It ain’t, and it runs scared of complaining.These unguarded funds have weakened and distracted local politics in Shetland. No one group is sufficiently powerful to say enough is enough. Where is the voice of those at the margins  Who speaks up for those in greatest need  The oil industry has washed it’s hands long since.

The Rangers v Aberdeen tie will be played at Hampden at .pm the same day.Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers described the process as “irrational and discriminatory”, saying he had never been to Murrayfield in his le.This is the same man who could not offer any comment when quizzed at the weekendit was unfair to ask Aberdeen fans to travel to Glasgow for a noon kick-off.The handling of this by the authorities has been a shambles, and it was a bit rich to hear Scottish Professional Football Leaguechief executive Neil Doncaster say that the U-turn was because the situation had changed.Initially Hampden Park Ltd had insisted on sticking to its contract to host all semi-finals involving Celtic and Rangers, Doncaster said. The SPFL was unwilling to breach that contract and risk legal action and apparently Police Scotland were okay with the original decision. Incredibly it was said to be “the best and most practical solution”.But after the inevitable outcry, Hampden Park Ltd changed its mind and decided to waive the legal obligation.No-one should really be surprised at such a monumental cock-up, however, as you’d be hard pushed to find two organisations with as little credibility as the SPFL and Police Scotland.The idea of staging both games at Hampden on the Sunday, with Rangers taking on Aberdeen at noon and Celtic meeting Hearts at .pm, was beyond belief.Dons supporters were rightly up in arms, having been forced ious times in the past to travel to Glasgow for lunchtime kick-offs. Unless Scotrail, another organisation not known for covering itself in glory, agreed to put on extra trains the first was due to arrive in the city  minutes after the match had begun.Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes pointed out that the scheduling would have little or no effect on his team’s preparations which would just go ahead in the usual fashion. That may be so but for the fans it would have been a complete nightmare.Hearts boss Craig Levein was more outspoken, which is becoming a regular feature of a man who was once seen as boring. He described the SPFL’s decision as absolute madness.The Edinburgh club’s owner Ann Budge also voiced concern, given the dficulties that could arise from having over , supporters from four dferent clubs in Glasgow on the same day.She was quite correct. The probability that it would deter younger Hearts followers from travelling, as it could be a very late trip back to the capital, was a very real one.Budge was one of those who asked the SFPL to think again, saying the body should be encouraging fans to attend and not making it dficult for them.If the first game had gone to extra time and penalties it could have been well after pm before the stadium was emptied. That would not have given much time to clear up the inevitable mess, get rid of , people and get another , in.If any evidence was needed about what is wrong with Scottish football, here it is. The Scottish football authorities had placed all its eggs in one basket with Hampden and had no option but to try and justy the daft move. It really did beggar belief.: : : : : : : :Fortunes have been mixed for Shetland’s rugby teams so far in their mainland competition endeavours.The men’s side began by losing all three games and finishing bottom of group one in the oddly named North Region Referee’s Cup, although they were only well beaten in one of the ties.Then, on the back of a promising home league win against Aberdeenshire, they unfortunately came up short on Saturday after a long trip to the Western Isles, going down - to Stornoway.The revamped Tennents Caledonia North  ision looks very competitive, with the likelihood of most teams being able to beat anyone on their day.Shetland, as we all know, will be a match for most at home. But it remains dficult to do the same when travelling, with so many players not able to commit due to one reason or another.The depth of the squad is very important, which is why it is heartening to see more youngsters coming into the equation. They, after all, are the future of the club.The women’s team, on the other hand, have enjoyed a great start to the season, beating both Banff and Inverness Craig Dunain and currently leading the Tennents North League table.Last year’s league winners Orkney have already lost a game against Inverness, and a fascinating battle could ensue at Clickimin on Sunday when the island rivals go head to head.: : : : : : : :As someone who has supported Manchester United for over half a century, it pains me to see the state of the club under manager Jose Mourinho.This week’s home peformance against Valencia was abysmal, with several players totally devoid of pace and urgency and obviously not doing the business for the man in charge.The stunned silence among the fans was something that has rarely,ever, been seen before. Many of them began leaving Old Trafford with  minutes still remaining, and you really can’t blame them.The once-great club has been on the way down ever since the retiral of Alex Ferguson. The treatment of his replacement David Moyes was shocking, being sacked after only eight months in charge, and the appointment of the next incumbent Louis Van Gaal was a mistake.The worst move of all though was to hand the job to Mourinho. Winning the Europa League and the League Cup in his first season obviously gave  hope to some but he really was an awful choice.This walking advert for narcissism needs to go now before things become even worse. But the question is who will be next in line. Zinedine Zidane has been tipped because of his supposed “humility”, in contrast to Mourinho, although that was hardly evident with the infamous dismissal for head-butting Marco Materazzi in the  World Cup final.Others who have been tipped include Didier Deschamps, who led France to World Cup success a few months ago, or former United player Laurent Blanc who was recently in charge at Paris Saint-Germain.While it will most likely be another foreign manager who succeeds Mourinho, I reckon the club could attempt to reverse the trend by appointing an Englishman.Why not give someone like Eddie Howe of Bournemouth the job  He is one of the brightest young bosses in the country and has performed wonders at a club where the ambitions are basically to stay in the Premier League. But sadly I can’t see it happening.: : : : : : : :Contrary to my views on Mourinho, it was very disappointing to see the likeable Steve Bruce handed his marching orders by Aston Villa this week.Bruce led the club to the final of the Championship play-offs last season, but was sacked on Wednesday after a - home draw with Preston North End the previous evening.Villa are now th in the table but had they beaten Preston they would have risen to fth equal, only five points behind the leaders. A couple more matches and things could have been on the up again.Bruce had a cabbage thrown at him by a so-called fan before the game on Tuesday and later said the incident unfortunately summed up society at the moment.“There’s no respect for anyone any more,” he told interviewers, a statement which was borne out by the actions of the Aston Villa board of directors the following day. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"whalsays new research arrives in lerwick for first time ","story":"The Research leaves Symbister with bunting flying as she heads for Lerwick on Saturday.

A lot of visitor experiences are going to be marred.\"Adam Gough, CairnGorm Mountain representative, who had told of the need for the slopes aimed at beginners and intermediates, was clearly stunned by the rejection.Asked immediately after the decisionan appeal was likely, he said that a statement would be issued later.CNPA head planner Gavin Miles had stressed from the outset the application had to be determined on planning issues ndash landscaping impacts in particular ndash and not on its commercial merits, which had generated much argument.He said the business case was a matter for Natural Retreats.Mr Miles told the committee the articial slope would not extend the ski area in any signicant way but the footprint of obvious development would increase.He commented: \"Initially the team were very concerned about the landscaping but as more information was given to us by the applicants it was considered that in the long term planting would mitigate against that. There would be an impact in the short term of the dry ski slope.\"Whether it will ever be an attraction in its own right and generate signicant income, who knows, but that is not a consideration of the planning process.\"In effect it is a ersication of business in this area and therefore acceptable andit was to strengthen the stability of CairnGorm Mountain then thats a good thing.\"He said there were some hefty planning conditions attached to control the development.CairnGorm Mountains representative said some  per cent of total visits to the resort were in just three winter months of the year.Mr Gough had told the committee Natural Retreats had explored several options in depth to remove the reliance on winter income including mountain biking and zip-wiring but this plan was the most viable at this time.He said it was imperative the attraction can provide year-round employment in order to retain its best staff. This site was the most sheltered for the ski slope and close to other facilities without impacting on other slopes, he said. It could also be used for tubing and other activities.Mr Gough acknowledged the clamour for better ski uplt at CairnGorm which has been overtaken as Scotlands most popular ski resort.He said: \"We would like nothing more than to be able to upgrade ski infrastructure to improve the snowsports experience for everyone but this has to be a long term process built on solid commercial foundations.\"He said the slope could be in operation for  per cent of the year outwith winter and ice would not be a problem as it was easy practice to break it up.ABA secretary Alan Brattey said history showed articial slopes at Scottish resorts including the Lecht, Glenshee and Glencoe had not worked.He also said a bright green Snowflex slope would stand out like a sore thumb and no consideration had been given by the operator to an alternative by market leader, Neveplast, which could be camouflaged.He said that of just over  votes on Facebook on the application,  per cent were against it.Tessa Jones, of the Badenoch and Strathspey Conservation Group, asked the committee: \"What are you going to say to the world about this peatland destruction \"Committee member Dave Fallows moved the application be refused and he was seconded by Carolyn Caddick.He said he appreciated the efforts to mitigate against the ski slope but said: \"It cant possibly soften in the long term the impact that this makes on the area.\"Mrs Caddick said: \"We are going to see it for miles and miles around.\"Peter Argyle had moved in favour of the application saying he had faith in the planning officers conditions but was not supported.Mr Brattey said after the vote: \"This was very much the right decision and wed like to congratulate the planning committee for deciding to reject this planning application against the advice of their planning officials.\"We very much hope that common sense will now prevail and that the plans for the Ptarmigan Building will be dropped.\"We are left to wonder just exactly why HIE allowed their tenant to take such a madcap plan all the way to the CNPAs planning committee who were very decisive in their rejection of it.\"He said HIE should ert the pound million to new uplt. \"The hill business requires to be funicular proofed as soon as possible,\" said Mr Brattey.Sunday  Oct  : PM"},{"url":"https://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04118000/04118063.jpg","title":"Green light for Dalwhinnie quarry work","story":"Gavin MusgroveA quarry operator has said that measures are in place to allay concerns that their excavation plans could lead to a surge in speeding lorries in a Badenoch village.Leithshas been given the green light by the Cairngorms National Park Authorityrsquos planning committee to recommence operations at the site at Carn Dhomhnuill Bhain on the doorstep of Dalwhinnie.The company has said that it is not contingent on winning a contract to supply aggregate to the dualling of the A but that the produce will be used for housebuilding and other local construction projects.The firm was granted temporary permission for  yearsatthe CNPArsquoslatest planning committee meeting at Boat of Garten Community Hall.Production will be stepped up dramatically at the quarry around one mile north of Dalwhinnie by the A.It was previously in operation up to .But now Leiths has permission to extend the site from two to  hectares.

That would alleviate the ridiculous waiting times that passengers travelling by road are experiencing.”“The current way of working has caused no end of problems. We have kids being stranded on buses for hours and cues over  cars deep in both directions. To be fair the council at least seem willing to listen. We now need to get all parties round the table and hammer out a plan on this as quickly as possible, the current situation cannot continue.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/web-ad-sales-large.jpg","title":"raasay shop offers delivery service amid stormy","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineA local store on Raasay is offering to deliver essentials to those who can#t access the shop due to weather conditions on the island.Following the . am crossing to Sconser on Friday morning , CalMac announced that it had suspended all sailings between Raasay and Skye due to the conditions.

Importantly that means that visitors will be travelling through the Sleat peninsula, where communities have worked long and hard to build up a viable industry.“In the midst of the important debates about ferries and not least the importance of the MV Coruisk to the Armadale-Mallaig crossing, it’s important to celebrate the huge contribution that RET has made to the island economies.”If CalMac#s league tables of ferry route usage tell us anything, it is that moving the MV #Coruisk# from its purpose-built harbours on the busiest crossing in the north-west remains inexplicable.If the two tables of passengers and coaches highlight anything , it is that CalMac badly needs its two new ferries from the Clyde to be delivered according to their revised schedule and not experience a third delay.It is a mild surprise, as Kate Forbes MSP says, to discover that more people sail between Mallaig and Armadale in Skye than between Stornoway and Ullapool and that more coaches cross the Sound of Sleat than make any other journey on CalMac#s itinerary.It is good news not only for Sleat but for the whole of the island. It is good news which is tempered by the fact that this busy, bustling route is now served only by whatever ships CalMac can spare, when the tide permits them, while its purpose-built vessel, the MV #Coruisk#, which can dock at Armadale in all tidal conditions, is ploughing between Mull and Oban  nautical miles away.If CalMac had the ships, Mallaig Armadale would be dependable and therefore even busier, Mull would have a vessel of its own and almost everybody would be happy.CalMac do not have the ships in large part because two new deep-sea vessels which were commissioned in  from Ferguson Marine Engineering at Port Glasgow show no sign of turning up for duty.One of them is due to operate on CalMac#s busiest passenger route between Ardrossan and Arran. The other is to work between Uig, Tarbert and Lochmaddy, which last year carried almost , people.The delivery date for those two ships has been put back twice. On each occasion, the £ million contract to Ferguson Marine — which is the property of one of the Scottish Government#s friends, advisors and allies, the billionaire tax exile Jim McColl — was topped up by a multi-million-pound handout from the public purse.If all was on schedule at least one of those ships would now be in service, and CalMac would have substantially more leeway in manoeuvring its fleet from one part of the west coast to another. They might even be able to keep the #Coruisk# on the Sound of Sleat.They are very far from on schedule. The new Ardrossan Arran ferry is now supposed to be delivered next summer, and the new Uig Tarbert Lochmaddy ship in spring .Will they be delivered  Or will we experience a third delay, which would certainly plunge CalMac into even greater chaos as its ageing fleet breaks down or requires routine maintenance somewhere in the Baltic Those are important questions. As we reported last week, the chief executive of Outer Hebrides Tourism, Rob MacKinnon, has criticised the Scottish Government for a lack of any #tangible action# to address the islands# ferry problems.The Scottish transport ministry, said Mr MacKinnon, must #pursue all feasible options to increase ferry capacity in both the long and the short term for the benefit of both visitors and islanders#.As we report this week, Labour#s Western Isles# candidate Alison MacCorquodale has added her voice to the many demanding to know the precise terms of the private finance initiative deal which has bound the Scottish Government into using just one ferry for all passengers and freight between Ullapool and Stornoway, with unacceptable consequences.Ullapool Stornoway may not yet carry as many tourists as Mallaig Armadale. But it is the definition of a leline service, with , passengers last year, many of whom found themselves unable to squeeze onto an overbooked #Loch Seaforth#.We should be told how and why one of our biggest and most important ferries came to be owned by Lloyds Bank.We should be toldJim McColl is going to deliver two badly-needed ships at the third time of asking.It is not enough to say, as does transport minister Michael Matheson, that building CalMac#s ferries is #providing vital support to our shipbuilding industry#The way things are going, building and rebuilding CalMac#s ferries will keep Scottish shipbuilding alive well into the next decade. Their higher purpose, and Mr Matheson#s job is to provide vital support to the Hebridean ferry service.

Published by LilliputPress, Dublin. Price hardback €. Like Fenianism itself, this book hadmodest beginnings but grew to cover all of Ireland, a good part ofthe globe and half a century. Eva Ó Cathaoir began a study ofFenians in Tipperary which has evolved into one of the mostcomprehensive and important scholarly works on the Irish RepublicanBrotherhood yet published. If the film ‘Black ’ is a storyof revenge set during the Great Hunger, the phenomenon of Fenianismarose to a great extent as a political response to that colossalcrime against the Irish people by the landlord system and the Britishregime. But there was far more involved than simple vengeance.Fenianism was a democratic movement, consciously in the tradition ofthe United Irish leaders of the s, and rejecting privilege andclass distinction. In  the IRB staged the funeral of TerenceBellew McManus and brought many thousands of people onto the streets.The working-class character of the movement was clear from thisdemonstration and the author quotes the following from the haughtysnobs of the ‘KilkennyModerator’, lamenting the absence of the‘great and the good’ from the procession:“When we look back to the O’Connellgatherings or even the Young Ireland ‘Confederation’ assemblies,and remember the array of names, of borough magistrates, professionalmen and traders, accustomed to put forward as representing Kilkennyon such occasions, we cannot but view in the most ludicrous light,this miserable farce of an ‘imposing demonstration.’” The recent visit of the Pope reviveddebate among Irish republicans about the role of the Roman CatholicChurch in Irish politics. This book shows again that, with very fewexceptions, the hierarchy abhorred the IRB for its democratic andrepublican principles and the ‘princes of the Church’ fearedFenian inculcation of their ‘flocks’ with a sense ofindependence, no longer reliant on clerical and aristocratic leadersto guide them. Such guidance had led to catastrophe during the GreatHunger as the passivity preached by Daniel O’Connell and thebishops facilitated the peaceful passage of food out of a starvingcountry.Students of Irish history will befamiliar with the story of the Fenian leadership on both sides of theAtlantic, abortive rebellion and invasion, the internecine disputesand personality clashes. This book recounts all that but it goes muchdeeper. For example it tells of the Fenian women, whose storiessurely need to be rediscovered. They were treated as subordinates bymost of their male comrades but many played important roles. It was atime of deep chauvinism with even otherwise progressive Fenians suchas John Boyle O’Reilly opposing votes for women. The book covers all aspects ofFenianism and a great part of its value is in its first Appendix‘Biographies of Munster and Kilkenny Fenians’ which providesbrief profiles of , rank and file Fenians. I have never beforeseen any ‘Roll of Honour’ of the IRB but this is now providedwith a list of ‘Fenian Casualties -’ while the book closes,appropriately, with a list of Fenian monuments in Ireland andManchester. This is a beautully produced book anda credit to the publishers Lilliput Press and of course to theauthor.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27481  ","story":"• Mícheál Mac Donncha and Robert Ballagh Mícheál Mac Donnchaby Robert Ballagh published by Head of Zeus. back in the late s. For anartist of his stature this was courageous, dependent as he was, tosome extent, on commissions from people who, to say the least, wouldnot be subscribers to our paper. But this was an artist who went hisown way in art and who acted as a citizen with a conscience in anIreland where State-imposed censorship distorted not only politicaldebate but also national self-image. For Robert Ballaghcreative work and active citizenship have gone hand in hand all hisle. This is depicted in his double self-portrait ‘Upstairs No.’,one of the many illustrations of his work in this superbly writtenand beautully presented book. It is not a standard autobiographywith chapters set out in chronological order beginning with genealogyand ending with this week’s news. As you would expect from Ballagh,he takes a dferent approach, starting towards the later years andcircling through his days in no particular order before coming backto the present. More than that, he weaves narrative, anecdote andreflection together seamlessly and conversationally showing a skillwith words akin to his skill with brushes. He has a story to tell ofa very ied le, from his unusual family background to his time asa showband guitar player, through his unorthodox beginning as apainter and his development as an artist and an activist. Withfrankness and clarity he tells us how he learned and matured as anartist and his brief commentaries on many of his works areilluminating both of how they were made and the concepts behind them.It makes the reader want to look again and more intensely at thepictures. The Prologue isessentially a dedication to Robert’s late we Betty, his lelonginspiration, mentor and most important critic. The first chaptertells the harrowing story of how Betty, in her serious illness, wasdisgracefully let down by a healthcare system which basically allowedher to die through neglect, as was admitted in legal proceedings. Butthis does not cast a shadow over the book, as her positive presenceis felt throughout, and is celebrated by the author. These days I rarely getthat urge immediately to re-read a book when I reach the end, but Idid with this one. Thankfully the chapters are so well defined thatthey can be read as stand-alone essays or stories. Take just twoexamples: ‘Who Fears to Speak ofEaster Week’ recounts the tremendous people’s commemoration ofthe  Centenary in which Robert played a central part, aculmination of his activism which has included campaigning againstapartheid, for the Birmingham Six, for artists’ rights, with theIrish National Congress opening border roads, in solidarity withPalestine and as an enthusiastic participant in Féile an Pobail inWest Belfast from its commencement.‘Dining at McDonald’s’is a brilliant critique of the dominant and stultying modernistideology and practise in art and an appeal for an opening up. Ballaghattacks “the notion that the artists’ choice imbues a givenobject with special properties which are tantamount to a metaphysicaltransformation of the object that it ceases to be a pedestrianartefactand becomes,by virtue of the artist’s choice, art”. This ideology leads tothe absurdity of much of the ‘installation’ stuff in galleriesthat baffles all but elitist insiders and, as Ballagh recounts, theclaim by loyalist killer Michael Stone that his attack on Stormontwas a piece of performance art. He argues that the bureaucracies mustset aside this ideology and make galleries more open and democratic .For these views and forhis artistic method and, among some I suspect, for his politics,Ballagh has been frowned upon by certain elites. One prominent figurein the Irish art world said of him with dripping condescension thathe is “not a real artist, he is a mere illustrator”. Typically,Ballagh responded with humour and defiance in a self-portrait wearinga t-shirt saying ‘Fuck the Begrudgers’. I cannot recommend thisbook highly enough. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27482  ","story":"Pearse Doherty: The Interview  Ruairí Doyle“Society is organised in the wrong way - we should not have a housing crisis - what is happening with our children in emergency accommodation is immoral. It is a scandal that we will look back at in twenty years with shame.” - Pearse Doherty TDSinn Féin TD and Finance spokesperson Pearse Doherty has spoken of his origins, his le and how they influence and inform both his political ideology in an extended online interview. He also outlined his vison for a New Ireland that provides achance for people to live, to work and to raise their families without thechronic levels of deprivation and inequality facing so many today. Speaking ahead of Sinn Féin’s Alternative Budget launch nextweek Deputy Doherty laid out his party’s vision “for a new economy for a NewIreland”.The Donegal TD was born in Glasgow and lived with hisparents and five siblings in a one-bedroom flat in Ibrox before the familyed home to Gweedore in Donegal in the ’s. This informed his belief that no matter when someone leftIreland, evenit were  or  years ago, they still have a great sense ofbelonging, of that tangible bond with home “that’s home - you know - Níl aontinteán mar do thinteán féin - that’s their home”, commented Teachta Doherty.Pearse, who has been a TD since , talked about his drivehome when the Dáil wraps up at the week’s end, crossing the border twice on hisway up the winding road to Donegal to his we and four boys. He also gave aninsight into the dficulty of the balance between work and home le, and theunique challenges of being a public representative. The Gaoth Dobhair resident added that it is not solely challengesthat come with being a Teachta Dala. He said: “It is what shapes you and your values. It’s yourexperience - it’s your past experience - it’s your family experience and it’swhat shapes you in Irish society, the people that are around you. The peoplewho influence you and that help shape you and that’s the values that I bring tomy job today as Finance spokesperson for the lead opposition party. It’s thevalues I will bring to the job as Minister for Finance,I am in thatposition.”Sinn Féin regularly faces accusations of employing “fairy-taleeconomics” or “economic illiteracy”.Pearse dismisses these comments as cheap throw-away remarks,designed to stunt political debate. This is a debate that Pearse opines that the establishmentparties do not want because “any fair minded person would see clearly thatthere is a need to build houses, to bring our children out of emergencyaccommodation instead of cutting taxes for the wealthiest in society.”He continued: “Where despite the fact that the three main banks aremaking €. billion in profits every year, they don’t pay any Corporation Taxand some of them won’t pay for the next twenty years.  That’s the debate they don’t want to have.”As Pearse puts it, the Budget is not just about numbers -it’s about our values and ensuring we create a new economy with strong publicservices and shared prosperity where no one is left behind and no child goeswithout.Deputy Doherty said: “Society is organised in the wrong way. We shouldnot have a housing crisis. What is happening with our children in emergencyaccommodation is immoral and it is a scandal that we will look back at intwenty years with shame.  “What is happening in our hospitals is outrageous, in a country thathas the wealth that it does.  “It is just not shared properly and it is not allocated properly andthat isn’t the fault of citizens. That is fault of politicians that decided onBudget day that the resources created by the Irish people are going to beallocated in this way.”Touching on the spectre of Brexit, as a TD for a borderconstituency, Pearse argues that the North of Ireland remaining in the EU andgiven a Special Designated status is the only way to protect people on bothsides, particularly Donegal which is isolated from the rest of the  Counties.Pearse also remarks that “the debate about Irish Unity needs to go toanother level”. He continued: “We are moving, in my view, to a position where we willhave a border poll. Where a majority of people will vote for Irish unity.  “And that will come about because of demographic changes. It will comeabout because Sinn Féin is agitating for it, and other people are recognisingthat it is in their interests that we have an end to the Irish border.”Sinn Féin is not interested in maintaining the status quoand not content to merely “tinker along the edges - where you might get anincrease in public services, an extra few gardaí, an extra few public sectorworkers, a little tax cut here” Pearse Doherty said. This Budget, and every Sinn Féin Budget, would be about our vision fora new Ireland and that vision of an equal and fair society. We would also focuson the political choices that have always been available to create that society one is prepared to make them. Teachta Doherty states in the conclusion of his interview: “Our job isto provide opportunities so that people can live and work at home. We need togive people the opportunity to raise their families at home, so that they canget through le and reach their opportunities and reach their potential athomethat’s what they wish.” test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27483  ","story":" Mary Lou McDonaldPresident of Sinn FéinWe are facing into a politically challenging time. However it is one which we can and must navigate. The position of the Irish Government and the EU is critical. They must ensure that the British Government cannot renege on their agreement to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, in the Brexit process.- Mary Lou McDonaldDUP Leader Arlene Foster has called for fundamental changeto the Good Friday Agreement to facilitate Brexit. In other words an agreement endorsed by the majority of people north and south must make way for Brexit, a proposition rejected by a majority in the north. The latest position of the DUP leader lays bare the root of thecrisis in the north. Remember, the DUP opposed the Good Friday Agreement, campaigned for a No vote in that historic referendum and they continue to oppose the Agreement. An Agreement that has underpinned peace for over two decades.They oppose the all Ireland nature of the Agreement, they oppose the rights and safeguards of the agreement and they oppose power-sharing.   to be in them.” The institutions in the north could no-longer bear the weight of this contradiction and collapsed. This was brought to ahead by the continual refusal to implement agreements, opposition to marriage equality, rights to an inquest, an Irish language Act and the financial scandal that is the RHI Cash for Ash scheme.Add to the mix a British Government that has no understanding of Ireland, our economy or our agreements. The Tories are at war with themselves over Brexit and seem intent to bring their own country down with them. This same Tory Government entered into a toxic deal with the DUP to stay in power. That is why there are no institutions in the north, and why the DUP leadership walked away from the deal they had made with Sinn Féin in February this year to get the Assembly up and running.These latest comments by Arlene Foster are a desperate throw of the dice by an increasingly marginalised Unionist leadership. The deal with the Tories will end. Its only legacy will be Brexit. Meanwhile Ireland north and south is changing and a New Ireland is emerging. The joyous revolution of Marriage Equality and Repeal of the Eighth has resonated with a new generation in the north. The largest political demonstration in Belfast is Pride. A magnicent event that celebrates the ersity of identities that make up our communities.Similarly there is a growing demand for access to abortion services. As a placard proudly announced in Dublin Castle when the Repeal result came through, “The North is Next”.Brexit has also unied those who voted to remain within the EU. Brexit will be a disaster for the economy in the north, particularly for agriculture. A community that values prosperity and access to the EU is looking beyond Brexit and Westminster and instead towards Irish Unity. We are facing into a politically challenging time. However it is one which we can and must navigate. The position of the Irish Government and the EU is critical. They must ensure that the British Government cannot renege on their agreement to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, in the Brexit process.As for Arlene Foster and the DUP - the game is up. If their leadership want the institutions in the north up and working then they must support real power sharing, respect, equality and the rights of others. When this happens Sinn Féin will be a willing partner. Now is the time for political courage, to look forward in the interests of all communities. Meanwhile the debate on Irish unity and a unity referendum grows. I am confident that we can build a New United Ireland, a home for all that share this island. That is the big challenge for our generation. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27484  ","story":"• RUC unleashed an unprovoked attack on the crowd with batons Mícheál Mac DonnchaCivil Rights campaigners in Derry had been pressing for a march in their city which had long been a byword for unionist sectarianism and discrimination.Using gerrymandered electoral boundaries and a corrupt voting system which allowed wealthier citizens to have multiple votes in local elections, the unionists maintained a majority of members on the council in a city with a nationalist majority.Nationalists lived in very poor housing conditions and were affected disproportionately by the % unemployment rate in the city.Unionists had long regarded the old walled town as a citadel that could never be surrendered and their dominance was symbolised by the walls towering over the crumbling th century terraced streets of the nationalist Bogside. The last time nationalists had attempted to hold a parade inside the walls was on St Patrick’s Day  – when they were batoned by the RUC.Housing was a massive issue in Derry and the Derry Housing Action Committeeprovided the focus for leadership as the Civil Rights campaign took off. The DHAC had organised a James Connolly commemoration in the city in July  which was banned by the unionist government.The Northern Ireland Civil Rights Associationagreed to hold a march in Derry on  October. The loyalist Apprentice Boys organisation immediately announced a counter-demonstration with the purpose of forcing the unionist government’s hand to ban the Civil Rights march. But the regime at Stormont did not require forcing because the Home Affairs Minister was ultra-unionist William Craig, who promptly imposed the ban.NICRA held an emergency meeting with the DHAC. Many on the NICRA Executive and some Derry nationalist figures, including John Hume, wanted to cancel the march, but the majority of Derry activists were determined to defy the ban. They won out and the march was to proceed as planned.It was a relatively small march, beginning on Craigavon Bridge with several hundred people. The objective was the Diamond in the city centre.The march was stopped in Duke Street by the RUC. A meeting was held with speakers including Gerry Fitt, Betty Sinclair, Eddie McAteer, Ivan Cooper, Austin Currie and Eamonn McCann. Three Westminster Labour MPs were also present.After the meeting, the marchers found themselves hemmed in on all sides by the RUC. They could not disperse and after a tense stand-off the RUC, oblivious to the presence of TV cameras and photographers, unleashed an unprovoked attack on the crowd with batons, boots and fists. Water cannons were then used.Bernadette Devlin McAliskey, then a young People’s Democracy activist, recalled:“Quite deliberately, they hosed in the upstairs windows and shopfronts, and they went right across Craigavon Bridge, hosing all the onlookers. The police just went mad.”The RUC attack in Duke Street brought the Civil Rights struggle in Ireland to a world audience for the first time. It was a complete eye-opener to many people in the  Counties and in Britain. But most profound was its effect on young nationalists.Derry man Mickey Devine , the last of the ten Hunger Strikers to die in the H-Blocks of Long Kesh in , recalled:“Like every young person in Derry, my whole way of thinking was tossed upside down by the events of  October . I didn’t even know there was a Civil Rights march I saw it on television.“But that night I was down the town smashing shop windows and stoning the RUC. I developed an intense hatred of the RUC. As a child I had always known not to talk to them or to have anything to do with them, but this was dferent.The RUC attacked the Civil Rights march in Duke Street, Derry, on  October .test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27485  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonThe past cannot be changed, nor can our shared hurt, suffering and pain be undone. While there may never be agreement on the ious contested narratives of the past, these must all be respected and acknowledged.- Declan KearneyThis week the NIO consultation on dealing with the legacy of thepast in the north of Ireland closed.It will inform a legislative process and bringforward future legacy legislation.Failure to deal with the past remains one of the most signicantimpediments to political progress here.It is a barrier to the development of a comprehensivereconciliation and healing process in this society.British state policy has been the primary factor in preventinglegacy issues from being addressed or resolved.Powerful sections of the British military and intelligence systemhave never embraced the peace process. They remain psychologically andpolitically locked into a conflict mind-set even twenty years after the GoodFriday Agreement was signed.The role of British State forces and their agents, a refusal toacknowledge and be accountable for their actions, combined with a disregard forsuccessive binding court rulings, has defined the British state’s approach tolegacy matters.That has been reinforced in recent times by a cynical and narrative, including interventions by the British Prime Minister Theresa May,and British Secretary of State in the north, Karen Bradley, to suggest thatonly state forces were being made subject to legacy investigations.These statements are offensive and wrong, and are an egregiousdemonstration of the partisan nature of British policy towards dealing with thepast.They are consistent with the British practice of denying wrongdoing, concealing the truth, and preventing accountability.This poses a major challenge to ensuring that a robust,independent, and impartial facilitation of the legislative process will emergefrom this consultation on addressing the legacy of the past.All sides suffered, and caused suffering to each other during theconflict.There are multiple narratives regarding our tragic past. There isno single narrative despite the attempts of the British state and politicalunionism to assert otherwise.The past cannot be changed, nor can our shared hurt, suffering andpain be undone. While there may never be agreement on the ious contestednarratives of the past, these must all be respected and acknowledged.The Stormont House Agreement, , , set out an agreedframework of legacy mechanisms which provided an unprecedented opportunity tocomprehensively deal with the past in all its aspects.Subsequent draft legislation reneged on the British government’sobligations under the SHA by introducing a national security veto, which hadthe effect of blocking a way forward on the issue of legacy.Full implementation of the SHA on a human rights compliant basispresents the best opportunity to deal with the legacy of our past and guaranteea framework which is victim centred.Facilitation of any future legislative process will require thatthe British government must ensure all victims are treated with equality,respect and dignity that the legislation reflects the policy intent of theAgreement and, that the legacy architecture is fully independent, human rightscompliant, and properly resourced and funded.The following key principles should be central to the operation offuture legacy legislation and mechanisms.-          Allprocesses should be victim centred-          Allprocesses must secure the co-operation of all relevant parties to ensuresuccess-          Allprocesses should be based upon equality, respect, and dignity-          Allprocesses must be free from political interference and be absolutelyindependent-         Acknowledgement should be central to the operation of the legacy framework-          The aim ofthat framework should be to enable reconciliation and healing within widersocietyIf there is to be a collective and comprehensive engagement withthe past in a human rights compliant manner, there can be no hierarchy ofvictimhood or humanity.There must be no change to the definition of a victim.High-quality services should be provided to all victims at thepoint of need.This should extend to the immediate provision of a pension for allseriously and psychologically injured during the conflict.The British Government should also immediately release therequired funding to resource the Lord Chief Justice’s inquest plan, as aseparate distinct process from any new legacy mechanisms.The Office of the Police Ombudsman should be adequately andimmediately resourced.Any attempt by the British state to introduce a statute oflimitations to protect its forces and agents would be a violation of the SHA and must be opposed.Full participation and unfettered disclosure by British stateforces and its agents with the legacy mechanisms will be essential to achievefull public confidence in their ability to deliver on behalf of all society.Periodic reviews should be carried out to inform the extent offunding requirements and necessary timeframe, for all legacy mechanisms.Legacy processes should not be limited or impeded by closedmaterial proceedings. In addition, for future legacy mechanisms toasintended, it is essential families are given full access to legal aid.The legacy legislation which ultimately emerges from theconsultation must comply with the policy intent of the SHA by:-          Promotingreconciliation-          Upholdingthe rule of law-         Acknowledging and addressing the suffering of all victims and survivors-         Facilitating the pursuit of justice and information recovery-          Beinghuman rights compliant-          Beingbalanced, proportionate, transparent, accountable, fair, and equalThe full implementation of that Agreement representsthe best potential and opportunity to address the legacy of our politicalconflict and the suffering experienced by everyone during the conflict inIreland, Britain and beyond. So, it is now time to finally deal with the past.  It is time tobuild for the future. It is time to lay the foundations for reconciliation andhealing, and to open up a new phase of the peace process. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27486  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National Chairperson“The DUP leadership is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic norms, social modernity, political integrity, and standards in public office”Ive been wondering lately whether anyone in Democratic Unionist Partyleadership circles actually try to reflect upon what republicans, nationalists, and other progressive minded citizens think about the current political situation.Do they even care what others think The evidence suggests not.Several days ago the DUP leader pronounced that her party could and would change the Good Friday Agreementat a whim. There was no hint of irony in her claim – the DUP has spent the last  years opposing the GFA, ever since it was signed.In another extraordinary, but not untypical, outburst she declared her blood red line position on Brexit and, that in the same week as the consultation on dealing with the past was concluding!Of course the DUP leader, and other key figures have form in making offensive and provocative political interventions.Her dehumanising description of republicans as \"crocodiles\" in  comes to mind.Notably, she previously called republican and nationalist Ministers in a ing Executive ‘rogues and renegades.Only the DUP knows whether this leader is naturally predisposed to being rhetorically gaffe prone, or is being deliberately offensive.Perhaps some figures in the DUP do think about wider opinion: the DUP is not a monolith after all.But, those currently in charge of the DUP have turned away from power sharing.  They oppose equality and rights, and reject reconciliation.Instead they have chosen to join forces with the extremists in the British Tory party to help steer the Brexit train wreck.The DUP leadership is living in a delusional bubble.Meanwhile, the party brand has become indistinguishable from the financial scandals of recent years such as Red Sky, NAMA, Brexit dark money, and financial relationships with Sri Lanka.The ongoing RHI inquiry exposé of how the DUP behaved in government makes a complete mockery of its purported adherence to good governance’.The party MPs have become power drunk through their pact with the Tories, and a serious misconception that they are king makers in Westminster.  Edward Carsons cautionary words have clearly been forgotten or disregarded.  He warnedWhat a fool I was.  I was only a puppet, and so was Ulster… in the political game that was to get the Conservative party into power.’ The DUP has a tactical approach towards everything including maintaining the status quo on its own terms, slowing down and frustrating progressive societal change, and maintaining sectarian dominance within the unionist constituency.The DUP leadership is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic norms, social modernity, political integrity, and standards in public office.  Its inability and refusal to embrace dference or celebrate ersity is reflected in an institutionalised bigotry against, and intolerance towards the Irish national identity and cultural traditions, and LGBT rights.The partys contempt and sharp practice in government has destroyed wider public confidence in the political institutions, and led to the decisive tipping point of RHI and withdrawal of the Líofa grant scheme in the winter of .As a result of its ingrained arrogance and lack of political humility the DUP leadership is constantly in denial about how society in Ireland views its sectarianism, homophobia, and toxic pact with the Tories.The overwhelming majority of republicans, nationalists, and many others, including sections of civic unionism, do not believe the DUP is serious about restoring genuine power sharing. These citizens want the institutions to be restored, but not at the risk of allowing the DUP to continue practicing discrimination, disrespect, intimidation, bigotry, and sharp practice. They will not be giving the DUP permission to get back into power on that basis.  And, neither will Sinn Féin.The DUPs behaviour, and the onslaught of Brexit have together brought back graphically into focus the denial of rights which resulted in the Civil Rights Movement fty years ago.A generational realignment has occurred within northern nationalism.Acht Gaeilge, marriage equality, womens reproductive health rights, legacy justice rights, and the demand for a Bill of Rights are the modern day acid test equivalents of one person, one vote.  The current crisis in the north of Ireland is the visceral culmination of  years of DUP push back against the GFA.Intoxicated with its imaginary power at Westminster, the DUP leadership has finally over played its hand. The political institutions could have been re-established by the th February last, but the DUP leaders walked out of negotiations.Instead of selling the deal which they negotiated in February with Sinn Féin, the DUP leader, deputy leader, party chief executive, and its senior talks team bottled out.Since then the party has been convulsed with the resultant internal fall out.  There has been no meaningful contact with Sinn Féin, and absolutely no willingness demonstrated to resume negotiations.Any advocacy of blood red lines is a total anathema to democracy.The wider nationalist constituency is fed up to the back teeth with the subversion of the political process by the DUP, the British Tory government and others in political unionism.It is more impatient than ever for equality, rights and parity of esteem.  The history of  is being replayed. Thousands marching from Duke Street in Derry city on Saturday th October to mark the iconic civil rights march  years before is the latest example of that.  An exciting momentum for change is taking place across Ireland, north and south.  Old orthodoxies are being eclipsed by discussions about new, modern, all-Ireland constitutional and political arrangements. The permanent unionist electoral majority is gone and demographic changes are irreversible.All of this puts the onus back upon both governments to act decisively to address the denial of rights.The Irish government needs to take the lead because for now the DUP has this British government over a barrel.  But thats a short-term situation.  A British general election in the immediate to mid term cannot be ruled out.A new political discourse has begun about the future. All sections of society need to be involved in this and the unionist is critical in all of this.Brexit, the GFA, citizens rights, and an Irish unity referendum are central to that. Progressives should explore common ground and alliances for change.Republicans and unionists need to start to face the same way.  We have to begin looking at each other through eyes of the future.The benchmarks of a rights-based society guaranteeing civil and religious liberties and equality for all, are set.  These are not negotiable.So, whoever is actually in charge of the DUP for the time being has a lot of serious thinking to do...Who now leads the DUP  Do they have the authority to negotiate and stick to an agreement Are they committed to a shared future with republicans, nationalists, and others in the north Unless, and until the DUP can clearly answer these questions for the rest of society, it will remain exactly where it is now – out of power, and facing the inevitable fate about which Carson warned: getting dumped by the British Tories.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27487  ","story":" Mícheál Mac DonnchaThe Liberal Party was in government in Britain and had introduced the Home Rule Bill with the support of the Irish nationalist MPs in Westminster. They had abolished the veto of the House of Lords and Home Rule was due to be implemented in . The Tories seized on the issue of Home Rule as the most effective weapon to bring down the Liberals. Leading members of the British landed aristocracy, capitalists and senior military figures jumped on the bandwagon and backed up Unionist leader Edward Carson with threats of civil warHome Rule was brought in.Amidst the political frenzy there were very few Protestants in Ulster who were prepared to oppose Carsonism. But there were some and among them was the Reverend J.B. Armour of Ballymoney, County Antrim. A minister of the Presbyterian Church, Armour stood out from most of his co-religionists in advocating self-government for Ireland. In , he opposed a resolution at the Presbyterian General Assembly condemning Gladstone’s second Home Rule Bill. He was also a strong critic of landlordism.In , he again opposed a resolution against Home Rule at the Presbyterian General Assembly.Calling for freedom of conscience for Protestants to support or oppose Home Rule, Armour slammed the intolerance of Carsonism when he told the assembly:“If you deny the right of private judgment and of free speech, how much do you have of Protestantism worth keeping  Nothing at all.”Armour organised a public meeting of Protestants in Ballymoney to support Home Rule and oppose Carsonism. Banners in the hall proclaimed “No provisional or provincial government for us” and “Ulster for Ireland and Ireland for us”.The resolution stated that the meeting of Protestants of Ballymoney and the protests in The Route“against the claim of Sir Edward Carson and the self-constituted Provisional Government of Ulster to represent the Protestant community of north-east Ulster” and “disputes the narrow claim that dferences of creed necessarily separate Irishmen and women into hostile camps”. Among the speakers at the Ballymoney meeting were JB Armour himself, historian Alice Stopford Green, Jack White, son of a British Army general and later a leading figure in the Irish Citizen Army, and Roger Casement, who was executed in . This was Casement’s first appearance on a political . With his Antrim family background, Casement regarded the occasion as hugely signicant and in his speech he denounced any notion of partitioning Ireland. The meeting was a once-off and failed to turn the tide of Carsonism but it did show that a signicant minority of Protestants in the North-East were still prepared to stand up for Irish unity and self-government. The meeting of Protestants in Ballymoney in support of Irish self-government was held on  October ,  years ago this week. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/200/2018/AP-New-top-side-logo.jpg","title":"27489  ","story":" Michael McMonagleThirty years ago today the British government, fearful of the growth of Sinn Féin, introduced the broadcasting ban to stop Sinn Féin representatives being heard on television and radio. The ban was introduced by the British governments Home Secretary, Douglas Hurd on October , . The ban was brought in an attempt to halt the growth of Sinn Féin in the north and to prevent a wider audience hearing a republican analysis of the ongoing conflict at the time. It prevented Sinn Féin representatives from appearing on television and radio interviews. When it was first introduced many broadcasters were unsure of how it should be implemented and effectively blocked all republicans from the broadcast media, even those who were not members of Sinn Féin. Broadcasters and journalists unions disliked the ban because of the disruption it caused and some sought ways to get around it, the most well known being the actors voice compromise where actors were brought in to speak the words of Sinn Féin representatives. This led to the bizarre situation where viewers could see Sinn Féin representatives on their screens but could not hear their voices. Several actors who went on to have successful stage and screen careers started out by providing the voices for Gerry Adams, Martin McGuinness and others. Of course, this was not the first time Sinn Féin representatives had been banned from the airwaves the Irish government used a similar tactic  years earlier. Section  of the Broadcasting Act, introduced in , banned Sinn Féin representatives from the media. RTÉ went further and extended the ban to all expressions of republican opinion, including popular ballads. As the peace process progressed the ban appeared more and more ludicrous, forcing the British government to abandon it in . Following the lting of the ban, Raymond McCartney became the first Sinn Féin representative to have his own voice heard in a  television interview. test"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1093314.jpg--.jpg?1539853794000\n","title":"is kilrea road sliding away","story":"Concerns have been raised about a section of the Kilrea Road where subsidence has caused the footpath to crack. TUV Councillor Timothy Gaston was contacted by local residents about the problem as they feared the footpath and road were not structurally safe.Councillor Gaston fears that the problem is now getting worse and is urging the Roads Department to act. Speaking to the , Councillor Gaston said: “I was contacted by local residents bout the footpath, and as the time has gone on, the problem has just got worse. “I got in contact with the Roads Department and they have been carrying out work to find the source of the problem.“The issue has now been flagged to the structural department from the maintenance department, and tests were carried out on the footpath and road just last week.” The heart of the problem lies with a tree that is growing through a wall at the edge of the footpath. However, there is also some natural subsidence that also needs to be addressed.Councillor Gaston wishes to give some reassurance to the public about the current safety of the footpath and boundary wall.He said: “The Department have said the wall is in no immediate danger of collapsing, but obviously there is a danger of this in the future, so I am eagerly and actively pushing that a solution be reached, before the problem gets any worse.” Many residents have expressed a fear thatthe situation persists, the road may have to be closed indefinitely, which is something Councillor Gaston is also keen to avoid. “There is a fear that part of the road might actually come away, so I am urging officials to act quickly to get a plan in place and be proactive about a solution so as work can be carried out in a controlled way, and the road will only have to be closed for necessary work, not indefinitely.”No plan for the road has been made to date, however officials are currently assessing the wall, footpath and road, and work on devising a plan is underway.

Frank’s story is one of a number which has been put together for the release of a tribute book of testimonies from family members and friends of Thomas and Gerard which is to be launched this weekend in Sailortown.Frank, who is now -years-old worked for Casey’s for over twenty years, recalls that day when fate determined who was in the yard that morning when the gunmen arrived.“My main job in Casey’s was to drive the old Bedford TK lorry, making deliveries to pubs, clubs and off licences. I always had one of the young lads on board as a helper,” explained Frank.“Every Wednesday for thirteen years I delivered to Casey’s off licences in Derry and Coleraine. They would ring in their orders on Monday. We would load up the old reliable Bedford on Tuesday and drive up to them on Wednesday morning.“On the day of the shooting that routine was changed which was fortunate for me and whoever was to go with me in the lorry that day. “The off licence in Derry, was due to be sold that Wednesday. If the sale went through, it meant that we would not be delivering to Derry, only Coleraine.It wasn’t until mid-afternoon that word came through that the sale went ahead. Frances Donnelly asked meI wanted to go on up to Coleraine that afternoon. As it was getting a bit late, I knew that we would not get back to the yard until after seven, so I told her that Thursday would be better. Frances gave me a choice that day and the choice that I made, saved my le.“On the Thursday morning we done a bit of tidying up around the yard and got ready to leave with the drink order.I didn’t know who was coming with me, it could have been any of the three lads, Thomas, another lad called Paul McDonald, and of course Gerard .“The owner, Sam Casey needed some pallets fixed, so that meant that Thomas was not going to go with me, because he was the best man for repairing pallets. That left two of lads to pick from, Paul and Gerard.“For some reason none of them wanted to go out that day and to settle matters Paul tossed a coin to see who had first choice, Gerard won the toss and he chose to stay in the yard. “It wasn’t really a big deal for Paul, he went into the store, got his jacket and that was us, we got into the lorry and left the yard, heading for Coleraine.”Frank and Paul headed off for Coleraine but little did they know what was to happen back in Belfast.“We found out later that we had only left the yard shortly before the gunmen arrived. For me, it was just another normal day. We were oblivious to the fact that while we were happily cruising along the motorway that gunmen had slaughtered our work colleagues and friends, back in Casey’s.“About an hour and a half after leaving Belfast I went into the off licence to speak to the manager. I took a phone call – ‘Frank, they are all dead’. I didn’t catch on what he meant, but it soon became clear and he asked who was with me. I told him that Paul was with me. “That confirmed to Vincent  that it was Thomas and Gerard who had been shot. Vincent was married to Marie, one of Sam Casey’s daughters, who worked in the upstairs office along with her sister Frances. Vincent happened to go in to the yard, unaware of what had happened, he saw one of his workers lying dead and when he went upstairs to the office he was met with an absolute blood bath. His we and her sister had been brutally murdered. “I drove back to Belfast in the lorry along with Paul, but I have absolutely no memory of the journey or the conversation between us, but I do remember going to the yard and getting the gates opened so I could drive the lorry in. “When I got into the yard there was blood everywhere, even on the fork lt. There was no one about, but I had no sooner got the lorry parked up, when newspaper reporters started to arrive outside, looking for interviews.“Thomas was seriously wounded and after treatment in hospital, was released after about two weeks. I know that Sam Casey was elated at the fact that Thomas had survived and was on the mend. Sam’s elation soon turned to deep sadness, Thomas died from his wounds exactly three weeks after he was shot.“The gunmen who went into the yard that day and shot my friends down like dogs have to bear the absolute responsibility, but fate played a role, as to who was in the yard when the murderers arrived.“The destiny of at least nine people was decided that day. The survival of the workers who would normally have been in the yard every single Thursday and the slaughter of those who happened to be there, was a matter of “s and buts” and for Gerard it was the outcome of a simple toss of a coin. “Yes, the outcome of the toss of a coin sealed Gerard’s fate, but saved the le of another worker. For Thomas, it was his skills at repairing wooden pallets that meant that he was working in the yard that morning.“I also think of the salesman who had been in the yard on business that morning and left just as we were driving out the gate. “Sam Casey, whose two daughters were murdered, would also have been in the yard that morning had he not have been in the Mater Hospital where he was recovering from a minor operation.”The tribute book will be launched this Sundayin the Mission to Seafarers Centre in Sailortown, soon after a plaque unveiling at pm at St Joseph’s Church in Sailortown."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"sailortown tribute","story":"A TRIBUTE afternoon is to take place in Sailortown this weekend to remember two men who died in a UVF sectarian shooting,  years ago.Gerard ‘Coke’ Grogan,  and Thomas ‘Tucker’ Osborne,  were killed in the shooting at their workplace, Casey’s Bottling Plant in Millfield on October , . Marie McGrattanand Frances Donnelly , daughters of the owner Sam Casey, were also murdered in the incident.On Sunday afternoon, a commemorative plaque will be erected at St Joseph’s Church in Sailortown at pm in memory of Gerard and Thomas who grew up in the area.A tribute book of testimonies from family members and friends will then be launched in the Mission to Seafarers Centre.The book, entitled ‘Ifs and Buts and the Toss of a Coin’ is a collection of humble and human stories about Thomas and Gerard as told by their friends and heartbroken family members.Brian Quinn, who has helped organised the event with the Docksiders Senior Men’s Group and friends of Thomas and Gerard, is hoping Sunday will be a fitting tribute.“It will be a nice day. We are pleased that  years after their brutal murders they will be publicly recognised in a respectful way.“Thomas and Gerard’s friends were all around the same age, lived a few streets apart, schooled together, worked together and in a special childhood bond, both were baptised in St Joseph’s Church.“We never got the chance to grow old with Thomas and Gerard. The least we can do now is to pay proper respect and where better to site the tribute than St Joseph’s in Sailortown.”The book also includes a tribute story to StephenBegley who is widely regarded as the fth victim of the Casey’s atrocity. On the day Gerard was laid to rest, his friend Mitch decided to hop on the back of a lorry after the funeral which was heading back into town. As the lorry approached Millfield, Mitch lost his balance and fell from the lorry and was killed.The public are asked to assemble at St Joseph’s Church on Princes Dock Street on Sundayat pm."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"two hundred jobs created at springfield factory in two years","story":"THE Innovation Factory in West Belfast is celebrating the creation of more than  jobs on its second anniversary.The business hub on the Springfield Road opened in October  with the aim of encouraging entrepren-eurship, innovation, and helping new high-tech businesses to grow.The  businesses located at Innovation Factory are some of the most ground-breaking, innovative companies in the north dealing in areas such as G technology, software development, film production and digital applications.Majella Barkley, Innovation Director, said: “The key to the success of Innovation Factory has been flexibility and support modern businesses need to be able to change and adapt their environment rapidly.

Most analysts were still predicting victory for independent candidate Kerryn Phelps, although the official result might not be known for days.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Independent candidate Kerryn Phelps Losing Mr Turnbull’s old Wentworth electorate – for the first time in its -year history – would give the government only  of the  seats in Australia’s lower chamber, the House of Representatives, with one of their seats being held by the speaker. The opposition Labour Party has  seats, while independents or minor parties hold six.Addressing the prospect that his government would lose Wentworth, Mr Morrison rejected calls for an early election from the Labour Party. He vowed to work with the independents and minor parties to ensure his government could still .“We have been at  , not , since the former prime minister resigned,” Mr Morrison told reporters. “In that time we had been able to legislate, run the parliament and we haven’t lost a single vote.”Earlier, Labour’s manager of opposition business Tony Burke said that Mr Morrison should call an election before the next one is due in May, saying the coalition had said strongly in the Wentworth campaign that an independent victory would bring more uncertainty to Australia.“I don’t see how he can argue that and then not say we have to have an election,” Mr Burke told reporters.The likely result in Wentworth has been seen as a major backlash from the public against the government, after the country’s fourth change of prime minister in eight years via an internal party vote.The likely winning candidate, Ms Phelps, said on Sunday she did not support an early election.“All governments should go full term unless there are exceptional circumstances, and the next election is due in May next year and that’s time enough,” she told reporters.Mr Morrison conceded the by-election showed voters were furious about Mr Turnbull being ousted.“Liberal voters expressed their anger at the parliamentary Liberal Party … and we copped that fairly on the chin,” Mr Morrison said.“The events of two months ago angered and outraged many Liberals and particularly those in the seat of Wentworth,” he said."},{"url":null,"title":"historic derry building formerly used orange order replaced new social housing development","story":"AN historic Derry building which was formerly used by the Orange Order and the Royal British Legion is set to be replaced by a new social housing development, it has emerged.Plans have now been lodged to replace the former Victoria Hall at , Spencer Road with a new building comprising of  apartments.The building formerly housed Lodge Rooms used by the Orange Order, and in  saw the formation of the Mountjoy Womans Loyal Orange Lodge, which still exists today.Victoria Hall was also used up until recently by the Royal British Legion.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshThe plans for the new development have been lodged by the Derry based Rosslyn Development and the social housing provider Radius Housing.Radius Housing currently provides social housing in  towns and cities throughout Northern Ireland, which includes sheltered housing for the over ’s and general needs housing for families and single people.The organisation also offers a range of specialist care and support facilities for the frail elderly, people with dementia and learning disabilities, and ‘other complex needs such as homelessness and victims of domestic violence’.The proposal is currently being considered by Derry City and Strabane District Council and will come before a future meeting of its Planning Committee.

But, more importantly, itrsquos good news for our holidaymakers and bathers who can confidently enjoy our fabulous beaches.ldquoWe take great pride in these results and know that maintaining them will take a sustained effort. We will continue to work to reduce water pollution to keep our bathing waters clean and safe.Mr Small added: ldquoOur beaches are a priceless resource to tourism and to the health and well-being of our local communities and visitors alike.

The newly-formed Ballynahinch United played in a local summer league which involved teams such as Montalto, Drumaness Mills, Plessey, Saintfield, Magheradroll and another called the Bachelors, who apparently had an Italian playing for them.The club made their competitive debut in Division  of the Newcastle and District League in September  when they travelled to Ballykinlar Army Camp to take on the Light Infantry.This fixture would prove to be quite an ordeal in many ways with the team being beaten - as player and car owner Ted McKibbin had to make double journeys to ferry players to and from Ballykinlar.Not a single league victory was recorded that season, although they won a number of friendly games.Although the   season started more optimistically with a - draw away to Down Olympic, it was a further seven games until they defeated the RAF at Bishopscourt -. During the summer of  the team won all eight games to win the Kilmore and District Summer League.Things improved signicantly in the   season as they were promoted as runners-up in Division  and also won the Enterprise Cup, which was played on a league basis, beating Saintfield AYC ndash in the replay after a - draw in the first match.The Swts were formed for the   season and they played in the Willowfield League recording their first win against Saintfield United on October , .Having been promoted to Division  of the Newcastle  District League, they won it at the first attempt and with the Swts moving to the Newcastle League for the   season, both teams performed a unique double by winning Divisions  and  while United reached and lost the Harry Clarke Cup final.United went to the Northern Amateur Football League for the   season and were promoted from Division B and they also reached the Irish Junior Cup only to lose to Moyola Park. They won the Division A title in  In the   season they lost the Irish Junior Cup final to st Bangor Old Boys while the Swts were probably the first reserve team to reach the Harry Clarke Cup Final which they lost after a replay to Downshire Hospital.Consecutive Cochrane Corry Cup finals were lost in   and  , as well as a second County Antrim Junior Shield final in .Manager Billy Hamilton, who had guided the team through the s so successfully, stood down at the end of the   season and then went on to become secretary of the County Antrim Football Association for a number of years. The playing strength within the club led to the formation of the Albion, in .In the mid s Ballynahinch Recreation folded. United took over the Millbridge playing fields and undertook signicant development work which led to it being admitted to Division C of the Northern Amateur Football League.Under the management of Bobbie Reid, they played their first games at intermediate level in the   season while the Swts switched to the NAFL reserve section, However the Albion remained in the Newcastle League.Success came quickly when Brian McKibbenrsquos team won the Border Regiment Cup in the   season after extra-time and penalties. Brian stood down as manager in  and through the efforts of Gerry McCormick and Cyril Lennon mid-table league positions were achieved.Under the leadership of club chairman Campbell Allen, great strides were being made with improvements to the drainage of the pitch, erection of tubular steel fencing around the pitch, construction of new dugouts and the erection of floodlighting to the training pitch with the clubhouse being substantially refurbished.For the   season Noel Dean was recruited as manager and he steered the team to their first and only promotion at intermediate level when they moved from Division B to A as runners-up to Dromara Village.The following season a mid-table position was achieved together with a memorable midweek Irish Cup replay defeat of Harland  Wolff Welders at Millbridge.Dean stepped down during the season and he was replaced by Michael Savage, who led the team to the final of the Clarence Cup which they were awarded as a result of Knockbreda Parish fielding an ineligible player.That same season the Swts, under manager Geoffrey Smith, lost the Purdy Cup final while Davy Teggartyrsquos Albion won the Bignian Cup and were also promoted to Division  as runners-up. Sadly, this team broke up and there followed a decade of struggle during which managers Eamon Wilson, Norman McCullough, Davy Teggarty and Alan Brown worked tirelessly to halt the downward trend.The occasional bit of encouragement came along with the Albion reaching two successive Shimna Cup finals in   and   only to lose out in penalty shoot-outs while in   the Albion won the Donard Dairy Shield defeating Castlewellan IIIs ndash.Campbell Allen stepped down due to business commitments and the current chairman Gilbert Cromie took over.In May  the club were awarded the honour of hosting the Britton Rosebowl International between the NAFL and the Scottish Amateur League at Millbridge.Nigel Neale managed the team for the   season, but resigned with ten matches remaining. Experienced first teamer Alan Stevens took over, assisted by John Jones, and they led the team to one of their highest finishes in years.Former manager Cyril Lennon came in for the   season and United enjoyed their highest league position for years. Stuart Buchanan came in as manager of the Swts and led them to the Newcastle  District League Division A title.The following season United again narrowly missed out on promotion, as well as reaching the quarter-finals of the Intermediate Cup when they were defeated by Harland  Wolff Welders at Millbridge. The Swts re-entered the Northern Amateur League and were promoted as runners-up in Division E to Bangor Rangers.Much to everyonersquos disappointment, Cyril Lennon stepped down and Steven Bell took over along with John Jones and they led the team to a very respectable fourth place in Division B. United were awarded the North East Referees Association Merit Award for Fair Play at the AGM of the NAFL.The Swts continued their good form to finish runners-up to Downpatrick IIs in NAFL D, but manager Stuart Buchanan stepped down due to study commitments.In the summer of  the club celebrated its th anniversary which a special former playersrsquo night and a friendly match against Irish Premier League side Lisburn Distillery. The Albion managed by Johnny Reid won Division  of the Newcastle  District League.In   the club was awarded a % grant from the IFA to undertake an upgrading of its facilities to meet new Intermediate regulations.Steven Bell stood down in January . A new management team of Colin Murray and John Jones took over the role and they guided the first team to a fourth place finish on goal dference. Much to the clubrsquos disappointment the Albion had to be withdrawn from the Newcastle League due to a reduction in the clubrsquos player pool.In the   season the club embarked on its usual Irish Cup campaign little knowing that it would reach the fth round for the first time and be drawn against Premier Division side Coleraine. This brought about a wonderful adventure during which the club was able to garner a massive support which necessitated the ordering of two double decker buses for supporters as well as a bus for the team.Everything was done as professionally as possible and despite a heavy defeat, although the score was - at half time, the players and their management gained enormous respect.In more recent times the team has been managed by Keith Hamilton, Scott Brashaw and Ross Hayes as caretaker managers, Alan Davis and Paul Allison. In the current season, former player Glynn Robinson and Dale Davidson have taken on the role and have made a promising start with good results in both league and cup competition.Over the last  years the club has been involved in a number of proposed amalgamation initiatives involving Ballynahinch Recreation, Ballynahinch Olympic and Temple Rangers, but none materialised.One amalgamation that did happen was with Ballynahinch Youth Football Club, which now means that the club includes male and female from age six years forward and a ladiesrsquo senior team. This fits in superbly with the clubrsquos ethos of being inclusive to all within the local community which has been something that is reflected in its history from day one.It also brought to the club an outstanding group of coaches and administrators which has invigorated the club.No club could everwithout committed iniduals being involved in its organisation and the club has had a cadre of them over five decades.The passing of the clubrsquos elder statesman, Billy Hamilton senior, in December  brought to an end outstanding service not only within the club as a player and administrator, but also within the leagues and governing bodies.Billy was no stranger to working hard on the ground, putting up nets and marking the pitch both at Feersquos Field in Dromara and Millbridge, aided and abetted by club president Winston Brown, who works away in the background and has done so for  years.Jimmy Brown has toiled tirelessly and selflessly for well over  years, keeping Millbridge well-manicured as well as using his building, plumbing and plastering skills to maximum effect.In addition to Billy senior, the Hamilton family have made an outstanding contribution with Billy junior managing for over a decade. Graham scored hundreds of goals over those early years while Wilson mdash better known to all as Chico mdash played for all three teams and continues to serve as a committee member to the present day.We can never forget the contribution that Sally Hamilton has made as she continues to attend the home matches and has made the sandwiches served to visiting teams at the Millbridge for decades. In addition to managing the team and being involved administratively with the club, Bobbie Reid has served as the clubrsquos Newcastle League representative for many years. Last, but not least, there is Davy Teggarty, who has fulfilled every role possible.While all of these iniduals and others have helped over the years we are most fortunate to have a new generation who have stepped forward and will see the club move forward for which we are extremely thankful..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Peace lantern walk marking WWI end 100th anniversary  ","story":"A UNIQUE peace lantern walk is to be held in Killyleagh to mark the th anniversary of the end of the First World War.The lantern will be carried in a relay chain from Shrigley to Killyleagh, and through its main streets, before a flame from it is used to light a gas beacon at the front of Killyleagh Castle on Remembrance night.A Killyleagh veteran, who is one of Northern Irelandrsquos last RAF survivors from the Second World War, has been given the honour of carrying the lantern on the final relay before the Beacon of Light is lit.Martin lsquoTinarsquo Charters, who is aged  and who survived more than  bombing missions as a rear gunner in Halax and Lancaster bombers in the Second World War, will light the beacon to mark the moment the guns finally fell silent in  after four years of the world at war.The Bomber Command veteran who still walks up to six miles a day and is one of Killyleaghrsquos most instantly recognisable residents, will be joined in the final relay of the cross-community walk by local schoolchildren and  unsung heroes from the local community.The Killyleagh Beacon of Light will be among the first of around  bonfires and beacons to be lit across Northern Ireland at pm at the end of Remembrance Sunday, as part of the Battlersquos Over commemorations on Sunday, November .Chris Hagan, the chairman of the Killyleagh Remembers the Great War project, revealed that an original candle and lantern, used on the th anniversary of the start of the war, will be used as part of a chain to light the beacon.ldquoWe extinguished a candle lantern in August  to mark  years from the beginning of the war, he said. ldquoIn remembrance of the end of the war and the millions who were killed or came home dreadfully wounded, the lantern will be lit again.ldquoThere were two bonfires lit in Killyleagh on the night the war ended at the Castle Square and at the Cross.

Armagh were largely at full strength with influential number  Neil Faloon passed fit.Armagh took an early lead with a penalty from promising young out-half Cormac Fox.The game then became entrenched around the halfway line with both sides either unwilling or unable to put any width on the ball due to the conditions.Armagh edged the possession and territory, but with defences well drilled on both sides it looked like only a mistake would provide any try-scoring opportunity on either side.There were a few fumbles from speculative kicks on both sides but defences were able to scramble into place and snuff out any chances relatively comfortably to leave the half-time score at -.The second half brought more of the same. Ballynahinch had to withstand a period of sustained Armagh possession, but did so without any major alarms.However, they were unable to stamp any real authority of their own on proceedings and as the match drted into its later stages it seemed that Armagh had done enough to escape with a famous win.Former Armagh man Richard Reaney had other ideas and he converted a penalty in the final minute to earn the home side a draw.Armagh will be happier with the result, but the Ballynahinch players and coaches will take the two points and move on to the tricky trip to Old Belvedere next week.The final round of the Celtic Cup took place last weekend, freeing up Ulster squad members for club rugby, but it remains to be seen how soon they become available. The depth of the club squad will continue to be tested over the coming weeks.Ballynahinch City of Armagh ALL-IRELAND LEAGUE DIVISON B.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Red Bull Racing bringing Formula 1 car to City of Merchants Festival  ","story":"A TOP Formula  racing team is coming to Newry as part of the forthcoming City of Merchants Festival.Aston Martin Red Bull Racing will be bringing one of its famous F cars to Marcus Square on Sunday, November , between pm and pm.The eagerly awaited visit has been organised by Newry, Mourne and Down Council in conjunction with First Derivatives and Newry Business Improvement District.Council chairman Mark Murnin said: ldquoThis is a great high-octane addition to an already action-packed City of Merchants weekend.ldquoUnleashing the spectacle of F for fans across the district is fantastic, and we are thrilled that Newry is one of its pit stop destinations during its travels around Northern Ireland.Louise Cunningham, Vice-President of Marketing at First Derivatives said: ldquoWe are delighted to welcome Aston Martin Red Bull Racing to our hometown of Newry.Over the last year, we have been building upon our partnership and supporting the team with data analysis for off track projects helping the development of its  cars.

A number of parked cars have also been damaged.It is being reported that some shops have closed early to protect staff, while residents who live near the historic Grove area in the shadow of Down Cathedral have revealed they have been verbally abused.Representatives from residentsrsquo groups in Stream Street, Bridge Street, Russell Park and Lynn Doyle Place have been invited to attend the meeting which they hope will result in an action plan being devised to tackle a problem caused by what some have described as ldquoferal youths.Grove Shopping Centre caretaker Peter Smyth, said businesses were frustrated that nothing is being done to address the problems and wanted local police to do more.ldquoBusinesses have had to pull down shutters either temporarily or shut early to protect staff in the St Patrickrsquos Square area, he said.ldquoWhile the trouble is largely centred on area between the Grove, the Saint Patrick Centre and the Downpatrick and Co Down Railway, it radiates out to town centre neighbourhoods and last week a number of young people climbed on to the roof at the nearby bus station.Anthony Trainor, of the Stream Street Residentsrsquo Association, said local people, including those who work in the town centre, have had their cars deliberately damaged.ldquoResidentsrsquo groups are telling us that there have been assaults on adults and children.

A bomb had damaged Enniskillen Townhall, and for a while the Council moved out to the Ardhowen.Pardon the pun, but there were times when Council meetings were ldquoas good as a play, as my granny used to say. Reporting the meetings for the paper was enjoyable, and I remember on one occasion two Councillors had a, er, lively exchange of views and we all held our breath as John Joe McCusker marched down the chamber to confront Jim Lunny.Of course it all ended amicably. The two men, both Nationalists and both with a mischievous sense of humour, were very dferent characters ndash genuine characters and not the fictional types which would tread the boards later at the same venue. I got to know them both and enjoyed their company.Jim Lunny was a great campaigner for retaining townland names, and John Joe fought his corner for his area. I recall them both having a sense of community, and not only would they do their best for Fermanagh in their day, both were also conscious of the need to pass things on to future generations.So they were very supportive of the then Chief Executive, Gerry Burns, a public servant with real vision, when he was the driving force to transform the Ardhowen into the beautul ldquoTheatre by the Lakes. And the architecture-award winning building became the envy of many places at home and abroad.Pardon the clicheacute, but the ldquojewel in the crown was an apt description, but more than just being a beautul building in a beautul setting, the Ardhowen under the dedicated and expert guidance of people like Eamonn Bradley and others, gave a real boost to the arts and entertainment.Enniskillen, and indeed Fermanagh generally, has a fine tradition in amateur drama and itrsquos gratying to see the likes of Adrian Dunbar and Ciaran McMenamin go on to have distinguished careers. About four years ago, I had the pleasure of chairing the Xchange summer school at the Ardhowen when Adrian spoke of his passion for the arts and as a regular visitor to his home town he still boosts the arts here. As does Ciaran, who engaged locals at such events as the film club. The range of activities at the Ardhowen is ied and we are, indeed, fortunate to have such a venue.Itrsquos starting to show its age, though. Even so, I cannot imagine that the people who got the theatre project up and running  years ago would have expected that already the Council is undertaking an exercise to look at the future of the theatre. Some of the options include an upgrade or extension, but worryingly another option is to build another theatre on another site.All this has been well reported by Colm Bradley in this newspaper.The situation has led to a number of people expressing doubts about the future of the Ardhowen, and Fermanagh Film Clubrsquos Jules Caithness wrote about ldquograve concern at the fog of uncertainty over the theatre which he said had been ldquohorribly neglected.The Council attempted to downplay this by saying they have ldquono plans to sell the Ardhowen site.No plans  Whatthey go for the option of a new theatre on a new site  What happens to the Ardhowen site then  Irsquod have preferred a straightforward, no wersquore not selling it. Itrsquos a uniquely beautul site and wersquod be mad to sell it.Irsquom told a meeting was held in August of ldquostakeholders which unsettled some of those present, and that no Councillors were present.Irsquom wondering how the succeeding Councils over the years allowed the building to get into such a state of repair, to the point where they now need to spend a large sum of money.So much money, in fact, that it exceeds the threshold that an ldquoeconomic appraisal is required.Irsquom sure some bean counter will weigh it all up but how do you place on a balance sheet the richness of cultural experience which the Ardhowen has brought to Fermanagh over three decades, and the reputation our centre of excellence has across Ireland In the current climate, I think the way we are governed isnrsquot as ldquoopen and accountable as it should be. There is certainly a massive disconnect between the people and those in authority at Stormont, though one would expect thatany public body would have the ear of the public it would be the local Council.Some decisions have implications for years to come. I still get annoyed when I walk past the old ldquostreets area opposite the police station in Enniskillen and see a lot of public sector buildingswhere once stood a thriving community of people living in homes on the island.OK, housing conditions were awful, but homes should have been built there instead of what the planners did with the area.So, please members of Fermanagh and Omagh District Council, consider carefully what you do with the Ardhowen. Itrsquos not really yours, and itrsquos not totally a matter of money.Part of the problem, apparently, is a lack of car parking. Aside from the fact that this would suggest itrsquos a popular venue, surely itrsquos not beyond the Council to sort that one out There are other problems, of course, and I fully accept that these are stringent times.Butyoursquore looking for feedback, Councillors, mine is that you should recognise what a magnicent asset you have on your hands. Pluck the jewel out of the crown and abandon it at your peril. In fact, find the money, go the whole hog and turn the ldquotheatre by the lakes into an even greater asset which will build on what has already been achieved and be lauded for years to come.Your predecessors, McCusker, Lunny and Burns among other, had the foresight to do that.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It was a conflict in which his uncle, Charlie Dunbar had been persuaded to volunteer for ldquoto fight for his religion.But the experience of what Charlie saw left a deep scar and changed him forever.Adrian was the focus of the ldquoWho Do You Think You Are  on RTE on Sunday evening, and it was a fascinating watch.As we all get a little older, many of us seem to have an increasing interest in our own past, especially our own family history. In Ireland, family is still a powerfully symbolic and emotive part of our DNA, and the programme often reveals some interesting context for inidual celebrities.As Adrian said: ldquoAll of us are interested in our backgrounds where we come from and what yoursquore born into. Those things shape who you are.Therersquos no doubt that we will have been particularly interested in Dunbarrsquos journey into his background after all hersquos one of our own.But the interest in the programme went much deeper and much more meaningful. With several little vignettes showing the complexity of identity in Ireland.A word used frequently these days in all sorts of context is binary, meaning only two parts or ision into two groups. Itrsquos particularly apt to the world view of Northern Ireland. Protestant equals Unionist British, Catholic equals Nationalist Irish, would be the perception.It isnrsquot the case, of course, and shouldnrsquot be. But the troubled th century in Ireland, particularly the last quarter of it, saw both groups driven further into a silo mentality.Irsquove always felt that there was a certain irony in the fact that a violent Republican campaign to achieve Irish unity did, actually, create more ision.Now, the current circumstance of changing demographics in the north combined with the Brexit crisis are focusing on identity as we go forward.Adrian Dunbar is a clever inidual and, indeed, a perceptive one and the story of his family background in the programme was punctuated with comments which should evoke some thought about the past, present and future.Adrian was brought up in Enniskillen in a mainly Nationalist area, though for a few years the family moved to Portadown, Garvaghey Road in fact, where he recalls loyalist paramilitaries parading close by in a show of strength to people in Nationalist areas to know their place. The memory of two communities living apart is eloquently described by Adrian as ldquosocial engineering to suit sectarianism. While Enniskillen was much less hostile, the time, the place and the neighbourhood environment where he and his siblings grew up were far from ideal recruiting ground for the British military.And yet, on his mother Pauline Camplingrsquos side, there is an incredibly strong link and a history of service going back three generations.Adrian visited St. Michaelrsquos Church where Frankie Roofe was able to give him intriguing detail of his great-great-grandfather coming to Enniskillen as a soldier from England and converting from Church of England to Catholicism.Recounting some of the history of the Inniskilling Fusiliers, when the regiment ldquoheld the line for Wellington at Waterloo about half of the  men were killed, Adrian himself pointed out that about a third of the men spoke only in Irish. Itrsquos a quirk of how history develops that hundreds of years later the native tongue of men who died serving the British Army is somehow portrayed controversially as anti-British.Adrianrsquos grandfather, Walter Campling served in the Inniskillings, and three of his sonshad distinguished service in the British military in world war.The programme shows Adrian coming home to Enniskillen to discuss this with his brother Liam.Interestingly, though, Liam said that because they were brought up in Nationalist areas they didnrsquot go round talking about their ancestorsrsquo British military service. And Adrian himself said that the idea that he and his siblings would have followed the tradition of their three previous generations had gone.Such service to the British military by Catholic Nationalist families was common, as a look at the names of both communities on the Enniskillen War Memorial show.Yet, it was a feature not talked about in recent history and illustrates the complexities of identity that weave their way through our communities.Conversely, of course, the perception suggests that all Protestants consider themselves ldquoas British as Finchley and thatrsquos just as much an oversimplication. Surely the two identities donrsquot slot handily into their own homogeneous monolith There were a couple of telling moments, I thought, in the Dunbar programme.His uncle Charlie, whom Adrian remembers fondly dishing out sixpences, had been convinced in the late s to join the Irish brigade fighting for the fascist Franco in the Spanish Civil War under the guise of fighting to preserve the Catholic religion against the evils of Communism.On hearing some of the shocking atrocities that his uncle witnessed, Adrian reflected: ldquoPeople do a lot of things in the name of religion, donrsquot they  Sadly, as we know only too well in the north.And he added: ldquoThe combination of religion and politics is not a good one.And there was another line which struck me. Adrian was shown a photo of Queen Victoriarsquos state visit to Dublin in  when the city was still under British rule.He was shown the regimental band, including his grandfather, and considering the protest and fight for independence in Ireland which was about to change everything, Adrian referred to his grandfather and other comrades as being ldquoon the wrong side of history.A century on from that Royal visit, the country saw a war of independence, a civil war, decades of conflict in this part of the island and more recently more Royal visits by the current Queen both north and south of the Border.And now itrsquos a pertinent question to ask what side of history the ious identities are on now.The confusion and uncertainty over future membership of the European Union has thrown the subject of identity to the forefront, and there is the suggestionthat the issue of Irish unity is firmly on the agenda.To be honest, I donrsquot think evena Border poll was held that it would result in unity just now.But herersquos a thing. On Sky News last week, journalist Adam Boulton was interviewing Scottish Deputy First Minister, John Swiney and his opening question was: ldquoWhat do you think is more likely to happen first, a united Ireland or an independent Scotland The fact that he asked it seriously is telling, as is Swineyrsquos serious reply which began, ldquoItrsquos a close run thinghellip.In the current political climate, the DUP say they are engaged in a ldquobattle for the Union. Aside from the fact that all politics here seems to boil down to that, in this case the DUP may well be right.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

I have been moved to tears by so many honest and heart-wrenching accounts.I canrsquot even begin to imagine the pain of losing a child at any stage of le it is inconceivable for those who have never suffered such a loss. But sadly, itrsquos more common that we imagine.It is estimated that one in four pregnancies in the UK ends in miscarriage, defined as a loss of pregnancy up to a gestation of  weeks and  days. A loss after that is considered stillbirth and in  there were , stillbirths ndash thatrsquos nine babies stillborn every day ndash and , neonatal deaths.As part of baby loss awareness week, bereaved parents, along with their families and friends have been coming together, joining with others across the world, to commemorate their babiesrsquo lives.The campaign was started  years ago and yet the fact remains that in our society, it is really only in the last couple of years that we have started to talk openly about baby loss.Indeed it remains a subject that few of us feel completely comfortable navigating. I will admit that before I became a mother three years ago, I had conversations with women who lost their baby during pregnancy and I know I didnrsquot handle those conversations very well.Maybe there isnrsquot a right thing to say, but I recognise now that that I, like so many of us do, shied away from much,any, conversation. Despite knowing that the phrase ldquoIrsquom so sorry was lacking, I refrained from empathising any further or asking questions because I felt I didnrsquot have the right words, I was afraid of saying too much, of saying the wrong thing, of being insensitive, and most of all I was afraid of upsetting that mother.But what I have learned since is that many women ndash and men ndash who have said goodbye to a child in pregnancy or during birth, want to talk about the loss. They donrsquot want you to cross the street to avoid them. Many want you to askthat baby had a name, or when his or her birthday would have been. Of course, itrsquos hard to know any of this unless we have the opportunity to have open and transparent conversations about such a sensitive and dficult issue.Talking about the subject of death is still quite taboo in our society, particularly when it is the death of a baby. But we shouldnrsquot underestimate the importance of talking about baby loss. Not only does it help those who are grieving, helping them to process what has happened, to stop blaming themselves and feel less alone in what can be an emotional and physical rollercoaster, it also gives us all the opportunity to develop the tools and language to discuss this emotive subject with greater understanding, helping to normalise something that is common - and indeed normal - but not talked about enough.Itrsquos ironic and perhaps a cruel reality of social norms that women are encouraged not to tell people about pregnancy until after the first trimester when sickness abates and the risk of miscarriage is greatly reduced. Surely the early stage is when pregnant women need compassion and understanding. The expectation to remain silent during the first  weeks of pregnancy means many couples faced with loss are left to grieve without the support that they need. After all, it doesnrsquot matter whether the loss of a baby is at eight weeks gestation or  weeks, the trauma felt by those who loved and wanted each child are the same. They had imagined their new family they had probably considered whether that baby was a boy or a girl and all sorts of other exciting plans.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This campaign is aided and supported by a number of the Prime Ministerrsquos own Conservative Party members.Sadly, what we are witnessing from many sections is an anti-British position rather than a debate based on any sound principles as to why there are not more pragmatic positions on providing a good deal for everyone involved.As someone who voted to remain within the EU I am extremely disturbed at the antagonistic stance being displayed by the European Union towards the democratic wish of the majority of the citizens of the United KingdomThis has brought me to thinking thatthis is their attitude in general to the UK, then we are better out of this vastly over regulated group. What is even more surprising is the attitude of the Irish Government. They are our near neighbours and have signicant trade with the UK, but are certainly making no attempt to have a conciliatory attitude to finding a positive deal.Given the potential economic loss to the Republic of Ireland, Irsquom curious as to why they are not attempting to use their influence, by their public utterances and in discussions with other EU members, to provide a more assuaging attitude to the situation. This I feel would be more conducive to sustaining beneficial trading relations between the two nations post Brexit.Thankfully the United Kingdom has a strong economy which has supported and assisted many smaller nations, including the Republic of Ireland in the EU for many years.It is hugely positive that Northern Ireland is part of the UK, the fth largest economy in the world. Moreover the UK is a signicant influencer throughout the world and a society that is a leader in freedom of democracy.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Ulster village ed to his old parish... bearing an extraordinary gt.Henry and Susan Livingston came from New York state to Killinchy to trace the footsteps of their ancestor Rev John Livingston – a Scottish-born Presbyterian minister who was one of the early Plantation settlers, and who established the village’s parish church.   Rev John Livingston In honour of their connection to the area – with Henry being John Livingston’s th great grandchild – the Americans gave the church a fully-restored pipe organ dating back to .The le of ancestor John Livingston was remarkable, and included an abortive effort to take about  would-be colonists from Ulster to America– believed to be the firstsuch attempted sailing from the Province.He became rector of newly-created Killinchy Parish Church – the first Protestant congregation in the village – while in his late s in .The current rector of the church, Stanley Gamble, said nothing like today’s plethora of Protestant denominations existed in John Livingston’s time instead it was essentially just the reformed faith, or the Roman one. Over time the parish church became Presbyterian, and then later Church of Ireland as it is today.   Harrison  Harrison  restored organ in Killinchy Parish Church The current church was built in , but on the same site of John Livingston’s original one.Rev Gamble said the US visitors, who both worked in Brown Brothers Harriman Bankhad travelled to Northern Ireland last year on a kind of pilgrimage to John Livingston’s former home.“They discovered the parish church, and me, and made the offer of installing the organ in his memory,” he said.The instrument was recovered from a defunct Methodist church in northern England.Originally made by Harrison  Harrison, and restored by the Pipe Organ Preservation Company, their gtwas formally presented at a gathering on September .“We had a little house organ – but it wasn’t much cop,” Rev Gamble said. “Harrison  Harrison is like the Rolls-Royce of organs.”The Americans’ visit was marked by the first-ever Livingston Days festival , and Rev Gamble said he aims to keep it going as a regular thing in the parish.Ex police chief: The peace process has ‘destroyed’ prospects of justice for Troubles victims Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"“We’re eternally grateful to Susan and Henry Livingston for their generosity. They’ve opened a new chapter of cultural and musical le in this parish,” said Rev Gamble.In terms of how John Livingston had ended up in Killinchy in the first place, Queen’s University Belfast professor Laurence Kirkpatrick said he was one of a wave of unemployed ministers dispatched by King James I to Ireland to the Plantation.But as a result of theological ructions he was “temporarily suspended, reinstated, suspended again and finally deposed in November ”.“These clerics, originally drafted into Ulster as part of Government policy, were now persecuted as part of a changing Government policy,” he said. Whilst his own plan to emigrate ultimately failed, his children moved to Massachusetts, where grandson Johannes Livingston married Mary Winthrop – beginning the line of descendents including Henry and Susan.John Livingston’s bid to emigrate was not plain sailing.The ship, Eaglewing, left Groomsport on September , , but Prof Kirkpatrick said: “Severe Atlantic storms damaged the ship and the group decided God was telling them toto Ireland.“They arrived back in Ulster on November .“A baby boy was born during the voyage to a couple from the Killinchy congregation and Livingston baptized him the following Sunday, naming him ‘Seaborn’.”John Livingston himself died in  in Amsterdam, about a decade after Charles II had exiled him over a theological dispute.try catch     .               ..

including extending the implementation period for a limited period of a few months, as an alternative to the backstop.“But we won’t sacrice Northern Ireland, and we must have finality to any backstop - whether through a time-limit or a mechanism that enables the UK to leave, in case the EU doesn’t live up to its promise to get the future relationship in place swtly.”The Brexit Secretary’s intervention comes as former Brexit minister Steve Baker is trying to block the EU’s backstop plan for Northern Ireland.The Tory MP has tabled amendments to the Northern Ireland bill, seeking to make it a legal requirement to get the Stormont Assembly’s approval for any plan to treat Northern Ireland dferently from the rest of the UK.The devolved government at Stormont has not sat since power-sharing collapsed in January .Legacy Scandal: ‘The peace process has destroyed the ability to deliver for victims,’ writes Alan McQuillan Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch     .               ..

The EU spent money underpinning the peace right across Europe, from the fall of the Berlin Wall, which could have been chaotic, right through to the former Yugoslavia.“Nowhere did it do that more so than right here.”She said the Brexit debate was not about protecting the UK’s union or creating a united Ireland, as it has been characterised by some on opposite sides of the issue.Mrs Long said: “This is about the people of this place coming together and saying, just like the EU, we value cooperation, we value immigration, we value working together in the best interests of everyone in this society.“That is why we value the EU, it is not just a model of cooperation, it underpins the very cooperation that we need here.”Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU by %.One placard hoisted aloft in the crowd said: “% say protect Good Friday.”People fanned out around a stage in front of the city hall down the main shopping street, Donegall Place, to hear speeches focused on environmental, human rights, business and student concerns.Dominic Raab: Extended transition is alternative to Brexit backstop Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Residents of border communities who oppose Brexit were also present.The crowd held a range of placards, including one proclaiming: “We won’t be DUP’ed” in reference to the pro-Brexit Northern Irish party’s partnership with Theresa May’s Conservatives at Westminster.Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin’s apparent support for Brexit was referenced as a reason for Northern Ireland to reject it.Other slogans demanded a People’s Vote, a second referendum, which another podium speaker, SDLP South Belfast Assembly member Claire Hanna, said Brexiteers should have nothing to fear fromthey are so wedded to democracy.She added: “Nobody voted to be poorer.”John Barry, a Queen’s University professor associated with the Green Party in Northern Ireland, also attacked the Brexiteers.He said: “They are drunk on magical thinking around making England great again and continuing the border with science fiction technology and an exaggerated sense of their importance in the world and they show no signs of sobering up.”Meanwhile, Sinn Fein vice-president Michelle O’Neill said Brexiteers had exhibited “reckless disregard” for the people of Northern Ireland.“They care nothing for jobs or for rights and are prepared to drive our economy over the clf.”try catch     .               ..

The idea that it was [Treasury funding] almost seemed to people to remove the risk – but we are in charge of public money”.Mr Woods was also scathing about how members of DETI’s energy ision reacted to his enquiries.Two civil servants – Stuart Wightman and Seamus Hughes – did not provide him with a copy of a ‘handover note’ which had been given to them when they joined energy ision and which signicantly undermined the story which they were telling him at that point.Mr Woods said it was “one of the lowest levels of cooperation I’ve experienced” and led to the department beginning an investigation ahead of potential disciplinary proceedings, a process which has been put on hold while the public inquiry is ongoing.Ex police chief: The peace process has ‘destroyed’ prospects of justice for Troubles victims Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch     .               ..

The paper was founded a year earlier, in September  but all the earliest papers are lost:LONDON, Sept.  and . \u2028There are private Letters in Town which are filled with Accounts of the gallant Behaviour of the Right Hon. the Earl of Crawford, a Voluntierin the Russian Army, commanded by Count Munich all these Letters mention his Lordship having sustained an important Part in every Action that Army was engaged in, but are so far from saying any thing of his Lordship’s being killed, as was reported, that they assure us, that he has had the good Fortune to escape unwounded.[A war was raging between Russia and the Turks. The previous day’s paper had reported that the earl had been killed by a cannon ball, but news moved slowly in the s and was uncertain. This is an early example of the record being corrected in a bid to convey accurate news]FRANCE. Paris Oct . Last week a very old Man, who had , Livres in ready Money by him, wished to see himself possess of , before he died, for which Purpose he prevailed upon his Son to borrow  Livres for him as soon as he got that Sum, he shut himself up in his Closet in order to join it to his own Stock but while he was busy in telling over his Money in his Chest, the Lid of it fell upon his Head, and he was found dead the next Day. The Reward of CovetousnessBELFAST. Last Tuesday the Right Honourable the Lord Viscount Hillsborough waited on the Rev. Presbytery of Bangor,in Order to have a dissenting Minister, whom his Lordship recommended to the Presbytery, settled at Hillsborough: It is not doubted but that the Presbytery will do what they reasonably can to graty his Lordship.[Trevor Hill, who was the first Viscount Hillsborough, died within four years of this report, while still only aged in his s. His son and heir Wills Hill later became a key British statesman as Secretary of State for the Colonies shortly before the July , American Declaration of Independence, which was reported on the front page of the News Letter in August of that year. A man who would become a founding father of the United States, Benjamin Franklin, visited Lord Hillsborough at Hillsborough Castle in . Later suggestions that the pair did not get on, helping precipitaterupture between Britain and the colonies, are disputed, and Franklin is said to have recorded that he was warmly treated by his host] The first two surviving News Letters from October  are the only early copies between September  and December . From December, there is a nine-month batch of papers until late .

Many moons ago I did diddle off and leave a dining room wall a third painted and the job to someone  to finish because I got bored and this has turned in to, ldquoWell, you see, Alison, you donrsquot do DIY. Well, fasten my tool belt and hand me a power drill because I now do do DIY.I unscrewed and moved a shelf just yesterday as it needed doing and no one  was doing it anytime soon. Shelf is now in itsrsquo new position, with books on it and it hasnrsquot gone wonky or fallen off over night, so unless it is the shelf-master of delayed action, I am assuming in situ it will stay and a good DIY job I have done.I was recently approached about a new writing project in a field and a genre I had never thought to write and my initial thought was, ldquoOh, Irsquom not sure I can. I agonised about whether I would do a good job and whether I would do the brilliant project idea, justice. But after urging from close friends and my children, I said yes.It is now well underway and feed-back is great and I love it. I am immeasurably proud and it is turning in to something that I am beyond giddy to be involved with.With lsquoback to schoolrsquo upon us and that feeling in September forever associated with change, next steps and new challenges, it got me thinking about all the children set to start St. Cyres and Stanwell, primary schools, Universities, colleges and the like and how many times we are all guilty of telling ourselves that we canrsquot, we shouldnrsquot andwe do, we wonrsquot be any good.This is my appeal to all students, be they tiny tots taking first steps in to Reception, tweenagers embarking on lsquobig schoolrsquo or those with a bit more experience, but often no fewer anxieties heading to further and higher education - go for it, try it take advantage of the chance to learn and the opportunities it opens up.Le is short and it is certainly too short to listen to voices that limit you or put you down. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Knowing this, John gave up his teaching course and took a full time job at the boatyardhellipand the rest is history.Mr Freemantle moved from Penarth and started his own boat building workshop in South Clive Street in  with British Road Services ndash now National Freight Consortium.In , the business was expanded and relocated to a greenfield site within Cardf Marina, which is now the exact location of Bayscape.The boat yard at the time stored around - boats. Long before the Cardf Bay Barrage was built, the water was tidal and boats moored in the middle of the river.As there was no road to the marina, Mr Freemantlebuilt a track to enable him to get to and from the boat yard. In  he put pontoons for the boats and laid the first cement for the slipway which was all created by Mr Freemantles own hands.In  the Freemantlesset their sights on retiring and sold the boat yard - which had grown to storing more than  boats - to a family friend of their business partner who used to visit the boat yard as a child. And so Bayscape began.One day the couple were walking along the waterrsquos edge and looked across to see the unique development taking shape in the exact spot of Mr Freemantles beloved boat yard, where  years previously they brought in the original electrics, telephone line and water. The couple decided to move back to where they had spent many happy years.Mrs Freemantlesaid: ldquoWe love living here, it feels really safe and therersquos a great sense of community.

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here.

It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth. Work is currently under way to consider how the Penarth Esplanade area can be further enhanced to deliver attractive uses for the townrsquos residents and visitors.ldquoWe recognise that there will be many people with an interest in the future of the site and we will continue to engage with the town council, as current tenants, and others as work continues in exploring options. ldquoThis will need the council to be creative with our ideas for how the arearsquos assets are managed at a time of diminishing budgets, as we continue our work to further enhance this important location.. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has recently written his le story. Journalist TomosPoveysat down with himONE of the culinary worldrsquos most talented figures has revealed his extraordinary journey, from the hardships of being made redundant to achieving the dream of opening his own restaurant, in a new book.James Sommerin released his -page autobiography - Generations - two months ago.The book takes readers on a turbulent ride, which documents the fall and remarkable rise of this multi-award winning chef.In no time at all, it has proved a major hit for the -year-old, with more than  copies having being sold.This is not surprising for this is no ordinary autobiography, as it also contains many eagerly-anticipated recipes and picturesque images.ldquoThe book is basically a round-up of my le so far, he said.ldquoIt also has a lot of personal information about me that people do not know. It has my childhood and when I was travelling, as well as some recipes in the back.ldquoIt was quite hard to come up with the title.ldquoAfter a lot of thinking, I came up with the name and it sums up what the book is about. It was my grandmother who inspired me to cook.ldquoI dedicated the book to her because she got me involved in cooking. I would cook with her on weekends and holidays.ldquoMy children are also involved with cooking. With these two points in mind Generations came forth.The chef, who was brought up and educated in Caerleon, left the area aged  and moved to Scotland.In the book he talks of Scotland in great depth, as this is where he ldquolearnt the craft.ldquoI did corporate and cooking in Caerleon. I then took my first full-time cooking position at the Cwrt Bleddyn Hotel, near Usk. Shortly afterwards I then moved to Scotland and it was there that I learnt my craft.ldquoThere was so much that I learnt when I was there and it helped me a lot in broadening my skills.He added: ldquoWhen I was there I also met my we. Then I came back to Wales a few years later and the rest is history.Despite the dficulty of doing so, Mr Sommerin also re-lives the ldquolowest point in his le by putting into words how he felt when the unthinkablehappened.ldquoThe book also gives the highs and lows, he said.ldquoDue to my wersquos persuasion, I also include the lowest point in my le. This was when I was made redundant from the Crown at Whitebrook.ldquoI had started there in  and was later made head chef.ldquoWhen I was made redundant it was a massive low for me: I went from an exceptionally good salary and having my first Michelin Star to nothing.ldquoI talk about this in depth in the book. I was devastated when I had to go. I even lost my cars.ldquoI had no income yet had to support my family.ldquoTo bring in money, I had to resort to cooking in peoplersquos homes.ldquoIt was dficult to writeabout this. But later I went on to open a restaurant in Penarth and that for me was one of my highest achievements. In the beginning it was a headache. It is not for the faint-hearted to open a restaurant. There were delays and things not falling into place.ldquoBut now Restaurant James Sommerin is a high point because this place is a family restaurant and we are all involved in it. My daughter is training to become a chef too.ldquoAnother high point for me was getting a Michelin Star. It is a hard thing to put into words how it felt, really.And for all the foodies wondering ldquoare there any recipes included  there is a plethora of mouth-watering dishes to cook at the back of the book.Mr Sommerin said: ldquoThere is about  recipes in the back ndash some are complicated and others easy. There are vegetarian dishes too.ldquoSome of the dishes are for a more challenging cook, rather than an amateur.The Michelin Star chef also expressed gratitude to his we for putting the book together, saying: ldquoThe book would not have happenedit were not for some strong people.ldquoThe strongest person is my we, who wrote it all.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

He knew myself and my friends and was a really friendly man.\"He always used to know what ice lollies we would each have, see us crossing over and put them on the counter ready.\"Mr Pontis suffered a stroke after falling in his garden in spring , and later had three small heart attacks and three bouts of pneumonia.He pulled through each time, but caught pneumonia for a fourth time and died on Friday September .His funeral was held at St Peterrsquos Church in Cardf on Tuesday October , before he was buried at Thornhill Cemetery.Ms Sakke called the service was ldquolovely.ldquoThe priest who led the service had lived in Rome and so did some of it in Italian, she added. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Ulster Business speaks to Gavin Kennedy, head of business banking NI and some of those burgeoning firms it has developed strong relationships with over the decades Long-term support is very much at the heart of the decades of partnership between Bank of Ireland and its business customers.And whether it’s offering a wide range of financial assistance, growth support or general advice, the bank has formed le-long partnerships with companies from right across the sectors, and from the large to the very small.It’s been there for three of its longest-running customers – with a combined almost -year history – from the start, and played a key role as a partner in each of their own growth stories.Gavin Kennedy, head of business banking NI at Bank of Ireland UK, told Ulster Business:“We base our business on a relationship management model – we spend a lot of time with the businesses, we know the owners and their management teams, their growth objectives and ambitions and understand the businesses.“That enables us to provide the right suite of products – challenging business plans, providing funding and help. There’s also the chance to introduce them to potential customers, signpost to expert advice, and become a partner to that customer, rather than just be a funder. It’s very much a partnership approach.“We provide lending facilities to business from the very small micro firm, right through their le-cycle, their growth phase, and scaling up to small and medium-sized businesses.”And for Gavin, it’s all about offering a range of services and assistance “under one roof”.“We have the ability to lend up to £m for business customers. There is the consistency to our approach, and that’s really important in the Northern Ireland market.”Partnership is a phrase that continues to raise its head in Bank of Ireland, regarding both its relationships with business customers, and the longevity and generational nature of the companies it’s developed long-term relationships with.“We would have many instances where a mother and father have built a business, and now the second generation is taking on the management,” Gavin said. “We are involved across both generations, and we are very privileged to be part of that family and business development.”“It’s in our interest that the company continues to grow and thrive and we have been very important in that role.”Nowhere is that more evident than with the hugely successful family-owned McKeever Hotel Group.What started out as a family restaurant business in Randalstown, Co Antrim back in , has blossomed into a burgeoning food and hospitality business boasting five hotels across Northern Ireland and Donegal.And the McKeever Hotel Group is still very much a family affair. In the last  years, the breadth of the business has grown to include Corrs Corner in Newtownabbey, the Dunsilly Hotel in Antrim, Ballymena’s the Adair Arms, Dillons in Letterkenny, and its latest hotel, the Dunadry in Antrim.Today, Eugene McKeever, along with his we Catherine, daughter Bridgene and son Eddie, run the thriving hotel empire which employs around  part-time and full-time staff.“The family business started in  when my parents opened the first restaurant in Randalstown – my dad was a chef and mum was teaching,” Bridgene, who is marketing director, said.“They then bought Corrs Corner. That’s when Bank of Ireland really become involved in the company and helped us out.“We have been supported by Bank of Ireland in a number of ways.”That includes the multi-million pound funding for the refurbishment of the Dunadry Hotel, in addition to funding support provided for the acquisition in .“Bank of Ireland has been with the company during its entire history. In , with the Adair Arms, we were one of the few people back then who were buying, due to the recession,” she said.“There has always been trust and the faith with the bank. My dad has always said – speak to your bank manager, and be honest with them.”The McKeever Hotel Group’s single biggest investment has been with the -bedroom Dunadry.Gavin says that one of Bank of Ireland’s core objectives is to help “customers to thrive”.“In doing that, it covers a lot of dferent things, and it’s not just about being profitable,” he said.“We specically tailor our packages to the customer needs. Their success, is our success and we are very privileged to be part of that growth story.”Eamon McCay started his cooking oil business at a small Strabane premises. He’s now grown Frylite from a small family operation to an Ireland-wide firm with more than  staff, boasting a turnover of £m.And he’s been helped along the way by Bank of Ireland amid ongoing expansion and growth. It’s a relationship which has so far lasted more than  years, and shows no signs of slowing down.“I started Frylite in , delivering fresh oil and collecting used oil. I combined all of the areas in one,” Eamon says.And that initial  sq ft building has grown to five depots across Ireland, with a further site on the cards for yet more expansion. “We supply our vegetable oils to hotels, fast food outlets, commercial businesses, bakeries, industrial food service sector… it’s been gradual growth.”A depot in Galway in  was followed by another two years later in Dublin, with Coleraine and Cork following a short time later. And its Strabane base is now a , sq ft building on a four-acre site.Since , Bank of Ireland has provided facilities to the business including invoice discounting, asset finance and term and cash flow ending, and also previously used stockline facility.Speaking about his strong relationship with Bank of Ireland, Eamon says a commercial finance package ensured the businesses growth.“The bank have gotten to know the business. I felt like I have had a partner, which is invested in the business. Building good relationships is one of the values,” he said.But it’s not just about providing help and finance to customers. Bank of Ireland is sponsor of Catalyst Inc’s Invent competition and is also working with organisations such as the NI Chamber and CBI to showcase and help companies improve skills, digital prowess and scale exports.Another business with a more than two-decade relationship with Bank of Ireland is Pinnacle.And just some of the Sage Platinum Reseller’s top customers include everyone from the Irish Football Associationand Ulster Rugby to Titanic Belfast and Mash Direct.The software partner, which was set up in Belfast in , now boasts a team of more than  experienced providers of Sage business management software solutions, IT services and support.“Going from humble beginnings, the company has grown into a £m business,” Fran McKee, Pinnacle’s marketing director said.The firm, which is headed by founder Ken Montgomery, has been supported by Bank of Ireland through its stages of growth, which has included organic expansion and acquisition. “We have a solid partnership with Bank of Ireland, which has nurtured our business since its inception in .”The firm offers businesses solutions from simple to more complex business needs with Sage. It now has  offices across the UK and Ireland, but according to Fran, there is “massive growth on the agenda”.“We want to be a £m business within the next few years and as well as growing our Sage ision we want to also grow our IT services offering and with the bank’s support we’ll achieve our growth ambitions.  You can come to us as a one-stop-shop for IT and software requirements.“Customers today are very focused on providing a good service as well as achieving their growth ambitions, so they want to have the software in place to help them make decisions and run their businesses effectively.”And Gavin says the key message is that Bank of Ireland is a “proven and consistent funding partner for businesses over a long period of time.”“We work hard to build a great rapport and great trust with our clients and these long term relationships are testament to that. It is exciting to share the journey of young and small businesses to growth and expansion and we’re keen to help the next generation seize new opportunities for their businesses.” ■View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/Premier.jpg","title":"premier inn looking at two new ni hotels","story":"Posted on Wednesday October  by John Mulgrew Premier Inn is eyeing up opening new hotels in Newry and Enniskillen as it seeks to expand across Northern Ireland, Ulster Business can reveal.The hotel chain, which has seven hotels here, is seeking developer opportunities in the two new locations, alongside growth in Dublin.The company, owned by Whitbread, has said it secured  new hotels in the UK during the last financial year, and has the same aspirations this year.It also says it is looking for “property partners and freehold development sites in Dublin and other major cities” as it seeks to grow Premier Inn across Ireland.Meanwhile, a new report from PwC says hotel prices in Belfast are rising five times faster than the UK average.In June , the average cost of an overnight stay in Belfast was £. but has now grown to £..Belfast is now the fourth most expensive city to stay in the UK, outside London.PwC Northern Ireland partner, Martin Cowie, said: “The influx of high-quality rooms to the market have driven and continue to support improved RevPAR and ADR for the city. “Though the full impact hasn’t been realised with easyHotel and the George Best Hotel yet to open as well as Signature Living’s new hotel at the Crumlin Road courthouse which just received planning permission, demand continues to be driven by inbound tourism, domestic holidays and events.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/Pete-2.jpg","title":"in focus peter hannan on beef brexit and business","story":"Posted on Thursday October  by Ulster Business Peter Hannan tells John Mulgrew about turning away the big retailers, growing trade by % and that he doesn’t believe Brexit will happen once people see what’s at the edge of the clf Like many in his industry, Peter Hannan is no fan of Brexit.But the top-end beef and red meat supplier also doesn’t think it’s going to happen, given how disastrous the post-Brexit landscape is painted, now that it’s been starkly laid out in front of everyone.The Kildare-born businessman runs Hannan Meats, based in Moira. He’s become something of a star of the Northern Ireland food scene in the last decade – buoyed on by dry-aged beef and an array of the UK’s best and brightest using his produce.He’s aged beef for , days – yes, more than three years – although purely experimental, boosted turnover by around % in the last two or three years, picked up more three-star awards from the Great Taste Awards than almost any other food firm, and now plans to expand into Dublin as his next venture, by the end of the year. Anyone who’s met the Meat Merchant – the moniker given to his retail business in Moira – will know that the -year-old is a personable, larger-than-le character, whose own personality contributes as much to his business and brand, as does his meat.“Our main areas of growth in the last three years have been into the UK, Republic of Ireland and the continent. We haven’t been looking at doing more at home here, because we have a presence, and we think it’s very adequate. We don’t push that, or cold call. We think the clients that we have in Northern Ireland are the best, and we aren’t looking to expand on that.”France is also becoming a growing market for the company, and Pete says business there is growing “very rapidly”.He’s also recently signed a deal to supply all of the Hastings Hotels’ spots.“We have approaches from all sortsover the years,” Pete says. “We are primarily a food service company, so dealing with any of the multiples – doing it a lot more, or not doing it as well has never been on our radar. We’ve had them drive in to the yard here – four suits getting out of a black-windowed car. You are watching on the camera and say ‘oh, that’s somebody’.“Everyone has dferent ideas. We just don’t believe they are the type of partner that we would want. We don’t want to do  tonnes a week of commercial product.”But a few years ago, he did the highest-profile grocer of its kind in the UK – arguably the world.“Five years ago we started to deal with Fortnum  Mason, and they are truly magnicent to deal with,” he said. “That was a turning point because, regardless of what anybody says, the best front window for food in the world is Fortnum  Mason.”According to Pete, business in the five years since the relationship began has increased by ,% – or around  times.What started as a meat wholesale business, blossomed thanks to the success of Hannan Meats’ Himalayan salt-aged Glenarm beef, and has grown into a business with a wide-iety of products – many of which have been done for the first time in NI.Aside from selling lesser-known cuts of beef, such as hanger and rump cap, Pete’s business has ersied into dry-aging lamb, and curing both pork and beef in a sugar-pit – producing hugely flavoured bacon and cured-beef.It doesn’t take long for Pete to start naming some of the greatest chefs which call Hannan Meats their beef supplier. That includes Angela Harrnett and Mark Hix. He was one of the first UK restaurateurs to exclusively use Peter’s dry-aged beef across all of his restaurants – it all started when Pete met Mark outside one of his eateries and gave him an honest retort to whether he had enjoyed his meal. The beef wasn’t up to scratch.But it’s not all just awards, top chefs, suppliers, restaurants and celebrity-backing. Pete says turnover is up around % in the last two to three years – sitting at around £m.“We have lots of other things going on in the background. Taking our next step forward is something we have been considering. We are at a crossroads as to where we take the business next. We are now at a point, do we go forward with the likes of our Meat Merchant , do we take that to a city  Dublin would be next on the radar.”On Brexit, he doesn’t think it’s going to happen – given a clearer image of what le outside the EU could look like.“No doubt, all of us in business have been reluctant to make decisions because there is no clarity,” he said. “Personally, I don’t think we will Brexit. We need to go and apologise, and say ‘as we were’ and just get on. It was a hell of a bad idea. It was sold based on rubbish information, and that’s why people made a rubbish decision.“Now that we have a bit of clarity – Theresa May is bringing us to the clf edge, and saying ‘that’s how far down it is – have a look,you tell me to jump, I’ll jump… but we don’t have to’.“This whole thing about immigration. The thing about bringing , people into this country every year needed to be explained to take that issue off the table. If you want your fruit picked,you want doctors and nurses in the NHS, for example...you want any of those things, then let’s put up the barriers. Unless we take those people in, we don’t have have those things done.“… we shouldn’t be in this position, and I don’t think we will be for much longer. Once Theresa May brings these things to the clf, no one will say that they want to jump.“I think there is a huge head of steam. People will say ‘we won’t take that deal’.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"pinnacle marks  years with huge bash in portugal","story":"Posted on Thursday October  by Ulster Business Belfast firm Pinnacle – a leading provider of Sage software and IT solutions – has celebrated  years in business by taking more than  of its staff to Portugal for an an all-expenses paid trip.The company, which has branches throughout the UK and Republic of Ireland, flew its workers to a five-star resort in Vilamoura, to mark the occasion.The five-star celebrations included welcome lunch overlooking the Vilamoura Marina, followed by spa treatments and water sports.

I grew up in an era where comedians actually had the benefit of free speech and you simply switched off or walked outyou didn’t find them funny. Common sense used to prevail and adults were able to admonish children as part of their development process. Today the world is dferent, everyone’s opinion matters evenit is illogical, ill-conceived and does not stand the scrutiny of even the most cursory of cross examinations. Politicians have always manipulated the message to try and persuade the electorate that the policy they are peddling today is for our benefit. Once elected they then change tack, claim they never supported the policy that they were elected for and blame the opposition. One of my clients’ recently told me to stop wasting my time writing about Brexit because nobody cares and the subject is now boring. I tend to agree that the subject has been over discussed but sadly it appears to have been under considered by almost all associated with our path to European exit. Local, national and European politicians have patently no clue as to how to deliver a workable and practical orce with both sides predicting a range of dire consequences for the UK economy whether we stay or go. As ever the true position will never be visible to the vast majority of voters and, therefore, we will probably never have the chance to understand our exit deal, whether or not we get the chance to vote on it. Never has the duplicitous nature of politicians been more evident than this shambles we are now watching. Businesses do not have the luxury of endlessly debating a myriad of options, we need to make decisions and act upon them. If we don’t then jobs are lost and families suffer. Locally we are pathetically represented by a group of politicians who appear not to want to undertake the jobs they were elected to do. Maybe I am just cynical but it appears to me that they are hiding in the shadows hoping that someone comes up with a plan for which they have no actual responsibility. That way,it works they can quietly move forward asthey were a part of it,it fails then it was not their fault. Do we not deserve better than this  I read an article in another publication recently, penned by one of my competitors, in which he invoked property professionals to be more optimistic and sell the positives of the NI market. I have spent my entire  year career trying to sell the positives of investing in NI. I have stayed here, built a business, paid taxes, employed many people and hopefully delivered pleasing results for our clients.

It’s through getting to know our clients and their business that we can best share our knowledge and advice around the type of financial support they need.“At First Trust Bank, having listened to what our customers wanted, we invested in six new business centres across Northern Ireland to support fast, local decision making. We also established a Small Business Centre to meet the needs of our smaller customers. Now firmly embedded in their respective communities, these centres – coupled with our expert sectoral advisors – are on hand to help business owners identy opportunity and risks and how best to mitigate or capitalise upon them.”Richard Donnan, head of Northern Ireland at Ulster Bank, says it “is strongly committed to supporting businesses of all sizes, from micro firms right through to large corporates”.“Our latest results show a % in small business drawdowns, and we continue to work hard through initiatives such as our Boost initiative and our Entrepreneur Accelerator to build mutually beneficial relationships with firms across Northern Ireland. “A key focus for the bank is the development of digital services that make it simpler, easier and safer for customers to bank with us. “Our digitally active customer base grew by % year-on-year and we are continuing to respond to that change, for example, by introducing our Business Growth Enablers and through the development of our digital s such as our mobile app.”But it’s not all bank financing. The Growth Loan Fund offers assistance to Northern Ireland-based companies who demonstrate growth, and tend to work within the manufacturing, engineering or tradable services sectors. “Loans will be typically unsecured and personal guarantees will not be sought. The loans provided are expected to be complementary to existing sources of finance, including banks, trade finance sources and equity investors.”Some of the companies availing of the finance include Belfast-based BLK BOX Fitness, which secured £, to grow its online  and boost exports, along with Fermanagh gin-maker Boatyard Distillery.Meanwhile, the BGF was set up in  with £.bn and has since backed close to  companies. Last year, BGF was the UK’s top institutional investor and ranked the seventh most active private investor in the world by number of investments. Upstream is a Belfast-based alternative finance company specialising in SME funding, and has also now introduced a trade finance option for clients. The market-first solution unlocks the ability for businesses to finance their working capital needs end to end, from supplier to buyer.Niall Harkin is director of customer journeys at Danske Bank. He says “personal engagement is still really important” when dealing with small and medium-sized firms looking at expansion.“That’s why last year we introduced a team of  dedicated small business advisers back in to key branches across Northern Ireland, giving customers access to expertise in their local area to discuss business plans and explore funding options,” he said.“Meanwhile, teams of experienced relationship managers supported by specialists in areas such as cash management, markets and trade finance, support our larger SME customers.“At the same time, we’re investing heavily in our digital offering, and recently added the capability for SMEs to get lending decisions in a matter of minutes in ious situations. ‘future financing’ makes the whole credit process much easier for our customers. For an overdraft, we’ve seen approvals in four minutes and access to money well within  hours. “In the future, customers should be able to go online and request an overdraft increase on a smartphone at home.”But aside from the financial support, businesses here can also turn to the support from hubs. That includes Ormeau Baths’s Barclays Eagle Labs – which is located at the south Belfast listed building – and the Ignite NI Propel Pre-Accelerator. The options are out there and available for companies wishing to take that next step, whether traditional banking or alternative streams are the way to go.

The Northern Ireland Hotels Federation said a \"shudder\" was going through the industry, which comprises  hotels and , bedrooms. In Belfast, , rooms were added over the past year, thanks to new construction of six new venues, including the Hampton by Hilton and the Grand Central, and extensions to two existing hotels. The federation said the market was going through a \"stutter\" with occupancy and room rates going down. \"It is important to note that demand for hotel rooms has grown over the last year, but it hasnt kept pace with the increase in supply,\" it added. A separate report by PwC put the cost of an overnight stay in a Belfast hotel at £. The federation predicted a signicant fall in demand next year and , with demand unlikely to catch up with supply until . On day two of industry event Hospitality Exchange, federation chief executive Janice Gault said: \"Market snapshots indicate a stormy  with volatility in the market. Overall analysis shows a reduction in occupancy levels and a decline in rate.\" She said Northern Ireland needed a new tourism selling point - suggesting something like Failte Irelands Wild Atlantic Way promotion, but for the north west and west coast. \"Demand is growing, but this needs to be accelerated with a number of interventions, including increased promotion, a bigger marketing budget and a proposition of scale for Northern Ireland along the lines of the Wild Atlantic Way,\" she added. \"Measures like this will allow the market to adapt to and absorb new supply. There has been a seismic change and a response of equal measure is required to create new business.\" Ms Gault said challenges for the sector included skills and staff, as well as Brexit, which had led to \"considerable uncertainty\". \"Added to this are the issues around tax, in particular VAT, access constraints and capacity at key attractions,\" she said. \"You can see why the market is experiencing a shudder as we come to the end of an era of exceptional trading.\" And while  would be quiet in comparison to the flurry of openings in , it was \"far from dormant\", the federation said. There are to be new openings in Londonderry and Newry and Mourne, while ventures on the north coast are now \"dependent on what has become a protracted planning process\". But Ms Gault said that despite some problems, the hotel sector \"has strong prospects\". However, drawing in more visitors was paramount. \"We need to increase the size of the tourism cake to ensure that each hotel gets a good slice of business,\" she said. \"Having spent in the region of £m, the hotel sector is keen to see aon this investment and a realisation of the industrys potential.\" A full briefing on the forecast takes place this morning at a business breakfast at Hospitality Exchange, which is taking place at the Crowne Plaza, Belfast.
