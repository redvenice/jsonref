To pay the bills and contribute towards his granddaughter\u0027s wedding, Stone embarks on a new career path, as a drugs mule          On his first  run, Cartel members put a bag of drugs in Stone\u0027s beat-up Ford pickup and after he reaches his destination, he finds a wad of cash in the glove compartmentStone is a orced horticulturist from Illinois. Stone\u0027s specialty is the daylily, a fragile flower that blooms for 24 hours a year.It soon transpires that Stone is more devoted to his flowers to the point he\u0027s neglected and alienated most of his family, including his ex-wife Mary played by Dianne Wiest and his daughter Iris, played by Alison Eastwood, the director\u0027s daughter in real life. In the film, Stone\u0027s lily farm runs into hard times and faces foreclosure.           Stone receives substantial payments but has to show unwavering obedience to his employers\u0027 ordersAs Stone has maintained a relationship with his granddaughter Ginny, played by Taissa Farmiga, he offers to help pay for her wedding. Finding himself down on his luck financially, he follows a tip that leads to an auto shop and Stone\u0027s foray into the world of the Cartel begins. Cartel members put a bag of drugs in Stone\u0027s beat-up Ford pickup and after he reaches his destination, he finds a wad of cash in the glove compartment.It quickly becomes obvious that he\u0027s been hired to be a drug mule who receives substantial payments but also has to show unwavering obedience to his employers\u0027 orders.            Federal agents working for the DEA, played by Bradley Cooper (right) and Michael Pena (left) see their path\u0027s cross with Stone\u0027s          Glenn Kenny, a critic at The New York Times, described the movie as \u0027quite grand\u0027The one job turns into several and many kilos are smuggled cross-country.

It also owns popular personalised greetings card website Moonpig. It opened the doors to its Paris factory in 2005, after merging with its French counterpart, Photoways. The company offers a range of products including personalised calendars, canvases and mugs - but the star of the show is their photo books, an album of photos created by the customer.           The Photobox factory, based on the outskirts of Paris, has to hire 250 extra staff for ChristmasThis is what the Paris factory specialises in and to support the tremendous demand for these albums in the run up to Christmas, the factory is open 24 hours a day, seven days a week. A whopping 18,000-21,000 photo books are produced every day over the peak period – four times more than what is created daily throughout the rest of the year.   The extra 250 workers are hired in October to leave plenty of time for them to be expertly trained up before the Christmas rush.           Close up: Our reporter, Grace, takes a look at the photo books before they have been coveredClaude Hanocq, the production director of France and Spain, who conducts the tour of the factory, said that not only does this mean there is more staff to look after, but the logistics of the whole factory have to be adjusted.He said: \u0027The cafeteria has to be moved from where it usually is, to a bigger room, so that there is enough room for everyone.\u0027We also need to make sure that everyone is in the right place at the right time. It is a big operation.\u0027 Before the tour, Claude proudly shows off a mug that has the record for the most amount of photo books made in a day printed on its side.  The record was set in December 2016 when an impressive 27,715 photo books were made. Claude said confidently: \u0027I think we\u0027ll beat that this year though.\u0027 How the photo book process worksThe huge factory floor is bustling with hundreds of members of staff hard at work, operating large machines.           Printing room: Looking at the printers that can print around 100-200 pictures a minuteIn the printing room, they churn out around 100-200 pictures a minute.It is home to the largest amount of the HP Indigo roll-to-roll printing machines in any one room in Europe - no mean feat considering each of the large machines costs roughly £1million.The printers are, Claude claims, the best on the market and print four colours, which is more costly, but does mean that they come out much clearer.It is no surprise the factory has decided to splash out on expensive printers, as demand from the company is high with a total of 1.7million photo books  printed each year.  Once the images have been printed, the covers of the photo books are created. The inners and covers of the photo books are printed separately, so throughout the whole process, the two have to be placed side by side on a trolley, to ensure that they don\u0027t become separated.There is a total of 800 different combinations of photo books that customers can create, including soft and hard back options that can be personalised.          It has the largest amount of \u0027HP Indigo roll to roll\u0027 printing machines in any one room in EuropeUp to 40 orders will be handled every minute across the peak period as 11million photos are uploaded to the site each day. After the images are printed, they go through a vicious cutting machine, snipping them to size. Claude tells us to step back - it is powerful and could easily break a man\u0027s leg. The images are then bound together into a book, before going through yet another machine that glues the cover onto it. A barcode  is then stuck on the book, which is passed over to an employee who conducts a rigorous quality check.The worker scans the barcode, which tells them exactly what should be included in the photo book and checks that there are no glaring errors and  the cover is in good condition.      \u0027The care we have for customers is what makes us stand out from the crowd from our competitors. \u0027We\u0027ve been going for years now and we are determined to make quality products that our customers will love for years to come.\u0027This renewed energy in the company has been helped along by it releasing 95 new products this year, including an artist collection, their first range of gallery quality prints.      It doesn\u0027t look like the company is slowing down as Photobox Group has now expanded to own five standalone brands, including Photobox, Hofmann, Moonpig, posterXXl and Greetz - the Dutch equivalent of Moonpig.  The group acquired Moonpig, which was responsible for 90 percent of the online greeting card market in the United Kingdom in 2007, in July 2011 for £120million in a cash and shares transaction.Looking forward to the future, the group is hoping to grow even further and continue to break its own records.  Free online will writingUse code timfree at checkout*\u0026#xA3185 in vouchers to switch and stay"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/25/01/4C807E2600000578-0-image-m-23_1527207763269.jpg","title":"Dianas butler Paul Burrell tells Meghan Markle stay close Harry Sandringham","story":"    When Meghan Markle sits down with the rest of the royal family for their traditional Christmas dinner, it\u0027ll be like being transported into \u0027another reality\u0027, says Princess Diana\u0027s former butler Paul Burrell          The Duchess of Sussex should prepare herself for an intense four days at the Sandringham estate, which will be \u0027occupied by some of the biggest personalities and egos in the country\u0027, says Burrell Burrell, who served as a footman to the Queen and butler to Diana for a total of 21 years, feels great sympathy for the baptism of fire that Markle, 37, has so far faced. Although this will be nothing compared to what will hit her on Christmas Eve when she travels up to the country estate in Norfolk, England.Burrell explains that the festive period has always been used by the royal members to curry favor with the monarch and Meghan should seize the opportunity to talk to Her Majesty about what\u0027s on her mind after a tumultuous few months where she\u0027s been saddled as \u0027difficult\u0027 and blamed for a rift with sister-in-law Kate Middleton.          Burrell, who served as a footman to the Queen and butler to Diana for a total of 21 years, feels great sympathy for the baptism of fire that Markle, 37, has so far facedBurrell said: \u0027It\u0027s the most intense period of the year, I\u0027ve been there for so many Christmases, this house is occupied by some of the biggest personalities and egos in the country. \u0027All these people are members of the royal family, they are all larger than life, have character to go with it. Everyone is jostling for position and attention, and they\u0027re bouncing off the walls after four days. It\u0027s like a pinball machine.\u0027They all want to please the Queen and want airtime with her, it\u0027s the one time that they can sit down with the head of the family and make an impression.\u0027It\u0027s what I said to Diana when she first came into the family, try to get airtime with the Queen, speak into her ear. \u0027The best time to do it is when she\u0027s seated at her card table, before and after dinner, she will sit and play Bridge or Canasta and she\u0027ll always ask people to join her, that\u0027s your chance to get quality time and tell the monarch what you\u0027re thinking and feeling.\u0027That\u0027s the time Meghan should grasp, don\u0027t be talking dresses and jewels with other royals, head for the Queen. The Queen is the most humble, approachable and kind person you\u0027ll ever meet, she\u0027s a great listener, nothing will shock her, she\u0027s heard everything, and you can tell her everything, and it will be safe.\u0027The Queen has to be informed from the horse\u0027s mouth, if you don\u0027t do that, you\u0027re doing an injustice, I hope that Meghan will get this advice from Harry, that granny knows best. \u0027If you speak your fears, she will take it onboard and speak to the right person.

Imagine Downton, but ramp it up. Sandringham is Downton Abbey on speed.\u0027It is daunting as everyone around that table is a very famous person on the world stage, there\u0027s not many times you can look at a dining room table and think: \u0027Oh my goodness\u0027.\u0027I am sure Meghan will sit at that dining room table with her heart beating double time, thinking: \u0027Pinch me, is this real?\u0027 It\u0027s far from reality, so detached from our world.\u0027From the minute she arrives, she\u0027ll be met by a valet and a dresser, who will unpack her suitcase and wash and lay out her clothes every morning, then pack her bag up again when it\u0027s over.\u0027This will be an intense period until the minute she leaves, she\u0027ll have to give up her time completely as it\u0027s about the royal family, she\u0027ll have to understand that.\u0027Burrell isn\u0027t surprised about the recent negative press surrounding Meghan -  stories that she demanded air fresheners at her wedding in the \u0027musty\u0027 Windsor chapel and apparently made sister-in-law Kate cry over daughter Charlotte\u0027s bridesmaid\u0027s fitting. It\u0027s exactly what happened to his old boss, the tragic Princess of Wales.

Well, it would mean the current uncertainty we all find distressing would be magnified rather than resolved.Our car makers – the centre-piece of our manufacturing industry, who depend heavily on exports to the EU – would face short term disruption and long term uncertainty about their ability to compete. Our airlines and freight hauliers and retailers would all find it difficult to guess what would become of their businesses.For the sake of all our futures, this mustn’t be allowed to happen when we have the power to prevent it. I acknowledge we should make preparations just in case. But I will do everything in our power to find a constructive solution.In order to protect the country from the short and long term disruption of a no-deal exit, we need to find a plan that a majority in Parliament can support. It’s something that’s eluded us. The Prime Minister had to put her proposal on hold because it would have been defeated.I support the PM’s deal, because it can deliver Brexit and allow us to move forward. But many of my colleagues aren’t yet persuaded. It’s possible enough will be – but they might not.We need to acknowledge the risk that Parliament could spend the next precious few months debating about preferred solutions and end up with no compromise, no agreement and no deal.So what’s to be done?We need to try something different. Something that people do in the real world all the time, but which seems so alien in our political culture – to engage with others and be willing to forge a consensus.

It means taking a more practical, sensible and healing approach. These may not be words to make the heart beat faster, or fill the soul with excitement – but they are what’s needed in a country that has seen everything from families to political parties split down the middle and that now needs some Brexit certainty.It also requires everyone to abandon outrage and accusations. It’s not weak to create a safe environment for Parliament to find a solution – it’s strong.There may be lost votes along the way as we edge towards a solution, but so be it. Each one will help us get to something that is workable and possible.There will be those outside Parliament that say this approach is naïve. Others may call it treachery. My colleagues across the House of Commons should ignore such siren voices calling us to the rocks of no deal.This is a great country. I believe it can have a fantastic post-Brexit future – but only if politicians are willing to try a different way and only if a coalition of those who want what’s best for this country argue a little less and compromise a little more.If we don’t start having these grown up conversations we also risk stumbling into a Jeremy Corbyn-led Labour Government. "},{"url":null,"title":"Secret society crafters decorate postboxes woolly hats","story":"    Baa humbug?

Massive cracks instantly appear along the fuselage’s aluminium skin, which starts to peel off. The lights in the cabin go out and the plane de-pressurises. It starts to pull apart. The flight deck recorder captures the sound of the nose section breaking away, which is blown back, hitting the right wing and smashing off one of the engines, then the tail assembly.The main cabin is now exposed to the elements and, as the plane disintegrates, most of the passengers are thrown from the fuselage into temperatures of -46c.

Some regain consciousness as they reach more breathable air.

Then the strip-light in the garage falls to the ground.Forty-six seconds after the bomb detonates, Pan Am Flight 103’s wings hit Sherwood Crescent at 500mph, disintegrating on impact and leaving a crater more than 150ft long and 30ft deep, vapourising Dora and Maurice Henry and their house at No13, the Somerville family at No15, and Steven Flannigan’s family at No16.A fireball shoots up 300ft and spreads towards the nearby A47 dual carriageway, scorching cars heading south. Drivers swerve to avoid the wreckage. Further along Sherwood Crescent, a vast lump of concrete thrown up by the blast crashes through the roof of Sarah Lawson’s house and onto the chair she’d been sitting in seconds before.Ella Ramsden can see a huge red glow through the window. ‘Is this the end of the world?’ she thinks.Older Lockerbie residents are having flashbacks to World War II.

Letters, paperwork and money are blowing down the roads. The smell of aviation fuel is everywhere.7.10pmWith the help of neighbours, Ella Ramsden escapes from her wrecked house. As she walks through her garden, she can see white plastic Pan Am cutlery scattered across the grass.7.20pmThe phone rings in the Heathrow office of Pan Am duty flight controller Brian Hedley.

Finally, a Pan Am agent answers. Rosemary asks: ‘Was my daughter on Flight 103?’ ‘There’s an M. Wolfe on the manifest,’ the agent says brusquely.It’s a common name, so for a moment Rosemary has hope it’s not her daughter. Then the agent gives the contact number they have for Miriam — her London flat. Rosemary hangs up and doubles up in pain. She whispers to her husband to ask their friends to leave. All she can think is, ‘They all have their children.’Five months later Rosemary will receive Miriam’s suitcase. It is dented, but inside are her clothes, which have been lovingly washed and ironed by women in Lockerbie.Among the clothes is a Christmas star for their family tree.

Later they will discover that the passenger they called ‘our boy’ was 45-year-old Frank Ciulla, who was on his way home to his wife and three children.

I was born in Chessington, and we moved to Epsom when I was 12. My father was an obsessive bird ringer and president of the Surrey Bird Club, so in my teens I’d head to Hersham sewage works with him every Saturday. That’s when I started trainspotting. It was light relief and a welcome distraction.I knew I wanted to be a photographer by 13. I’d go and stay with my grandfather who was a keen amateur. We’d go out shooting, process film and make prints together. I became dogmatic about it, boring almost, but it made a good start. I don’t believe in God, I don’t think I ever did. My parents were Methodists, but I was always arguing in Sunday school and being precocious. I really couldn’t shake the feeling I was being peddled a massive lie. My outlook on that hasn’t changed for 50 years.You have to be fearless if you’re to be a photographer. If you want to get the picture, you need to go up and take it. There’s no time for being intimidated, and if you look guilty then you are. My best advice is to avoid eye contact, don’t invite someone to comment. Of course I still have problems, it’s an occupational hazard. Do know that if the police come, the law is on your side.Class is still everywhere in Britain, it tells us who we are and what we do. There are class systems across the world, but here it’s clearly defined, woven into daily life and extremely visible.Photography doesn’t change the world, I don’t buy into that humanistic line of thought. I just go out with my camera to observe and present. All photojournalists are leftwing, you don’t do this job unless you care about people and have an interest in their wellbeing. But in my work? I’m simply creating entertainment. There might be some politics there, somewhere, but it’s lingering in the background.Fatherhood has been amazing. It had a profound impact on me. Being a dad has seen me unlock parts of myself I didn’t even know existed. I think I’ve probably been an average parent. I’m away too much for work, I always was.I’ve travelled the world, but I can’t get a visa to Iran, a place I’d still love to go. The authorities say I’m too “political”, which I find pretty staggering given I’m not very politically active in any traditional sense. Could someone have a word with the Iranian embassy for me? I’d be much obliged.Instagram has been a blessing. More people are engaging with photography, going to shows and supporting the industry. And yet, documentary photographers are needed more than ever. If we’re all doing it, we need people to be doing it well. The skill of our profession is exploring one’s relationship with a subject. That isn’t easy. It’s your personal take on the world, and that’s the story.Photographers are known to live to ripe old ages. We’re very active and keep ourselves working, thinking and walking around. That said, I fully accept I’m getting older. There are more aches and pains, but I won’t let them intimidate me.A membership scheme has begun at the Martin Parr Foundation.

She published her debut book, the memoir Everything I Know About Love, in February. Last month it was shortlisted for Waterstones book of the year and won the 2018 National Book Awards prize for best autobiography. Alderton started her career as a columnist at askmen, where her reviews of the Channel 4 reality show Made in Chelsea landed her a job as a story producer on the Bafta-winning show. From 2015 to 2017 she wrote a dating column for the Sunday Times Style magazine, where she has recently returned as a columnist. She presents the current affairs podcast The High Low with Pandora Sykes, and her own podcast, Love Stories.Are you surprised by the huge success of Everything I Know About Love?So surprised. I didn’t sleep for about two months when my proofs were being sent out. I rang my mum and said: “I’m really worried that a number of jobs at Penguin are under threat because of this book.” That is probably quite a self-aggrandising notion.You write about trying to rely less on external validation, so how have you handled so much of it?I told a friend I’m the happiest I’ve ever been, and she said: “Well, it’s very easy when everyone is telling you they think your book about your life is good.” Which I hadn’t considered. I wrote a terrible first draft in my mid-20s. The good thing about this timing was that I had come out the other side of therapy so there was a degree of hardiness, whatever people’s reactions.Do you feel pressure to be relatable?You have to make sure you don’t distil your experiences into digestible shorthand. A friend said: “There are stories I remember being painful that you now talk about as if they’re funny, and vice versa – where’s the truth?” That’s what I was trying to do – to explore the multifaceted nature of supposed transgression. We’re so keen to moralise the female experience that we put a neater spin on things. But how many experiences were wholly tragic or wholly wonderful? It’s really important that we talk about those things without fearing accusations of hypocrisy.How has technology changed the relationships of people our age?It’s such a big question. On any given day I could be very dour about technology or very jubilant. I have quite a difficult relationship with WhatsApp. I love that I get to have an uninterrupted space with women I love where we’re just being silly and disgusting and sad and fearful. It engenders a great sense of closeness. But it can also bring a false sense of closeness leading to a lack of effort in real day-to-day life relationships. The same can be said of romance.What do you make of the current feminist publishing craze – the essay anthologies, The Guilty Feminist, celebrations of so-called “rebel women”? Is it a net good?I think it can only be a good thing. I’m not sneery about the commodification of feminism. I wasn’t even that well-read in it but I identified as a feminist from a very young age, inherited from my mother. Until well into my mid-20s it was not a bus that girls I loved wanted to pile in on. It was something embarrassing – isolating and man-hating. I don’t know one woman close to me now who doesn’t call herself a feminist and who doesn’t think about gender equality at home, at work, in their relationship, in dating. That might mean that the complex historic thinking on feminism is, at times, reduced, but I think that’s a small price to pay if something so fundamental to human rights has trickled down.You’ve both been labelled the “voice of a generation”. Why are we so keen to attribute that tag?I don’t think people say it about men. It’s the same reason why you would read “This girl is the new Lena Dunham”, and now it’s “the new Phoebe Waller-Bridge”. It has sexist overtones – having got their head around one woman, people can’t be bothered understanding others.Everyone who is called the voice of a generation hates it, but everyone wants to be perceived as an influencer. Why?A friend once said, hypocrisy is the worst insult that can be thrown at millennials. It’s the antithesis of intellectualism – not being interested in being challenged, because any U-turn shows a lack of supposed authenticity. So we protect ourselves by saying: “Not only do I believe this about Brexit, skincare, gluten, feminism – it’s written in stone for you to follow as dogma.” Somehow we believe that is evidence of integrity.You recently turned 30 – did you have a crisis?An enormous crisis. I’d love to give a more brooding answer but I don’t want to get old and die. And it’s the female currency of youth. I’ve tried to muffle that noise but some of it seeped in. I didn’t like that I was fearful about potentially losing aesthetic identity, fertility or a certain cachet in romance. It’s so disgusting when I say it, and I actually think acknowledging how gross that was frustrated me. I thought I would be able to bypass that and I didn’t.Are you a Christmas person?I had my tree up the first weekend of December. My mother is Canadian and so obsessed with Christmas that she has every corner of our house covered. I’ve inherited it from her. I’m very schmaltzy and quite earnest, so Christmas is a lovely celebration of all those cheesy qualities.• Everything I Know About Love by Dolly Alderton is published by Penguin (£8.99).

After 19 novels ning Nigeria to Ethiopia, he shares what he learnedAt last year’s  Opinion Christmas party – modest affairs at which those who want to dance are outnumbered by those who want to talk by at least five to one – I met Chibundu Onuzo, a Nigerian author.“We share a publisher,” she told me.“I’m sorry,” I told her. “I haven’t read your book.”Chibundu waved away my apology with generous indifference. We carried on chatting and were among the pioneers on the dancefloor.Chibundu did not appear bothered by my ignorance of her work, but I was. I can’t say exactly why. There are lots of books I haven’t read. But in some small way that gnawed at me in the days ahead, I wondered not only why I hadn’t read her but why she wasn’t on my radar.Feeling it was time to fix my radar, I decided, when it came to fiction, to read only African women for a year. The motivation was not virtue but curiosity. I wondered what I had been missing out on. I wasn’t completely ignorant of literature by women from that part of the world: I’d read Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, Ama Ata Aidoo, Bessie Head, Buchi Emecheta, Leila Aboulela, Gillian Slovo, Nadine Gordimer and Zoë Wicomb. Nor was I entirely ignorant of that part of the world. I lived in Sudan for a year, reported from South Africa, Mozambique, Zimbabwe, Tanzania and Sierra Leone and visited Ghana on holiday. But it had been at least four years since I read any of those authors and five since I set foot on the continent.Not so long ago my project would have been much harder. “It used to be just a few writers published mostly as part of an educational series,” explains Margaret Busby, editor of Daughters of Africa, the landmark anthology of writing by women of African descent, which came out in 1992. “Now they are in the mainstream. I think publishers can see the success they can have with someone like Chimamanda and of course they want that success too.”But it’s still not as easy as it might be. “Until you can no longer count the number of African women writers who have broken through then we’ve still got work to do,” says Busby, whose sequel, New Daughters of Africa, comes out next year.My original approach was not methodical. I just started with the books on my shelf, posted an appeal for recommendations on Facebook and then took the books I’d read and went to Amazon’s “Customers who viewed this item also viewed” section to see what else was out there. But when, by around Easter, it became clear that if I didn’t mix it up I could spend the whole year reading Nigerian women (no bad thing, just not my plan), I made an effort to seek out writers from various parts of the continent.With the year almost up I have read 18 books by authors from Morocco, Ghana, Zimbabwe, Nigeria, Sierra Leone, Senegal, Egypt, Somalia, Uganda, Ethiopia and Cameroon.There have been love stories, short stories, multi-generational sagas, political novels, ghosts, infertility, coups, occupations and migration stories, written in the voices of white English men and women, first, second, third and fourth wives, children, slaves and slavers, ranging over four continents and in every century from the 16th onwards.The book most often recommended to me was Homegoing by Yaa Gyasi, a 29-year-old Ghanaian American writer based in Berkeley. This debut novel from 2016, which won a slew of awards, is a saga ning the Atlantic and many generations. It starts in an 18th-century Asante village and follows the descendants of Maame, who has two daughters. One is married to the British governor running Cape Coast Castle the other, Esi, is enslaved in the dungeons below. Each chapter then follows their offspring, in Africa and the US. Panoramic in its scope, Gyasi’s book is a bold effort.But chances are I’d have appreciated it more if I hadn’t already come across two books that use the same device to greater effect. The first, Segu, tells the story of the eponymous west African kingdom as it fights to maintain its traditions and integrity against Christian, Muslim and foreign incursion and expansion. It starts in 1797, when “Segu was at the height of its glory. Its power stretched as far as the outskirts of Jenne ... and it was feared as far away as Timbuktu ... ” The book traces the lineage of Dousika Traore, the Segu king’s most trusted court adviser, through his four sons and beyond. Maryse Condé, 81, employs her historical knowledge with a light touch, building complex characters who are not reduced to vessels of a historical moment. Condé, the French winner of this year’s New Academy prize in literature (given in lieu of the Nobel prize), is the one writer included here who is not African. Momentarily distracted by the subject matter of Segu, which I already owned, by the time I remembered that she wasn’t African it didn’t matter – I was already hooked.The second, Kintu, is the first novel by Ugandan-born Jennifer Nansubuga Makumbi, who now lives in Manchester and was awarded a $150,000 Windham-Campbell literature prize this year. Kintu, published in the UK in January, is the story of a curse passed through generations in what is now Uganda. It starts with the mob killing of a man mistaken for a thief and then stretches back to the story of a powerful governor who unleashes a curse that reverberates through the ages when he kills his own son. Makumbi’s prose style is as haunting as the storyline. “Just as the sun moved into the centre of the sky to inflict its worst, o Lwera, a region of barren land came into view ... Even at this distance, a dirge, the hum of its heat, was audible. Waves of radiation danced in the air warning: You traverse these grounds at your own peril.”In his satirical 2006 Granta essay, How to Write About Africa, Binyavanga Wainaina advises: “Never have a picture of a well-adjusted African on the cover of your book, or in it, unless that African has won the Nobel prize ... Taboo subjects: ordinary domestic scenes, love between Africans (unless a death is involved), references to African writers or intellectuals, mention of school-going children who are not suffering from yaws or Ebola fever or female genital mutilation.”There are plenty of portrayals of ordinary domestic scenes and love between Africans in this motley collection. But rare were the west African, and particularly Nigerian, works that did not find ample material in polygamy. If you think of how much drama English literature has managed to extract from monogamy, we probably shouldn’t be surprised. When African men write about polygamy it is generally treated, at best, as a problem to manage: keeping peace among the wives. But, not surprisingly, female authors engage with it differently. It is for the women to manage the humiliation, competition, jealousy and rancour brought about when a man invites another woman to share his bed and compound. A pecking order emerges among wives and children, in a range of abusive relationships between men and women, women and women and women and their children, producing rivalries that propel plots.The most tender of these accounts is also the shortest – the 95-page So Long a Letter, published in 1979, by the Senegalese author Mariama Bâ, who died aged 52 in 1981. The book takes the form of a letter from Ramatoulaye Fall to her best friend Aissatou on the death of Ramatoulaye’s husband Modou, who has abandoned her and their 12 children and taken one of their daughter’s best friends as his second wife.“And to think that I loved this man passionately,” writes Ramatoulaye. “To think that I gave him 30 years of my life, to think that 12 times over I carried his child. The addition of a rival to my life was not enough for him. In loving someone else, he burned his past, both morally and materially. He dared to commit such an act of disavowal.”In the more recent novels polygamy appears to pose a challenge to a sense of modernity, making its way from the urban centres towards the peripheries, particularly in Nigeria where, according to the Demographic and Health Survey 2008, a third of married women and one in eight married men (aged 15-49) are in polygamous unions.These dynamics are further complicated, or sometimes instigated, as the focus shifts from the bed to the uterus, and the guilt and desperation as women will their bodies to produce the one thing – often the only thing – that will legitimise both their marriage and their femininity: a child. It may take two to make a baby but fertility and fecundity are understood to be a woman’s responsibility not least because they represent the underpinnings of a man’s honour.This is the defining theme of The Secret Lives of Baba Segi’s Wives by Lola Shoneyin, the winner of several awards and longlisted for the Orange prize in 2011, in which Bolanle Alao, a graduate with a promising future, marries into a polygamous family as the fourth wife. Baba Segi’s role in the whole affair is almost incidental – the benign dictator in a state of emotional repression, his sexual endeavours are described in tragicomic detail. “Baba Segi was heavy,” relates one of his wives. “Everything about him was clumsy and awkward. He heaved and hoed, poured his water into me and collapsed onto my breasts.” Only Egyptian author, psychiatrist and physician Nawal El Saadawi’s depiction of Zakariah’s subservience to his “gland” in Zeina (2011) is more debasing. In Baba Segi’s house, however, the disgrace is Bolanle’s. Despised and ultimately feared by the other wives who try everything – including murder – to get rid of her, Bolanle struggles to conceive. The shame of being barren, the overbearing mother-in-law, the disappointed gaze that rests on a newly-wed’s flat stomach, the natural remedies and visits to traditional healers are constant features.“You have had my son between your legs for two more months and still your stomach is flat,” Moomi, the mother-in-law, tells the protagonist, Yejide in Ayòbámi Adébáyò’s excellent 2017 novel Stay With Me. “Close your thighs to him I beg you … If you don’t he will die childless. I beg you, don’t spoil my life. He is my first son, Yejide.”We follow Yejide through a phantom pregnancy, infant mortality and a second wife as Adébáyò builds a vivid cast of secondary characters who bear witness and contribute to the disintegration of her marriage.The Map of Love by Ahdaf Soueif is one of several books in which the more familiar tensions of monogamous relationships dominate, including Zeina, in which love is absent and others, like Aminatta Forna’s The Memory of Love (2010), which is tied together by a marriage that is unfulfilled, a romance that is incomplete and a courtship that reaches fruition. Soueif’s 1999 Booker shortlisted novel tracks the dual romances of an Egyptian American conductor and American journalist in the US during the 90s and an English widow and Egyptian doctor in Egypt at the beginning of the 20th century, and is the only one of these books in which romantic love drives the narrative completely.Stay With Me, like many of these stories, whether set in Egypt (Zeina and The Map of Love), Uganda (Kintu and Tropical Fish by Doreen Baingana), Zimbabwe (We Need New Names by NoViolet Bulawayo), Sierra Leone (The Memory of Love) or the US (Behold the Dreamers by Imbolo Mbue), uses political upheaval to provide an important, if somewhat incidental, backdrop. More often than not this is just an aside: “We were at Makerere University,” writes Baingana in her collection of intertwined short stories, “We were the cream of the crop. We had dodged the bullets of Amin, Obote, all the coups, the economic war, exile and return, and here we were on the road to success.”Only in Maaza Mengiste’s 2010 novel Beneath the Lion’s Gaze, set in Ethiopia during the downfall of Emperor Haile Selassie and the first years of the Dergue dictatorship, does politics dominate. Through the story of one family – Hailu, the doctor, his two sons, the religious Yonas and the rebellious Dawit, their partners and neighbours – we see the disintegration into a reign of terror. The depiction of inidual acts of morality and resistance – both major and minor, futile and fruitful – as a society descends into brutality and conformism is arresting even if all the characters except Hailu feel one-dimensional. “You want to save people,” Dawit’s revolutionary handler tells him after he tries to drag from the street the corpse of a woman he knows against a soldier’s orders. “Then save the living. Those who are dead aren’t worth dying for.”Unlike many black British novels, which often have a fractured timeline, only a few of those I read (Zeina, Kintu, The Memory of Love) shift between past and present. But many move geographically, offering migration stories either within the continent (Segu, Nadifa Mohamed’s Black Mamba Boy (2010), Homegoing) or beyond. Behold the Dreamers, Homegoing, Tropical Fish and We Need New Names take us to the US Segu to Brazil. Philosophically the authors of these books feel more comfortable in their skin than their diasporic counterparts in Europe and the US, who often work through their issues of belonging, discrimination and minority status through their fiction. Ethnic, tribal, religious and regional differences may make their protagonists question their place at home, but they don’t interrogate whether it’s home or not. That sense of confidence evaporates the longer they stay outside Africa.But perhaps the boldest and most arresting migration story of all is that offered by Laila Lalami’s 2014 novel The Moor’s Account (shortlisted for the Pulitzer prize, longlisted for the Booker), which tells the story of the calamitous New World expedition from Spain to Florida, from the point of view of Estabanico, a Moorish slave, to whom Lalami gives the original name Mustafa. Mustafa is one of just four from an original contingent of 300 who survive the journey after some are lost, others killed and a handful eaten by their fellow explorers. As the expedition proceeds, with all the brutality and arrogance such an imperial adventure entails, the numbers dwindle and the hierarchy between slave and master breaks down, threatening to reassert itself when the four finally find their way back to other Spanish colonists. “The rules and formalities that had existed on land could not be maintained on the rafts,” notes Mustafa. “Worse: our ablutions were no longer private ... But for one like me, who had already known these humiliations, it was a reminder that all fates, including my master’s, could turn upside down. And I would do whatever it took in order to right mine.”In a regular year my fiction choices are very hit and miss. I read non-fiction primarily for work and fiction for pleasure. Occasionally, prompted by reviews and more often by recommendations, I yank something off the shelf and give it a go. I come late to pretty much everything. Sometimes I try to improve myself with something I think I should have read – a classic Russian novel or recent prize winner – which rarely works out. If I have a default it’s to black western writers – the ones I’m most likely to see referred to in other work and refer to in my own. It’s a rare summer holiday that I don’t take a Walter Mosley with me. But last year I devoured Anthony Doerr’s All the Light We Cannot See the year before, Elena Ferrante’s Neapolitan novels. This year I’ve enjoyed more books than usual and encountered far fewer duds.Indeed one of the most delightful was Welcome to Lagos, by one Chibundu Onuzo. It follows Chike Ameobi, a military officer, who deserts the Nigerian army with his subordinate of few words, Yemi, after refusing to fire on civilians in the Niger delta. As they flee they bump into Fineboy, a slick character who fought with rebel groups Isoken, a 16-year-old girl whom they rescue from being raped by Fineboy and his fellow rebels and Oma, on the run from an abusive husband. Having found each other, this unlikely band of travellers sticks together through a series of adventures during which they sleep rough, squat in an apartment, imprison a corrupt minister, redistribute stolen money to schools, and eventually make a life for themselves in a beautifully spun yarn that I could not put down.Discovering these writers, new and old, who were hiding in plain sight has been a bit like coming across a new word – suddenly they pop up everywhere and you realise that somehow their presence never registered. With the year nearly up I feel much as I did after I gorged on books about Russia in my teens or the American south and the Harlem Renaissance in my 20s – I feel I need to see these places, particularly Nigeria and Uganda, that have been so vividly created for me. That’s why it intrigues me that, had I not embarked on this endeavour, I probably never would have read most of them. Wondering why that is, I’m reminded of what Maya Angelou the late African American writer said to me about her choice of romantic partners.“I could fall in love with a sumo wrestler if he told stories and made me laugh,” she said. “Obviously, it would be easier if someone was African American and lived next door and went to the same church. Because then I wouldn’t have to translate. But if I make the effort to learn the language and respect the mores then I should be able to get along anywhere and with any kind of people. I think I belong wherever human beings are.”Faced with an array of choices and limited time, when it comes to literature, there’s a part of me that I’m not particularly proud of that chooses not to make the effort, even when there is little to no translation necessary. Somewhere deep in my subconscious I must have decided that books by African women would be harder than those by some other demographics. They weren’t. On some level I must have had reading African women down as self-improving but not necessarily enjoyable, when in fact it was mostly the latter and often both.With my radar reset I can’t wait to see who I bump into at this year’s Christmas party.This article was amended on 15 December 2018 to correct the spelling of Makerere University"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/74e5672fc4da51ca1cfb76229b34d1c2b0e81faa/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=05f6670260460b4267a7bf702daa30ed","title":"what was your favourite book of 2018","story":"As part of the ’s 2018 in culture series we want to hear what you’ve been reading this yearIt has been a big year for books, from the spate of Trump-related exposes such as Bob Woodward’s Fear and Michael Wolff’s Fire and Fury, to star-name releases including JK Rowling’s The Crimes of Grindelwald (or her turn as Robert Galbraith in Lethal White), George RR Martin’s Fire and Blood and Michelle Obama’s memoir Becoming.When nominating their favourites of the year, our critics chose novels including Everything Under by Daisy Johnson, Normal People by Sally Rooney, and Jonathan Coe’s Middle England memoirs including Tara Westover’s Educated and Alan Garner’s Where Shall We Run To? political books including Isabel Hardman’s Why We Get the Wrong Politicians and Brit(ish) by Afua Hirsch and poetry collections including Tishani Doshi’s Girls Are Coming Out of the Woods and Vahni Capildeo’s Venus As a Bear.But what were your favourites?

Yes, replies Rachel Fletcher, chief executive of water regulator Ofwat, as I press her about the term “social contract”. The news is “out there” even if not “fully baked”, she says.Fletcher speaks deliberately, choosing her words with care in a slight Scottish burr. Water is “essential to life – not just another commodity,” she says. “It does not chime with people that the relationship between them and their water supplier is transactional.”The water industry is at an inflexion point, she insists. Gone are the days when loopholes would allow a company like Thames Water, under its previous owners, to load up with debt, financially engineer high returns and route the resulting idends through tax havens. The whole episode was a “wake-up call to the sector”, she says.Ofwat has closed those loopholes and she argues that the water industry – including other big private names such as Severn Trent, United Utilities and Anglian Water – is in the throes of a makeover. Most, but not all, of its chief executives no longer see their role as simply running water through pipes, conforming with the letter of regulation if not the spirit and aiming to maximise short-term profits.They “can and must play a broader role”, says Fletcher, and understand that they are part of a water system that must be curated as the foundational “natural capital” on which they depend, along with being integral parts of the communities they serve.“Social contract”, “natural capital”, “serving communities” – these are not concepts any regulator in the wake of the Thatcherite privatisations would have promoted. That was a world in which private was good, public bad and all regulation light-touch. Fletcher acknowledges that whatever immediate gains there were after privatisation – leakage rates fell, for example – regulators then took their eye off the ball. She wants to see the companies declare their business purpose in social-contract terms, putting the customer at the heart of what they do. An extraordinary 1.5 million people in aggregate were consulted one way or another – for example through youth panels, questionnaires and online forums – in the formulation of water companies’ business plans for 2020-25, which are now being reviewed. She calls for that clear purpose, reflecting the consumer interest, to be embedded in the companies’ culture and organisation.Fletcher adds: “There are pockets of really good stuff – on the environment, bonuses, delivering to customers and community.” But it is not yet reaching every corner of the industry, she says.It is obvious that each water company responding inidually makes no sense. Fletcher balks at going so far as creating a national water grid – at least for the moment. But there does need to be “a national framework” to ensure water can be moved to where it is needed – and the framework will depend on water companies accepting that preventing any part of the country suffering shortages is part of the social contract, just as much as keeping rivers clean or planting trees to ensure better run-off.What of their shareholders, about to see surpluses deployed in this way? They understand too, Fletcher says. But she accepts she “still has a job to do to align interests of owners with what we are proposing for customers”.She is not yet calling for water companies to write their purpose into their articles of association and establish themselves as public benefit companies (I declared an interest as co-chair of the Purposeful Company Taskforce, which advocates public benefit companies) rather, she wants a water company to hold itself to account as if it were one. Nor is she a promoter of stakeholder capitalism, although she recognises that everything she is pushing for comes under that label.Meanwhile, the Labour Party’s plan for industry nationalisation sits in the background: the problem, she acknowledges, is that while most consumers register high trust in their local company, that trust is not transferred to the sector was a whole. That is what has to change, and quickly.She is, though, a woman on a mission. Along with most people in the water industry, Fletcher claims she gets out of bed each morning to “make a difference”. Over the next five years we will see if she has succeeded."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9fa9c35101eddb2cab92b7b2c05d0e5715560e65/0_48_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b525b6066cf5ebf80dcb8b15e7286ac5","title":"sellafield thorp reprocessing uranium hazard cleanup","story":"Deep in the heart of Sellafield, Britain’s biggest nuclear waste site, a small piece of history is playing out. Technicians are about to use a huge amount of force to slice nuclear fuel into thin sheets, so that it can be dissolved in nitric acid, then chemically separated into uranium (for power stations), plutonium (for bombs) and highly radioactive waste.But first they face a computer-says-no moment. Taut minutes pass as on-screen red boxes indicate issues with the shearing machine, which is safely ensconced behind a metre of leaded glass. Finally, the boxes turn green.“Go for it,” says the operator, at which there’s a loud clanking, a white flash on a fuzzy video screen and smiles from staff crowded around.This is the final shear at Sellafield’s thermal oxide reprocessing plant (Thorp), which has halted operations after 24 years it has spent reprocessing more than 9,000 tonnes of fuel from nuclear plants in the UK, Germany and Japan.The facility – which in 2005 experienced one of Sellafield’s worst radioactive leaks – was built in an era of fears over uranium scarcity. Today, however, there is more than enough uranium globally to meet projected demand, so reprocessing no longer makes economic sense.It is an emotional milestone for Thorp’s 450-plus staff, who are facing new, sometimes less prestigious roles, engaged in either winding up the plant or working on decommissioning of the wider site.The scene also marks the start of the endgame for Sellafield, as its focus shifts to a decades-long mission of storing civil and military nuclear waste and gradually cleaning up the 700-hectare site.The site, known to be he most hazardous industrial facility in Europe, dates back to the dawn of the nuclear age. This is where British scientists rushed to develop nuclear weapons during the cold war. The opening here of the world’s first nuclear power station in 1956 was billed as the start of a “new atomic age”.Sellafield sits near Whitehaven on the West Cumbrian coast, cleaved in two by the river Calder. It is extremely congested – to the extent that more and more car parks are being shifted off-site to make space – and has no scope for expansion.Insiders often reach for the metaphor of 3D chess to describe the challenge of removing old and often contaminated infrastructure while building modern facilities to house waste the government hopes will one day be buried deep underground.With 11,000 workers, Sellafield is like a town, with a laundry, hospital, restaurants and its own armed police to protect the stockpile of plutonium, the biggest in the world. The facility eats up two-thirds of the UK’s annual £3bn nuclear clean-up spending.It was outsourced in recent years to a US-led consortium, whose performance was sharply criticised. Management has since returned to the public sector under the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority, but that has not stemmed criticism from MPs, who complained in October that Sellafield was nearly £1bn over budget and years behind on projects. The public accounts committee found signs of progress, however, and some are evident.A building called “B30” is considered the most hazardous on the site – and by extension the most hazardous in Europe. It houses a concrete-walled pond open to the elements, and beneath its waters lie skips of waste fuel, dumped in haste half a century ago, and an unknown amount of radioactive sludge.Photographs leaked four years ago showed how degraded the building, one of four such ponds, now was. There had been no plans to remove that waste for decades – but it has now started unexpectedly early, aided by remotely operated underwater vehicles – though these are contaminated in the process and become nuclear waste themselves.The Observer witnessed only the second-ever batch being removed from B30, with a tractor allowed through a gate in the barbed wire-topped three-metre-high fence. Its load was a desk-sized metal box encasing a decades-old skip, probably filled with intermediate- or low-level waste. The hazardous cargo was trundled off to a modern shed, to be dealt with later.Elsewhere in this oldest corner of the site – which resembles a rundown industrial estate – is a US grain-style silo filled with nuclear waste. Huge metal doors have been fitted in its side to allow material to be mechanically removed – but retrieval work is not expected to start until next year.Just metres away, a crane is bringing down an old tower, and workers are using a diamond saw to remove a seven-tonne block of concrete from the top of the building. David Peattie, the NDA’s chief executive, said: “The skyline is changing.”The role the facility plays here in Cumbria is changing, too. With the recent collapse of plans to build a new nuclear power station in the field next door, Sellafield is a vital source of decent, high-paying jobs for the area. One anecdote shared – perhaps apocryphal – is of a local lawyer taking a job in the Sellafield laundry because it was better paid.Tony Lywood, Labour’s prospective parliamentary candidate for Copeland, said even with no job losses, the end of reprocessing was a “disaster” for the area because of the changing nature of the work. He also opposes plans to see more future jobs in the private sector supply chain.But Jamie Reed, a former Labour MP who quit two years ago to become head of community relations at Sellafield, said: “Our people have been brilliant. They understand Sellafield is changing. The mission is now clean-up.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6d1541f841eed8ce45d0516da9aca9c8af1641c1/0_30_1280_767/master/1280.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7fb6f69347238a1fd78ffaf2b1e00b47","title":"is dominic west the authentic voice of a working class hero","story":"Casting a Yorkshireman as Valjean in Les Misérables raises thorny issuesThe dilemma is easy to understand: how to convey the class isions of 19th-century French society in an English-language adaptation of Les Misérables made for a modern British audience? Dominic West, who plays Valjean in the BBC’s starry new version, an apt choice of Christmas blockbuster that should play right into the current festive mood, opted for a Yorkshire accent to convey the character’s poor roots.“In Britain, there are class isions that we perceive on the basis of accents,” explained director Tom Shankland. “So the simplest rule that we found was really to nod towards those rules that we have in our own ided society, but without ever leaning into them very heavily.”In a prickle of northern defensiveness, I first read this as, simply, “northern  peasant”, then recited my vows to say “bath” and “bus” and not “barth” and “bas” until my dying day, as I stroked my whippet. Not this cliche again, which ascribes salt-of-the-earth decency by way of flat vowels and assumes that everybody north of Peterborough eats only barm cakes smeared with dripping.Plenty of northerners in the public eye have spoken about how the way they talk pigeonholes them. Maxine Peake says she was asked how she could possibly play an educated barrister in Silk presenter Steph McGovern has said she believed “posh” women were paid more than her Vanity Fair’s Olivia Cooke, from Oldham, put it succinctly when she said that casting directors hear her and think: “If she sounds like that, make her Maid Number Two.”West has spoken about shedding his accent – he was born in Sheffield – first at Eton, then at drama school. “We all had to learn RP, because we were told we’d get more jobs, and it’s true,” he told the , in 2012, while promoting My Fair Lady, a class fable built on learning “proper English” to pass in high society.Naturally, then, I bristled, even though my accent has been softened by two decades of living in the south, much like my ability to go out at night between September and June without wearing a coat. Still, this is Les Misérables. It’s about rich people and poor people and the only northern accent I could spot in the trailer is Valjean’s, with plenty of southern saltiness, too. I wonder if this minor hoo-ha says more about our continuing lack of comfort when it comes to talking about class (and how it changes how we’re perceived) than it does about whether Valjean grew up going on Sunday drives to the Peak District or not.It’s the most wonderful time of the year for mulling in-depth interpretations of potentially creepy lyrical content, as the debate around whether Baby It’s Cold Outside is suitable for the airwaves has its annual airing (I like the argument that the woman is defying what’s expected of her, given the era’s social norms, by being coy about leaving).It is a strange moment, then, to feel a bit sorry for Robin Thicke, whose career was blown up by “I know you want it you’re a good girl” pick-up track and problematic banger Blurred Lines. A court has given its ruling on the copyright case against Blurred Lines, brought by the family of Marvin Gaye, who argued that it copied Gaye’s 1977 single Got to Give it up.Other legal experts have argued that due to the specific complexities of this case, it is unlikely to change much in a technical sense, but what it has introduced is an abundance of caution, which feels like something of a death knell. Every person I know who writes or makes or creates something is inspired by what went before them. To make that something to fear, rather than celebrate, is a bleak state of affairs.The BBC has announced its long list of new artists to watch out for in 2019, a quite amazing roster of established acts who are known enough to have hundreds of millions of Spotify plays, performed at American awards ceremonies and been on Jools Holland’s show.It is fitting that, in the spirit of looking for hot sounds that might actually break a fresh artist into the mainstream, it turns out that one of my most-played tracks of the last year was released in 1967. My finger is on the pulse. Or at least, a pulse. A very old one.I have played Nancy Wilson’s version of Bobbie Gentry’s Ode to Billie Joe until I think I’m sick of it and then played it some more. It is one of the best covers of all time. It takes the original exemplar of slender storytelling and turns it into a string-soaked soul masterpiece.I have loved Ode to Billie Joe since I very first heard it, but discovering Wilson’s astonishing cover led me to discovering Wilson herself.She died on Thursday, at the age of 81, having released more than 70 albums over the course of her lifetime. What a treat it is to have them all to work through."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d29993bd5386fa1c5d486b286954b706308c0999/458_606_3424_2055/master/3424.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2a92df1dbca24b939bce6a1920ffa534","title":"observer view of the baleful distraction of brexit","story":"Every shred of political energy is being tied up in Brexit, with detrimental effects on a nation facing other urgent challengesBrexit has paralysed British politics: it has left the government utterly incapacitated, ministers warring and both main parties riven by splits. It is absorbing every shred of political energy in the words of one official, it has wiped the policy grid clean. Yet in every nook and cranny of the state – from understaffed hospitals to the schools sending parents begging letters for financial support – there are problems that demand urgent focus and resource. We also face huge social challenges that require action now, from how to care for an ageing society to how to prepare for the impact of technology on the world of work. All this is going ignored, with detrimental effects on people’s lives.There is a grim paradox at the heart of Brexit. The vote for Britain to leave the EU was partly fuelled by the sense among many voters that there are increasingly two Britains: a thriving capital barely touched by recession and boarded-up high streets outside the south-east. This has been a long project in the making, driven by decades of deindustrialisation and uneven economic growth that have contributed to some of the biggest regional inequalities in western Europe. Yet Brexit is going to make it far harder to respond to this gap, which has only got wider since the financial crisis.Of course, not all that’s transpired since June 2016 can be laid at the door of Brexit. Deliberate political choices made since 2010 at first contributed to the economic dissatisfaction that paved the way for the vote and since then have made it worse. Even as Conservative chancellors delivered expensive tax cuts to the overwhelming benefit of more affluent households, the pain of the spending cuts has been borne by low-income families with children, with child poverty forecast to hit record levels by 2022. From hospitals to schools to policing, public services have been forced to cut back in ways that have hurt people’s lives. Instead of borrowing to invest in the infrastructure that could have kickstarted regional economies, ministers used the financial crisis as an excuse to spend less.But there is barely any political capacity to respond to the consequences of eight years of austerity. In an unprecedented intervention, a group of cross-party select committee chairs has expressed grave concerns in the Observer today about the detrimental effect the Brexit negotiations are having on the domestic policy agenda.This is evident across huge swaths of domestic policy. The combination of the housing crisis and a fraying welfare state means too many people can no longer afford their rent, let alone get on the housing ladder. The rollout of universal credit, with people facing delays of weeks until they get their first payment, has pushed families into rent arrears and forced them to rely on foodbanks. The most visible sign of something deeply awry is the growing number of rough sleepers on Britain’s streets, but there are hundreds of thousands more who are homeless out of sight. Tackling homelessness would require building more social housing, reforming universal credit and undoing the benefit cuts of the past eight years, but there appears little appetite from government for any of this.Councils have had their central government grants slashed by almost half since 2010, most affecting poorer areas with lower levels of council tax and business rates revenue. This has hit services for vulnerable children: as we report today, the Local Government Association predicts a £1.6bn funding gap in services for children with special educational needs and disabilities by 2020-21. And fewer older people are getting financial help with their care costs, leaving 1.4 million without the support they need to carry out tasks such as washing and eating. Yet the government has once again delayed publishing its proposals for reforming social care funding.The number of police officers on the streets of England and Wales is at its lowest level since the 1980s, despite recent increases in violent crime. Delays have beset big transport infrastructure projects such as HS2 and Crossrail, while commuters across the country have suffered as a result of botched timetable changes.In 2016, Brexit was disingenuously sold by rightwing Eurosceptics as a solution to the very problems that the government’s austerity drive had compounded – stretched public services, ailing local economies and a lack of good jobs. It is not only a major distraction from finding answers to those problems: the economic pain it inflicts will make them worse. There are no Brexit-shaped shortcuts to better hospitals and schools, a kinder welfare state, more well-paid jobs and flourishing town centres. But they are things people rightly want and expect and the government must find a way to deliver them."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c625856914e0af959b88913fafb9db89889e3045/0_60_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6617fbe47b97603c2161727721904711","title":"week in patriarchy facebook parenting advertising","story":"Facebook’s tone-deaf response to a woman who continued to be bombarded by parenting ads after her son was stillborn highlights big tech’s bro-gramming problemThe Week in Patriarchy is a weekly roundup of what’s happening in the world of feminism and sexism. If you’re not already receiving it by email, make sure to subscribe.Silicon Valley has a woman problem. The tech industry is notorious for its gender disparity and despite lots of talk about “ersity”, companies like Google and Facebook have made little progress in stamping out gender bias, nor in recruiting and retaining more female engineers.This affects all of us every single day. When the algorithms that govern increasingly large parts of our lives have been designed almost exclusively by young bro-grammers with homogeneous experiences and worldviews, those algorithms are going to fail significant sections of society.A heartbreaking example of this is Gillian Brockell’s experience of continuing to get targeted by pregnancy-related ads on Facebook after the stillbirth of her son. Brockell, a Washington Post journalist, recently made headlines when she tweeted an open letter to big tech companies, imploring them to think more carefully about how they target parenting ads.“Please, Tech Companies,” she wrote. “If you’re smart enough to realize that I’m pregnant, that I’ve given birth, then surely you’re smart enough to realize that my baby died, and can advertise to me accordingly, or maybe, just maybe, not at all.”After Brockell’s letter went viral, Facebook’s vice-president of advertising, Rob Goldman, apologized to Brockell on Twitter. He also patronizingly pointed out that she could have avoided the situation if only she’d taken the time to navigate Facebook’s ever-changing settings and tweaked her ad preferences. “We have a setting available that can block ads about some topics people may find painful – including parenting,” he explained. Brockell, it should be noted, did go on to block parenting ads … and immediately started getting ads from adoption agencies. (“And no, I have not been googling about adoption,” she tweeted. “I am miles away from anything but grieving.”)Goldman’s interactions with Brockell on Twitter make clear he sees her painful experience as the sad result of an isolated “bug”. “I would like to debug how this ad was shown,” he told her, “so we can improve the way this control works.” But, of course, it’s not an isolated bug or flawed algorithm that is responsible: it’s Silicon Valley’s ethics-free, male-centric culture.It doesn’t matter how sophisticated your algorithms are, when you treat pregnancy as an advertising event, an opportunity to be monetized, you will get situations like this. When your engineers consist largely of twentysomething dudes, you will get situations like this. When you think about your users as data-points rather than thinking, feeling, complex human beings, you will get situations like this. Facebook is always going on about connecting people bringing people closer together. But as Brockell’s experience makes abundantly clear, it seems to have very little understanding of people at all.A government investigation has found that at least nine Japanese medical schools manipulated exam results in favour of male candidates. Juntendo University said that they did this for purely benevolent reasons. “Women mature faster mentally than men, and their communication ability is also higher by the time they take the university exam,” the dean told reporters. “In some ways, this was a measure to help male applicants.” Ah, that’s OK then.Jacob Walter Anderson, a former fraternity president at Baylor University accused of rape, will not face any jail time after accepting a plea deal. Anderson, who was charged with four counts of sexual assault, after a 19-year-old student accused him of assaulting her at a fraternity party, will have to pay a $400 fine and go to counselling. His light sentence has provoked outrage, and sparked renewed conversation about how difficult it is to prosecute sexual assault cases.Movies with a female lead perform better at the box office than those lacking the xx factor, according to a new study by Creative Artists Agency’s digital strategy firm, shift7.

I was taken to see them at the British Museum by my white, British mother, who felt it important that her half-Nigerian children learned about the artistic achievements of their forefathers. I’ve been entranced by them ever since.The Benin bronzes have always been famous, partly because the works themselves are so exquisite and partly because their backstory is so brutal. The bronzes were not “acquired” – they were looted, taken from the royal palace of Benin during a “punitive expedition” of 1897 that also destroyed the palace and much of the ancient city. The bronzes – 4,500 plaques and statues that are in fact made from a brass alloy – were later auctioned off by the Admiralty to defray the costs of this punitive expedition. These are the ugly facts. This is the history that Britain and Nigeria share. And since Nigerian independence in 1960 there have been constant demands for the return of the Benin bronzes. For almost 60 years, there was impasse.Then, in October, came a breakthrough. The Benin Dialogue Group announced it had brokered an agreement that will see “some of the most iconic” of the bronzes returned to Benin City, Nigeria, where they will be housed in the soon-to-be-built Benin Royal Museum. The agreement is being touted as a blueprint that might be applied to other cases of looted treasures.With this announcement and the publication of a report commissioned by the French president, Emmanuel Macron, which points the way to the return of many objects from French institutions, the route map towards a new relationship between western museums and the non-European nations seems to be emerging.For many, myself included, offering African nations their own art treasures on long-term loans is not enough. The issue of ownership is yet to be addressed. But the Rubicon has been crossed and in 2021 some of the plaques and statues that once lined the walls of the royal palace will return to their homeland.But in some quarters, this breakthrough has been angrily characterised as a capitulation, and I now find myself a target in this counterattack. It has been suggested this past week that my publicly expressed view that the Benin bronzes should be returned to Nigeria is – somehow – incompatible with my role as a trustee of English Heritage. As arguments go, it’s a bit of a stretch. English Heritage has no links to the Benin bronzes and no say in whether they remain in London or make the journey to Benin City.If I were a trustee of the British Museum, things would be different. But I’m not, so I am struggling to connect the dots in this line of attack. And there is a reason for that: such criticisms tend to lack intellectual cohesion because they are not designed to operate within a rational contest of ideas. Their function is to silence black people.During the French Revolution, the population was ided into two groups. Active citizens, who were given limited voting rights, and passive citizens – women, the poor and former slaves – who were denied the vote. The constant drumbeat of criticism and insinuation levelled against black people in the public eye (and in this target-rich environment I am a very small fish) is designed to corral us into a new form of passive citizenry.When the Daily Mail demands that the journalist Afua Hirsch show “gratitude” to Britain, what it is really saying is that as a black British woman she has no right to condemn British racism or express views on British history. No matter that you’re a British citizen, no matter that you were born here – your skin colour means you do not have the same rights as others to express critical opinions about your own country. When Twitter trolls tell David Lammy to “go back to Africa”, they are pushing the same line – that black people, even those elected to parliament, have no place in debates about this country, its present policies or past wrongdoings.Black people are expected to be passive citizens, good immigrants, mute and grateful. And, as the constantly repeated argument goes: “If you don’t like it, why don’t you go back to your own country?”It arguably gets a little more complicated if, as well as being a member of a “visible minority”, you are also an immigrant. I struggle to understand why it is deemed surprising (never mind newsworthy) that, as somebody born in Nigeria who retains Nigerian citizenship, I should favour the return of Nigeria’s greatest artistic treasure to Nigeria. If this comes as a shock, I hate to think how my critics are going to cope when they find out about the pope’s religious affiliations or learn of the habits of bears that live in the woods.Britain today is not revolutionary France. There are no grades of citizenship. An immigrant who has just shaken hands at the end of their citizenship ceremony is as British as a member of the oldest family in the land. To speak of equal rights is meaningless so long as black people exercising those rights are told to sit at the back and be quiet.As a half-British, half-Nigerian historian, my desire to see some of the Benin bronzes housed in a new museum opposite the palace from which they were looted in 1897 is something I care passionately about. But I feel no more or less passionate about my desire to see Britain’s greatest art and heritage protected. I am entirely comfortable with this duality. Others, clearly, are not. But then, as a “citizen of nowhere”, am I supposed to feel affiliation to no nation rather than two?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3308a3dec039cccd07d924891718c8a116cff741/0_78_4831_2900/master/4831.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0a3b1c47493e9b57e851010e65ef54c4","title":"un climate change talks postpone contentious issues with draft agreement","story":"Struggles remain on enacting 2015 Paris accord despite more clarity on emissionsThe UN met on Saturday in Poland to discuss a draft agreement on climate change, which sources said was likely to pass, as exhausted delegates made compromises on some key issues but left other contentious problems to be resolved next year.The result will not be the breakthrough campaigners and some countries were hoping for, but will keep discussions alive on formulating key aspects of the implementation rules for the 2015 Paris accord.Delegates have been thrashing out a text on the complex mechanisms required to put the Paris goals into effect for the past two weeks, and appeared partly successful as the talks overran their Friday deadline and looked likely to continue into late afternoon on Saturday at least.The text will give countries clarity on key points such as accounting for their greenhouse gas emissions and recording their carbon reductions. They will also go some way to encourage the stepping up of each country’s climate change efforts.Among the issues holding up progress is the highly technical question of what should happen to the market for carbon credits, held by some countries in recognition of their emissions-cutting efforts and their carbon sinks, such as forests.These credits count toward countries’ emissions-cutting targets. Brazil introduced wording that would benefit the country for its huge rainforest cover, but critics said contained loopholes that allowed for double counting of carbon credits would severely undermine the integrity of the system.That question is unlikely to be resolved in the time remaining, but gave an indication of Brazil’s likely stance in future talks. Next year’s conference was supposed to be held in Brazil, but will take place in Chile because Brazil’s incoming president, Jair Bolsonaro, withdrew the offer to host.Brazil has been a reliable supporter of the annual talks in the past and has worked to broker deals between the developed and developing world. Without that support in future, the talks are only likely to grow more fractious.The US, Russia, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait have also played a disruptive role, watering down a resolution that would have welcomed the recent IPCC report that a temperature rise of 1.5C would have dire consequences.The compromise in the redrafted text would have all countries “welcome the timely completion” of the IPCC report, but campaigners pointed out that this was weak because it refers merely to the timing of the report rather than its content. The EU, by contrast, and several other developed countries joined with scores of developing nations in announcing they would focus on preventing a 1.5C rise in their carbon-cutting efforts.There were few new offers from the rich world of financing for developing countries to help them cut emissions and adapt to the effects of climate change, another issue that has been pushed to future talks.As the last-minute negotiations wore on, delegates were saddened to hear of the death overnight of the veteran Philippine negotiator, Bernaditas de Castro Muller, who was a notable presence at the talks for nearly three decades. Tributes came from many who admired her forthright style."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bd867c65af95a5b2133a87b6a7f53df5c88e33dd/433_363_2286_1372/master/2286.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e0e8b44557ffdb2e2b618c35e84a2d60","title":"the week in wildlife in pictures","story":"Bird battles, snoozing seals and mischievous macaques in this week’s gallery"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/adaf91a4f7b231d7080af7ecf6ac3d79ec3fe19f/0_121_960_576/master/960.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9f1c79365ec64e9810f3cce6c80c99d0","title":"prada new york blackface pradamalia","story":"Luxury firm says it ‘never had the intention of offending anyone and we abhor all forms of racism and racist imagery’Prada has apologized after some of its products displayed at a store in New York appeared to contain blackface imagery.The products, part of a line of goods called Pradamalia, were pulled after they prompted outrage and accusations that they depicted racist caricatures of black people.Prada said in a statement that it had not intended the products – some of which seemed to resemble black monkeys with outsized red lips – to have any reference to the real world or blackface imagery.“The Pradamalia are fantasy charms composed of elements of the Prada oeuvre.

In my prime, I could eat upwards of 10 Carr’s table water biscuits slathered in Boursin after seconds of turkey pie and an inordinate amount of chocolate mould dessert.But as a grownup – and as someone who gets more excited over the possibilities contained within the leftovers than the initial purpose of an ingredient – the garlicky cheese with the chant-inducing advert has come to represent versatility as well as comforting familiarity. I’ve long been stirring Boursin through fettuccine with lemon-roasted broccoli, or dolloping spoonfuls on top of slow-roasted red peppers, tomato and fennel. I’ve whisked it with milk to make the sauce for potato dauphinois, combined with soured cream, red onions and prawns, and even spread it on stale sourdough, scattered with pancetta and baked with whisked eggs to make a savoury bread and butter pudding. As an ingredient, it is undeniably simple yet effective, saving the lives of many a withered fridge companion. However, my favourite use is a relatively recent discovery, from a French friend: a roast chicken recipe – with a twist.Requiring only three ingredients: Boursin, lemon and the chicken itself. One Boursin is stuffed into the bird’s cavity with half a lemon, and a second is smeared underneath and over the top of the skin. And that’s it. The result is a creamy, flavoursome and perfectly textured meat that the carver will undoubtedly be standing over and picking at long before it reaches the table.Since learning of this dish a few years back, I’ve found that it’s the perfect recipe for those mellow days between Christmas and the new year, when families are still gathered, but the enthusiasm for spending hours in the kitchen to create a celebratory spread for those around you has dissipated to eating cold stuffing and cranberry sauce from the fridge on the sofa. This roast chicken requires no more than five minutes of preparation, a chopping board and a roasting tin. But the best thing about this recipe? It perfectly balances familiarity and nostalgia with indulgence – and that’s exactly what the festivities are all about.1 free-range organic chicken2 x 150g Boursin½ lemonSalt and ground black pepper1 bunch purple sprouting broccoli, ends trimmed25g butterZest of 1 lemonRoast or mashed potatoes, to servePreheat your oven to 180Cgas mark 4.Remove the string from the chicken and stuff one of the Boursin into the cavity along with the lemon half.

Inside the development kitchens at top supermarketsIf you thought cooking Christmas lunch for a dozen family members was stressful, imagine trying to create festive dishes for 12 million diners, all with their own peculiar tastes and budgets, and all willing to walk across the road if they don’t like what’s offered to them.The British supermarket industry, competitive to a cut-throat degree at the best of times, treats the festive season as a key battleground. “Christmas is so important for supermarkets, financially and for their morale,” says Fraser McKevitt, head of retail and consumer insight at Kantar Worldpanel, a market research firm. McKevitt’s team has been tracking how Aldi and Lidl, the Germany-based discounters, have been breathing down the necks of the big four – Tesco, Sainsbury’s, Asda and Morrisons – along with Marks \u0026amp Spencer and Waitrose. All are under pressure, but Christmas presents a golden opportunity for the legacy supermarkets to fight back. Kantar calculates that households spent on average £129.47 at a supermarket in the week before Christmas last year, compared with £79.66 in a normal week.The biggest weapon in the Christmas battle is new product development. Any of the supermarkets can cut prices on a tin of Quality Street or a bottle of champagne but to really get customers to spend, they need to prove “differentiation” through their own-label, premium dishes. These are developed by in-house kitchens and innovation centres.Here, the men and women who spend months trying to work out what you want to eat alongside your turkey, or at a Boxing Day buffet, share the secrets of their test kitchen.Most supermarket development chefs start working on Christmas 18 months before the big day. Jonathan Moore says some of his ideas began six years before products hit the shelf. He spends a lot of his time eating in restaurants – “It’s not eating out. I go to taste stuff. There’s a big difference,” he insists – as well as visiting food conferences to pick up ideas. He remembers attending StarChefs in 2012, an annual international chefs’ conference in New York. “Loads of cool mixologists were there, and they were burning rosemary, burning orange zest. It was a ‘doink’ moment,” he says bitter, particularly bitter orange, has become a key flavour in a lot of Waitrose’s Christmas dishes this year.The bitter trend first went mainstream in cocktails, as Aperol spritz and negronis became popular a few years ago. “Then brassicas and kale start appearing everywhere. So you go, bitter, kale, health, and you have this perfect storm when you think: we need to start developing stuff around this.” This year, the supermarket has used bitter orange in savoury Christmas dishes such as venison haunch with bitter orange and juniper, and chantenay carrots with bitter orange and juniper glaze, as well as sweet products: a dark chocolate and orange stollen wreath.Moore, 58, started out as a hotel chef and won a Michelin star in the mid-80s working at Les Semailles, Bristol. He now works in Waitrose’s £1.5m innovation centre, which opened this summer at the supermarket’s sprawling head office in Bracknell, Berkshire. The kitchen includes six workstations (one for every chef in his team), all with a sous vide machine there are smokers, indoor barbecues, blow torches and walk-in fridges.He is in charge of all Waitrose’s own-brand food, as well as the Heston Blumenthal range, which is developed in collaboration with a team from Blumenthal’s Fat Duck restaurant. Waitrose has never managed to replicate the extraordinary success of Heston’s hidden orange Christmas pudding, launched in 2010 the £13 puddings changed hands for £250 on eBay after the supermarket ran out. He is hopeful that Heston’s “profiter’coals”, black profiteroles filled with an orange crème pâtissière and finished with popping candy and an orange caramel sauce, will be more successful than 2016’s attempt: a banana bacon trifle. “At Christmas, a lot of people want to trade up and try something a little bit different. I think the bacon trifle was a stretch too far.”“Food has become fashion. What is the next little black dress?” Moore asks, comparing Waitrose to Zara, a company interpreting the catwalk or, in his case, restaurants and street-food trends for the discerning mass market. “Some of our lines, even if they are hugely successful, will have a two-year life cycle.”Mark Richmond, head innovation and development chef, AsdaWensleydale cheese with salted caramel, a super-sized gingerbread man encasing a chocolate mousse, a foot-long pig-in-blanket – a lot of the Christmas food at Asda can be a bit self-consciously wacky.Head chef Mark Richmond explains the big pig-in-blanket (retailing at £5): “It’s a great talking point at the family table, it’s showstopping, it’s fun. And Christmas,” he pauses and smiles, “is fun. From a marketing perspective, this is a great product. It’s interesting for consumers, and it fits into our trend about sharing.” Many dishes are developed with an eye on how they will play on social media. Asda’s marketing team has calculated that the pig-in-blanket reached the news feeds of 1.14 million people by the second week of November as a result, it has ordered 10,000 more in time for Christmas.The quirky food created by Richmond, 42, in the development kitchen at Asda’s head office in the centre of Leeds, is rooted in months of trend analysis undertaken by his boss, Jo Johnson. As the head of innovation, she commissions reports from most of the big trend agencies and market research companies. She shows me a graph produced in the summer of 2017, which helped shape this year’s products. It’s a series of pictures and buzzwords along a curve. At one end is “mainstream” – gold, Nordic, premiumisation in the middle is “gaining momentum” – unicorns, sharing, Christmas brunch, lowno alcohol at the far end is “emergent” – plant-based, pink, rum, sustainability.Asda has seen its turnover and profits hit by the relentless march of the discounters Aldi and Lidl, so its products need to be competitively priced. Richmond says he often gets thwarted by Asda’s buying teams, who want to keep costs low: “From a development perspective, it can be very difficult when it comes to price. What you’ve got to do is work with expensive ingredients and try to dilute cost in other ways.” Plans for a rhubarb gin mince pie this year, which were “bang on trend”, were ditched after Asda could not “make it stack up commercially with a supplier”, says Johnson.But Richmond has managed to create a number of products that hit the “premiumisation” trend, including a sheep’s milk cheese (similar to a manchego) with truffle flecked through it. Supermarkets now have to appeal to all shoppers, regardless of budget, in the increasingly fickle retail world, he says. “People are shopping about more. Our core customers used to be ‘Asda mums’. Now we’re saying that anyone is an Asda customer.”There is a mock sitting room at Tesco HQ, complete with sofas and a TV. It’s where consumers come to taste food “and feel relaxed”, says Kate Ewart, product development director at Tesco. “We video it all,” she says, pointing to discreet cameras. “So we can listen in on focus groups without intruding. We want them to feel comfortable.”She adds: “We have a trained panel who can describe textures and flavours. If I am looking for the most succulent turkey, they will taste until we get the right recipe, the right brine. We screen them every year to ensure they have the right taste buds.” Ewart, 48, who has been at Tesco for 18 years, is a food technologist by training. She leads a team of 50 food developers and four chefs to create Tesco’s food range, and signs off all Christmas products. “The exec chefs come up with great ideas, but not necessarily with the inidual products. Their job is to excite our developers, who will then brief suppliers as to the kind of things we’re looking for. And then suppliers submit ideas. I coordinate it all.”Tesco is still the UK’s biggest supermarket, with 18m households shopping there at least once a month. It segments customers into six broad types, invented and named by its insights team, including young “Roshini”, who likes yoga, and “Carol”, who suffered heart failure five years ago and is on a tight budget. Ewart says she wants to ensure that Tesco has Christmas products for all those demographics.One of its “showstopper” desserts is a £5 frozen black forest meringue wreath, which Ewart says is aimed at the likes of “Roshini, who Instagrams everything,” adding: “Everybody wants to be able to say, ‘My dinner is better than your dinner’, so they want it to look amazing. It has to be table presentable. Ten years ago, I don’t think we would have had a meringue wreath. But having more variety and visual display – that’s what it is really playing to.” Black forest gateau has been particularly embraced by Tesco this year, which has woven it through a dozen dishes, including savoury ones such as venison with a morello cherry glaze. The volume of black forest dishes is deliberate, says Ewart. “If you go into a restaurant and you have the tasting menu, everything complements each other. That’s what we’re trying to do: different tastes that come together.”Jon Jones, development and innovation chef, Marks \u0026amp SpencerFor Jon Jones, it really is Christmas every day. “I am always thinking about Christmas. You could see a bit of packaging and you think, ‘Oh God, that would be a brilliant platter.’”Jones, 31, who joined the company from Waitrose four years ago, says Christmas party food has become increasingly important as consumers entertain more frequently than they used to. It also gives him licence to be creative. “You can think outside the box in a way you can’t with the main meal,” he says, adding: “Party food tends to be brown and a bit greasy. So, you need some classics, but also some quirky products that people pick up and say, ‘That’s really clever.’”In M\u0026ampS’s development kitchen at the company’s HQ in London, he has worked on mini vegan burgers, sticky Asian-style chicken lollipops, and spicy pulled-pork tacos. “It’s not that Christmassy,” he admits, “but there’s only so many Christmassy things you can do.” The tacos tap into the Mexican street-food trend at £7 for 10, they are not cheap, but those shopping at M\u0026ampS at Christmas have larger budgets than average. Jones highlights its Belgian chocolate and cherry dessert. “We realised we had a very, very successful £20 price point dessert last year – the white chocolate wreath – so we wanted to do something with a similar ‘wow’. This has more layers, more textures. Yes, £20 is punchy. But it serves 10, so it’s £2 a portion.” The dish, inspired by a trip that Jones and his team took to Paris last year, is served in a rectangle shape with an intricate holly and berry pattern on top, using a mould M\u0026ampS commissioned from its supplier. “This guarantees it will be unique. It’s Christmas: you want to bring it out and put it on the table and for people to go, ‘Wow, how did they do that?’ We’re always striving towards the ‘wow’.”Last Christmas wasn’t the best for Richard Jones. “Our mince pies didn’t deliver great results,” he says, in the Morrisons “taste and test” kitchen in Bradford. “Sales were OK, but they didn’t feature very well in taste tests.” In a Which? magazine test, the mince pies came 11th out of 11, with the review saying the pastry was “cloying” and the mincemeat lacking spice.Morrisons, with 12 million weekly customers, may be No 4 of the big four supermarkets, but it sells more than 5m boxes of mince pies over Christmas a product its customers particularly care about. “Our core customer is a little bit older, very traditional in what they like. We have to get the traditional products absolutely right. We can play with a little bit of creativity, but our customers don’t want us to go too far.” Part of the company’s challenge is to persuade shoppers, more likely to cook from scratch, to trade up from basic turkey, trimmings and veg to better ingredients.Unusually for a supermarket, Morrisons owns a lot of its own manufacturing sites, including three abattoirs and a prepared produce factory in Worsley, Greater Manchester. “Some customers will do everything from scratch and that’s great, but increasingly they want help,” says the 49-year-old. He points to the growth in cook-at-home meal kits, which have influenced Morrisons’ Christmas veg dishes, such as heritage carrots with cranberry and orange butter, made in the Worsley factory. “We prepare it to a certain point, but the customer can finish it off with a glaze or a butter.”Ultimately, Jones’s job is to ensure the basics are done well, not least this year’s mince pies. After the poor reviews last year, “We took the pastry apart, we took the mince apart, then we looked at the design on top, how much dusting do you want, the packaging, everything. We had to make improvements.”His assistant chef, Jon Coates, chips in. “Christmas is not the time to take risks. It’s high pressure – the poshest Sunday lunch any of us do. Do you really want to have flavours you don’t know? You don’t want people to pick something up and say: ‘What the hell is yuzu?’”“A lot of what we do is blue-sky stuff,” says Nicola Bramley, explaining how she comes up with four “fashion flavours” that will dominate her Christmas range of food. “It’s reading restaurant menus, visiting food shows and events, buying all the food magazines, cookbooks, going on food trawls, walk around food markets, and premium retailers like Harrods and Selfridges.”Her small office, across the corridor from the main test kitchen at the Sainsbury’s head office in London, is crammed with cookbooks, recipes torn from magazines, trend charts, restaurant menus and mood boards. The 35-year-old writes a “direction presentation” for the development team a year before products hit the shelves. This year’s four flavours are mulled pears, pomegranate fizz, caramelised chestnut, and gin botanicals: all on-trend, and all suitable for both sweet and savoury food.Bramley does regular exercise most days, to burn off all the calories consumed as part of her job: “Sometimes you can do four or five restaurants in a day. You try to be restrained, but that never works you end up eating everything on the menu,” she says. “I exercise for nearly three hours a day – I cycle to work, then I go to the gym. And yoga after work every few days.”Not all her ideas end up on shelves or sold in the way they were originally conceived. “We development chefs are briefed not to worry about commercial considerations or manufacturing capabilities. It’s what’s going to look great, the amazing next thing. It’s then up to the product developer, buyer and technologist to work with the supplier to get as close to that as possible.” Inevitably, costs come into play a £7 jewelled squash and red pepper vegan pilaf, using the pomegranate fizz flavour, was originally designed to be sold in a wreath, a popular shape this year. “It changed, because, do we really want to invest £20,000 in a new mould?” It is now sold in an ordinary dish. “It’s vegan, which is very on-trend, and a bit Middle Eastern, so I think it will do well.”Sometimes technical issues cause a recipe to be changed. Bramley created – as party food – some duck bonbons with a sloe-gin sauce hidden in the centre. “They changed, because the supplier couldn’t quite get the quality of shred on the duck. They then tried with minced duck, which wasn’t very good. Venison worked a lot better.”The dishes take more than a year to develop, because of all the toing and froing between product developers and suppliers most dishes will go through five or six iterations. Before any dish is given the final signoff, it is tested by either a panel of consumers or Sainsbury’s staff – every dish has to receive at least a seven out of 10. “The venison bonbons have scored really well,” Bramley says. “But it’s difficult. Things I think are amazing and my favourites might not do as well as I hope. We’re in the London bubble, and I might be excited by mini lobster rolls or pulled jackfruit bonbons – but is that a trend in other areas of the country?”• Commenting on this piece?

Four points from the five matches he has presided over is not a collection rate that will keep Fulham from the Championship.The Italian pronounced this the best performance of that short reign, but his statistical readout of the game pinpointed where West Ham had won the match. “We shoot at goal 16 times,” said Ranieri. “They created two counterattacks and they scored. Our counterattack was not good.” Another pair of bald statistics are that Fulham stayed bottom of the Premier League and have not kept a clean sheet in their last 21 top-ision matches.Felipe Anderson was the difference, supplying the key passes that turned those counterattacks into West Ham’s two goals. For the first, smashed in by Robert Snodgrass from the edge of the box in the 17th minute, Anderson’s turn of foot and change of pace left the Fulham right-back Denis Odoi for dead, allowing him time to lay up Snodgrass to score. For the second, 12 minutes later, with Odoi again left chasing shadows on the touchline, Anderson’s cross teed up Javier Hernández to flick the ball on for Michail Antonio to slot in.Both goals came against the run of play. Fulham were on the attack throughout the first half, with Aboubakar Kamara having the best of the chances, but were unable to beat Lukasz Fabianski the Polish goalkeeper is another big reason for West Ham being on their upward curve.The spirit Ranieri had hailed in his programme notes appeared to have been extinguished by half-time. As the sodden conditions the game was played in turned to ice, so did the game. West Ham saw out the second 45 minutes with ease, bar one hurried clearance from Fabián Balbuena after Tom Cairney had escaped to the byline. Fulham’s previous bustle had been extinguished.As Declan Rice strolled through midfield the home team were accepting of their fate. Anderson had a chance to score the goal his performance deserved but his header was weak.With four wins from their last four matches, the club’s best run since February 2014, Pellegrini has his team playing something along the mythical lines of the “West Ham Way”. They are scoring goals and also likely to concede at any moment even if they did see out this London derby with a clean sheet collected with efficiency.After the painful austerity under David Moyes and Slaven Bilic last season, the away fans’ audible enjoyment suggested a club happy in its own company. That has rarely the case since the club moved to the London Stadium in the summer of 2016.The noisy contingent from East London even sang their manager’s name for the first time, which Pellegrini said he was “very happy” to hear. “When we started the season so bad I never felt any negative reaction,” he said, in reference to West Ham losing their first four matches. “We know last season was not easy so I think they deserve this.”They ended the day just two points off sixth-placed Manchester United. And in Anderson the Hammers may have a new hero in the club’s classic mould his brilliance cannot always be counted upon, but he is a player capable of a hot streak. Pellegrini spoke of Anderson delivering “four or five decisive performances” before then preaching characteristic caution.“It was important for him to learn what the Premier League is,” said the Chilean. “And Felipe still needs to improve a little.” With Marko Arnautovic absent until the new year, and Andriy Yarmolenko out longer still, a considerable burden has fallen on Anderson but he appears capable of shouldering it.Ranieri has no such luxury. The habit of his long career has been to bolt his teams’ back door but he is working with a group of players incapable of doing so."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d0dffe36a9cd52c3673c9201596881fb3e5cbc5d/0_102_3429_2057/master/3429.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=233c872ce48b088dafedd0ca6bcef835","title":"tottenham burnley premier league match report","story":"Last Tuesday, Tottenham played Barcelona in the Camp Nou for a place in the Champions League knockout stages. On Wednesday, they face Arsenal in a League Cup semi-final. A game against Burnley in front of a half-full Wembley, rain sheeting down and adding an extra chill to an already freezing Saturday, was always going to be what advertising types call a tough sell.Thank the lord then, for Christian Eriksen. For 90 minutes, it was the sort of grim afternoon that might lead everyone to question their life choices, the 0-0 scoreline to that point even less interesting than it might sound.Tottenham are a different team when Eriksen is on the pitch: mostly that is for his invention and the way he seems to gently control games as if he is a delicate marionette operator, but this time it was his finishing. The Dane was brought on as a substitute to conjure something for a sluggish Spurs side, which he did just as second-half injury-time began, sweeping home his late winner and causing several Burnley players to sink to the turf. Cruel old game, football.Sean Dyche said that Burnley had been “done by a lump down the pitch” a little uncharitable, perhaps, because one man’s lump is another’s controlled long pass, but it is true that his side had frustrated Tottenham with a 5-4-1 system and tactics you might call pragmatic.“We limited them, by their standards,” said Dyche. “They had to work incredibly hard to get something.”This is exactly the sort of game where it is smart to park the bus, against a tired team with bigger things on their mind and with a crowd already frustrated at having to show up at their rented home again, months after they thought they would be shot of the place.At the moment Tottenham feel like one of those couples on Grand Designs who have to live in a caravan while their ambitious, self-sufficient eco-home with a £10,000 bath is dogged by delays. Admittedly, Wembley is an expensive and very well-appointed caravan, but the point is nobody wants to be here, the novelty wore off some time ago and everyone is grumpy.But while not many of the 41,645 in attendance will have enjoyed most of their afternoon, Mauricio Pochettino was delighted. “We know very well you need to play 90 minutes plus. I’m so happy because we played much better than the opponent. It would have been a frustrating afternoon if we hadn’t got the three points. For us, it was about having patience. The character and mentality of the team was amazing, to keep pushing. It was a massive effort to finish the week in that way.”With those games either side of this one in mind, Pochettino made five changes, including giving the 18-year-old midfielder Oliver Skipp his full debut. “Fantastic. Fantastic,” Pochettino said about the youngster, who at first glance looks like the mid-point between Eric Dier and Harry Winks. “He played like a 30-year-old man. I said to him ‘You look so relaxed.’ That’s the difference between someone who’s going to be a top player against someone who was a normal player like me.”Perhaps because of the changes, perhaps because they have bigger fish to fry, Spurs lacked their usual intensity, looking like a team who just wanted to get this game out of the way understandable perhaps, given the fixtures it came between, a little like asking someone to get excited about the tap water that arrives after the lobster and before the steak.They struggled to make chances and squandered the ones they did create before Eriksen’s winner, most notably from Son Heung-min and Dele Alli in the closing stages, as that frustration almost graduated to desperation.But then arrived Eriksen, right at the end, scoring from a Harry Kane pass after the referee had waved play on following a foul on Alli. Eriksen saved Tottenham’s Champions League campaign with a late goal against Inter and while it might be a bit much to say this one has saved their title challenge, it at least keeps them in touch with Liverpool and Manchester City.“We are in a very good position,” said Pochettino, celebrating his 100th Premier League win. “That is the reality: after 17 games, we have 39 points and are third in the table. It’s a massive achievement for us – we are there, we are close."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bdc3ad0dc991fc819a333ddedf6049fc30f37d31/0_49_2976_1785/master/2976.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f07fa9f3e8ae0e52aa2058dbf886eaaf","title":"fulham v west ham premier league live","story":"Robert Snodgrass and Michail Antonio piled the misery on Claudio Ranieri’s rock-bottom Fulham team on a rainy evening at Craven Cottage.And that’s all from me. Thanks for reading! And here’s John Brewin’s match report from Craven Cottage:Michail Antonio: “We’re definitely in good form. The gaffer’s brought in some good players and we’re starting to gel now, things are going well for us. Fulham threw everything at us today, but we kept a clean sheet. They didn’t have many opportunities and we kept playing, killing time, and won the game.”And that’s that. West Ham barely lifted a finger in that second half, which unlike the first was hugely comfortable for the visitors. Fulham remain well within reach of safety, but the way their confidence evaporated after a good start today hardly bodes well. As for West Ham, well, that’s another very convincing win indeed for Manuel Pellegrini – is it time to recognise that he’s a bit good…?91 mins: Kamara bustles messily into the box and wins a corner. Johansen takes, Fabianski claws at it, and the ball pinballs dangerously across the box. Back it comes, only for Andy Carroll to end all this nonsense with the world’s biggest hoof. The ball sails downfield via the skies.89 mins: A booking for Johansen, for tripping Diangana. Soft.87 mins: Anderson works his way forward down the left wing and lends the ball to Diangana before curling at goal from a tight angle. He can’t get enough backlift on the shot, though. Saved.Antonio makes way for Diangana. He’s played well, as he tends to.80 mins: West Ham are starting to enjoy themselves now. Anderson flicks the ball over a defender to Masuaku, who sidesteps infield with gratuitous flourish. Grady Diangana is about to come on. The home fans are filing out.78 mins: Another Fulham attack breaks down, and Carroll gets his first touch, blamming the ball out to Anderson, who jaunts infield but can’t quite engineer a chance.Fulham roll the dice again. Neeskens Kebano on for Andre Schurrle, who for a player of his pedigree has been pretty pitiful today. 74 mins: Fulham needs something soon – Craven Cottage has become resignedly flat, the only noise emanating from the away end. And West Ham are mighty comfy, dominating possession now.Enter Carroll. The Big Man comes on for the Little Pea.69 mins: West Ham look dangerous whenever they venture forward. First Anderson has a good headed chance, which he doesn’t get enough power on, then he gathers the ball on the left, pauses a beat and tries to pick out Declan Rice, in a sure-to-score position on the penalty spot, but Chambers just about manages to clear.66 mins: Cairney glides into the box with a nutmeg on Diop. Balbuena comes across to cut out the danger. Another corner for Fulham, but it’s quickly cleared. West Ham break and have a corner of their own through Zabaleta.65 mins: Anderson dances past two Fulham shirts on the left flank, eventually winning a free-kick when Christie’s patience runs out and he resorts to a shirt-pull. He’s a lovely player to watch.61 mins. West Ham make a change of their own, Pedro Obiang coming on for the scowling Mark Noble, who looks like he has a knock.59 mins: A corner for the home side almost comes to something, but Mitrovic’s goal-bound header is blocked by Balbuena. The hipster-haired Stefan Johansen is being readied on the touchline – he comes on now, for Jean Michaël Seri.Fulham legend Collins John was on the pitch at half-time. Here he is, looking chirpy.54 mins: A rare spell of sustained pressure for West Ham ends with Snodgrass jinking around near the corner flag and playing it back to Zabaleta, who wins a free-kick. They work it back across the box but Hernandez is caught offside. 51 mins: Cairney shimmies on the edge of the box and feeds Christie, steaming down the right. He batters the ball low and hard across West Ham’s six-yard box and Diop’s wild block turns out to be an effective one. The ball stops dead and West Ham clear.49 mins: Cairney and Chambers have a hopeful long-shot apiece – the first blocked, the second flying harmlessly wide.48 mins: Fulham work the ball out of a tight spot, right back near their own corner flag, very nicely indeed. Mitrovic’s through-ball to Schurrle, though, has too much on it, and trickles through to Fabianski.Cyrus Christie has come on, by the way, for Tim Ream.We’re off. And Fulham are back on the attack straight away, Mitrovic’s knock-down just escaping Seri. Fabianski gathers.Matthew Dony writes, in an email titled Shoot on sight: “Don’t get me wrong, he’s a very good footballer, but if I had as many shots as Andre Schurrle, I’m pretty sure I’d score a goal or two. (See also: Lampard, F.)” Quite so – he’s had a fair few goes already today, and nothing says ‘we’re out of ideas’ as much as the hopeful long-ranger.Some half-time reading, ahead of tomorrow’s big one: Mike Dean blows up, and Claudio marches across the pitch and down the tunnel, a picture of frustration. His side have been good. They will also do incredibly well to get anything out of this.46 mins: Cairney tries the very same thing from the other side. A mirror image of 30 seconds ago – but high and wide. 45 mins: Schurrle collects the ball on the left-hand corner of the box and looks to bend one into the far post. It doesn’t quite bend enough, though, and the ball sails wide."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/57c25bb419f90ff6f23e07c380204577984d0ce2/2_0_8723_5236/master/8723.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=68d9bf7db63ab782f125d4f4377f6ffe","title":"bolognese and bonding why i love cooking with my children","story":"With smart appliances like the Samsung Family Hub™ fridge, getting your kids to help out in the kitchen is easier than ever. Mum-of-three Antonia Windsor explains why cooking with your kids is the perfect opportunity for bonding, belly laughs and some stealth mathsBy the time my middle child Ziggy, now five, was just nine months old he had already joined me in the kitchen. He would sit on the floor with pans while I threw down the potato peelings for him to stir and spoon. I loved this bonding time with him, and proudly posted pictures of him on social media: my chef in the making. My two-year-old Zenya is following in his footsteps, often by my side while I’m chopping, offering up plates of pretend pizza for me to mime eating or cups of imaginary hot chocolate to sip.My eldest, Zayla, who is now six, had less interest in pretend cooking, but as soon as she could mix real flour in a bowl with real milk and crack an egg into it she was desperate for us to make pancakes on a weekly basis.I began to love and dread with equal measure the unfolding of the aprons, knowing that my kitchen would be chaos in just a few short minutes, but knowing, too, that there would be belly laughs and bonding that no other activity quite reproduces.Not only is cooking a fun, sensory activity for children it is also a great way for children to develop pride and confidence in their abilities. To create something from raw ingredients and actually get to eat the end product gives children a great sense of satisfaction.It is also a great way for small children to develop fine motor skills. Chopping, mixing, spreading and spooning are all actions that help develop hand-eye coordination and build strength in little fingers. As children get older they can start to read recipes for themselves and learn about weights and measures, turning family cooking into an easy educational activity that the children don’t need a spoonful of sugar to swallow. If I want to make our cooking a little more challenging mathematically, I double the quantities in a recipe and ask the children to help with the calculations. I also find it’s an easy way to help them understand concepts such as fractions - particularly when cutting a homemade cake into slices.If you are looking for inspiration on what to cook with the family, smart kitchen technology can really help you out the Samsung Family Hub™ fridge, for instance, can suggest child-friendly recipes based on the ingredients you already have in stock. We’re all big fans of the CBeebies programme I Can Cook, which has a fabulous range of multicultural recipes that are simple for children to make, and the Samsung Family Hub™ can help out here too – you can stream TV* to the built-in screen from your smartphone**.I find that when we make things ourselves from scratch it is easier to slip in healthy ingredients. Now, when we make pancakes, I slip in chia seeds and linseed, almond flour and coconut sugar. The children are happy because there are more ingredients to mix in the bowl, and they eat their creations hungrily, having hovered at the pan as I fry each one, desperate for their first taste.Now my children are old enough, we have progressed from pancakes and biscuits to them helping with dinner preparation. The children use butter knives to chop mushrooms for bolognese sauce, or help with the mashing of potato for shepherd’s pie.I talk to them as we cook. I tell them about ingredients, about where they come from and when they are in season, and I share family history, describing the food my husband’s mother prepares in Zimbabwe and the French-influenced dishes that my mum and gran cooked for me during my childhood in Jersey. In this way, I hope that our cooking together is a way that I can pass on traditions and family recipes, and help my children to grow into confident cooks who can pass these traditions down to their own children.* Service available on the Samsung Smart TV 6400 series and above, released in 2015** Requires Samsung Galaxy S6 and above or Samsung Galaxy Note 5, 7, 8 and 9 seriesDiscover how the Samsung Family Hub™ can help make your kitchen a more enjoyable place for all your family at samsungukfamilyhub"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3318994f724b574ee48a01cfaf4202d5f9c7b299/0_34_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b91ba024cc71993216c3ec641337fd55","title":"have you or your partner recently given birth share your experiences with us","story":"We’d like to hear about your physical and mental recovery after birthMost parents will tell you that nothing prepares you for the arrival of your first child.

In my teens I grew to resent it. As an atheist adult, could I find an alternative?On Christmas morning 2009, after my customary breakfast in bed of a chocolate orange accompanied by a large portion of foreboding, I pad downstairs to locate my parents. Ah, there’s my father. He’s dressed for church, not in his Sunday best, nor even in his problematic lay preacher’s cassock (white, pointed hood) – but in what appears to be a star-adorned navy curtain shrunk to fit the dimensions of a child’s playhouse.“And if we go over your lines one more time…” prompts my mother, with the maniacally bright smile of someone who has been entrusted with raising morale during the apocalypse.It’s a familiar scene – my parents are members of the Church in Wales, and the nativity has long formed the spine of my Christmases – so I wait for them to finish.My father replies: “I thought it was just the one line, lovey? ‘I bring a gift of myrrh…’”“No, I told you, Jacob and Lily have chickenpox and can’t come. So you’re bringing the gold and frankincense as well.”He catches sight of me lurking in the corner. “That’s a lot for one wise man to carry, isn’t it, Gwen?” he hoots, exaggeratedly miming dropping an armful of trinkets. It is difficult to know what is more perplexing. The fact that he, a fiftysomething, has agreed to act in the nativity play again. Or the fatherly tendency to imagine his daughter’s sense of humour has been frozen since the age of three.“Right, we’ve got to get to the Sunday school room to set up,” mutters my mother, shepherding him towards the front door. “The key’s on the sideboard,” comes a distant yell, followed by a loud slam. I’m left in an unfestive silence.That’s how it goes in the Smith household. Christmas morning is not about exchanging presents or making the stuffing or gleefully opening the extra-large window in the advent calendar you forgot the previous day. It’s about the nativity. My mother runs it. My father gamely takes part (with declining congregations, Sunday schools are no longer the hives of eager young thespians they once were). Atheist me, the odd one out, glowers from the sidelines. Well, that’s after smarting at being abandoned and considering not going at all – before rushing to church at the last minute and sulking in the back row. That’s what happened in 2009, the first year I was no longer involved in the play (I had left to be a student), and the point at which I began questioning whether it needed to form part of my Christmas at all.In my late teens and early 20s, the play was nothing more than a frenzied obstacle between me and the ordered, elegant, largely secular Christmases enjoyed by my friends. Or, as I saw it at the time, Literally Everyone In The World Apart From Me. As a child I loved taking part. I gamely greeted the Lord’s birth wearing a succession of damp-smelling tunics (shepherd), yellowing bedsheets (angel) and hairbands with cotton wool glued on to them (sheep). It was a chance to dress up and eat medically unwise quantities of selection-box Curly Wurlys.But it became less appealing in adolescence. There weren’t enough of us in the parish, so my peers and I were still forced to perform. Parishioners were recently treated to the discomfiting spectacle of a bearded, 40-year-old Joseph escorting a primary school-age Mary to Bethlehem.And so we return to the ghost of Christmas 2009. You would think navigating the nativity as an adult might have been easy, not least because I was – finally – no longer expected on stage. It wasn’t. Without filling my time the way I did as a teenager, with squabbles about being too old to don a tinsel crown (a position I maintain), the morning now felt directionless. It was also, given my parents’ early departure for church, lonely. Suddenly, not participating felt as isolating as announcing a newfound ambivalence towards pigs-in-blankets. I didn’t want to be involved in the show any longer. But I wanted to be involved in… something.Why? I guess my church childhood hardwired me to crave ceremony. You try growing up having your year nicely shaped into a string of cosy festivals, each with its own reassuring ritual, and not coming out at the other end with a sheepish yearning for tradition. Not liking the ceremony I’d been lumped with didn’t stop me looking for it elsewhere.Church was also my first taste of community and belonging. Yes, I’ve now rejected Christianity and found those things in other places – in my friendship group, my career, and the corner of the internet that celebrates Julia Roberts’s 1980s hair (what a lustrous mane!). But at Christmas, offices close and friends – while thankfully only a WhatsApp away – tend to hunker down with their own families. If my template for the season wasn’t religious, then I didn’t have one at all.Last December, I was offered that festive holy grail: an invitation to attend someone else’s (far less churchy) Christmas. Was this the “something” I was looking for? A chance to spend the day with reassuringly spiritually deficient folk, who weren’t likely to swap celebrations for stagecraft? There was the added bonus that it was in Sweden – a country in which, I had been led to believe, below-par Christmases are illegal. But despite the seasonally appropriate weather and chic decorations, I missed Christmas in Cardiff. And there was one thing I pined for more than anything else. You guessed it: the nativity.Why? Well, several gulps of rejuvenating Swedish air led to an epiphany: I missed the play because it sums up my family Christmas. More, it sums up the strange pull of the frazzled family Christmas, full stop.After all, as with every dysfunctional festive gathering, no one particularly enjoys the nativity. I can’t be the only one who fantasises about skipping it and going instead for a glamorous lunch somewhere devoid of familiar faces and their grating quirks. It’s messy, more work than it’s worth and usually ends in tears. And yet… a lot of people still do it. This is most certainly the fault of a cliche – the one that says company is more important than comfort at Christmas, and then pathologises anyone who dares to point out that there might be a more peaceful way to spend the holiday than bickering with relatives over the gravy. Even so, it points to a worthwhile truth. That’s right: at the tender age of 26, I had matured enough to realise that reality can sometimes trump fantasy. Even if that reality is unpredictable or messy, or if you stopped believing in God around the time you began to question the existence of Santa.In that spirit, when I’m in Cardiff this year, I won’t roll my eyes when Mum starts fretting about the attendance record of Ox Number Three. Instead, I’ll say soothing things, arrive at the service on time and generally make myself useful. Behind the scenes, that is. I draw the line at dusting off my shepherd’s tunic.• If you would like to comment on this piece for inclusion on Weekend magazine’s letters page in print, please email weekend@the, including your name and address (not for publication)."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d6866bd1a7150342b7997eb129a34068cbe761a8/0_273_4974_2984/master/4974.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e80d6e1360e1e3dc972f0c938288be98","title":"over 65s join parkruns","story":"More older people than youngsters are now joining parkruns. Some stopped long enough to tell us why…Every Saturday morning, 9am sharp, 74-year-old Eileen Bartlett lines up for the start of her local parkrun in Lee-on-the-Solent, Hampshire. It’s something she’s done for two years, having become addicted to the “endorphin high” and exhilaration.“The first time I came down that slope and could see the finish line, if you’d given me a million quid I couldn’t have felt better,” she says. “I wanted to tell everyone on the bus home that I’d just run five kilometres!”Bartlett is one of a rapidly growing number of pensioners across Britain who are defying preconceptions about their age, putting on trainers and taking to the track. According to new data from parkrun, the organisation behind the weekly 5km events, over-65s have notched up more runs in 2018 than the 18-24 age group for the first time in the charity’s 14-year history. And, if you add the 55-64 age band, the older generation completed a million runs, doubling figures from two years ago.The growing visibility of parkruns has introduced pensioners to an activity many had never dreamed of doing. Bartlett turned up to the park on that first day to take photos of the runners but decided on a whim to have a go herself. Others volunteer as marshals before gradually getting the urge to join in.True, not all of them actually run. Some stroll, some hobble. But for Bartlett, who completed her first run in a parka, scarf and walking boots – the way you get around hardly matters. “My confidence and self-esteem have gone through the roof. If you can run, you feel you can do anything,” she says.Parkrun has saved her life, she believes, because it was only through her laboured breathing that she discovered she had a chronic lung disease, known as COPD, that can now be controlled. “My doctor said a lot of people, when they struggle to breathe, just give up and get a mobility scooter. I said, no way! I breathe like a steam engine when I’m running but apparently it’s what my lungs need. It makes them stronger,” she says.John Butcher, 87, from Hampshire, says running has thrown him a lifeline too. He started doing weekly parkruns after his wife, Lizzie, died on Christmas Day 2015. Having been married for nearly 60 years, he says it has helped him deal with the grief and loneliness.“The worst thing you can do in that situation is sit in front of the TV and do nothing. I really do look forward to the Saturday morning run. I’ve met so many nice people, it’s quite incredible really,” he says.Others have discovered hidden talents. Jacklin Richardson never used to run as a younger woman “unless it was to catch a bus”. But when she turned 70, her daughter persuaded her to give the Hastings parkrun a go. Remarkably, Richardson found a natural aptitude for endurance and recently won a bronze medal in the British Masters road relay team. “I was flabbergasted,” she says.All of which is music to the ears of parkrun founder Paul Sinton-Hewitt, whose idea back in 2004 of getting a bunch of mates to jog around his local park in London has mushroomed into a global movement in 20 countries. It has even spawned his own sportswear brand, Contra. “What was clear from the early days of parkrun was that the main motivation wasn’t to run faster but to hang out with friends,” he says.That community element, he believes, is at the heart of why growing numbers of older people are turning up in unprecedented numbers.Butcher agrees that an old-school, almost religious-like community spirit is parkrun’s golden ticket. “Park running isn’t going to attract any yobbos, is it? We have a nice cup of tea and a cake afterwards, and that’s all part of it,” he says.Bartlett loves going to the cafe, too, but warns about getting too involved with the cake and biscuits. “It’ll only get harder to run,” she says."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/89b040d930aa375ac9ffae13e37b110de25d3ea0/142_204_5380_3228/master/5380.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=43a3566453c1cd206d05a64f6d0ebfde","title":"playing with scale huge murals and humorous details in west london","story":"Huge murals and humorous details work together to give this 1930s semi a bold and modern lookPop art, industrial-inspired design, global handicrafts and antiques, 70s glamour and lots of colour: you could never say that Preston Schroeder was afraid of mixing it up. “I’ve always wanted to develop a house that reflects my personality,” says Schroeder, who lives here with his partner Marcus and their teenage daughter Dulcie. The couple had renovated and sold homes, but when they found this 1930s semi in southwest London, it was time to stay – and inject the iniduality that had been missing.“I initially discounted this house because it was on a busy road, but property was so scarce I ended up looking at it anyway,” says Schroeder. “It was rented out, and the tenant hadn’t looked after it. The garden was like a forest. But I knew that we could completely reinvent it. I remember standing on the first floor, looking out to the garden, with a smile on my face, thinking: ‘This is the one.’”After living in the house for a year to get a feel for what they wanted, the couple worked with an architect to draw up plans for two ground-floor extensions at the side and rear, both with rooflights to bring in daylight, plus an attic conversion. The initial plan was to have the extension wrap fully around the house, but when local planners wouldn’t allow it, they settled for a small side courtyard instead. It’s turned out to be one of Schroeder’s favourite features – a pocket of calm that leads the eye through the space from the light hallway, with a hot-pink wall that helps to tie together inside and out.That pink wall is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to bright colour. From zingy green in the downstairs cloakroom to acid yellow, lavender and baby blue in the living room, Schroeder has let his imagination run riot. “I love combining something old and antique with something new and fresh, and colour is a way to achieve harmony with that – the formality of the antiques is countered by using really bright colours on the upholstery,” he says. A pair of 150-year-old French chairs have been covered in a distressed pink velvet, while dark wood dining chairs get an exotic spin with leopard print.While others might find it daunting to invent such bold schemes, he follows a simple formula: “If you’re scared of colour, start with a print you love, then pick out two or three colours within it to create a wider scheme. That generally works, and you don’t have to think too much about it.” So, for example, he came up with the colours for the bedrooms by extracting inidual shades from the multicoloured silk-effect wallpaper that runs all the way up the stairs and landing: dusky pink, emerald green and, for the master bedroom, a soothing aqua blue.Schroeder is a serious globe-trotter, heading up his own fashion brand, Purple Smoke, which specialises in glamorous resort wear, while also working as a retail buyer for luxury hotels, sourcing unusual, independent and locally made items to sell within high-end resorts. His affinity for seeking out curiosities is abundantly obvious in his home. “I love to go off the beaten track and into markets to get a feel for a place,” he says. “In Bali, I can spend days on a bike going around the back streets discovering artists and antique dealers.” He grew up in Cape Town, so there are also lots of handmade objects from home, such as the wall of woven bowls in the dining area, and the life-size wire-and-bead baby giraffe sculpture in the garden, shipped from South Africa.Where he couldn’t find what he wanted, he had furniture made, giving a sleek and tailored overall effect. He has also modified antique pieces, turning a grand sideboard he bought at auction into a basin unit for his en suite bathroom.“The best money I spent was with a lighting designer, Light.iQ,” Schroeder says. “As the ground floor is open plan, it was important to have different spaces lit at different times, but I still wanted it to feel balanced. Our home transforms at night because of the lighting.”Schroeder’s best advice for those wanting to create a daringly decorated home is that they should be willing to experiment: “I think it’s important to keep an open mind and not to stick to what you know.

I doubt, in truth, that much of the damn thing survives anyway. I was brought up in a generation when nearly all the parenting was done by mothers and I have now helped to bring up four daughters as well as having been through the crucible of two marriages. In short, I have lived most of my life in the penumbra of women.Lately, in the tremors of #MeToo, #TimesUp, the Jordan Peterson phenomenon and the emergence of “incels” (involuntary celibates) and Mgtow (men going their own way), I find myself puzzling over the question: what is masculinity anyway? To try to answer the question, I signed up for a weekend intensive course run by the media platform and transformational workshop company Rebel Wisdom, titled The New Masculinity, at a retreat in a converted barn in Buckinghamshire.The weekend is built on the idea of the “hero’s journey” pioneered by the Jungian anthropologist Joseph Campbell. It suggests that all myths, stories and folk tales follow the same essential pattern because they reflect inner psychological states present in all human beings and therefore contain clues to how we might better “integrate” ourselves. The work involves, metaphorically, going into a cave and confronting the monster inside – usually negative aspects of ourselves that we deny. We then return home with the “treasure” – a more fully integrated personality.I find myself waiting for activities to start in a room with about 30, very normal-looking and sociable youngish to middle-aged men. They include a war correspondent, a TV director, a yoga teacher and a martial arts teacher. We are met by three facilitators who ide us into groups of six to build trust, by each closing our eyes and falling backwards to be supported by the rest. We each make a public statement of general commitment – “To face the dark and unacceptable parts of ourselves” – and a personal one, which we offer to our group. I commit to keeping an open mind.We go to bed in silence (on instruction). The next morning, we rise at 6.45am for a “wild man” workout. After vigorous push-ups and stretches, to the sound of Navajo chanting, the group is asked to walk, then run in a circle round the room, catching and holding one another’s gaze. After breakfast, we have an “embodied meditation” called Out of the Box in which are told to “let out our frustration”. Men jog around the room and grunt, then scream, until the room is full of reddened faces. We ide into twos and stop and stare deep into another man’s eyes. One by one, the men in the room begin to roar at each other. It is discomfiting to stand in front of a man whose face is distorted by rage and know that one’s own face must look much the same.We start to move again. Firestarter by the Prodigy blasts out and the march turns into a wild dance. Despite being an inhibited person, I am swept up. Half the men take off their shirts. The group leader shouts over the cacophony: “Get out of the box!” I’m not sure what kind of box, but I get the drift. It is liberating, but so intense that one man actually throws up after the session.We stand at the “mouth of the cave” and now we are going to “face our own shadow”. I suggest to the group that during the Out of the Box exercise, we were just a few steps away from pillaging and looting the nearest village. I was also acutely aware that any women in the room might have found the spectacle terrifying. I was assured that the idea was not to “let the beast run free” but to control it through forming a relationship with it, to foster a “positive masculine spirit”.During lunch I ask some of the men to try to define this spirit. Among their suggestions were boisterousness, level-headedness, risk- taking, protectiveness and assertiveness.Later, we go into a one-on-one “talking meditation”. We speak without interruption for 10 minutes about our fathers, always maintaining eye contact with our partners. My “buddy” is “Adam”, a likeable and gentle man in his mid-30s. I gaze into his eyes as I say anything that comes into my head about my father, who died five years ago. I find myself quickly in tears. I hadn’t realised how much I had missed him.We prepare to go “into the cave” using controlled breathing to enter into a different state of consciousness. It is surprisingly effective. Adam lies on the floor. I put my hand on his chest so he can register my presence and support. Eventually, he squirms and arches his back and his hands curve into claws. He begins weeping and muttering and starting a dialogue with his father. Exclamations fill the hall. “Fuck you,” shouts one guy, repeatedly, at the top of his voice. Many others call out and sob. Adam is crying so much I find myself weeping in distress.When my own turn comes, through rapid breathing, I enter a space that I can only call akin to taking a small dose of LSD – dissociated, vaguely euphoric. I do not cry, but I do lose control, and call out yelling at the top of my voice. But I cannot remember what it is that I say.Having encountered the “monster”, we can return to the real world with some kind of “treasure”. Each of us has to write our “Letting Goes” on a piece of paper – fixed psychological or emotional states we are trapped in that we can now symbolically dispose of. We gather around a bonfire and one by one walk inside the circle of faces, again making eye contact which each member. We cast our Letting Goes into the fire and speak – or shout – their contents. One lets go of his need to be liked. Another lets go of his need to be in control. And so on.A celebration begins. A guitar is produced from somewhere. A singer performs songs. A hip-hop artist begins improvising lyrics. There are jokes and stories. The atmosphere between the men is one of camaraderie, closeness and warmth.The next day we are going to learn “reintegration”. It’s about, apparently, being “kingly”, which means to be fully aware – “showing up” – and taking responsibility for ourselves. Another talking therapy has us reveal “The man I want to be and what stops me getting there.”We each write a commitment on a piece of paper and head outside, where there is a bridge crossing a stream. We cross it alone, calling out our commitment on the other side. Then we return, again crossing the bridge alone, and are applauded by the whole group as we cross back. Our own unit of six gathers for a group embrace.There is a final talking meditation in the groups of six, each of us having to state what we appreciate about ourselves and what the others in the group appreciate about us. In my experience, although men banter and are capable of great compassion, they rarely directly compliment one another (women seem to do it naturally). To affirm one another without irony feels highly novel and very rewarding. When the other men in the group tell me what they appreciate about me, I find myself very moved. I realise I am not used to experiencing this kind of praise, from either gender. Men often survive in a culture of criticism. I don’t think I’m unusual in recalling a father who almost never praised me.We say goodbye, standing in a circle of 30 in front of the teachers. One by one we are asked if we have something to say before we leave the weekend. As my turn approaches, I think how bizarre it is to experience something more intimate by far than you would do with male friends you have known all your life. Sadly, fear – of the unknown, of intimacy, of feeling silly – will keep many men away from workshops like this, partly because what goes on is actually so feminine, full of warmth, connection and affirmation.That may be a pity, even a tragedy. When my turn comes, I talk of an acquaintance of mine who killed himself earlier this year – a charismatic, attractive man in his 50s. I dedicate my time at the retreat to him and men like him – superficially self-possessed, but on another level, deeply vulnerable. My friends meet my eyes – I now think of them as my friends – and in my imagination seem to understand. That is some consolation. With that, I leave the circle, already considering when I might return.For more details, go to rebelwisdom. @timlottwriter"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e4b531e9975553b9c78a6670c6d158c58463a570/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=49070f0d6734862662311cf17b2efb58","title":"bruce springsteen on broadway paul mcartney liverpool echo arena review","story":"Two musical veterans take stock after half a century, with self-reflection and serious back cataloguesCurating your legacy is a great problem to have as a musician – one that few artists truly need to contend with. Shaping the narrative of your life’s work probably becomes – at some point in your fame – your life’s work perhaps around the 50-year mark.Two storied greats of the modern age were in session last week, each of them half a century in showbiz, both approaching Christmas with marquee undertakings guaranteed to curry favour with fans. Each deals with a deep catalogue in different ways.New Jersey Catholic boy Bruce Springsteen releases a double album, Springsteen on Broadway, and a Netflix documentary, both capturing his long 2017-8 stint at the Walter Kerr theatre in New York. The shows were the staged version of the book: Springsteen’s revelatory 2016 memoir Born to Run.On this documentary album, Springsteen plays many of the autobiographical songs that made him one of the finest chroniclers of the yearning, joy and pain of the 20th century. Each is contextualised some reminiscences seem to come verbatim from the memoir. Located somewhere between a TED talk, an episode of VH1’s Storytellers and a confessional, it’s a hugely nourishing listen – not least because Springsteen, the boss of righteous stadium bluster, unveils a self-deprecating sense of humour. He’s “tinged with fraud”, he twinkles. (The whole thing is scripted, but does not suffer from it.) Of course, he also declaims and testifies, he croons poignantly. But the subplot in which Springsteen sheds his myth with a wink is new.“I made it all up,” he grins, “that’s how good I am.” Springsteen’s oeuvre is all about leaving stifling home towns, in search of glory, or just a job: being Born to Run. “I currently live 10 minutes from my home town,” he quips. “Born to Come Back? Who’d have bought that shit?”He didn’t know how to drive when he wrote Racing in the Street. The balladeer of the working man has never had a real job. On it goes: superbly written stories-behind-the-songs, loaded with the self-knowledge of years of therapy, all delivered with the puffy-mouthed, plosive Jersey Bs that belie his Italian-American ancestry, as well as the Dutch-Irish.Anyone with daddy issues will particularly cherish the closure that begins with My Father’s House and ends with Long Time Comin’, with Springsteen’s distant, brooding, hard-drinking father coming over to talk. You can hear Springsteen choking up as he tells, in an especially lyrical section, how his father “petitioned” him to become an “ancestor” rather than a “ghost” in his life.Jimi Hendrix rewrote The Star-Spangled Banner in response to the unconscionable ravages of the Vietnam war. In one shiver-inducing highlight, Springsteen reconfigures his often-misunderstood 1980s anthem Born in the USA, playing harrowing psychedelic slide on a 12-string guitar. It’s not a new version – you can find similar acoustic Borns online – but it makes plain what that song is about: a disorienting loss of faith in the idea of America, an indictment of the senselessness and dire consequences of the war.Is it churlish to wish Paul McCartney would write a no-holds-barred memoir, then stage a series of mid-sized theatre shows retelling the ballad of Paul McCartney, in a way we haven’t heard it before? Perhaps. It is, after all, mid-December, and we should – as he points out some way into this mammoth 38-song, three-hour set – be having “a wonderful Christmastime”, in the company of the Liverpool Institute for Performing Arts 4-19-year-old choir.McCartney has told his story, again and again, to interviewers, on TV specials, through films, at gigs, and to the BBC’s Mastertapes programme, to James Corden. You can’t help but think, however, that a more intimate setting than an arena, where this giant of song could lower the Macca mask just a little and really get stuck in, would be truly electrifying.The closest McCartney probably has come to a memoir is Many Years from Now, 1997’s very-authorised biography. The book was widely perceived as McCartney’s attempt to set some Beatles myths straight – not least the assumption that McCartney was all about the nice tunes (and oh my, how lovely Let It Be and Hey Jude still are) – while John Lennon was responsible for the avant-garde, the politics and the boundary-testing.As it is, having released a rewarding new album, Egypt Station, a few months ago – it went to No 1 in the US – the indefatigable McCartney is taking the back catalogue sine qua non out again, studding the Beatles-heavy set list with new cuts and tunes from a mid-period longer than most careers.A galumphing guide to flirtation, Come On to Me, remains one of McCartney’s best latter-day compositions, but Fuh You – McCartney’s single in the company of producer Ryan Tedder – still feels like a bad idea, only louder.Slim and agile, finally allowing his hair to grey and – back where he once belonged – audibly Liverpudlian on this first-night show in his home town, McCartney is a generous talker. He recalls filming Car Pool Karaoke here earlier this year, cracks a joke about being charged admission to his old house by the National Trust. There are people in this crowd who actually played the game Queenie Eye, which gave its name to a track on 2013’s New, as children the Quarrymen’s drummer, Colin Hanton, is in the audience to hear their tune, In Spite of All the Danger.“I could spend the whole evening chatting to you,” McCartney says affably just before Letting Go, from Wings’ 1975 album Venus and Mars album. The song comes with added slink from one excellent innovation: a live three-piece horn section who play their first parts from the middle tier of the crowd.Relocated to the stage, the Hot City Horns are one of this show’s mightiest weapons, featuring in all the right places: a superb Lady Madonna, the obligatory Ob-La-Di Ob-La-Da, a closing Golden Slumbers. They zhoosh-up Let Me Roll It, one of many well-received Wings tunes, which turns into Hendrix’s Foxy Lady – an electrifying coda that sees McCartney play guitar like a boss.There’s an anecdote here: when the Beatles released Sgt Pepper’s, Hendrix covered the title track at his own gig 48 hours later. It’s part of 60s lore, and if you’re a Fan on the Run – Macca diehards, here in force with placards – you’ll have heard it before, more than once.It’s possible that McCartney, who despite his well-documented post-Beatles depression, and his acknowledged stint with a therapist after his split from his former wife, hasn’t been through the self-analytical wringer in quite the same manner as Springsteen has. You crave more intimacy from Macca and his songs – but you certainly can’t accuse this most compassionate songwriter of emotional constipation.Newbie Who Cares reaches out to the bullied. McCartney recalls how he wrote Blackbird in solidarity with those struggling in the civil rights movement. And of course there is Here Today, an imagined conversation with Lennon, which seeks to privilege their bromance and draw a line under the strife. Its abiding sentiment: “I really loved you.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c3a0209d790d9b416237015b80ed3481469edb0f/0_331_7360_4417/master/7360.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1035a6c5a3376c1df2bfb965fc933efa","title":"bryn terfel life on a plate conductors italian food","story":"The opera singer on Plácido Domingo’s cookbooks and what to eat to survive WagnerWhat had a huge bearing on me – a sheep farmer’s son from Gwynedd – believing that I could sing Wagner on the stages of the world in my first language, Welsh, with its circumflex vowel sounds and rough, rugged, throaty consonants.

I loved the crust, the final piece of a loaf, being lobbed over to me.I started cooking, usually pasta with sauces, when I had to negotiate my career. I’d spend two months in, say, Chicago, New York, London. Usually Plácido Domingo had an apartment to rent and they always had Italian cookbooks. I was suddenly singing with conductors like Riccardo Muti and Claudio Abbado, and they adored Italian food. Even John Eliot Gardiner and Daniel Harding – they loved it. It’s ingrained in the conductor, for some reason.When I started singing for Welsh National Opera they had a small office space in Tiger Bay and a chef in the cafeteria who was magnificent, which is often not the case in opera houses. It’s horrible sometimes in their cafeterias, where they should know that singers need to be fed like racehorses.My first recording of a big opera was with Pavarotti and Joan Sutherland, and we stayed in a place called Fairyhill run by a couple, John and Madge, who had a sheepdog called Celyn. They welcomed me and said: “Dame Joan would like to invite you for tea in the garden.” Then, every night, we’d have stunning food together after our recording session.After I come off stage I’m immediately thinking of food. And if I do, say, 10 performances at the Royal Opera House, I leave the stage door afterwards once out of those 10. Because nowadays it’s about contractual obligations and having dinner with sponsors. I want to be there to help, so have food and wine with benefactors who give a dinner in honour of the opera or its singers. Once I lost my voice in Reykjavík in Iceland and the night before I’d eaten, I believe, some bad mussels. So, I’m blaming those mussels.A Wagner opera tends to go on for four or five hours, sometimes six, starting normally at 4pm, so I have steak at lunch and always eat something in the break. A cup of soup, some fruit nothing too extraordinary. Simplicity is best. And I’m a strong believer in carrying honey always in my bag. I’m not sure if it has the power to bring back a voice but it’s there to help in an emergency.FoodAny city in the world I’m tagging along with the Italian-restaurant goers. If you go to Rome you’ll have the most amazing carbonara, which I think is the most difficult to make. The best I had was in a restaurant in N.Y in the village, called Babbo. Stunning. Absolutely marvellous.DrinkI remember my Australian tour and being given my favourite, a Magnum of Penfolds Grange. I didn’t want to leave it anywhere – it accompanied me throughout. Of course, back then I would cradle it on a flight now you can’t even carry it on.RestaurantThe Harrow in Little Bedwyn where (co-owner) Roger Jones is Welsh and Le Manoir Aux Quat’Saisons in Great Milton, where Raymond Blanc has a church on the side and two acres of veg and herbs.

But as we eat the food grown in his garden outside the window, he confesses that he did once see a film. He refuses to disclose what, brushing aside my questions as we sit talking around the dining table with his wife, five of his eight children and one grandson. “I am not proud of that,” he says. “I went against my parents’ wishes.”But this one-off incident, many years ago, speaks to the reasons why this 52-year-old sold his thriving Ohio clothing business, one that supplied hundreds of stores across North America, and moved his family to this idyllic farm in upstate New York three years ago. Daniel is Amish – a member of a community famed worldwide for their plain clothes and use of horse-drawn buggies – and he fears the impact of modernity and the temptations of technology on his children, his church and his traditional Christian world. “Our values are different and we chose to safeguard them,” he says. “But if our people get lax and rub elbows too much with the world, then the world may not look too different – we become like the people outside.”Instead, he has returned to the Amish tradition of farming, enjoying a homespun lifestyle that eschews things the rest of us take for granted – from televisions to trouser belts, in case they distract from a devotion to God. This German-speaking sect, which demands simple lives of self-reliance based on the Bible, may be at odds with the rest of today’s society – yet surprisingly, it is booming, rather than being swamped by a fast-evolving world of smartphones and social media.In 1989, there were some 100,000 Amish scattered in 179 settlements across North America. Recent analysis by academics at Elizabethtown College, Pennsylvania found numbers have surged to 330,265 Amish in 546 settlements. It is the fastest-growing faith group on the continent, with predictions that there might be more than 1 million adherents by 2050. This marks an extraordinary turnaround: there were only 5,000 Amish in America a century ago.Perhaps most remarkably, the reason for this population explosion is not just the traditional big Amish families. Children are actively choosing to stay in communities, resisting the lure of clubs, sport, music and technology. “I’ve heard a lot about Facebook, but it seems a waste of time,” says Michael, 15, one of Daniel’s four sons, over fresh tomato soup. “I can be doing things a lot more beneficial than going to bars or spending time looking at a phone.” Children can choose to be baptised into the church in their late teens – and researchers say retention rates appear to have risen in recent decades.It is not just computers and cars that families turn their backs on. Many Amish reject mains electricity and some refuse indoor plumbing, while wives must follow the decisions of their husbands orce is an impermissible sin. Children carry out chores from infancy. Yet behind those distinctive long beards for men and white bonnets for women, there are some smart business brains, with soaring numbers of multimillionaires. I speak to one man running a firm with 500 employees that he started aged 50 in his barn, while others have become wealthy from land ownership as their population expands, driving up land values.Most Amish people live in small communities of about 20 households, clustered around churches that set their own rules they can now be found in 30 states, as well as Canada, Argentina and Bolivia. “When you have families of 13 people and most stay with the faith, then you end up with lots of people,” says Karen Johnson-Weiner, an anthropology professor and author of books on the Amish (though she is not Amish herself). “For the most part, I have seen shared labour and a sense of working together that we do not have any more. What I have always most admired is the strength of their families.”A range of factors, from ending the draft in 1973, which forced young Amish men (as conscientious objectors) to carry out community work, through to a more recent trend towards educating Amish children in their own schools, has meant less interaction with the outside world. This has reinforced a sense of separatism and fuelled higher retention rates than in the years before the second world war, when differences with wider society were less stark.New York’s Amish community is among the fastest-growing, with 58 settlements, mainly in the north of the state. Settlers are lured by land cheaper than in the Amish heartlands of Ohio, Indiana and Pennsylvania – the photogenic backdrop for the film Witness, starring Harrison Ford as a police officer hiding in the community. In the small market town of Morris, where the Weavers now live, there are seven Amish households in an area that has seen scores of small farms go out of business.But their neighbours seem to welcome them, not least because they have revived derelict farms. “They are well liked here,” says Leslie Stroh, a publisher who worked on Daniel’s fields as a boy. “They don’t integrate, and why should they? But they are still very open to us.” There have been tensions in other places, however, over issues such as horse droppings on roads, and refusing to install hazard lights on buggies.Stopping in the centre of this quiet town, I meet an elderly Amish man visiting the post office on his bicycle, who turns out to be Daniel’s father, Roy. A widower who moved here a year ago, following his son, he politely answers my questions and talks me through some of the Amish community’s basic beliefs – about following “the old ways” as set out in the Bible. Later I learn the family was driven to move by cheaper land, tensions over technology in their previous church, and Daniel’s desire to spend more time with his family. He is building a store to sell local produce, while Sam, his eldest son, runs a dairy farm.That evening, Daniel asks me to join his household for dinner, an unusual invitation. But the meal is punctuated by laughter, as the Weavers describe a way of life that revolves around faith, family and work. “I feel you can be trusted, so you are sitting at my table,” Daniel says. “But on a friendship level, our values are very different. We would not want to mix with you, because if our children came to your home, they might sit and watch television.”We discuss their attitudes to issues such as girls’ and women’s rights, the conversation carrying on into the following day. “The Bible says a husband must love his wife and if a wife follows his lead then you will have a happy family,” says Sam, 28, a father of four. “If God’s ways are followed, then a contented family will result under our culture.” When I press him on the fairness of this, he argues they are all – men and women alike – following ine command. While the family insist all key decisions are shared, it is noticeable that the women are reticent in these male-dominated discussions. They are also more likely to carry out the traditional tasks of cleaning and cooking. Ira, Daniel’s wife, describes her day to me: “quiet time praying”, then “the girls help with breakfast and we are done by seven so the men can go out.” Her husband tells me Ira is not a “women’s libber”.The couple’s lively one-year-old grandson, Nathan, joins us at the table, along with his father, Josh. His wife – Daniel and Ira’s oldest daughter – died of Hodgkin lymphoma when she was just 23, soon after the boy’s birth. They tell me this was deeply painful and that they miss her profoundly, but believe there is a higher purpose to such loss. “To us, death is not God’s punishment. God is in control of life and death,” Daniel says.The Amish are followers of Jacob Amman, a hardline Swiss bishop who broke with the Mennonite faith in 1693. The Amish began emigrating to America in the 18th century, mostly settling in Pennsylvania. In the 1930s, they came to wider attention and were romanticised for resisting moves to shut down the small schools their children attended. Later generations have found other aspects of their lifestyle to admire: in the 60s, counterculture rebels looked to them as off-grid pioneers in the 80s, they were celebrated for their traditional craft skills more recently, it’s been their long tradition of organic farming, with branded grocers opening in New York City.Outsiders are allowed to join the community – though only an estimated one in three stick with the creed they are encouraged to spend time living the Amish lifestyle for several months before baptism into the church.Converts include Marlene Miller, a former high school majorette who joined half a century ago, after marrying an Amish man. In a memoir, she wrote that the hardest things were learning to speak German and to sew just three of her 10 children are still in the faith.Although clearly devout, with hymn sheets stuck to his own kitchen table for the family to sing together, Sam admits to me the day after our dinner that, as a teenager, he questioned his belief – if it “was a learned thing rather than the truth”. He has friends who have left to join “the English” – the Amish term for outsiders. He also confesses that, as a bird-watcher, he would love to have a camera. “But our values are down to our connection to a faith that will be discarded if we adopt technology.”Sam, who has travelled abroad, says he is old enough to remember a pre-digital era, before computers and smartphones. “I can see the big changes they have brought to society, which my children will never see. There is more independence on the inidual level, but people have become more selfish – everything is for themselves. We value the idea of working for the betterment of everyone. Christ said we are to be a light to the world. We are not saying we want everyone to be Amish, or that we are better, but our goal in a selfish society is to show people that it works if we are honest in our dealings, respect people and go the extra mile.”Watching him lead one of his young sons around the lush fields and milking his cows, assisted by a younger brother and automated machinery, it’s clear this thoughtful man loves the rural way of life, with his 800 cows and renovated old buildings. He is scathing, however, about industrialised farming, with tens of thousands of cattle in one place. “In America, we are so driven by capitalism that everything has to get bigger and bigger all the time,” he says.They may use a horse and buggy for trips into town, clip-clopping along the roads alongside thundering trucks, but the Amish will take taxis and trains when needed. I am surprised to learn that both Sam and Daniel have flown abroad, to places such as Guatemala and Haiti for charity work. Daniel explains that the Amish reject many modern items for fear of assimilation. So they do not own cars, for instance, because the machines detach people from their extended families too easily and can create envy, not because they are deemed “sinful” in themselves.Daniel does not buy a newspaper, because he does not want his children becoming interested in sport – “sport seems to be the God of America, so competitive and with so much money” – yet they play volleyball and he will happily read a paper if he finds one on a train. So they know about their disruptive president, despite opting out of the electoral process. Yet when I mention Donald Trump’s bellicose language on North Korea, one young adult asks me if his country has gone to war.Given the world’s political turbulence, such ignorance might sound almost blissful. But some who leave the Amish community have spoken about a dark side to the peaceable Amish facade people who leave the church can be shunned by their families for the rest of their lives. I am told of one person, for instance, who was recently barred from attending her own mother’s funeral, having walked out of the sect.Former church member Ira Wagler wrote a bestseller called Growing Up Amish, the story of how he stole away in the middle of the night, aged 17 – finally quitting the church nine years later, on his fifth attempt. “People put the Amish on a pedestal but they are just people,” he tells me. “There are some very good things about their culture that I respect, now I have joined the real world. I was taken to the top of our house, given a goose wing and made to sweep steps as my job when I was only three. The message is you do not deserve anything unless it’s earned. But if someone’s barn burns down, you help rebuild it.”Wagler tells me that Amish children have little sense of the outside world. “My childhood had great security, with black-and-white boundaries in a very warm community. It was on a farm, so we worked and played – out in the fields or fishing in the creeks. I have very warm memories.” But he points out the flipside of such isolation, and the intense pressure to stay loyal to the church. “It is mind control. You knew that if you stepped outside the culture you’d go to hell. It was only in my mid-20s that I realised: you don’t have to be Amish.”Like others, he talks about the impact of technology, which many Amish recognise has confronted them with existential dilemmas. Some already use mobile phones children are secretly using social media and those with businesses often need email and a website. Meanwhile, firms and retailers are using notes and coins less a cashless society could ultimately force even the most conservative groups to adopt technology.“The smartphone is a threat to the Amish not only for the darker aspects of the internet, such as access to pornography, but also for the way it can change the way we behave,” says Erik Wesner, founder of the authoritative Amish America website. “We have all got quickly used to finding instant solutions online. These can erode traditional values that the Amish revere, such as patience and dependence upon their community. And unlike a car or pickup truck, a smartphone is easily hidden.”Yet Wesner believes the Amish will adapt, with more conservative groups resisting the digital age for as long as possible, just as some still resist electricity and modern plumbing while the majority retain defining markers such as austere clothing and a ban on car ownership. “They do gradually change, although at slower pace.”One comparatively recent adaptation has been the shift from farming to business. One study found more than 10,000 Amish-owned firms across the US – with lower failure rates than average, despite the fact that most Amish leave school at 14, making them unlikely entrepreneurs.One of the biggest is a kitchen cabinet business started by Ola Yoder in his barn two decades ago. It now churns out 6,000 units a day from an industrial park in Indiana, employing 500 staff. Unusually, Yoder, now 72, spent seven years outside the Amish in his early 20s. “I saw how other people lived and decided it was not for me or my kids,” he says, although he still has many “English” friends. He also spent time working for a major company. “They had rules about drugs and swearing, but no one enforced them,” he says. “In corporate America, it is all about climbing up the ladder.”Yoder bans mobile phones at work, asking why you would want to employ someone who is always texting, and says he sticks to Amish values in business. “Success is about finding peace within yourself and your family. For the Amish, money is just a tool to enable you to live your faith. What good would it do, to have smart cars and fly all over the world?”Before I leave Morris, with its rolling farmland and warning signs urging drivers to beware of horse-drawn buggies, Daniel tells me he knows outsiders think their approach to life looks outdated and tough. “But all those seeking freedom seem to have more traps than ever – all their cars, computers and televisions seem to make their lives more morose,” he says. “I think our lifestyle is actually easier.”That may be true. But only time will tell, as their numbers continue to rise, whether they can hold out against what Sam Weaver calls “the glitz and glamour” of the modern world.• If you would like a comment on this piece to be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine’s letters page in print, please email weekend@the, including your name and address (not for publication)."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6e2db68c686c22cb1eab938be60457422f7f472f/225_89_2182_1309/master/2182.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2a30f032f50b889a5d3d3a1e19d21694","title":"toulouse wasps european rugby champions cup report","story":"Wasps’ hopes of reaching the Champions Cup quarter-finals ended as Toulouse claimed a 42-27 bonus-point victory at the Stade Ernest-Wallon.Tries from Yoann Huget, Joe Tekori, Romain Ntamack and two from the man-of-the-match Antoine Dupont plus 17 points from the boot of Thomas Ramos secured the win for the four-times European champions, which leaves them unbeaten at the top of Pool One. Wasps scored three tries of their own through Josh Bassett, Willie le Roux and Ross Neal with Billy Searle kicking 12 points.The home side crossed for their first try within three minutes with Huget intercepting a loose pass from Le Roux in the Wasps 22 to cross at the far left corner. Wasps ground their way into the Toulouse half with Searle cutting the home side’s lead to two points with a successful penalty attempt.Thomas Young sparked the visitors into life with a 30-metre break down the touchline before being brought down. The ball was eventually recycled with Le Roux and Young showing some terrific handling to put Basset over for their first try.Toulouse hit straight back with the softest of offloads from Sofiane Guitoune releasing Tekori, who sidestepped Le Roux to score. The hosts continued to lay siege to the Wasps line as they looked to power their way over but the ball was recycled to Jerome Kaino, who put Ntamack over with a nice pass.Wasps kept coming back at their hosts with Elliot Daly breaking clear from his own 22. The England international ran all the way to the Toulouse 22 before finding Le Roux on his shoulder with the Springbok running in unopposed.Toulouse had a try disallowed just before the interval when Huget spilled the ball forward over the line after a neat pass from Ramos. Ramos and Searle exchanged penalties meaning Toulouse led 22-20 at the break.It took the home side a mere three minutes of the second half to secure the bonus-point try with Huget hitting the perfect angle before his inside pass sent Dupont over. But Searle dragged Wasps back into the game with his searing inside break releasing Le Roux who sent Neal, on his outside, flying over the try line.The home side finally pulled clear of Wasps when an offload from Zak Holmes sent Ramos racing 30 metres upfield before the full-back put Dupont over for his second try. Ramos capped a fine performance with a late penalty."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2d16f1baa42848086581eec715d14587ea317697/0_0_2853_1712/master/2853.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=47969a859d56d75d5d9857be65d4bda3","title":"the 12 saves of christmas an expert survival guide","story":"From emergency gift ideas to master mixology – via Jackson Boxer’s ballotine and Patrick Grant’s suit – experts share their must-haves and must-dos for surviving the festive season 1.

If in doubt, I now reach for Home Alone – guaranteed laughs for all ages – or White Christmas, which has that reassuring retro glow.”Smith has hosted private film events as part of the La Maison Rémy Martin members’ club2. Tim Halilaj, award-winning mixologist“People always run out of ice at Christmas parties, so the night before just fill your freezer with plastic containers of water and then hack these bergs into rugged lumps – they’re more on-trend than cubes. For totally clear ice, boil tap water, let it cool and then freeze it.”3. Shona Vertue, personal trainer (and David Beckham’s yoga teacher)“The gym seems like a distant memory over Christmas, but it doesn’t have to be that way. Type ‘HIIT’ into YouTube and do a 30-minute home workout, using nothing but your body weight to induce sweat and burn Christmas dinner calories. If nothing else, it gives you a break from the family for half an hour!”4. Garrett Moore, party planner and co-founder of Immersive Cult“Go for candlelight, scattered lamps and dim light. Some people feel self-conscious at parties and they don’t want to feel like they’re being watched, so low lighting is very conducive to good times. And create welcoming spaces where people can sit somewhere quiet and have a nice conversation if they want to. Maybe have a mistletoe area or create a little grotto-type nook. It’s nice for guests to feel like they have options and places to explore.”“I also have a bottle of Rémy Martin.

And if they’re not claimed, that’s even better, as you can just enjoy them yourself.”7. Wrapologist Kirsten Westlake, from gift-wrapping service Wrapsody“Double-sided Sellotape is my secret weapon. It’s invisible and makes the finished product appear super slick. Most people come unstuck by using too much paper, which causes bulky, messy folds. The secret is to measure before you cut and use just enough paper to meet by about a centimetre.”8. Candice Brathwaite, parenting blogger“One tried-and-tested Christmas save if you’ve got a house full of children is advent stockings. I put them up on 1 December – containing 24 tiny, totally inexpensive gifts. The most important thing is that they aren’t allowed to open their advent presents until the end of the day, so it’s the perfect bribe to try and keep them in order until the evening.”9. Patrick Grant, fashion designer“If you’re having a suit tailored, have them cut you an evening suit with both a dress vest and a cummerbund. By this simple expedient, you can wear the same suit throughout the Christmas party season. Just switch between the two, change up your pocket hanky and, hey presto, with one suit you will look subtly different but always impeccable.”Grant has hosted private fashion events as part of the La Maison Rémy Martin members’ club10. Florist Anna Potter, from Swallows and Damsons“Bowls of one kind of fruit such as apples, figs, pomegranates or pears on a table make great centrepieces. Any fruit or vegetable that has an interesting shape, colour or texture looks amazing and harks back to Christmas being about feasting. And a sprig of rosemary looks beautiful on a place setting and also smells great. Or sneak some foliage from the garden and wrap it into a leafy circle to make a mini wreath for each guest.”11. Jackson Boxer, chef and restaurateur, St Leonards and Brunswick House“I make up a large ballotine of cured foie gras loaded with black truffles and brandy. It’s good to have on hand to quell appetites if anything goes wrong and causes any delays, or anyone shows up unexpectedly. And it’s outrageously delicious smeared on top of butter-fried cold Christmas pudding – a sentiment heartily endorsed by both chefs Fergus Henderson and Jeremy Lee, who know about such things.”12. Sam Lyle, co-founder of Pines and Needles“So many people order trees that are way too big for their room and have to hack bits off. The width of the tree is typically a third of the height, so be realistic about how much space you want it to take up.

Remarkably, much of Thuringia’s cobbled streets and old stone architecture has barely changed since the time of Bach et al, so as well as touring the many museums devoted to these famous creative and intellectual figures, you have the opportunity to literally walk in their footsteps. Start right here ...Johann Sebastian Bach: baroque brought to lifeGermany’s greatest baroque composer was a jobbing musician throughout his life, and Thuringia is full of traces of his industrious career. Bach was an organist at Arnstadt, but his legacy is celebrated at the annual Thuringian Bach Festival in spring, and Eisenach (where he was born, in 1685) boasts the world’s biggest Bach museum. Housed in a splendid medieval building, the Bach House is devoted to the Bach dynasty – not only Johann Sebastian, but also his numerous musical relatives. The house is full of artefacts from Bach’s life and times, and each visit includes a short concert, played on original baroque-period instruments. If you’re a fan of classical music, you’ll also want to visit the Liszt House in nearby Weimar, where the great Hungarian composer Franz Liszt lived and worked.Martin Luther: the father of ReformationLuther spent his teenage years in Thuringia, first as a schoolboy in Eisenach, and then as a student at the University of Erfurt, graduating with an MA from its faculty of arts. While he was a student, Luther lived in Erfurt’s Augustinian Monastery (open to visitors – you can even stay the night). However, the most spectacular Luther site is Wartburg Castle, near Eisenach, where Luther hid, in disguise, from 1521 to 1522, and translated the New Testament into German – cementing the Reformation and establishing German as a national language. You can visit the room where Luther wrote his meisterwerk, where there used to be an ink stain on the wall – no longer visible – supposedly made when Luther threw an inkpot at the devil, who was trying to distract him.Johann Wolfgang von Goethe: the master of all tradesIt’s hard to overstate quite how important Goethe is to German culture. Poet, playwright, novelist, philosopher and scientist, his genius encompassed virtually every avenue of German intellectual life. Born in Frankfurt in 1749, he came to Thuringia as a young man, fresh from the success of his sensational first novel, The Sorrows of Young Werther, and spent time in Erfurt, Jena and Gotha, before settling in Weimar. The baroque house, where he lived for 50 years, until his death in 1832, is now the Goethe National Museum. There are lots of other sites associated with Goethe all over Thuringia, from the Liebhabertheatre in Kochberg Castle to the Botanical Garden in Jena.Lucas Cranach (Elder and Younger): Renaissance father and sonLucas Cranach is one of Germany’s most celebrated painters, and Thuringia is full of paintings by this Renaissance master and his son. Lucas the Elder was the better painter, but his son was almost as good, and their styles are so similar that it’s often hard to tell them apart. Born in 1472, Cranach the Elder settled in Weimar near the end of his life to live with his son’s family, and his adopted hometown is full of mementoes of his life and work. There are plenty of paintings by both Cranachs in Weimar’s Castle Museum, but the crowning glory is the magnificent altarpiece in the Church of St Peter \u0026amp St Paul, started by Cranach the Elder and completed by his son. If you’re travelling around Thuringia, don’t miss the Friedenstein Palace in Gotha and the city’s art museum in Erfurt, which both have fine Cranach collections, and St John’s Church in Neustadt an der Orla, with its precious altarpiece. However, the most atmospheric setting for Cranach’s moody masterpieces is Wartburg Castle, where Cranach’s good friend Martin Luther hid away. The castle contains several acute portraits of Luther by Cranach the Elder, as well as some intimate, perceptive studies of Luther’s parents and his wife.Walter Gropius: founder of BauhausModernist architect Walter Gropius was born in Berlin in 1883, but it was in Thuringia that he made his name. In 1919 in Weimar, he founded the Bauhaus – a revolutionary design school that transformed the way we live today. Gropius taught his students to work across a wide range of disciplines – from pottery to printmaking, and carpentry to ceramics. He taught them to throw out the chintz, to see that less is more. His house style was stark, minimal and, above all, practical. Everything he made was fit for purpose. His ideas have since become commonplace, but in the 1920s they were shocking. In 1925, local conservatives drove him out of Weimar, and when the Nazis came to power he was forced to flee abroad. Yet, here in Thuringia, his influence lives on. Next year, bauhaus museum weimar marks the centenary of the Bauhaus with a move to a smart new building – a fitting forum for the world’s oldest Bauhaus collection. There are plenty of other Bauhaus sites elsewhere in Thuringia, including the Haus Auerbach in Jena, built by Gropius, and a Bauhaus-era hotel, the Haus des Volkes, in Probstzella.Carl Zeiss: a new visionBorn in Weimar in 1816, Zeiss trained as a fine machinist in Thuringia, and in 1846 he opened a workshop in Jena, making telescopes, microscopes and other optical devices. By the time he died, in 1888, his little workshop had grown into a large factory. By the beginning of the first world war, it was the largest camera manufacturer in the world. After the second world war, the Soviets stripped the factory bare, and took much of the equipment back to Russia, but although it ended up behind the iron curtain, Zeiss held its own against western competition – and when Germany was reunified it was one of the few East German firms to survive and prosper as a viable concern. You can learn all about Zeiss at the German Optical Museum in Jena, then visit the nearby Zeiss Planetarium, fitted with state-of-the-art Zeiss telescopes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2023de63811aee4a9d67e5f9b10f3e4797ff3b14/0_54_1445_867/master/1445.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=04d8faa07753c074dcaf2e59778857ab","title":"send us a tip on a uk winter walk for the chance to win a 200 hotel voucher","story":"A good walk and fresh air are perfect for blowing away the Christmas cobwebs.

But who danced off into the Strictly sunset?And that’s the end of another Strictly year – my eighth or ninth on this liveblog, I’ve lost count. It’s been a great series, made all the better by the brilliant Strictly community down below who make me laugh every week, and make writing this blog an absolute pleasure. A huge and heartfelt thanks to you all. I’m all finished with liveblogging for this year, but as usual we’ll open a thread on Christmas Day for the Strictly Christmas Special, so you can chat amongst yourselves in the comment box. In the meantime you can find me on Twitter @heidistephens if you’d like to say hello. Have a wonderful Christmas and a happy and prosperous 2019 – see you next September and we’ll do the whole thing all over again. Keeeeeep dancing!Stace and Kevin take to the floor to ‘Simply The Best’ by Tina Turner, which I’m not sure is technically true but now is probably not the time. Time to crown a winner, HOORAY! And the winners of Strictly Come Dancing 2018 are…STACEY AND KEVIN!Well that’s rather wonderful, even though tonight wasn’t their best night. After all those years in the final, Kevin finally gets a win, so hopefully will stop banging on about it. Stacey has been wonderful, and any one of the final four couples would have been a worthy winner. What a fabulous series, I’ve loved every minute.Final montage from the judges. Don’t drink any more, I fear for your liver. Have a peppermint tea.Christmas Special promo! DRINK! I won’t be liveblogging, but we’ll open a thread so you can all play in the comment box.Time for a final dance with all the contestants! It kicks off with a VickGraziano lift, then Dr. Ranj bopping about in his white coat. Graeme is bench pressing Oti, and Susannah’s dress has about eight people camping in it. Daughter and I have stopped watching to reminisce about what a banger ‘The Boy Does Nothing’ by Alesha Dixon is. OK, we’re back. Well that was fun. Former contestant montage! DRINK. Just need a mention of Christmas and it’s a full house. Bonus dancing from Aljaz and Janette, who are the most adorable couple on and off the dancefloor. Aljaz’s sparkly jacket is outstanding, all men should have one.Time for a musical interlude, courtesy of Canadian Croonmeister Michael Buble.

Stacey and Kevin at the bottom of the Irrelevant Leaderboard, which is unexpected - their Showdance was a huge risk that may have misfired. Still think Joe and Dianne are going to grab this, but it’s a really tough one to call at this point. I’d argue Faye and Giovanni did the best dances, but Stacey and Joe have both had an epic journey and Ashley and Pasha have consistently delivered the highest quality since week one. What a series, I’ve loved it. Scores: 9,9,10,10 - a total of 38 for Joe and Dianne.

In 1807, in the midst of a struggle with Napoleonic France, HMS Leopard, a Royal Navy ship of the line, attacked, boarded and captured an American frigate, USS Chesapeake, off Norfolk, Virginia. The British claimed their action was justified by the presence on the American ship of four English deserters, whom they arrested. But, for President Thomas Jefferson, it was an outrageous, illegal infringement of the sovereignty and independence of the infant republic, eventually leading to the 1812 war.It’s fair to say the Americans never forgot lessons drawn from the Chesapeake humiliation – and have been faithfully following Britain’s script ever since. As its power grew, the US, too, assumed the right to extend its national writ beyond its shores. One modern example is the way the US justice department ruthlessly pursues foreign nationals, such as the Scottish hacker Gary McKinnon, who are deemed to have broken US law. McKinnon’s extradition was ultimately blocked in 2012 by Britain’s then home secretary, Theresa May, after a public outcry.Donald Trump’s threat to impose sweeping penalties on any country or inidual, anywhere in the world, that dares to ignore his unilateral embargo on Iran’s oil exports is another instance of extra-territorial over-reach. Like an Oriental pasha of old, Trump has graciously deigned to issue exemptions to supplicants who beg for relief. But the overall principle is clear: in its view, the US has the right to direct and control the actions of sovereign states using threats, sanctions and almost any other means at its disposal.Even liberal-minded Americans see no particular problem with such overweening, imperial power-plays – for who, some argue, can doubt that the US, as the pre-eminent  of enlightened values, acts for the best? Yet American power is no longer as all-pervasive, or trusted, as perhaps it was 30 years ago. Many contemporary states, allies included, do harbour serious doubts about US motives and intentions.Foremost among them is China – a rival, not a friend – whose furious reaction last week to the arrest in Canada, on a US warrant, of the top Huawei executive, Meng Wanzhou, showed how Washington’s presumptuous attempts to exercise universal jurisdiction have become outdated, objectionable – and increasingly unenforceable.Meng is ostensibly wanted for breaching Iran sanctions. But the wider context is more instructive than the specific, alleged offence. Huawei is the world’s largest supplier of telecommunications network equipment and second-biggest maker of smartphones, with revenue of about $92bn last year. Western spy chiefs believe its market dominance, and close association with China’s communist regime, pose a security risk. The US, Australia, New Zealand and Japan have all recently restricted use of Huawei technology.In Britain, Huawei has pledged to spend $2bn to fix security loopholes that the National Cyber Security Centre, an offshoot of the GCHQ spy agency, fears could be exploited for surveillance and data-collection. The promise followed a reportedly bad-tempered meeting last month with British officials. Huawei insists that neither Meng, nor the company, have broken the law or pose any kind of security risk.The row will intensify existing worries about Chinese state-approved investment in Britain’s next generation of nuclear power stations. Meanwhile, in a public speech, Alex Younger, the head of MI6, said Britain must decide whether it was “comfortable” with using Chinese technology in critical national infrastructure. Last week, BT gave its answer, confirming it was removing Huawei equipment from its 4G network.More broadly still, the backdrop of intensifying US-China strategic, geopolitical and economic rivalry is also germane to Meng’s arrest, as is both countries’ blatant disregard for international law. The US warrant has embarrassed Canada, partly due to suspicions that it is a politically motivated abuse of the extradition system. Although it will not admit it, China’s action last week in detaining two Canadian citizens was direct retribution, intended to pressure Ottawa into releasing Meng.There can be little doubt Meng is a highly symbolic victim of this global rivalry. Typically clueless, Trump gave the game away when he explicitly linked the possible dropping of the case against her to resolving the US-China trade war. Trump’s clumsy intervention – rapidly disavowed by his own justice department – left the US looking no better than Beijing. Both sides appear guilty of what amounts, in effect, to hostage-taking – not what the world expects from superpowers. But perhaps it’s no surprise. After all, it is learned behaviour, courtesy of the Royal Navy."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/03e1a78c5df989dd6ffd15de19e8ef5d284a4303/0_84_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ba47b875300f8e73d682c1e9f6f52155","title":"ryan zinke interior secretary steps down","story":"Donald Trump’s embattled interior secretary, Ryan Zinke, is stepping down, following a series of scandals in which he is accused of using his position for personal gain.Trump tweeted that Zinke would “be leaving the administration at the end of the year after having served for a period of almost two years”. Trump added that Zinke had “accomplished much during his tenure” and that a new secretary of the interior would be announced next week.Zinke becomes the latest official to leave Trump’s cabinet in an exodus following the 6 November midterm elections.Under Zinke’s leadership, the interior department has sought to advance oil and gas drilling and mining on or near public land, rolled back protections for threatened species and shrunk national monuments.“Zinke’s days of plundering our lands and enriching himself and his friends are over,” said Nicole Ghio, senior fossil fuels program manager for Friends of the Earth.“With an average of nearly one federal investigation opened into his conduct in office per month, Zinke’s highly questionable ethics have finally caught up with him. Now, he is just another name on Trump’s list of disgraced cabinet officials, which the Republican-led Congress has failed to hold accountable.”Gene Karpinski, president of the League of Conservation Voters, called Zinke “the most scandal-plagued interior secretary in recent memory”.He said: “The damage done by this administration’s anti-conservation policies will not be erased by his departure alone,” noting that Zinke’s replacement would continue to pursue policies friendly to the fossil-fuel industry.In a statement, Zinke said he was resigning because he could not “justify spending thousands of dollars defending myself and my family against false allegations” but was proud of his record and achievements.Zinke’s acting successor, David Bernhardt, until now the deputy secretary, is a former energy lobbyist who is expected to pursue fossil fuel development and downplay conservation. Bernhardt will take the role until a permanent replacement is confirmed by the Senate, which could take months. Brett Hartl, government affairs director for the Center for Biological Diversity, called Bernhardt the “mastermind” behind major efforts at the agency.“I don’t think anything will change in terms of what’s happening inside interior, although it’s nice Zinke’s gone,” Hartl said.Bernhardt has acknowledged the science behind climate change but said his job is to consider the administration’s goal of ramping up energy production. Last year he rescinded policies meant to give more weight to climate change and conservation in decisions about public lands.Joel Clement, a department climate scientist who resigned last year, said this week that Zinke and his staff “sidelined scientists and experts while handing the agency’s keys over to oil, gas and mining interests”.The Union of Concerned Scientists, where Clement is now a fellow, compiled a report outlining what the group has seen as anti-science moves, many of which will continue under Zinke’s successor.The department’s internal watchdog last month asked the justice department to investigate Zinke.Zinke is linked to a real estate deal with the chairman of the oil-services company Halliburton and is accused of blocking Native American tribes from expanding a casino and of redrawing the boundaries of a national monument for political reasons. He also inappropriately allowed his wife to travel with him in official vehicles and invited campaign fundraisers on a government boat tour, according to the watchdog.In Congress, Zinke would have been a top target of Democrats who won control of the House in the midterm elections and are planning oversight of Trump administration officials.In a statement, Nancy Pelosi, poised to be the next Democratic speaker of the House, attacked Zinke as beholden to corporate and industry interests and slammed the various scandals that marked his time in office.“Zinke has been a shameless handmaiden for the special interests. His staggering ethical abuses have delivered a serious and lasting blow to America’s public lands, environment, clean air and clean water.“Americans are confronted with an administration of unprecedented corruption, cronyism and incompetence, which has shown zero respect for the office or taxpayers’ money,” she said.Representative Raul Grijalva, the ranking Democrat on the House Natural Resources Committee, said he was hoping for a “genuine turning of the page”.“Secretary Zinke’s successor has a chance to move on from an unfortunate Trump administration record of environmental mismanagement and decline,” Grijalva said.Conservatives in Congress have largely supported Zinke. The Republican senator Steve Daines, who like Zinke is a Montanan, thanked Zinke “for restoring common sense management of our public lands, fighting to end the war on coal and for making the US energy dominant”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7d75b16510f4747d93ee903f48bb672b986a9059/0_2_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3743d6ee01b767967326883aaedd12bb","title":"dr congo hopes for fresh start as election looms","story":"The Avenue Salongo is the Champs-Élysées of Mbuji-Mayi, residents say. The comparison is an optimistic one. There is little that unites this strip of pitted tarmac, with its pair of faltering streetlights and sweltering central African humidity, with the famously beautiful Parisian boulevard – other than the French language spoken on both.The Avenue Salongo’s only hotel is the pole, where paunchy political fixers drink strong beer in a “salon bar” furnished with much smoked glass and heavy fake leather furniture. Opposite is a row of diamond dealers, where local artisanal “diggers” sell stones scrabbled from red earth in makeshift mines among the verdant hills around the city. An understocked pharmacy, a restaurant selling grilled offal and the Couture de la Paix dress shop complete the scene.Last week, however, the DRC’s third-largest city enjoyed a day that was one of the most exciting anyone could remember for a long time, triggered by the arrival of one of the main opposition candidates in forthcoming presidential elections.This vast resource-rich country – with its population of 80 million spread over an area the size of western Europe – will go to the polls in seven days. The DRC has never known a peaceful transition of power since its hasty independence from Belgium in 1960. The fall of the dictator Mobutu Sese Seko in 1997 triggered a civil war in which four million died. Joseph Kabila, the president, has been in power since his father, the victor of that conflict, was shot dead in 2001.The forthcoming polls have inspired both great trepidation – and great hope. “We need a change, a big change. We live so badly,” said Angela, 21, a student. Angela, who did not want to give her family name for fear of attracting ennuis or troubles, had walked across the city to the Avenue Salongo very early in the morning to greet opposition candidate Félix Tshisekedi. She had first tried to reach the airport on the outskirts of Mbuji-Mayi, but had turned back when police clashed with stone-throwing youths and a teenager was shot dead. “I am best here. I will wait for him. He is our president. He is worth it,” Angela said.Mbuji-Mayi is the capital of the province of Kasai-Oriental. Tshisekedi is from the region, and this is his stronghold. His father, Etienne Tshisekedi, was a famous opposition leader under Mobutu. He died last year and his son has inherited his party, and with it a slim chance of winning power.No one doubts the problems any president of the DRC will face. The country is one of the poorest in the world, wracked by war and disease. Inequality is off the charts with wealthy grosses legumes – or fat cats – driving Jaguars over the potholes of streets in the capital Kinshasa. Huge sums earned from mining contracts disappearing into the pockets of those close to le pouvoir, or power elite.In the east, scores of militia commanders battle for control of mines and an outbreak of Ebola has killed more than 300. In the Kasais – the name given to the provinces around Mbuji-Mayi – the grass is yet to grow over the mass graves left by a conflict between rebels and government forces in which thousands died between 2016 and last summer.Across the country, aid agencies estimate that 4.3 million people are displaced. In the rolling valleys around Mbuji-Maya, half the children may be malnourished. Cholera has killed hundreds since 2016.The country’s manifold problems have been exacerbated by the refusal of Kabila to leave power after the end of his second mandate two years ago. Only under fierce pressure from neighbouring and nearby powers, particularly Angola and South Africa, did he agree not to stand in the coming polls, even if he is constitutionally barred from serving three consecutive terms. “He was very unhappy, very angry and resentful,” said one diplomat close to the negotiations with Kabila. Instead, the ruling coalition picked the little-known interior minister, Emmanuel Ramazani Shadary, as its candidate.In Kinshasa, aides insisted Shadary was his own man. “Our candidate was chosen by a broad cross section of Congolese society. He has his own programme and personality,” said a spokesperson.The opposition has been weakened by internal arguments and the exclusion by the electoral commission of two political heavyweights: Jean-Pierre Bemba, a former warlord, and Moïse Katumbi, a popular tycoon.Critics say Tshisekedi is unproven, inexperienced and lacks the charisma of his father. “His father was a man of the country. The son is very limited,” said Valentin Mubake, a former secretary-general of Tshisekedi’s Union for Democracy and Social Progress.Many are worried about new electronic voting machines. Not only are these impractical in the harsh conditions of the DRC, where electricity is unreliable or non-existent, but they could be vulnerable to manipulation, opposition leaders claim.Last week 7,000 voting machines in Kinshasa were destroyed in a suspected arson attack, stoking fears of interference. A result seen as illegitimate by much of the population might lead to protests, violence and even war. “Imagine what would happen if there was chaos here. Imagine Libya but on the scale of the Congo. Imagine what that would do to the region, to the continent,” said Mubake.Yet such fears did not dampen the enthusiasm for Tshisekedi in Mbuji-Mayi. Through the morning, despite the continuing reports of further delays to the candidate’s arrival, crowds continued to gather on the Avenue Salongo, singing in praise of their “hero”.By early afternoon, hundreds of young people were running and singing in rhythm along the road. Some carried palm fronds. Armed police watched nonchalantly. “Something has to change. Life is too hard. There’s no clean water, power. Most of us here don’t have enough to eat. The prices are double what they were a year ago. We struggle,” said Joseph Kabula, a trader who supports his wife and two small children by selling mobile phones he fetches from Kinshasa, 800 miles away.Finally, in the early evening, with the crowds now thick all along the Avenue Salongo, sirens are heard, music and cheering. The candidate is on his way. Sitting on the cab of an SUV, Tshisekedi is smiling, bespectacled, rotund, sweating. He waves and then is swept away among supporters surging down the road. “He is going to save us. I know it. He is our saviour. He will bring light into our darkness,” Angela says, when the noise and crowds have subsided."},{"url":null,"title":"charity prints from the irish times","story":" photographers have produced a gallery of images that will make a unique Christmas gift.

Photograph: Dave MeehanSome, but not all.On Tuesday night as he made his big decision, any notions Micheál Martin might have had of coaxing one of his favourite deputies (after John McGuinness and Eamon Ó Cuív to his cause were soon proved wide of the Marc. It is to his credit that he managed to put a brave face on things when he addressed the Dáil on Wednesday afternoon and then somehow found the strength to follow this up with a media briefing on the plinth.One can only image the maelstrom of emotions swirling around Micheál’s head as he contemplated the devastating letter he received the night before from Marc MacSharry, Fianna Fáil’s bumptious baritone of the backbenches.Having launched his missive, MacSharry circulated it to a number of colleagues.We cannot reproduce all of it, because it’s Christmas and the newspaper can’t bear another supplement.Micheál blood will have run cold when he read the ominous opening paragraph of the 780-word communication.Marc goes on to say that continuing with the confidence-and-supply arrangement will make the party irrelevant. “An extension of even a day is an endorsement of the last 3 years with all its flaws and scandals. We cannot propose any real policy different to FG for fear of precipitating a crisis and or election, we shuffle between 4 and 8 behind them in opinion polls depending exclusively on the sum of the efforts in ground hurling by our TDs candidates, senators and Cllr’s to stay in the game but the common perception now is there is no tangible difference between us. We have morphed into FG in the public conscience.”Had the party gone for “national government rather than coalition” in 2016, he believed Micheál would be Taoiseach now.“Granted my Effrontery in going solo at the time is one of the probable many reasons for my exclusion since but look that ship has sailed. I was right though. The Brexit cover story is a red herring.”The Sligo TD points out that elections have continued throughout Europe despite Brexit and he feels an extension of article 50 beyond March “is certainly likely”. Meanwhile, the country is close to full employment and the housing and health crises need to be addressed.“The point here is we risk more permanent damage to the party by staying in,” he tells Micheál. “Staying in buys time but for what ?? More time to become even less relevant?? How and when do we get our policy out there. How do beat them up on policy ??”And when will the leadership seek more input and share information with the rest of the party?“We need unity of course but as I said before Unity flows from shared ownership. You have worked harder than any leader ever and you deserve to be Taoiseach more than any of them. Please do not renew this .Thanks for reading. Marc.”He’ll not last the year, at this rate. And he’s not the only one.Can a heave, or a split, be far off?A sweet little story this week from Leinster House as the Dáil prepares to rise for the Christmas break.It concerns American student Maeve Price, one of a group of overseas interns who have just completed a semester working with Irish parliamentarians. The programme is organised by the Institute of Public Administration.Maeve, who is studying education and communication at Denison University in Ohio, was assigned to the office of the Fianna Fáil TD for Meath East, Thomas Byrne.She told him about her parents, John and Patricia, who eloped to Sligo in 1993 and were married in Rosses Point. It wasn’t a total surprise to their folks in New Jersey, because the young couple became engaged in August of that year before they decided to make a break for Ireland and tie the knot in Yeats country.They had ties to the west of Ireland – their great-grandparents came from Galway and Mayo – and John was a great admirer of WB’s poetry.And so, with help from a priest back home, who contacted Msgr Jennings and Sr Joseph in Rosses Point, a wedding was organised. Locals pitched in with help when they heard the story and two teenagers, brother and sister Frank and Carina Mitchell, were drafted in as best man and maid of honour.Fast forward a quarter of a century, and Maeve is on a call to her mom back home in Jersey. She mentions that Thomas Byrne is a solicitor who also qualified for the New York bar. This was a co-incidence as her brother Jack is currently studying for the New York bar.“Then mom remembered that Frank told her he was going to study law. She said to me: “Just ask Thomas if he knows Frank,” Maeve recalls, adding that Ireland may be a small place, but not that small.“It was so random that my mom thought to even ask Thomas.

Repealed! It doesn’t exist.”He turned, looked in her direction and countered “Don’t get so emotional.”Then Terry took grave umbrage at charges that his comment was misogynistic. “I’m not referring to any sex . . . I see more emotion here with David Norris than I do for any of you,” he told the women, withdrawing his remark if it had offended anyone.There then followed a most curious exchange of words.Senator Leyden appeals to the chair, claiming he is being shouted down. “In fairness now, you have to admit that they’re really coming on top of me here at the moment now, big time. In fairness now.”“We’ll get the violins out,” shrugs Lynn Ruane.“Don’t get emotional, Terry,” smiles Ivana Bacik.“There is nobody coming on top of you, I can guarantee you that,” declares Marie-Louise O’Donnell, with an even bigger smile.David Norris isn’t going to be left out. “I’d need to be more emotional than I am to get on top of you.”Brian O’Domhnaill, sitting behind Terry, is grinning away as the sound of chortling senators fills the chamber.Terry looks to the chair again. “Sorry, cathaorleach, you’ll have to, kind of, delete some of these comments which I think are very unsuitable, actually.”We are making no comment on the above. Just leaving it out there.And to think, we almost abolished the Upper House.It was a female first for Irish politics in the Royal Irish Academy in Dublin on Wednesday evening when four distinguished politicians spoke from the same platform for the first time in their long careers.

Photograph: Henry NichollsReutersThe Huffington Post reported on Thursday that Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party was in talks with the DUP “at a senior level” to try to find “common ground” on the way forward.That was viewed as shorthand for the DUP possibly being prepared to support a no-confidence motion that Corbyn may be scheming against May and her government in order to force a British general election – an election that could usher in a British Labour government Such a scenario would seem to border on the incredible given that Corbyn’s friendship with Gerry Adams and Sinn Féin and his support for a united Ireland are well known.The DUP said its MPs were “talking to people on all sides of the House” of Commons but that its current focus was on urging the British prime minister to convince the European Union to change the terms of the UK-EU withdrawal agreement to get rid of the backstop in its current form.The DUP, the party added, “would not support a no-confidence motion” in the British government when Theresa May is involved in lobbying the EU to alter the withdrawal agreement.But equally the DUP is not ruling anything out. Arlene Foster and Nigel Dodds and Sammy Wilson are playing a very tough tactical game at the moment to force the abandonment or emasculation of the backstop in the withdrawal agreement designed to ensure a soft North-South border post Brexit. One senior party source reflected that hard-ball negotiating attitude when it was put to him that surely the DUP would never do anything that would see Jeremy Corbyn in charge of deciding the future of the “precious union”.The source told The , “In circumstances where the Tory leader was prepared to undermine the union by trying to force through an unacceptable withdrawal agreement then it would be better to deal with the person who would stab you in the front than the person who would stab you in the back.”The same source was equally confident that in any general election it would at least hold its 10 seats, again notwithstanding the support for the withdrawal agreement from the business, farming and voluntary sectors of Northern Ireland.But when the Ulster Farmers’ Union (UFU), normally so sympathetic to the DUP, comes out in favour of the withdrawal agreement surely the party should have concerns?The source wasn’t impressed with this argument. He said at the winter fair in Lisburn on Thursday a steady stream of farmers made it known to DUP MEP Diana Dodds at the party stand that it opposed what the leadership of the UFU was saying.He was conscious too of a widespread contention that the DUP just “don’t get” how serious are the stakes here. But he felt that those same people “don’t get” how unionists react when there is a perceived threat to the union. And the backstop requiring a border down the Irish Sea was a threat, he was 100 per cent certain, again notwithstanding Irish, British and EU commitments to the consent principle of the Belfast Agreement where change in the constitutional status of Northern Ireland only could be effected through a majority vote of the people of the North.He asserted, “If Theresa May tries to railroad through a withdrawal agreement against our will then we would have to review the confidence-and-supply agreement, and she can’t get the agreement through without our votes.”That was putting it up to Theresa May to extract a new deal from Brussels, regardless of the fact that the word so far from the EU is that while there can be assurances that it is unlikely the backstop ever will be used, there can be no legal changes to the agreement.The DUP wants more, however, and, it was clear from this source, it was prepared to exert the gravest of threats to try to achieve that objective. One idea, he said, that could be tried would be the removal of the backstop and a legally binding addition to the withdrawal agreement stating that under no circumstances would there be a hard border between the North and South.The same source was conscious that many people in Dublin, Belfast, Brussels and London believed that the DUP was shooting itself so many times in the foot that it was running out of foot, and that ultimately rather than safeguarding the union, it was undermining that which it asserts to love and cherish.He was aware too of the ridicule and lampooning of the likes of Foster and Dodds on social and other media. “We don’t worry, Arlene and Nigel are thick-skinned, and anyway we are getting our message across to MPs in the House of Commons.”And while the source did not put it like this it was implicit that he felt that people appalled, bemused or shocked by the DUP tactics failed to understand that when unionists say “not an inch” that is precisely what they mean.“This is not about us being uber unionists,” said the well-placed source seeking to promote some understanding of the DUP position. “But this is about the union, and once you start threatening the union it is a very serious thing to do. And remember every single unionist party is on the same page as us.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches. See more here.

Photograph: Geert Vanden WijngaertAP“A year ago,” Donald Tusk told journalists, “we promised concrete steps to strengthen the Economic and Monetary Union. Today, leaders delivered on this promise.”The President of the European Council was trying manfully to suggest that the EU summit was not simply preoccupied with Brexit. Life goes on. Although the Brexit issue was unavoidable at the final press conference.British Prime Minister Theresa May had said that talks would restart with the union immediately to complete the business left undone over the past two days.\u0026nbsp Mr Tusk said that although he had no mandate for more talks and that the withdrawal agreement was inviolable, he was “always at Mrs May’s disposal”. Most expect another summit in January.\u0026nbsp Concerned that perhaps the leaders were not being seen in the media as sufficiently sympathetic to MPs’ concerns about getting out of the backstop, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said that “a second after approval by the British and European parliaments of the withdrawal agreement we will start negotiations” on the future relationship.He acknowledged “deep mistrust” in the Commons of the EU’s intentions, but the union was determined that the backstop should not last one day more than necessary. It will be suspended when agreement is in place on an alternative which does an equal job in protecting the frictionless border.He insisted that the EU treated the British prime minister with great respect – better, in fact, than many British MPs.The leaders agreed two important elements of economic and monetary union reform – the creation of a common backstop for the banking Single Resolution Fund, a means of ensuring the fund can cope with even the biggest defaults.And secondly, \u0026nbspto give the European Stability Mechanism, the union’s state bailout arm, stronger powers to prevent and manage financial crises.The move would “significantly strengthen the monetary union”, Mr Juncker said, adding that the leaders had also indicated their support for recently announced Commission plans to bolster the international standing and use of the euro.The leaders agreed to ask the European Commission to continue its work on a stabilisation and competitiveness fund that would help sates weather internal and external economic shocks. They agreed that funding for the measures would come from the EU’s next seven-year budget, the MFF.Chancellor Angela Merkel told journalists that the “Franco-German proposal for a euro zone budget has been controversial so far and therefore we were asked to explain it again before the council. We have adopted substantial parts of what Macron has proposed, the French president was quite satisfied, we made good contribution with the Franco-German co-operation.”\u0026nbsp Mr Juncker said that the leaders’ debate on the MFF, which saw little more than a formal restatement of member-state starting positions, and the work done by the Austrian presidency in crafting the complex “negotiating box” setting out options, would allow the incoming Romanian presidency to accelerate discussions.He expressed disappointment that the leaders had been unable to advance the asylummigration reform package debate, accusing some member states of “hypocrisy” over their lukewarm support for commission proposals to strengthen the EU coastal and border service.\u0026nbspFive elements of a seven-element migration package were close to agreement, but supporters of reform of the “Dublin” regulation to increase support for front-line states by sharing resettlements refuse to split the package. They fear that to do so will see Dublin reform consigned to an indefinite future.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches. See more here.

Photograph: Geert VandenAPTaoiseach Leo Varadkar has said that there are “limitations” to any assistance to what the EU can offer the British Prime Minister Theresa May to help her get the withdrawal treaty passed.Mr Varadkar said that he and other EU leaders wanted to be as helpful as possible to Mrs May in her attempts to get the withdrawal treaty through Westminster, “but there are limitations to that”.“We can’t get into a situation where we’re contradicting anything that is in the legal text of the treaty that’s been agreed,” he told a press conference after the conclusion of the EU summit in Brussels today.Mr Varadkar said there was no agreement on what clarifications or declarations or assurances that Mrs May might want, echoing a frustration with the British prime minister evident among other EU leaders over the two-day meeting which was, once again, dominated by Brexit. Mr Varadkar stressed the EU’s wish to help Mrs May, but added: “That is contingent on her understanding that there are limitations.” Earlier, Mrs May acknowledged it will not be possible to reopen the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement to alter the backstop provisions which have sparked mass rebellion among Conservative MPs. She said Britain would have have talks with the EU over the coming days about how to obtain “further assurances” which might persuade MPs to back the deal.In a press conference at the end of the European Council summit in Brussels, Mrs May said she had a “robust” discussion with European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker.She insisted she had been “crystal clear” about the UK’s need for firmer assurances that the backstop cannot become permanent. Video footage of the conversation showed a clearly angry Mrs May apparently berating Mr Juncker for saying that her address to leaders of the 27 remaining states on Thursday evening had been “nebulous”. Mrs May welcomed the official conclusions issued by the EU27 which committed the EU to trying to get a post-Brexit trade deal agreed quickly enough to avoid the need for a backstop to keep the Irish border open.“The EU is clear, as I am, that if we are going to leave with a deal, this is it,” she said.Mrs May’s hopes of a legally binding commitment on the backstop from the EU27 were dashed on Thursday, when Mr Juncker said there could be “no real changes” to the Withdrawal Agreement negotiated over 18 months.Meanwhile, British Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said: “The last 24 hours have confirmed that Theresa May’s Brexit deal is dead in the water. “The Prime Minister has utterly failed in her attempts to deliver any meaningful changes to her botched deal. Rather than ploughing ahead and dangerously running down the clock, the Prime Minister needs to put her deal to a vote next week so Parliament can take back control,” Mr Corbyn said. - Additional reporting PADeal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph: Daniel Leal-OlivasAFPGetty ImagesBritish foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt said on Saturday that the British parliament could back prime minister Theresa May’s deal if lawmakers received assurances from the European Union, but warned that a no deal Brexit was still on the table.Mrs May pulled a vote on her deal this week after acknowledging it would be heavily defeated over concerns about the orce agreement’s “backstop”, an insurance policy designed to avoid any hard land border for Ireland but which critics say could bind Britain to EU rules indefinitely.“When the dust has settled, the only way we’re going to get this through the House of Commons ... is to have a version of the deal that the government has negotiated,” Mr Hunt told BBC radio.Following a summit in Brussels on Friday, Mrs May said it was possible that the EU could give further guarantees that the backstop would be temporary although the bloc’s other 27 leaders told her they would not renegotiate the treaty.Mr Hunt said the EU was likely to make concessions to avoid Britain leaving without any deal, a scenario that both sides say would be highly damaging for business and their economies.“The EU cannot be sure that if they choose not to be helpful and flexible ... that we would not end up with no deal,” Mr Hunt said. “We cannot in these negotiations take no deal off the table. I don’t think the EU could be remotely sure that if we don’t find a way through this we wouldn’t end up with no deal.”The Times newspaper reported on Saturday that most of Mrs May’s senior ministerial team thought her deal was dead and were discussing a range of options including a second referendum.“Brexit is in danger of getting stuck - and that is something that should worry us all,” pensions minister Amber Rudd wrote in the Daily Mail newspaper.“If MPs (lawmakers) dig in against the Prime Minister’s deal and then hunker down in their different corners, none with a majority, the country will face serious trouble.”–Reuters Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Those are welcome. This is the clearest statement we have had yet from the European Union that it is their intention for the backstop never to be necessary, that it is their intention to ensure that if it were necessary it was only temporary and that it’s their intention to work quickly with us once we’ve seen the deal being agreed in parliamentary terms, that they will work quickly with us to ensure that we start those negotiations about a future partnership,” she said.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThe prime minister postponed a vote in parliament on the Brexit deal this week after it became clear it would be defeated heavily.

She said afterwards that she had been “crystal clear” in her presentation and that Mr Juncker had explained his remark.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp“I had a robust discussion with Jean-Claude Juncker. I think that’s the sort of discussion you’re able to have when you’ve developed a working relationship and you work together.

It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination.

The producers of Only Fools and Horses The Musical have accused the makers of a cabaret-style dinner show inspired by the BBC characters of infringing copyright and presenting a “low quality” version of the classic sitcom.Phil McIntyre Entertainments (PME) is promoting the musical, which opens at the Theatre Royal Haymarket in February with the endorsement of the estate of John Sullivan, who wrote the long-running sitcom.It alleges its rights have been infringed by Interactive Theatre International (ITI) after it created a cabaret-style show inspired by the series. The London-based immersive theatre company began touring Only Fools, The Cushty Dining Experience in the UK in September before taking up residence in a Radisson Blu Edwardian hotel in central London in October.That company said the show, which promises to “transport audiences to The Nags Head for wheeling, dealing and eating”, was innocent of copyright infringement as it does not use scripts or music from the original show.According to ITI, lawyers instructed by the John Sullivan estate wrote to the company earlier this year to warn it against using material but received no further contact. According to ITI, PME allegedly accused it of acting without a licence, not paying royalties to Sullivan’s estate and presenting a “low quality show”.The show aims to “transport audiences to The Nags Head for wheeling, dealing and eating”ITI responded by threatening its own legal action against PME unless the row was resolved amid claims that its business was being damaged.PME said it was unhappy with ITI’s theatrical dining experiences and accused the company of presenting a performances based on Only Fools and Horses that do not compensate the original creators, while it (PME) offered an authorised production that did.  The Sullivan estate did not respond to requests for comment.  The row began in 2015 when ITI unveiled Faulty Towers The Dining Experience, which is still presented in Britain and Australia. At the same time, John Cleese, the original series star and co-writer, launched a theatre show with PME.

There was a really close and important relationship there, but whether it was physical or not we\u0027ll never know.Emma Stone plays Abigail in The FavouriteThe Queen and the Duchess were friends from girlhood, in a relationship which persisted until Churchill and her husband were dismissed from court in 1711. The falling out is believed to have been over the amount of time the Queen was spending with the younger Abigail. Before that, Churchill had been one of the most powerful women in England, exerting significant political influence over the Queen, who reigned from 1702-1714. Anne turning to other advisers is also thought to have soured relations. As well as intrigue over her relationship with Churchill, Queen Anne\u0027s personal life is notable for the tragedy of her struggles to have children. Of 18 pregnancies, only one child lived, William Duke of Gloucester. He died aged just 11 in 1700. As Queen, she over saw the 1707 Act of Union which combined England and Scotland into a single kingdom with one parliament, flag, coinage and customs union. Asked why Queen Anne had been forgotten, Mr Storey: Her reign was short, and a lot of attention is given to the Stuart monarchs who come before her.But actually her reign changed Britain forever and gave us the UK as we know it today. It is incredibly important for the history of the UK.Kensington Palace has turned over its Queen\u0027s Gallery for the exhibition, displaying the costumes made by Sandy Powell, a three-time Oscar winner, who has used inspiration from real 18th century styles mixed with modern fabrics alongside quotes from Powell and historic context provided by Historic Royal Palaces.Strictly Come Dancing 2018 final, live: Stacey Dooley and Kevin Clifton crowned champions despite finishing bottom of judges\u0026#39 scoreboardJeremy Hunt: UK will \u0026#39flourish and prosper\u0026#39 if it walks away from the EU without a dealChester Zoo fire: Orang-utans saved from blaze at \u0026#39monsoon forest\u0026#39Millennials driving trend for canned wine to avoid binge drinkingScrabble\u0026#39s word of ze year is gender neutral, and potentially high scoringRSPCA declares \u0026#39horse crisis\u0026#39 as over-breeding leads to rise in neglectComment: If Macron can’t reform his country, how can he hope to save the faltering EU?Police given drama lessons to improve detection of coercive control Revealed: Smuggled Albanians forced to work in intensive cannabis farmsOnly Fools and Horses dining experience accused of copyright by musical producersUK weather: Storm Deirdre brings freezing rain and black ice as Met Office issues amber alertKate Winslet and Saoirse Ronan to star in film portraying fictional romance between Mary Anning and another womanJerome Corsi: Mueller probe suspect using investigation to promote his conspiracy theoriesJennifer Lawrence denies she ever slept with \u0026#39predator\u0026#39 Harvey WeinsteinGandhi dynasty returns from the shadows as reluctant heir finds golden touchComment: Banning ‘harmful’ adverts?

As a result, rents are expected to rise “modestly” over the next year, RICS said.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

That Mike Ashley. Has the FT taken leave of its senses? The same title that exposed the scandal of the macho bad behaviour surrounding the Presidents Club dinner now praising the business boss who vomited into a fireplace after consuming 12 pints in a pub during a management meeting?Actually, the FT is right. The source of the applause was the memo Ashley sent to the Debenhams board, expressing anger at their refusal of a £40m interest-free loan and equity injection from his Sports Direct chain, the department store group’s biggest shareholder. In no uncertain terms, Ashley maps out the lie of the land for the Debenhams directors. It’s not pretty: “November was the worst November for retailers in living memory the market is saying Debenhams has no credit insurance advisers and banks are telling suppliers they should not trade with the firm at a level above which they can afford to lose suppliers are managing themselves out of stores product is being discounted to try and realise some cash.” And, says Ashley, with a final flourish: “Additionally, it is speculated that the company currently has a zero chance of survival.”Sports Direct boss issues warning to Debenhams in leaked letterCan Mike Ashley turn around the high street when no one else is tryingMike Ashley tells MPs: ‘The internet is killing the high street’Mike Ashley ‘demands’ meeting with MPs to discuss high street crisisPhew. That’s telling them. And that’s the point. Because too few senior business people tell it how it is, for fear of provoking upset and spoiling relationships. Too many of their advisers seek to please, not help. The result is that they carry on existing in a bubble. Decisions that should be taken aren’t, boards do not confront reality, and instead, carry on their sweet way. Opportunities to act, to do something, are lost, with the result that when the C-suite does decide to move it’s often too late. For injecting a dose of reality into proceedings, and, hopefully, making the Debenhams top brass sit up and see sense, Ashley deserves much credit. At the very least, they cannot maintain they were not made aware. His straight-talking is commendable and authoritative – Ashley, don’t forget, is immersed in retail, and is grappling on a daily basis with the same landscape that is confronting Debenhams.It would be disastrous if the time-honoured establishment reaction to the likes of Ashley, of labelling him as an upstart, as someone not to be taken seriously, was pursuedIt’s Ashley as well, as the head of an empire that along with Sports Direct includes lingerie firm Agent Provocateur, Evans Cycles, luxury fashion chain Flannels, the House of Fraser department stores, and major holdings in Debenhams and French Connection, who is warning loudly about the dire future facing the high street. Rising rents and growing popularity of online shopping paint a bleak prospect, one that he says could be improved by a tax on firms who generate 20 per cent of their revenues from the internet.As with Debenhams, Ashley does not pull his punches, telling MPs, the high street is heading for extinction\u0026nbspunless radical action was taken and warning them: “I’m not Father Christmas.”I never imagined I’d write this: we need more Mike Ashleys. Not the bad boy Ashley, but the one who is prepared to speak out, to stand up and to be counted.What’s striking is just how few major retailers are prepared to voice their fears and frustrations. We’re entering a season of renewed woe in the industry, of yet more dismal sets of results and closures – but the silence, the sense of inertia, will be resounding.In private, they’re all complaining and moaning like mad. But, hidebound by conservatism, afraid of rocking the boat, of drawing attention to themselves and somehow being seen as in trouble, they’re saying very little in public.The result is that it’s not just the directors of Debenhams who are able to kid themselves, but trade associations, industry organisations, MPs, media, councils, landlords, trade unions. They, along with the retailers, should all be campaigning to save our high streets, highlighting the imbalance between digital and bricks and mortar, pointing up the ridiculous nature of the business rates system, stating categorically that thousands of jobs are going to perish – not to mention the knock-on effects to communities.There’s a bit of noise, but it’s scattergun, and nowhere near concerted or loud enough. The fact it’s fallen to Ashley to say something, speaks volumes.All credit to him, though. Of course he’s got a vested interest, as he has in Debenhams. But if he does not protest, who will? Hopefully, the directors of Debenhams will wake up, along with the MPs he was addressing.It would be disastrous if the time-honoured establishment reaction to the likes of Ashley, of labelling him as an upstart, as someone not to be taken seriously, was pursued. The time for retreating into the bunker, and hoping the danger will pass, has gone. The Debenhams board must act, and act now. Likewise, where the broader state of the high street is concerned, we need action and we need it now. Mike Ashley, a saviour. Who would have thought it?

As a result, rents are expected to rise “modestly” over the next year, RICS said.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

According to the letter, obtained by the , Mr Ashley offered Debenhams a £40m interest-free loan, which was rejected. In his message, the Sports Direct owner said: “November was the worst November for retailers in living memory.”For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialCan Mike Ashley turn around the high street when no one else is tryingMike Ashley tells MPs: ‘The internet is killing the high street’Sports Direct set for stormy AGM but Mike Ashley will win in the end“Additionally it is speculated that the company currently has a zero chance of survival.”Earlier this year, Debenhams announced plans to close up to 50 shops, putting 4,000 jobs at risk. The cuts are being made in an attempt to slash costs, after the company reported its biggest ever loss of £492m in the year to 1 September. Sports Direct currently holds 29.7 per cent of Debenhams, just shy of the 30 per cent threshold at which an offer for the remainder of the company must be made, according to the UK takeover code. Mr Ashley said in his letter that he was concerned that the Debenhams board “doesn’t really seem to appreciate” the position that the company is in “and their responsibility to shareholders”. He added: “Sports Direct is Debenhams’ largest shareholder. What we are offering is a very public statement of support at a critical time for the Debenhams business.”The letter concluded with a request that Mr Bucher reconsider the offer of a loan, and respond by “lunch time Friday”. A spokesperson for Debenhams said: “We welcome Sports Direct’s proposal as a clear demonstration of their willingness to support the company. “However, as the offer came with conditions that could affect the interests of other stakeholders, while the board does not think it could accept the proposal, as presented, it has invited Sports Direct to engage as part of our broader refinancing process.”Shares in Debenhams were down 4.89 per cent to 5.45 at close of trading on Thursday, while Sports Direct’s stock tumbled by 14.8 per cent to 235.40. Earlier in the day, Sports Direct issued a trading update for the first half and revealed that House of Fraser had lost £31.5m in the first 11 weeks after the discount retailer bought it out of administration.Sports Direct also recently purchased Evans Cycles from its administrators.

Newtownabbey, Co Antrim“Some argue it is actually increasing in intensity,” astronomy blogger Dave\u0026nbspSamuhel\u0026nbsptold the website.The key to the\u0026nbspGeminids’ consistency is the celestial object that has triggered the meteor shower each year since the\u0026nbsp1800s, which orbits the Sun every 550 days or so.3. It’s named after the Gemini constellationThe\u0026nbspGeminids’ name is no accident: once it enters Earth’s atmosphere, the meteor shower seems to be coming from the Gemini constellation.In order to spot the\u0026nbspGeminid\u0026nbspmeteor shower, you should thus be looking towards the Gemini constellation, which is well positioned from\u0026nbsp10pm, the American Meteor Society explained.This gives the\u0026nbspGeminids\u0026nbspa rare status as a major shower experiencing significant activity before midnight.4. It’s also linked to a Greek godSo what exactly causes the\u0026nbspGeminid meteor shower?

Harrison Ford’s daring archaeologist is almost always out of his depth but has impeccable underdog charm, and Douglas Slocombe’s casually stunning cinematography is matched by one of John Williams\u0027s finest scores. Indy is ultimately irrelevant to the entire plot, interestingly, but his indefatigable effort to do the right thing still inspires. HO242 The Wings of the Dove (1997)Henry James is notoriously difficult to adapt well, but here is the darkly shimmering exception. Helena Bonham Carter still hasn’t topped Kate Croy, conniving but also trapped by her circumstances, as a leading role the masquerade of her and Linus Roache\u0027s motives makes the film a psychological thriller of sorts. Iain Softley directs the Venice sequences with bewitching gamesmanship, then tears your heart out at the end. PSJapanese animation legend Hayao Miyazaki\u0027s films delight kids with their bright colours, imaginative characters and plucky heroines (usually). But there\u0027s meat to their bones for adults to digest, especially in this towering fantasy epic. As young Chihiro takes a job in a mysterious bathhouse peopled by spirits in order to save her parents, viewers can explore everything from deeply rooted interpretations of traditional Japanese myth to Miyazaki\u0027s fascination with Western filmmaking and the Second World War. And visually it’s unparalleled. HOLuis Buñuel and Salvador Dalí changed the face of cinema with this 16-minute-long Surrealist short, instantly confronting the viewer with the sight of an eyeball being slit open. Narrative is jettisoned, and the unnerving power of juxtaposition championed in dreamlike montage, which still has a fizzing voltage and suggestive power. PSYes, but hear us out: Avengers is a grand experimental film. Marvel risked four popular franchises on this superhero throw of the dice, something never attempted in cinema history. They won, and made the fizzing chemistry of the unlikely gang who must save us from aliens look easy. But the failure of every Marvel imitator since makes clear how impressive this billion-dollar gamble really was, and how difficult it is to tell character-driven stories in blockbuster cinema on this scale. And as a bonus, it has a Hulk. HOYes, but hear us out: Avengers is a grand experimental film.

But the failure of every Marvel imitator since makes clear how impressive this billion-dollar gamble really was, and how difficult it is to tell character-driven stories in blockbuster cinema on this scale. And as a bonus, it has a Hulk. HO742 Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1978)One of those remakes that justifies remakes, Philip Kaufman’s beautifully skilful spin on the McCarthy-era alien-clone thriller translates it wickedly to the psychobabble age of the 1970s, with a bit of post-Watergate panic thrown in. Donald Sutherland’s lugubrious health inspector is a nicely grumpy enemy of the pod people, and the hysteria ratchets up masterfully. PSWes Anderson\u0027s meticulously mannered and beautifully composed films are not to all tastes, but when combined with a cast of this calibre and a more-than-usually heartfelt script, they are capable of magic. Gene Hackman plays the disgraced patriarch of a family of geniuses, making one last attempt at redemption. With a who’s who of Hollywood in support, it’s a story that is as bizarre, hilarious and moving as family life itself. HO942 Lawrence of Arabia (1962)David Lean’s First World War epic about TE Lawrence remains a filmmaking milestone, the movie that Steven Spielberg rewatches before starting each new film. Its genius is to combine huge scale battles – notably the attack on Aqaba – with psychological insight into the toll that the war took on Lawrence’s mind. The white-led casting of Arab characters is appalling to modern eyes, but with its daring, dazzling filmmaking it remains one to watch despite that. HOA devastating portrait of the poverty trap, Vittorio De Sica’s neo-realist masterpiece remains all too relevant. Antonio (Lamberto Maggiorani) is offered a desperately-needed job – but it requires a bicycle, and when his is stolen he and his son resort to desperate measures to get it back. Shot with non-professional actors who lived in circumstances close to that of their characters, this is a study in compassion and empathy. HOSpanning five decades of Chinese history, this sprawling epic follows two stars of the Peking Opera from harsh childhood training through the perils of the Second World War, the Communist takeover and the Cultural Revolution. Director Chen Keige drew on his own experience of the Cultural Revolution to shape this groundbreaking, tormented romance both between Zhang Fengyi’s Ziaolou and Leslie Cheng’s Dieyi, and between Ziaolou and his former prostitute wife Juxian (Gong Li). HOOriginally titled 1984½, Terry Gilliam’s crazily ambitious riff on Orwell is a dystopian comedy about a world stuffed to bursting point: one clerical error and it threatens to burst, plunging Jonathan Pryce’s befuddled low-level bureaucrat into madness and chaos. A nightmare of retro-futuristic oppression, outfitted with mad bravura and some of the best sci-fi production design ever. PSPauline Kael thought that the basic appeal of movies was the “kiss kiss bang bang” of action and romance, but Yasujirō Ozu demonstrates that film is capable of much more in this quiet family drama. It’s a simple story about two elderly parents visiting their adult children, only to find that the younger generation is busy with other things. But it’s also a meditation on the passing of time, and on grief, and on the constant push towards the new that will break your heart every time you watch it. HOIf we have learned anything from film noir, it is that murder pacts never work out well for both parties. That’s certainly the lesson when Fred MacMurray’s infatuated salesman offers life insurance to Barbara Stanwyck’s femme fatale Phyllis against her unloved husband. The scheme gives way to a riveting stew of suspicion and paranoia, with Stanwyck’s ruthless determination warping MacMurray’s Neff out of all recognition as director Billy Wilder tightens the screws. HO1542 Days of Heaven (1978)Terrence Malick’s second, and for many, greatest film is a mesmerisingly gorgeous love triangle set in the Texas Panhandle in 1916, loosely based on an Old Testament parable. Richard Gere and Brooke Adams are the lovers who pose as brother and sister to fool a rich, dying farmer (Sam Shepard). Nestor Almendros’s astounding magic-hour photography rightly won an Oscar, and Linda Manz supplies heartbreaking, plainspoken narration as Gere’s younger sister. PSThe problem with calling something “the greatest film ever made” is that it begins to sound like homework. Forget that: beyond all the technical dazzle and ground-breaking filmmaking Orson Welles’s masterpiece has red blood in its veins and a huge beating heart. What’s more, its portrait of a thrusting, occasionally demagogic tycoon and the hollowness at the heart of his success remains as relevant as it ever was, and the suggestion that America might be susceptible to media manipulation all too believable. HONirvana and despair among a troupe of 19th century theatre actors, in Marcel Carné\u0027s luminously moving epic of the heart. This not only represents the full flowering of French cinema\u0027s Golden Age, but a gracious look back at the performing traditions film was built on. It’s peopled with some of the most touchingly clownish characters you’ll ever see. PSWhether you see it as Alfred Hitchcock’s celebration of voyeurism or simply one of the most nail-biting thrillers ever made, it’s a superb example of the Master of Suspense at work. James Stewart’s photographer, laid up with a broken leg, becomes obsessed with the lives of his neighbours and suspects one of murder. The unusually vulnerable hero – as in Vertigo – increases the stakes and ensures that simple brawn won’t save the day, while Hitchcock ratchets up the tension unbearably by putting Grace Kelly’s plucky girlfriend in the lion’s mouth. HOClaudette Colbert\u0027s eloping heiress and Clark Gable\u0027s hack on his uppers warily team up on a Greyhound bus, only to aggravatingly fall for each other. Frank Capra\u0027s evergreen romcom all but invented the love-hate formula that\u0027s one model for silver screen chemistry, hoicking up Colbert\u0027s skirt to flash a leg when they need to hitch-hike, and dismantling Gable\u0027s smarmy defences. The biggest hit of its day for a reason, it was also the first ever film to win the big five at the Oscars. PSThe trials of young black basketball hopefuls in Chicago tell us volumes, from their upbringing to all-or-nothing career rimshots, about the opportunities otherwise denied them. For these portraits of inner-city poverty, gliding between frustration and triumph, Steve James’s epic of ghetto realities has been influential on every sports doc that has come in its wake. The Academy’s documentary branch will never quite live down failing to nominate it. PSThis blistering Billy Wilder and IAL Diamond script is a demonstration of just how dark a love story can be get without tipping entirely into bitterness, a standing rebuke to every lazy, schmaltzy comedy going. While the entire cast is stellar and Shirley MacLaine was never better, it’s worth ignoring them all and just watching Jack Lemmon’s meek office worker CC Baxter. Every gesture and glance is flawless he carries entire scenes without a word. HOThe title of Wim Wenders’s Palme d’Or-winning emotional odyssey is both a real place and a broken state of mind. The missing Travis (Harry Dean Stanton) is found wandering there in a battered cap, and begins a trek to make amends with his ex (Nastassja Kinski), whom he finds, oblivious to who he is, on the other side of a Houston peepshow window. Culminating unforgettably with this long-take tête-a-tête, it\u0027s a mesmerising quest for redemption, with a Ry Cooder score that will twang its way into your soul. PSIt’s encouraging how many obituarists of Philip Seymour Hoffman identified this as his masterwork – literally the performance of a lifetime. The meta-theatrical conceit – Caden Cotard is constructing a play about his life, which becomes as long as his life – lets Charlie Kaufman unleash a panoply of ideas about creativity, self-worth, love, death, everyday and lifelong terrors. It’s bruisingly honest, and a shattering experience for the faithful. PSCéline (Julie Delpy) and Jesse (Ethan Hawke) have settled down since the two earlier films in Richard Linklater’s essential trilogy, Before Sunrise (1995) and Before Sunset (2004), but the problems in their lives – self-inflicted by now – only keep proliferating. Trenchantly pushing them into full-on battle-of-the-sexes territory, the film squares them off for a bitterly adult dissection of a long-term relationship, asking stark questions about love, compromise and lasting the course. PSOther Jean-Luc Godard films are punchier, ruder, more experimental. But this is his most lavish, measured, and sad: an elegiac fantasy of filmmaking, as a loose adaptation of the Odyssey grinds to a halt on Capri, with Jack Palance as the brash American producer trying to sell art by the yard. Meanwhile, the screenwriter (Michel Piccoli) and his beautiful, bored wife (Brigitte Bardot) tussle and reconcile in an incessant, pained ballet. PSSome films strain under the weight of greatness Casablanca’s quality bubbles through. Against the backdrop of the Second World War, two former lovers reunite though everything in the world is pulling them apart. Bogart’s Rick hides a huge heart under a thin veneer of cynicism opposite him Ingrid Bergman’s luminous Ilsa would melt an iceberg. Packed with quotable lines and brimming over with impeccable cool, here we are, still lookin\u0027 at you, kid. HO2742 Meet Me in St Louis (1944)On the surface, Vincente Minnelli\u0027s Technicolor classic is all sweetness and light: Judy Garland, the Trolley song, lots of dancing and tinsel. What makes this one of the great American musicals is an undertow of despair a mile wide. It\u0027s a nostalgia trip as subtly bitter as it is sugary and the subtext of “Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas” is anything but merry. PS2842 A Trip to the Moon (1902)Georges Méliès pioneered many of the visual and special effects techniques that have formed the backbone of fantastical filmmaking ever since, and he pushed them all to their limits in this turn-of-the-century tale of a rocket trip to the moon to meet the strange creatures who live upon it. Witty touches and a real sense of story mean that this is still entertaining more than a century later, and if the effects are less awe-inspiring now, they’re still beautifully designed and executed. HO2942 Out of the Past (1947)Cigarette smoke gives everyone a halo in this masterly, Jacques Tourneur-directed tale of a private investigator (Robert Mitchum) who can’t escape old associates – especially Kathie (Jane Greer), the doll-faced schemer who’s perhaps noir’s ultimate femme fatale. Aka Build My Gallows High, it’s a fatalistic masterpiece, with Kirk Douglas as the smarmy gangster setting Mitchum up for a fall. PSA screwball comedy of substance, Howard Hawks\u0027s remake of The Front Page is an objectively odd mix of high stakes and high comedy. Yet it works because the machine-gun dialogue is so quick that there\u0027s never a moment to question what’s happening (the great screenwriter Ben Hecht, who co-wrote the original Broadway play, worked on it uncredited). Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell, as the warring editor and star-reporter trying to work together long enough to land the story of the year, remain the standard by which all on-screen chemistry should be judged. HOWho\u0027s eavesdropping on whom? Hatched before Watergate and speaking eerily to it, this audacious story of an obsessive surveillance whiz (a career-best Gene Hackman), commissioned to snoop but finding himself morally embroiled, is a slippery plunge into Seventies paranoia like no other. What a run Francis Ford Coppola had, slipping this one in between the first two Godfathers. PSJohn Travolta\u0027s Z-movie sound man, out recording one night, accidentally tapes what turns out to be a political assassination. Brian De Palma hit peak ingenuity and gut-punch profundity with this stunning conspiracy thriller, mounted with a showman\u0027s élan but also harrowing emotional voltage from its star. It’s one of the most delirious thrillers of the 1980s, with a bitterly ironic pay-off that’s played for keeps. PS3342 City of God (2002)There’s a deep contradiction at the heart of this acid-bright portrait of the violence in Rio’s favelas. On one hand these child hustlers and teen gangsters have an intense lust for life, an exuberance displayed in dance and play and love on the other, they value life cheaply and take it without a qualm. Director Fernando Meirelles and co-director Kátia Lund cast a talented band of local kids to give it authenticity and then punctuated their story with Scorsese-esque violence that still shocks. HO3442 Hannah and Her Sisters (1986)The erging romantic fortunes of Hannah (Mia Farrow), Lee (Barbara Hershey) and Holly (Dianne Wiest, who won an Oscar, as did Michael Caine) provide an ideal structure for Woody Allen to check in on a midway state of adulthood, when there\u0027s already a sense of disappointment about squandered promise, but still much to play for. It hits the miraculous sweet spot between all Allen’s modes and tones. PSThe Coen Brothers had already established a ghoulish signature style with Blood Simple, but here they showed us how funny they could be, in a zig-zagging kidnap farce which manages the difficult feat of being both zany and adorable. Nicolas Cage and Holly Hunter are the unlikely couple whose abduction of a spare newborn quintuplet, Nathan Jr, causes all hell to break loose. PSThis looks and acts like a thriller, but in reality Michael Haneke’s exploration of colonialism, guilt, paranoia and privacy cares more about subtext than about scares or mystery. A well-to-do Parisian family are tormented by the arrival of surveillance tapes of their lives, but it’s not clear who could be sending them or why, leading patriarch Georges (Daniel Auteuil, never better) to confront his own past sins. As a subversion of genre and viewer expectation, there are few to match it. HOStraight up the best Bourne movie – an experience Ultimatum can’t help but want to repeat, more falteringly – because of Paul Greengrass’s phenomenal instincts for pace, Matt Damon’s unguessed flair for minimalism, and a script by Tony Gilroy that’s all about conscience. Barring Mad Max: Fury Road, it’s the best and most enduring action movie of the present millennium. PSOrson Welles suggested that Buster Keaton’s silent Civil War comedy might be the greatest film ever made, and who are we to argue? Keaton’s Johnny Gray is a key figure on the railroads of the Confederacy, but he and his engine, The General, must go above and beyond to defeat a Union spy. Ignore the dodgy politics and focus on the sublime physical comedy of Keaton’s beautifully composed routines. You’ll come out wondering if movies even need sound. HOThe Babadook is a black, hunched pop-up book monster who raps on your door three times before paying a visit. And you can’t get rid of him. Widowed mum Amelia (brilliant Essie Davis) can’t remember reading his book to her emotionally disturbed misfit of a son (Noah Wiseman) before. Jennifer Kent’s thoughtful Australian chamber shocker, a feast of inventive design, claws its way into you and leaves scratch marks. PSIs it impossible for men and women to be purely platonic? It is according to Harry, in this beautiful, brainy comedy about two neurotic New Yorkers who become friends and then more. Directed by Rob Reiner and written by wonderful Nora Ephron, it\u0027s a paean of sorts to Woody Allen\u0027s early films, with razor-sharp observations about sex and dating (I\u0027ll have what she\u0027s having). It\u0027s still the pinnacle of both Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan\u0027s careers. Toy Story revolutionised animation Up and Wall-E vie for the best opening of any film this century, but for sheer audacity Pete Docter’s head-trip must prevail. As a little girl struggles to adapt following a family move across country, her emotions go on a madcap adventure through the mind itself. What’s dazzling here is that two completely separate films unfold at once. Kids watch brightly coloured sprites on a quest adults watch a psychologically dense depiction of how we think and feel. It’s wonderful.Disinterred from a script Tarantino wrote in the mid-Eighties called The Open Road – the same screenplay that also spawned Natural Born Killers – Tony Scott\u0027s True Romance is a pulpy, hyperviolent twist on a damsel-in-distress fairytale, with a plinky-plonky score that is based on Badlands. Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette are the lovers on the lam, chased by Christopher Walken\u0027s suave mafioso. Bombastic, brash – and totally brilliant. 142 Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981)With this update and upgrade of the 1930s serial adventure, Steven Spielberg turns what could have been pastiche into a practically perfect film. Harrison Ford’s daring archaeologist is almost always out of his depth but has impeccable underdog charm, and Douglas Slocombe’s casually stunning cinematography is matched by one of John Williams\u0027s finest scores.

Every gesture and glance is flawless he carries entire scenes without a word. HOThe title of Wim Wenders’s Palme d’Or-winning emotional odyssey is both a real place and a broken state of mind. The missing Travis (Harry Dean Stanton) is found wandering there in a battered cap, and begins a trek to make amends with his ex (Nastassja Kinski), whom he finds, oblivious to who he is, on the other side of a Houston peepshow window. Culminating unforgettably with this long-take tête-a-tête, it\u0027s a mesmerising quest for redemption, with a Ry Cooder score that will twang its way into your soul. PSIt’s encouraging how many obituarists of Philip Seymour Hoffman identified this as his masterwork – literally the performance of a lifetime. The meta-theatrical conceit – Caden Cotard is constructing a play about his life, which becomes as long as his life – lets Charlie Kaufman unleash a panoply of ideas about creativity, self-worth, love, death, everyday and lifelong terrors. It’s bruisingly honest, and a shattering experience for the faithful. PSCéline (Julie Delpy) and Jesse (Ethan Hawke) have settled down since the two earlier films in Richard Linklater’s essential trilogy, Before Sunrise (1995) and Before Sunset (2004), but the problems in their lives – self-inflicted by now – only keep proliferating. Trenchantly pushing them into full-on battle-of-the-sexes territory, the film squares them off for a bitterly adult dissection of a long-term relationship, asking stark questions about love, compromise and lasting the course. PSOther Jean-Luc Godard films are punchier, ruder, more experimental. But this is his most lavish, measured, and sad: an elegiac fantasy of filmmaking, as a loose adaptation of the Odyssey grinds to a halt on Capri, with Jack Palance as the brash American producer trying to sell art by the yard. Meanwhile, the screenwriter (Michel Piccoli) and his beautiful, bored wife (Brigitte Bardot) tussle and reconcile in an incessant, pained ballet. PSSome films strain under the weight of greatness Casablanca’s quality bubbles through. Against the backdrop of the Second World War, two former lovers reunite though everything in the world is pulling them apart. Bogart’s Rick hides a huge heart under a thin veneer of cynicism opposite him Ingrid Bergman’s luminous Ilsa would melt an iceberg. Packed with quotable lines and brimming over with impeccable cool, here we are, still lookin\u0027 at you, kid. HO2742 Meet Me in St Louis (1944)On the surface, Vincente Minnelli\u0027s Technicolor classic is all sweetness and light: Judy Garland, the Trolley song, lots of dancing and tinsel. What makes this one of the great American musicals is an undertow of despair a mile wide. It\u0027s a nostalgia trip as subtly bitter as it is sugary and the subtext of “Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas” is anything but merry. PS2842 A Trip to the Moon (1902)Georges Méliès pioneered many of the visual and special effects techniques that have formed the backbone of fantastical filmmaking ever since, and he pushed them all to their limits in this turn-of-the-century tale of a rocket trip to the moon to meet the strange creatures who live upon it. Witty touches and a real sense of story mean that this is still entertaining more than a century later, and if the effects are less awe-inspiring now, they’re still beautifully designed and executed. HO2942 Out of the Past (1947)Cigarette smoke gives everyone a halo in this masterly, Jacques Tourneur-directed tale of a private investigator (Robert Mitchum) who can’t escape old associates – especially Kathie (Jane Greer), the doll-faced schemer who’s perhaps noir’s ultimate femme fatale. Aka Build My Gallows High, it’s a fatalistic masterpiece, with Kirk Douglas as the smarmy gangster setting Mitchum up for a fall. PSA screwball comedy of substance, Howard Hawks\u0027s remake of The Front Page is an objectively odd mix of high stakes and high comedy. Yet it works because the machine-gun dialogue is so quick that there\u0027s never a moment to question what’s happening (the great screenwriter Ben Hecht, who co-wrote the original Broadway play, worked on it uncredited). Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell, as the warring editor and star-reporter trying to work together long enough to land the story of the year, remain the standard by which all on-screen chemistry should be judged. HOWho\u0027s eavesdropping on whom? Hatched before Watergate and speaking eerily to it, this audacious story of an obsessive surveillance whiz (a career-best Gene Hackman), commissioned to snoop but finding himself morally embroiled, is a slippery plunge into Seventies paranoia like no other. What a run Francis Ford Coppola had, slipping this one in between the first two Godfathers. PSJohn Travolta\u0027s Z-movie sound man, out recording one night, accidentally tapes what turns out to be a political assassination. Brian De Palma hit peak ingenuity and gut-punch profundity with this stunning conspiracy thriller, mounted with a showman\u0027s élan but also harrowing emotional voltage from its star. It’s one of the most delirious thrillers of the 1980s, with a bitterly ironic pay-off that’s played for keeps. PS3342 City of God (2002)There’s a deep contradiction at the heart of this acid-bright portrait of the violence in Rio’s favelas. On one hand these child hustlers and teen gangsters have an intense lust for life, an exuberance displayed in dance and play and love on the other, they value life cheaply and take it without a qualm. Director Fernando Meirelles and co-director Kátia Lund cast a talented band of local kids to give it authenticity and then punctuated their story with Scorsese-esque violence that still shocks. HO3442 Hannah and Her Sisters (1986)The erging romantic fortunes of Hannah (Mia Farrow), Lee (Barbara Hershey) and Holly (Dianne Wiest, who won an Oscar, as did Michael Caine) provide an ideal structure for Woody Allen to check in on a midway state of adulthood, when there\u0027s already a sense of disappointment about squandered promise, but still much to play for. It hits the miraculous sweet spot between all Allen’s modes and tones. PSThe Coen Brothers had already established a ghoulish signature style with Blood Simple, but here they showed us how funny they could be, in a zig-zagging kidnap farce which manages the difficult feat of being both zany and adorable. Nicolas Cage and Holly Hunter are the unlikely couple whose abduction of a spare newborn quintuplet, Nathan Jr, causes all hell to break loose. PSThis looks and acts like a thriller, but in reality Michael Haneke’s exploration of colonialism, guilt, paranoia and privacy cares more about subtext than about scares or mystery. A well-to-do Parisian family are tormented by the arrival of surveillance tapes of their lives, but it’s not clear who could be sending them or why, leading patriarch Georges (Daniel Auteuil, never better) to confront his own past sins. As a subversion of genre and viewer expectation, there are few to match it. HOStraight up the best Bourne movie – an experience Ultimatum can’t help but want to repeat, more falteringly – because of Paul Greengrass’s phenomenal instincts for pace, Matt Damon’s unguessed flair for minimalism, and a script by Tony Gilroy that’s all about conscience. Barring Mad Max: Fury Road, it’s the best and most enduring action movie of the present millennium. PSOrson Welles suggested that Buster Keaton’s silent Civil War comedy might be the greatest film ever made, and who are we to argue? Keaton’s Johnny Gray is a key figure on the railroads of the Confederacy, but he and his engine, The General, must go above and beyond to defeat a Union spy. Ignore the dodgy politics and focus on the sublime physical comedy of Keaton’s beautifully composed routines. You’ll come out wondering if movies even need sound. HOThe Babadook is a black, hunched pop-up book monster who raps on your door three times before paying a visit. And you can’t get rid of him. Widowed mum Amelia (brilliant Essie Davis) can’t remember reading his book to her emotionally disturbed misfit of a son (Noah Wiseman) before. Jennifer Kent’s thoughtful Australian chamber shocker, a feast of inventive design, claws its way into you and leaves scratch marks. PSIs it impossible for men and women to be purely platonic? It is according to Harry, in this beautiful, brainy comedy about two neurotic New Yorkers who become friends and then more. Directed by Rob Reiner and written by wonderful Nora Ephron, it\u0027s a paean of sorts to Woody Allen\u0027s early films, with razor-sharp observations about sex and dating (I\u0027ll have what she\u0027s having). It\u0027s still the pinnacle of both Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan\u0027s careers. Toy Story revolutionised animation Up and Wall-E vie for the best opening of any film this century, but for sheer audacity Pete Docter’s head-trip must prevail. As a little girl struggles to adapt following a family move across country, her emotions go on a madcap adventure through the mind itself. What’s dazzling here is that two completely separate films unfold at once. Kids watch brightly coloured sprites on a quest adults watch a psychologically dense depiction of how we think and feel. It’s wonderful.Disinterred from a script Tarantino wrote in the mid-Eighties called The Open Road – the same screenplay that also spawned Natural Born Killers – Tony Scott\u0027s True Romance is a pulpy, hyperviolent twist on a damsel-in-distress fairytale, with a plinky-plonky score that is based on Badlands. Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette are the lovers on the lam, chased by Christopher Walken\u0027s suave mafioso. Bombastic, brash – and totally brilliant.

There would never be a Drake without a Kanye, West wrote.Origins of the beef between West and the Canadian rapper appear to have emerged a decade ago, when the two started sharing managers – setting them on the path of in-person meetings, mutual praise across blog posts and interviews, and, eventually, their drawn-out fall-out.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialHere is how history remembers the Kanye West vs Drake beef so far:Kanye West reignites, then appears to squash, beef with Drake2008, as\u0026nbspComplex\u0026nbspnotes, was the year Drake secured Cortez Bryant as his manager.Who is Bryant\u0027s business partner, you ask? None other than Gee Roberson, who counted West among his clients at the time.This appears to be the moment West and Drake\u0027s paths started to cross – the inciting incident, perhaps, of the soap opera of their lives.It might be hard to believe today, but there was once a time when Drake and West heaped praise on each other publicly.That was the year West said Drake had one of the best lines of the year on his song\u0026nbspEvery Girl.Drake, meanwhile, called West the most influential musician in his life in an interview with\u0026nbspMTV.2009 was also the year West and Drake met in Hawaii, and the year they were both featured on a remix of Jamie Foxx\u0027s\u0026nbspDigital Girl.2010: Trouble in paradiseFind Your Love,\u0026nbspa Drake song co-written and co-produced by West, was released in May 2010. A good sign, surely?Well, not exactly – West said in 2013 that he was fine working on the track until Drake got too big.In September of that year, Drake was spotted with Amber Rose – then West\u0027s recent ex, which many believe contributed to their discord.2011 will go down in beef history as the year Drake told\u0026nbspThe Source\u0026nbspabout West:\u0026nbsp“My goal is to surpass everything he’s accomplished. I don’t want to be as good as Kanye, I want to be better.”In December of that year, Drizzy appeared to confirm he was coming for West\u0027s crown\u0026nbspby rapping on DJ Khaled\u0027s\u0026nbspI\u0027m On One: I’m just feeling like the throne is for the taking  Watch me take it.2013: Drake acknowledges the elephant in the roomMe and Ye just fell into this thing where we hadn’t actually talked to each other in so long that all this stuff got built up, Drake told\u0026nbspBillboard\u0026nbspthat year.Sometimes you just have to find the opportunity to tell someone that you really like and respect them. After that, everything can move forward.Rolling Stone\u0026nbspreaders gasped when Drake was quoted as dissing\u0026nbspWest\u0027s album\u0026nbspYeezus\u0026nbspin these terms: There were some real questionable bars on thereLike that ‘Swaghili’ line? Come on, man. Even Fabolous wouldn’t say some s*** like that.Drake promptly said on Twitter he never commented on\u0026nbspYeezus\u0026nbspin the interview.West was later quoted as supporting Drake during his tours, saying magazines were trying to pit n***** against each other.\u0026nbspBig Sean\u0027s\u0026nbspBlessings, on which West and Drake both feature, came out in January 2015, inaugurating what is remembered as one of the more positive years of the West  Drake timeline.In February 2015, West teased the possibility of doing an album with Drake in the future.That same month, Drake brought West onstage during one of his shows.Created with Sketch.Albums of the year 2018 Show all 40Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Thom Yorke’s first ever soundtrack summons the darkness of horror, and the terror of blood and evil, over 25 tracks.Marauder is Interpol’s most experimental to date, blending everything from rough garage rock to Motown rhythms.

The country artist returns after the release of his acclaimed 2016 album Shine On Rainy Day with Providence Canyon a slice of blue-collar country offering fresh tales of Southern lifeThe Brighton metal band’s sublime second album is their most ambitious to date. Enlisting Adrian Bushby (Foo Fighters, Muse) on production was a master-stroke – with his help they offer up vast sonic landscapes that recall the drama of Darion Malakian’s Scars on Broadway record, DictatorOne moment opining the joys of leaving a party to pluck your eyebrows, the next raging over the gaslighting of assault survivors, Miya Folick’s debut album continues her habit of cracking the shiny veneer of pop, and unsettling the exceptions put upon a feminine voiceThough their themes remain in the gutter, Suede aspire to monuments, and The Blue Hour will stand as another sordid masterworkSix years after the release of her last LP Sun, Cat Power – whose struggles with alcoholism, addiction and mental health issues have been much publicised – demonstrates “both a newfound sense of calm, and strength” on her new albumHoly Hell offers up some of the best tracks of the band’s career, with a through-line that maintains Tom Searle\u0027s role as an integral part of Architects, particularly on “Doomsday”, while “Hereafter” feels like the song that launches the album’s momentum. Listening to vocalist Sam Carter scream: “I wasn’t braced for the fallout” is intensely cathartic – even non-metal fans will find it hard not to be moved by the band’s sincerity. (RO)Even in discarding such basic pop necessities as melody, Robyn has managed to create a masterpiece. With her first album in seven years, the Swedish singer delivers nine songs that glow and pulse with bittersweet sensuality, sung in a voice that sifts over the synths like icing sugar1040 31. Florence \u0026amp the Machine - High as HopeOn Florence \u0026amp The Machine’s latest album High As Hope, her voice is just as powerful when she holds back. She seems to attribute much of this calmness to her new-found sobriety – she quit alcohol a few years ago and looks back on her twenties with a mix of fondness and regret1140 30. Teyana Taylor - Keep that Same EnergyShe’s not restricted by genre constraints, and K.T.S.E. (Keep That Same Energy) is a pleasant surprise. Embellished with producer Kanye West’s keen ear for samples, it blends Eighties nostalgia with fresh rap and R\u0026ampB. At the core of the project is Taylor’s love of pleasing herself, her relationship with her husband, and being a mother1240 29. The 1975 – A Brief Inquiry into Online RelationshipsOn their third and best album, A Brief Inquiry into Online Relationships, The 1975 have created what so many post-Radiohead bands couldn’t: a coherent pop statement with enough hope, radical honesty and genre-ning breadth to make sense across ided generations1340 28. Kamasi Washington - Heaven and EarthFor a new generation, Kamasi Washington is largely responsible for the revitalised interest in jazz in modern music, most notably with his work on Kendrick Lamar’s jazz-heavy masterpiece, To Pimp a Butterfly. On Heaven and Earth, the Los Angeles saxophonist and band leader splits his second record in two halves: the urgent Earth side explores reality while Heaven deals in dreamy opulenceThe 21-year-old south London MC Novelist’s debut album is a clear, concise look at the current social and political landscape of the UK, offering up astute observations on black masculinity and the music industry along the way.The German composer’s 10th solo album is a stirring, complex work that draws on the concept of connection a fluidity in the way the universe worksCamila Cabello\u0027s debut solo album is the first time fans have been able to see her clearlyOn Mitski\u0027s brilliant fifth album she is desperate and lonely one minute, hardened and withdrawn the next. Her music, which exists in a space between fierce, guitar-led walls of noise and soft, delicate balladry, feels like an open wound – and Be The Cowboy is no different. (AP)Frontman Olly Alexander is offering fans their own generational pop icon: a young man who has the courage to put all of that vibrant, dynamic character on full displayOn Tell Me How You Really Feel, Courtney Barnett turns her keen eye inwards, exploring anxiety and depression while coming to terms with her own emotional life. Written as her burgeoning stature and hectic touring schedule began to take their toll, these 10 songs are Barnett’s attempt to work through her vulnerability and sadnessFor Negro Swan, Blood Orange’s fourth album, the multi-instrumentalist has dreamed up a 16-song suite that weaves together impressionist psych-pop and interstellar funk, late-Seventies Marvin Gaye and early-Eighties Prince, with some tangled ballads and insomniac blues reminiscent of Elliott Smith and King Krule thrown into the pot2140 20. Cardi B - Invasion of PrivacyWhen she sings off the hook, it’s just another moment where Cardi B runs to her own rhythm: because nothing about Invasion of Privacy is formulaicWith producer SOPHIE on board (whose own album, also released this year, is well worth your time), they explore the anxieties and frustrations of being a teenage girl through clattering beats and Nokia samples. The result is exceptionalGhetts re-evaluates much of what he said on Ghetto Gospel, when he was frustrated and angry with the world. Now he looks more to the future, whether on “Next of Kin”, where he speaks from the perspective of a mother carrying her child’s coffin, or “Black Rose”, which addresses fears for his daughter in a society that places double standards on black women. It’s a reminder that grime is so much more than violence and threats. (RO)2440 17. Cypress Hill – Elephants on AcidElephants on Acid is a 21-track monster, loaded with twists and turns that take you as far as Egypt, where Muggs recorded much of “Band of Gypsies” – teaming up with artists on oud, sitar, keyboard and guitar, as well as some of its street musicians. Its lead hook harks back to the glitchy shrieks of “How I Could Just Kill a Man” from their eponymous 1991 debut.His brilliant fourth album Love Is Magic takes listeners on a similar thrill ride, dominated by swirling loops of grand, romantic melody, sly twists of sardonic wit and heart-stopping drops of sheer honestyHis third record, produced entirely by Kanye West, could easily have been an EP, coming in at just seven songs and 21 minutes. While many fans were disappointed by the erratic and self-indulgent nature of some of West’s other releases, including his own album ye, the beats on Daytona are sample-heavy and superb the instrumentation is sparse but all the more impactful for itSince her debut single – the AK Paul-featuring “So Good” – was released in 2014, London-based singer-songwriter NAO has hovered around a near-perfect brand of sultry, neo-soul-inflected R\u0026ampB. Four years later, and she seems to have mastered itThe third solo album from the US artist stars an overwhelming number of (uncredited) guest features, producers and co-writers, but, ultimately, it’s his own, most career-defining work to date. Bloom captures the A to Z’s of modern queer love with pinpoint precisionHoward’s music has always, above all, reflected the shifts and moods in nature, while he sings poetic lyrics in his signature low, warm murmur. On Noonday Dream, he expands on the Cornish landscape that impacted his earlier work and brings in sounds and instruments that spark the imagination for places further afield, in the most exquisite way3140 10. Shame – Songs of PraiseDistinguishing themselves from the hordes of other white, indie guitar bands that emerged around summer 2017, south London natives Shame manage to make raw, bleeding anger on their debut album sound articulate.Gaika broke new ground on the UK music scene and asserted himself as one of the most provocative and multitalented young artists of this generation with his debut album, Basic VolumeTamino’s music on his debut Amir draws on the old-world romance of his grandfather – a famous Arabic musician and actor ¬– but also embodies the genre-less quality of much modern pop. The musical heritage that is so essential to the 22-year-old’s sound comes to life in the dramatic, sweeping instrumentation on a song like “So It Goes” haunting, graceful violins, bold drum beats and the shimmer of a tambourine transport the listener entirely.Mac Miller turned his anguish into one of the year’s most disarming records3540 6. Colter Wall - Song of the PlainsWall’s songwriting is as stark as it comes: his plain-speaking manner is delivered in a slow, melancholy drawl that paints him as some lonely cowboy – the last man of the West, as he describes in the most matter-of-fact terms how a bullet ripped in to “poor Wild Bill”. There’s no fuss in the instrumentation, either, mostly just gentle picking or brisk, deep thrums on Wall’s acoustic guitar, which are bolstered by icy laps of pedal steel and the occasional harmonica. It’s effective in the simplest of ways – and allows the listener’s imagination to do the restKendrick Lamar co-executive produced the Black Panther soundtrack, has writing credits on its 14 tracks, and appears in various skits and features. But his most essential job on this album is that of the curator, as he brings in a staggering array of talent – from Anderson .Paak, SZA and Future to South African gqom (EDM) artist Babes Wodumo and alt-rapper Yungen Blakrok.Kacey Musgraves third album flips between wide-eyed country pop and disco-electronica. Aided by co-writers and producers Daniel Tashian and Ian Fitchuk – both Nashville stalwarts – Musgraves conjures up a feeling of lightness as she melds the traditional and futuristic.Dirty Computer is Monáe’s gift to the LGBT+ community, non-binary people, black men and women… anyone who faces stigma and abuse just for embracing their true selves. It’s a message of love and hope to anyone who fears what is different, but who has capacity to learn and know better. And it’s seemingly a gift to herself, as well. (RO)Tranquility Base Hotel \u0026amp Casino feels more like an interlude between AM and a seventh Arctic Monkeys album – a delve into the bizarre, where even the Steinway piano has its own character. On “The Ultracheese”, the descending piano chords symbolise a kind of final bow the last soliloquy of the night before the curtain closes. Few bands today are as brave as this.Letissier makes her vintage synths snap, crackle, pop, fizz, freeze, squelch, shimmer and soar. There’s even a shattered glass effect (on “Stranger”) to complete the Old Skool Electronica bingo card. Treble notes bounce from air-cushioned soles. Bass lines lasso your hips. Chiffon layers of Letissier’s Anglo-French vocals glide around your neck and shoulders and roll them back. It’s ridiculously danceable.Thom Yorke’s first ever soundtrack summons the darkness of horror, and the terror of blood and evil, over 25 tracks.Marauder is Interpol’s most experimental to date, blending everything from rough garage rock to Motown rhythms.

The result is exceptionalGhetts re-evaluates much of what he said on Ghetto Gospel, when he was frustrated and angry with the world. Now he looks more to the future, whether on “Next of Kin”, where he speaks from the perspective of a mother carrying her child’s coffin, or “Black Rose”, which addresses fears for his daughter in a society that places double standards on black women. It’s a reminder that grime is so much more than violence and threats. (RO)2440 17. Cypress Hill – Elephants on AcidElephants on Acid is a 21-track monster, loaded with twists and turns that take you as far as Egypt, where Muggs recorded much of “Band of Gypsies” – teaming up with artists on oud, sitar, keyboard and guitar, as well as some of its street musicians. Its lead hook harks back to the glitchy shrieks of “How I Could Just Kill a Man” from their eponymous 1991 debut.His brilliant fourth album Love Is Magic takes listeners on a similar thrill ride, dominated by swirling loops of grand, romantic melody, sly twists of sardonic wit and heart-stopping drops of sheer honestyHis third record, produced entirely by Kanye West, could easily have been an EP, coming in at just seven songs and 21 minutes. While many fans were disappointed by the erratic and self-indulgent nature of some of West’s other releases, including his own album ye, the beats on Daytona are sample-heavy and superb the instrumentation is sparse but all the more impactful for itSince her debut single – the AK Paul-featuring “So Good” – was released in 2014, London-based singer-songwriter NAO has hovered around a near-perfect brand of sultry, neo-soul-inflected R\u0026ampB. Four years later, and she seems to have mastered itThe third solo album from the US artist stars an overwhelming number of (uncredited) guest features, producers and co-writers, but, ultimately, it’s his own, most career-defining work to date. Bloom captures the A to Z’s of modern queer love with pinpoint precisionHoward’s music has always, above all, reflected the shifts and moods in nature, while he sings poetic lyrics in his signature low, warm murmur. On Noonday Dream, he expands on the Cornish landscape that impacted his earlier work and brings in sounds and instruments that spark the imagination for places further afield, in the most exquisite way3140 10. Shame – Songs of PraiseDistinguishing themselves from the hordes of other white, indie guitar bands that emerged around summer 2017, south London natives Shame manage to make raw, bleeding anger on their debut album sound articulate.Gaika broke new ground on the UK music scene and asserted himself as one of the most provocative and multitalented young artists of this generation with his debut album, Basic VolumeTamino’s music on his debut Amir draws on the old-world romance of his grandfather – a famous Arabic musician and actor ¬– but also embodies the genre-less quality of much modern pop. The musical heritage that is so essential to the 22-year-old’s sound comes to life in the dramatic, sweeping instrumentation on a song like “So It Goes” haunting, graceful violins, bold drum beats and the shimmer of a tambourine transport the listener entirely.Mac Miller turned his anguish into one of the year’s most disarming records3540 6. Colter Wall - Song of the PlainsWall’s songwriting is as stark as it comes: his plain-speaking manner is delivered in a slow, melancholy drawl that paints him as some lonely cowboy – the last man of the West, as he describes in the most matter-of-fact terms how a bullet ripped in to “poor Wild Bill”. There’s no fuss in the instrumentation, either, mostly just gentle picking or brisk, deep thrums on Wall’s acoustic guitar, which are bolstered by icy laps of pedal steel and the occasional harmonica. It’s effective in the simplest of ways – and allows the listener’s imagination to do the restKendrick Lamar co-executive produced the Black Panther soundtrack, has writing credits on its 14 tracks, and appears in various skits and features. But his most essential job on this album is that of the curator, as he brings in a staggering array of talent – from Anderson .Paak, SZA and Future to South African gqom (EDM) artist Babes Wodumo and alt-rapper Yungen Blakrok.Kacey Musgraves third album flips between wide-eyed country pop and disco-electronica. Aided by co-writers and producers Daniel Tashian and Ian Fitchuk – both Nashville stalwarts – Musgraves conjures up a feeling of lightness as she melds the traditional and futuristic.Dirty Computer is Monáe’s gift to the LGBT+ community, non-binary people, black men and women… anyone who faces stigma and abuse just for embracing their true selves. It’s a message of love and hope to anyone who fears what is different, but who has capacity to learn and know better. And it’s seemingly a gift to herself, as well. (RO)Tranquility Base Hotel \u0026amp Casino feels more like an interlude between AM and a seventh Arctic Monkeys album – a delve into the bizarre, where even the Steinway piano has its own character. On “The Ultracheese”, the descending piano chords symbolise a kind of final bow the last soliloquy of the night before the curtain closes. Few bands today are as brave as this.Letissier makes her vintage synths snap, crackle, pop, fizz, freeze, squelch, shimmer and soar. There’s even a shattered glass effect (on “Stranger”) to complete the Old Skool Electronica bingo card. Treble notes bounce from air-cushioned soles. Bass lines lasso your hips. Chiffon layers of Letissier’s Anglo-French vocals glide around your neck and shoulders and roll them back. It’s ridiculously danceable.2016: Are we really fighting about pools?If 2015 was the year of sunshine and rainbows in the Drake  West universe, then 2016 can be marked as the year where their feud officially delved into the absurd.In his track\u0026nbspSummer Sixteen, Drake claimed to own a larger pool than West, rapping:\u0026nbsp“Now I got a house in LA, now I got a bigger pool than Ye  And look, man, Ye’s pool is nice, mine’s just bigger’s what I’m saying.”\u0026nbspWest contributed to the argument by stating: I have three pools.2016 was also the year of West\u0027s third appearance at Drake\u0027s OVO Fest, and marked renewed speculation about a possible joint album by the two artists.2018: Things get somewhat complicatedNothing much happened on the West  Drake front in 2017 – but 2018 came back with a vengeance.In May, Drake released his song\u0026nbspDuppy\u0026nbspFreestyle. In it, he responds to Pusha T, with whom Drake is involved in a separate feud.\u0026nbspPusha T had accused Drake of resorting to ghostwriters. In turn, Drake implied in the lyrics of\u0026nbspDuppy Freestyle\u0026nbsphe had ghostwritten for West, the founder of Pusha\u0026nbspT\u0027s label GOOD Music.Things escalated until September, when Drake appeared to diss\u0026nbspWest\u0027s Yeezy 350 sneakers in a collaboration with French Montana, writing: Keeping it G, I told her don’t wear no 350s around me.Instead of fighting back, West addressed Drake in a series of tweets apologising for various things, writing at one point: There should have been no songs with my involvement that had any negative energy towards you.All of this brings us to December 2018 and West\u0027s most recent tweetstorm, which appeared to have been triggered by a clearance request from Drake regarding his own song\u0026nbspSay What\u0027s Real, which features a sample by West.West tweeted a screenshot of a request before firing off many tweets about Drake, at one point claiming Drake had threatened him during a phone call.His wife Kim Kardashian chimed in, writing:\u0026nbsp@drake Never threaten my husband or our family. He paved the way for their to be a Drake.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

As a new book points out, it’s an essentially selfish state of being, and society should stop chasing this illusion because it’ll only make us miserable. Even if you do own an orgasmatron...Click to followThe IndependentSurfing is similar to happiness: it’s all about feeling good within yourself. It’s an internal, physiological and emotional state. Which means it is devoid of any moralityThomas Jefferson made it a constitutional right in the US. “The pursuit of happiness.”\u0026nbspYou have the right to pursue wellbeing. No one is stopping you. Go ahead and pursue it. But when did a right morph into an obligation, a duty?The founding fathers were influenced by the great voyages of discovery. Thanks to Captain Cook and his French counterpart Bougainville, the idea got about that everyone in the southern hemisphere was happier than in the cold and dismal north. We had the technology, we had the “civilisation”, but why didn’t we feel good about it? They had something we were lacking. Surfing was a case in point. According to European observers, the men and women riding waves had found a way to “allay all perturbation of mind”. The American constitution was, in effect, suggesting we ought to try living our lives on the crest of a wave.I personally put the utopian theory to the test by following in Cook’s footsteps and going to the Sandwich Islands, aka Hawaii, aka “the Happy Isles of Oceania” (according to Paul Theroux). By a strange quirk of fate one of the first people I met there was a clinical psychologist. “Where are you from?”, she said. “England,” I replied. “You’re so lucky!” she said. I had just travelled several thousand miles to get away from England and here was someone telling me I was better off saving my money and staying put. “How do you work that out?” I asked. “The great thing about England,” she replied, “is that you can be miserable and nobody minds. In fact you’re expected to be miserable.”It turned out that she was a specialist in treating people with depression. “In Hawaii?” I said with genuine scepticism. They have palm trees, sultry breezes, and big waves, what was the problem? “People get depressed in Hawaii the same as anywhere else,” she said. “The problem is that here you’re expected to be happy. So you feel guilty about it on top. And then considering Hawaii is also technically the 50th state of America, if you’re broke too, when you’re supposed to be prosperous, then you’re really screwed.”You don’t have to be miserable, but it’s your constitutional right to be downhearted if you want to be. What he demonstrates so convincingly is how feeling good can really be bad for youDr Depression surely had a point. But she represents the opposition to what has become increasingly a vast and powerful and highly profitable industry, as Carl Cederström sets out in his wise and witty new book, The Happiness Fantasy. He might equally well have called it the “happiness conspiracy”, because we are being ganged up on, bullied and battered and bruised by the imperative of happiness. Can’t we just be unhappy if we feel like it? What’s so bad about that?I know I’m going to come over as the biggest party pooper, grouch or grinch in the history of the world here, but I can never really sing “Happy Birthday” to anyone with any degree of conviction or enthusiasm. I do still occasionally send birthday cards, but I’m not going to write the words “happy birthday” in black and white. It always seems too coercive to me. My attitude is OK, be happy if you like, but if you want to be unhappy that’s good too, you shouldn’t have to feel like you have to be happy. Happiness ought to be voluntary and accidental and spontaneous and strictly optional. (So what do I write? “Be awesome”? It’s tricky. Suggestions on a postcard, please.)TherouxCederström comes from Stockholm. He is more of an exponent of Nordic noir. No palm trees in Scandi-land, so far as I know. Only bracing, even lacerating minimalism. Don’t get me wrong. Cederström is not advocating despair. Maybe he is even trying to save you from Hawaiian-style depression. You don’t have to be miserable, but it’s your constitutional right to be downhearted if you want to be. What he demonstrates so convincingly is how feeling good can really be bad for you.According to Philip Larkin, sex was invented – or at least re-invented – sometime between the publication of Lady Chatterley’s Lover and the Beatles’ first LP, around 1963. “Happiness,” as Freud said, “comes from the satisfaction of needs that have been dammed up to a high degree.” But what if they are not dammed up? Then we are looking at futile or self-destructive overexertion. Instead of being an episodic phenomenon, sex turned into our lodestar, our archetype of mood-management. Thanks in part to Wilhelm Reich, the orgasm was no longer an exceptional high, it became the model of how we were ought to be feeling generally. Way up there on Cloud 9. Average was no longer good enough. But the idea that everyone should really be feeling well beyond average all the time – having constant “peak experiences” (in Abraham Maslow’s phrase) meant that there was always going to be lot of disappointed customers.Reich was an Austrian, originally a disciple of Freud’s, who broke with him over Freud’s notion of sublimation. Civilisation, said Freud, depends on you bottling up all that libinidal energy of yours, and channelling it into doing something creative, like writing novels, composing symphonies or building bridges and tall buildings. Rubbish, said Reich. The orgasm (no ordinary orgasm moreover, it has to be “full”) – that rapturous release of endorphins and assorted chemicals – is good for you. What we need is more actual orgasms. Thus was the Age of Aquarius born, ie the Sixties, marking an end to the long, grim era of repression. Reich invented the “orgone accumulator”, which became the “orgasmatron” in Woody Allen’s Sleeper. He was eventually arrested for fraud, locked up, and died in prison in the US, aged 60, a martyr to sexual liberationBut this was only the beginning of the happiness industry, branching out into “human potential”, “self-help”, “positive thinking”, and New Age gurus, even Scientology, all of them packaged and purveyed and pharmaceutically-inflected. If you’re feeling blue, why not pop a pill? It’s your constitutional right. Especially if it might make you more productive or more “authentic”. We have ended up in a situation where no one feels they are really getting enough, of just about anything. And we are “depraved on account of being deprived” as they say in West Side Story.Cederström is the co-author, with André Spicer, of The Wellness Syndrome, and together they wrote Desperately Seeking Self-Improvement. He puts me in mind of that bloke in Boswell’s Life of Johnson who says, “I tried to be a philosopher, but cheerfulness kept breaking through.” I couldn’t resist asking Cederström if he considered himself a happy sort of guy. He said that he thought the word itself was now effectively meaningless, as per the passage from Beckett’s Waiting for Godot:Godot, Alfred Lynch plays\u0026nbspEstragon (left) and Nicol Williamson is Vladimir (Rex)Vladimir: Say you are, even if it’s not true.\u0026nbspEstragon: ​What am I to say?Vladimir: Say, I am happy.\u0026nbspEstragon: ​We are happy. (Silence.) What do we do now, now that we are happy?\u0026nbspCederström reckons that “the whole self-actualisation craze had a purpose when it kicked off, in the Sixties, as a reaction against the hyper-patriarchal image of the happy family life with the ‘happy’ housewife and all the rest”. But he clearly thinks that the concept has long outlived its usefulness and is now being sold as a contemporary form of snake oil.The thing about happiness is that it should happen to you accidentally. You can only be happy until the moment where you start asking yourself the killer question, “Am I really happy?” And then it all falls apart. Hence all the hype and hysteria and desperation around happiness is entirely self-defeating. Happiness underwent a period of massive inflation in the 20th century. Maybe we have reached the point where the bottom has fallen out of the market finally and we need to rethink happiness from the ground up.I think the Greeks had a good idea in “ataraxia”. They didn’t think of the orgasm as the be-all and end-all. The point about ataraxia is that you are neither feeling particularly good nor particularly bad, but have attained a neutral state – a kind of degree zero – in which your desires give you a break for a time. Rather than maximum gratification we are looking at the minimisation of regret.As someone suggested to me the other day, happiness equals reality minus expectations. I think stoicism is superior to mere happiness because it allows that there is and there will be suffering in the world and the best you can hope for is to be able to adjust your attitude towards it. As Epicurus says, when you drop your favourite vase and it smashes into a thousand pieces no one expects you be jumping for joy. But you might be able (with a truly heroic effort) be able to say to yourself, “The vase has been restored.”The other problem with happiness is, oddly enough, the same problem that affects surfing. It’s an essentially selfish state of being. It’s all about feeling good within yourself. It’s an internal, physiological and emotional state. Which means, in effect, that it is devoid of any morality. Harvey Weinstein was just trying to be happy too. Pursuing his democratic rights.We tend to think of other people as being or at least looking happy. And definitely happier than ourselves. The fact is they\u0026nbsparen’t, we just think they are. All those blissfully smiling beautiful people – they’re just as screwed up as everyone elseCarl Cederström sees Donald Trump as the ultimate flowering of the human potential movement. Even the president speaks of “tapping human potential”. Just as, at the same time, he speaks of “grabbing pussy” or celebrating the NRA. Happiness, as John Lennon said, “is a warm gun”. That’s my constitutional right too. Which has become practically synonymous with a lack of impulse control. I enjoy having a drink, don’t I? Or a big fat cheeseburger. So isn’t it my right to go on eating and drinking myself to death? I want to feel good, even if that way perdition lies (not to mention diabetes and cirrhosis of the liver). As the actor Philip Seymour Hoffman once said (before OD’ing on heroin), “There is no pleasure I haven’t actually made myself sick on.” Cederström himself recalls anything but fondly a week of limitless hedonistic excess in the Canary Islands, leading to an all-time hangover.Happiness, in any case, is largely an illusion. We tend to think of other people as being or at least looking happy. And definitely happier than ourselves. The fact is they aren’t, we just think they are. All those blissfully smiling beautiful people – they’re just as screwed up as everyone else. Social media only serves to spread the delusion. I once asked my son, who was supposed to be studying at university at the time, if his life was constant partying. “Why would you think that?” He asked. “Because all I see of you on Facebook is pictures of you dancing or getting drunk at parties.” He scoffed at my naivety. “That’s only because no one ever posts pictures of themselves sitting at the library and reading a book or writing an essay.”Happiness is a myth that only serves the interests of the happiness-conjurors and the manufacturers of birthday cards. I think happiness has now entered its twilight zone. I can’t see feeling good being of any intrinsic value unless it is also coupled to doing good. Aristotle had something like this in mind when he defined happiness (or eudaimonia) as leading a virtuous life. I think this is what Cederström is hoping for in the future when he speaks of “collective happiness”.But there is another issue here: just as happiness can dissolve into a kind of self-satisfaction, having one’s fellow humans in mind is only another kind of narcissism at the level of the species. One of the most ecstatic non-anthropocentric moments I can recall is when I was cycling through a park and a small bird – a sparrow, I think – came flying out of a bush straight out at me, but seeing me in the way, turned at right angles so that – for the space of a second or two – the bird was flying at exactly the height of my head and at the same speed I was cycling. With the effect that we (if I can speak of “we”, the bird and me) briefly flew along together. That was years ago and I can still feel something of what it must feel like to be a bird. It was exceptional and aleatory and probably unrepeatable. But perhaps the oceanic feeling that Freud was so sceptical of – the sense of there being “an indissoluble bond” with the universe – needs to make a comeback.Andy Martin is the author of ‘Reacher Said Nothing: Lee Child and the Making of Make Me’Carl Cederström’s book, ‘The Happiness Fantasy’, is published by PolityShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

The cuts are being made in an attempt to slash costs, after the company reported its biggest ever loss of £492m in the year to 1 September. Sports Direct currently holds 29.7 per cent of Debenhams, just shy of the 30 per cent threshold at which an offer for the remainder of the company must be made, according to the UK takeover code. Mr Ashley said in his letter that he was concerned that the Debenhams board “doesn’t really seem to appreciate” the position that the company is in “and their responsibility to shareholders”. He added: “Sports Direct is Debenhams’ largest shareholder. What we are offering is a very public statement of support at a critical time for the Debenhams business.”The letter concluded with a request that Mr Bucher reconsider the offer of a loan, and respond by “lunch time Friday”. A spokesperson for Debenhams said: “We welcome Sports Direct’s proposal as a clear demonstration of their willingness to support the company. “However, as the offer came with conditions that could affect the interests of other stakeholders, while the board does not think it could accept the proposal, as presented, it has invited Sports Direct to engage as part of our broader refinancing process.”Shares in Debenhams were down 4.89 per cent to 5.45 at close of trading on Thursday, while Sports Direct’s stock tumbled by 14.8 per cent to 235.40. Earlier in the day, Sports Direct issued a trading update for the first half and revealed that House of Fraser had lost £31.5m in the first 11 weeks after the discount retailer bought it out of administration.Sports Direct also recently purchased Evans Cycles from its administrators.

They had hoped to land somewhere plain, but found it even more free of rocks and safe than they had been expecting.The near-absence of rocks, hills and holes means it\u0027ll be extremely safe for our instruments, said InSight\u0027s Principal Investigator Bruce Banerdt of NASA\u0027s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. This might seem like a pretty plain piece of ground if it weren\u0027t on Mars, but we\u0027re glad to see that.The spacecraft appears to be sitting in some sort of hollow, a dip made in the Elysium region where it landed when a meteor landed there. That should make it easier for the probe to dig down into the surface.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Earlier this year a Waymo test driver reported a man in shorts aiming a gun at his car when it passed the man’s driveway.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialPolice reports also show that rocks were thrown at Waymo’s fleet on at least four separate occasions, according to\u0026nbspThe Arizona Republic,\u0026nbspwhile other incidents include people yelling at the vehicles, chasing them and forcing them off the road.Many other incidents may have gone unreported, the newspaper suggested, with Waymo reportedly keen to minimise police interaction.Created with Sketch. Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The underlying motivation behind such harassment appears to be frustration with Waymo’s parent company Alphabet, combined with fears the technology poses a threat to both jobs and road safety.“Everybody hates Waymo drivers,” one resident told\u0026nbspThe Arizona Republic. “They are dangerous.”Earlier this year, an autonomous vehicle being tested by Uber hit and killed a woman on a darkened street\u0026nbspin Tempe, which borders Chandler.Such frustrations led one man to block the path of a Waymo vehicle by standing in front of\u0026nbspit.\u0026nbspThe police report for the incident stated the man was “sick and tired of the Waymo vehicles driving in his neighbourhood, and apparently thought the best idea to resolve this was to stand in front of one of these vehicles.”The company recently launched the first ever commercial self-driving taxi service in nearby Phoenix, with the hope of a much broader roll out in the coming years.A Waymo\u0026nbspspokesperson said drivers of its self-driving vehicles are trained to deal with threats from the public.“Safety is at the core of everything we do, which means that keeping our drivers, our riders and the public safe is our top priority,” the spokesperson said.“Over the past two years, we’ve found Arizonans to be welcoming and excited by the potential of this technology to make our roads safer. We believe a key element of local engagement has been ongoing work with the communities in which we drive, including Arizona law enforcement and first responders.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

They were bottom of the judges’ leaderboard, but the audience didn’t care. On this show, if you don’t have a journey you’ve got no chance of glitterball glory. Here’s what happened:The stakes were high for Grimsby’s finest Kevin Clifton. This was his fifth Strictly final and he was fed up of coming a close second. So perhaps that’s why he got so stroppy with Craig when he refused to give them a ten and poured scorn on Kev’s showdance choreography. ‘He does this to me in every final!’ moaned Kevin as Craig dismissed his masterpiece as ‘lots of running around’. Ouch.The highlight of any Strictly final, amid all of the strung-out VTs and voting reminders, it’s the showdances we tune in to see. Faye’s was by far the best – an old school Hollywood number with glamorous, cinematic choreography. It oozed showbiz and Faye sparkled.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialJoe’s attempt to be a rock and roller wasn’t quite as successful (although his trampolining was good) and Ashley’s contemporary routine was technically amazing but hardly a crowd pleaser. Stacey’s energetic jive-based number was full of commitment but it split the judges. Clearly it was enough to make people vote though.Ashley faced the dance-off for three weeks in a row and did her best to ignore a huge backlash about her dance background. Tonight, both she and Faye produced clean show-stopping performances, scoring a perfect 120 out of 120. But it wasn’t enough. Alas, it’s not just about the dancing ladies, but you did yourselves proud.Let’s face it, Strictly is on telly for a long, long time every year. So it’s easy to forget who graced that dance floor until they reunite for a special nostalgic routine in the final. It was great to see Danny John Jules put his ‘show must go on’ smile on after boycotting It Takes Two when he got eliminated. And nobody batted an eyelid when erstwhile national villain Sean(n) Walsh recreated his Matrix number. Dr Ranj was great fun, Susannah brought back her ridiculous props and it was great fun to get the gang back together.Yet again Brrrruno said a naughty word on telly as he tried to talk about Stacey’s ‘Greatest Hits’. To be fair, it’s quite a minor slip-up for Mr Tonioli, he’s said a lot worse.

People were against no deal by 44 per cent to 37 per cent, for a new referendum by 46 per cent to 30 per cent and for Norway by 41 per cent to 39 per cent.A sign of just how difficult it will be to secure any deal that enjoys broad support came from another question, which asked respondents to say what it is that is most important for a Brexit deal to secure.The equal top answers were “controlling immigration” and “maintaining smooth trading links with the EU” – two things which, to an extent, are mutually exclusive because of the red lines set out by the EU and UK in negotiations.Ensuring that there is no border erected between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland – the matter at the heart of opposition to Ms May’s plan – was rated as the key issue by just six per cent of people.EU ‘will renegotiate with Theresa May’ Brexit deal is voted down’Ms May is likely to play for time if the vote does go against her next week, and travel to Brussels for a summit of the European Council where she may ask for further concessions to try and make her deal more palatable to MPs.Despite a string of European figures saying there could be no further talks, ex-commission president Mr Prodi appeared to throw Ms May a lifeline on Saturday. Asked how he expected the commission to respond after the vote, he said: “Negotiate. We must keep free trade between us because it is in the British interests and European interest.”On Saturday, Ms Rudd hit out at Brexiteers who she said “flounce out quite a lot” instead of trying to get things done, an attack coming after Boris Johnson\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspDavid Davis\u0026nbspquit the cabinet over Ms May’s deal.\u0026nbspAll have leadership ambitions and have been jockeying for position ahead of a potential future contest in the coming weeks.In an interview, Ms Rudd also took the unusual step of revealing details of a private conversation with the prime minister, even critiquing her leadership style by saying “she is not always forthcoming” about what she wants.\u0026nbsp \u0026nbspMs Rudd is seen as a leading candidate from the moderate wing of the party and even said in her interview that she hoped it chooses a “centrist” figure for its next leader, though she said a contest at this point would be “too indulgent”.Source Note: BMG Research interviewed a representative sample of 1,508 GB adults online between 4 and 7\u0026nbspDecember.

It’s possible enough will be – but they might not.“We need to try something different. Something that people do in the real world all the time, but which seems so alien in our political culture – to engage with others and be willing to forge a consensus.“That requires politicians to be more prepared to work with anyone who – like me – is willing to accept you can’t always get what you want.

Instead, she promised to secure further assurances from the EU on the issue of the Northern Ireland backstop, which Brexiteers fear could trap the UK in a customs union permanently.\u0026nbspThe prime minister’s\u0026nbsppleas were rebuffed by Brussels on Thursday, however, with EU leaders united in their insistence that negotiations on the withdrawal agreement could not be reopened.Ms May\u0026nbspis likely to face fresh\u0026nbspanger from MPs\u0026nbspon Monday when she will have to admit to the Commons that she has failed to secure any new guarantees on the backstop.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Parliament has taken it. We know the options for Brexit. Parliament will have to decide on one of them.

More than 600 people have paid or put down deposits to fly aboard Virgin\u0027s suborbital missions, including actor Leonardo DiCaprio and pop star Justin Bieber. A 90-minute flight costs $250,000.Short sightseeing trips to space aboard Blue Origin\u0027s New Shepard rocket are likely to cost around $200,000 to $300,000, at least to start, Reuters reported in July. Tickets will be offered ahead of the first commercial launch, and test flights with Blue Origin employees are expected to begin in 2019.Other firms planning a variety of passenger spacecraft include Boeing Co, Elon Musk\u0027s SpaceX and late Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen\u0027s Stratolaunch.In September, SpaceX said Japanese billionaire Yusaku Maezawa, founder and chief executive of online fashion retailer Zozo, would be the company\u0027s first passenger on a voyage around the moon on its forthcoming Big Falcon Rocket spaceship, tentatively scheduled for 2023.Musk, the billionaire CEO of electric carmaker Tesla , said the Big Falcon Rocket could conduct its first orbital flights in two to three years as part of his grand plan to shuttle passengers to the moon and eventually fly humans and cargo to Mars.According to Virgin, SpaceShipTwo is hauled to an altitude of about 45,000 feet (13.7 kms) by the WhiteKnightTwo carrier airplane and released. The spaceship then fires its rocket motor to catapult it to at least 50 miles (80.47 km) above Earth, high enough for passengers to experience weightlessness and see the curvature of the planet.Bezos\u0027 New Shepard has already flown to that altitude - an internationally recognized boundary between Earth\u0027s atmosphere and outer space known as the Karman line - though the Blue Origin trip did not carry humans.Virgin\u0027s Thursday launch likely will not go as high as the Karman line. Virgin\u0027s pilots are aiming to soar 50 miles into the sky - the U.S. military and NASA\u0027s definition of the edge of space and high enough to earn commercial astronaut wings by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration.Thursday\u0027s test flight carried two pilots, four NASA research payloads, and a mannequin named Annie as a stand-in passenger.Additional reporting by agenciesShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Then, on August  his Somerset home was vandalised. Heres his story.Jacob Rees-Mogg is a backbench Tory MP for North East Somerset but is better known for his period drama persona which has been winning him fans.He entered parliament during the  General Election after working as a fund manager in London.During the EU referendum, he was a passionate Brexiteer and made many high-profile media appearances arguing for a vote to leave the EU.To say he was born into a privileged position is an understatement - he is the Eton and Oxford-educated son of the long-serving Times editor William Rees-Mogg.During the  General Election Rees-Mogg attracted ridicule.This is because he brought his faithful nanny along with him as he battled to be elected in the working class and staunchly Labour seat of Central Fe.He had batted away speculation that he would challenge Theresa May for the leadership of the party, insisting he was completely loyal to her.Rees-Mogg said he was more likely to become POPE than PM.On October  he also said changing Conservative leader could cause more problems than it solves and the party should back May.He said the Torys lack of a parliamentary majority meant it would be dficult for an alternative leader to push through an ambitious Brexit deal.Despite all this, he was one of the  Conservative MPs who submitted a letter of no confidence, which triggered a leadership challenge on December , and ultimately failed to oust May.There has been speculation that he might try his hand for the role, but previous polls put his likelihood of becoming PM at -.Outside the political arena, Jacob is a family man with six children.His we is journalist Helena de Chair, daughter of the aristocrat Somerset de Chair.He celebrated the birth of his sixth child with a touching picture on Instagram in September .He wrote: Helena and I announce with great joy that we have a baby Sixtus Dominic Bonace Christopher, a brother for Peter, Mary, Thomas, Anselm and Alfred.In May  it was reported by The Mail on Sunday that he had purchased a new £million house just around the corner from No  Downing Street.The five-storey mansion is just a short walk away from the Parliament and is also close to Tory HQ in the heart of Old Westminster.Rees-Mogg joked he had been priced out of swanky Mayfair and needed a bigger home for his six children.Rees-Mogg named his sixth child Sixtus, which is a Roman name meaning polished.It is also the name of a Pope and Saint.His full name is Sixtus Dominic Bonace Christopher .Sixtus eldest sibling is Peter Theodore Alphege, who was born in .Jacobs only daughter Mary Anne Charlotte Emma came along a year later followed by Thomas Wentworth Somerset Dunstan in  and Anselm Charles Fitzwilliam in .His fth child, Alfred Wulfric Leyson Pius, was featured in a video as his father tried to teach him how to say Brexit.Alfred was born in February .In September , a thug shouted at the children your daddys a horrible person outside their London home.It happened on August , , when the Rees-Mogg family were on holiday in the US.According to the police, graffiti was sprayed on a building and on a car as well as the garden.They managed to write posh scum on windows of the house.The MPs th Century country home, called Gournay Court, is a listed building.He also owns a £.m house in Westminster.Due to his strict Catholic beliefs, Mogg admitted on ITVs Good Morning Britain that he did not support abortion even in the case of rape and incest.I am completely opposed to abortion, le begins at conception, he said.Abortion is morally indefensible.The MP has also repeatedly voted against sex marriage legislation.He defended everyones right to free speech, and insisted thathe ever became Prime Minister, the law is not going to change.Soon after Rees-Mogg made his remarks it emerged the millionaire MP was making money out of an abortion pill despite his strong stance against it.Somerset Capital Management, the investment company he co-founded, owns nearly £million of shares in Indonesian firm Kalbe Farma.Reacting to the story, Rees-Mogg told The Mirror: This is not something I would wish to invest in personally but you have a duty as an investment manager not to impose constraints on investors.He added: This company does not procure the abortion of babies.It’s not my money in these investments and I profit from the total amount of client money we hold, not the investments we make.The Made in Cha star and  Im A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here winner has admitted she has the hots for Rees-Mogg.In an interview with the Sunday Times, Georgia Toff Toffolo revealed the politicians she admired “the standard - Zac Goldsmith, Jacob Rees-Mogg. I fancy them all, adding: Jacob’s a sex god.”The reality star elaborated: “The human mind can be sexy. He’s so clever, I just love him, adding: “I fancy middle-aged politicians, but I’ve never been with one.”Rees-Mogg has responded to news of the -year-olds crush, saying he was “greatly surprised but nonetheless flattered” by the revelation.“I am glad Miss Toffolo won and hope this is the launchpad for a glittering career,” he added.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

This, alas, is the position the Government and the Prime Minister have now reached.For many people their virtues and vices are cut from the same cloth. Indeed, one may simply be an extension of another. This is what we have seen with Mrs May.Her very steadiness, dutulness and determination have led her to be unable to see that her policy has failed. In her latest House of Commons statement it was once again the mantra that “nothing has changed” — these three small dangerous words that did so much damage to her election campaign were wheeled out again but convinced nobody.After Ministers had taken to the media to insist that the vote on her deal would go ahead there was not one word of apology to them or hint of embarrassment that policy had turned on a sixpence. Continuity, instead, was claimed.At the heart of this humiliation was a dreadful deal that does not represent Brexit. As a London cab driver told me yesterday, he did not vote for a deal. He voted to leave.That widespread sentiment is not honoured in the Withdrawal Agreement, which subjects the United Kingdom to the European Union as a vassal state or colony.Yet the humiliation is even greater for having failed even to allow her deal to be voted on in Parliament. Fearing a huge defeat the Prime Minister is now scurrying around the Continent asking for something she said was impossible a few days ago.Last week this deal was the only one available and the British people were told to like it or lump it.Today, apparently new assurances can be given which will allay our fears. Both positions cannot be true and as EU officials have been arrogantly dismissive of Mrs May’s request it seems that only the airline profit margins will benefit from these trips.However, it could have been so dferent. Had the Prime Minister held the vote and lost by over  votes then she would have had proof to show the European Union that the deal could not pass through Parliament.It would have made it abundantly clear that the Withdrawal Agreement had failed and would have encouraged the EU to take her request for change seriously. Instead the President of the Commission and of the Council have mocked her and almost thrown back in her face the line that “nothing has changed”.Fortunately the UK has a trump card, which is to leave without a deal. In these circumstances we would save £billion of taxpayer’s money and be able to remove all tarfs on goods we do not produce,  helping the least well off.We can immediately cut VAT on domestic fuel, helping the elderly in the winter and remove it from women’s sanitary products where the imposition of tax is an injustice.The Prime Minister has challenged those who want to deliver on the Referendum result to be “honest” about the risks of leaving without a deal, including potential queues at Dover, as there have been in the past when the French go on strike or blockade the roads.There is inevitably a risk that the EU is determined to punish a country that leaves and is willing to break International Treaty obligations.On the other hand there are tangible advantages to be had, too, as Mrs May must herself recognise. Otherwise she ought not to have said “no deal is better than a bad deal”. If she never believed this to be the case then it explains why her negotiating position has been so weak and submissive to the EU. It is the root cause of her failure.This must now be recognised. The Government’s Policy, personally linked to the Prime Minister and the operation at Downing Street, has produced an agreement that fails to deliver Brexit and breaks Theresa May’s own promises.This has lost her the confidence of the House of Commons, for she can no longer push her most important business through, and by all constitutional precedence she ought to resign.Mrs May is a decent person with many honourable characteristics but her handling of Brexit has been hopeless, and has left the country, the Conservative Party and the Government humiliated.As we look to forge an agreement that could set our relations with our nearest neighbours for generations and define the authority of our own democracy, it is time for someone who backs Brexit to take over.Theresa May has failed because she never really wanted to do it. She is now caught in the web that she herself spun, and it is her duty to go.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And whether you believe it or not, the Government claims it may be a calamitous economic event.Why, then, are we not already on an emergency footing It is our Government’s job to mitigate the damage. To keep food in the shops, medicines in plentul supply, clean water in our taps and supply chains open to keep our firms going.Why,the danger is so severe, has the Government not suspended all other business  Why is it not working round the clock, including at Christmas, putting every conceivable contingency plan in place, spending billions to get us ready  It’s not wasted money — it’s insurance.Is the Army briefed to help keep us moving  Are our ports and motorways ready  Is the Treasury drafting tax cuts, perhaps slashing corporation tax to zero, to attract global talent and investment to newly-independent Britain  EU states are preparing for No Deal. Cabinet ministers are right to demand the same NOW from Downing Street. Those, that is, not needlessly distracted by measuring up No’s ­curtains themselves in the event that Theresa May falls.Her deal has almost no chance of winning a Parliamentary vote. Her last-minute plea for help in Europe looks doomed. Ireland’s naive, grandstanding PM Leo Varadkar absurdly suggested we simply scrap Brexit.Brussels could give Mrs May enough to satisfy the DUP and her backbenchers — but it won’t. It still hopes to engineer the ­referendum reversal which its stooges, Tony Blair and the “people’s vote” ­brigade, are shamefully plotting.But neither that dangerous, isive vote or the worst-of-all-worlds “Norway Plus” idea look likely to get a majority either. Parliament can oppose No Deal, but without an alternative it’s the default.Planning for it should have begun two years ago. In hindsight, we should have assumed it was the most likely outcome from the off. We would have extracted much better terms from Brussels.No Deal would mean a rocky few months, here and in the EU . . . Ireland especially. But Britain will weather the stormthe hatches are battened down.Look at us now.

Former EU leaders are imploring their successors to see sense.Ex-Commission President José Manuel Barroso says: “If there’s political will the excellent lawyers of the EU can find a creative solution for the backstop.“It is crucial to avoid resentment. I hope the EU council understands it. There will be no third country more important than the UK.”His predecessor Romano Prodi has also said the EU could give ground.But it will take more than vague promises. Our power to exit the Irish backstop has to be legally binding — and approved by Attorney General Geoffrey Cox.It seems vanishingly unlikely. But it’s the one thing that could yet see Mrs May’s deal rise like Lazarus from the dead.PHILIP Hammond’s “extremists” jibe at Brexit-supporting Tory backbenchers was reckless and stupid.If anything is likely to hasten a catastrophic split in the Tories it’s the Chancellor of a minority Government declaring war on scores of his own MPs. But it also displayed staggering ­contempt for politicians committed to honouring the referendum and the election manesto on which they stood.Politics has been debased by charlatans making promises they dump as soon as it’s convenient. It is in a critical stateNOT doing so is “extreme”.If there are extremists in Parliament besides the obvious, Corbyn and McDonnell, it is those playing roulette with national stability by attempting to stage a second referendum before the verdict of the first is carried out.It is incredible that it is considered mainstream, noble even, of these MPs to renege on promises they made and votes they cast — and to refuse to honour the majority’s will because the losing minority must have their “final say”.All while performing intellectual ­contortions to justy what, deep down, they know is unjustiable: imposing their will over the public’s.

They need to do far more when it comes to outreach, actually visiting isolated and deprived areas and talking to children years before they start thinking about university.Otherwise, a child growing up in a community where very few people have a degree will believe university just isn’t for them.The top universities all have their own outreach policies, and don’t work together to reach particularly under-represented parts of the country, which means entire towns can often end up being ignored.The political world doesn’t help, either. A young, white, working-class boy might not think he fits into the current Parliament, and so a vicious cycle of the same sort of people from the same sort of backgrounds going into politics continues. We know all the figures about the percentage of MPs who went to private schools , or that  prime ministers were schooled at Eton.But what we are less likely to realise is that there are entire towns in this country that have never, ever had an MP who was born and schooled locally.Or that the cost of getting into politics means thatyou are from a working-class background, your only hope of becoming an MP is landing a well-paid job first. And that tends to be easieryou’ve been to university.MPs tend to recruit their researchers straight from university. Researchers go on to become special advisers or take other political jobs before becoming MPs, so the political gene pool is articially shallow from the beginning.It’s handy to have MPs who hail from all kinds of backgrounds, but especially useful to have people who grew up in tough circumstances.When governments make mistakes, it is usually the most vulnerable people who suffer first. A Parliament of old Etonians can’t always instinctively realise when a policy is going to cause trouble.I don’t need to tell you that the current Parliament isn’t working very well.From those at the top of government who have failed to take big decisions on Brexit, to the backbenchers who have been busy plotting away, a lot of people in Westminster seem to be lacking a sense of perspective.This week the drama has all been about Brexit, but the infighting means that serious policy problems on social care, domestic abuse and, yes, education are largely ignored.If we made it easier for any bright kid from any background to get to university, perhaps we would have more competition for Parliamentary seats — and end up with better politicians.SoDamian Hinds got his way with universities, he’d be putting the future mediocre politicians out of a job.There might even be entire weeks in politics when you’d have a chance of noticing comments made by the Education Secretary, rather than being distracted by the self-indulgent way in which politicians of all persuasions have ended up conducting themselves.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And now we have introduced the element of a -hour snitch, the elf on a shelf, to keep our kids honest, in case they were a bit suspicious of Father Christmass ability to find out whos been naughty or nice. Of course, the clever kids keep it to themselves that theyve realised that they get Christmas presents from everybody they know except their parents. Hmm...  Getting an early start Alcohol plays a prominent part in the typical family Christmas. Indeed, it might even be essential, depending on which relatives are visiting. But the important thing is to pace yourself. Dont peak too soon. It would be mad, say, to start at breakfast time. Unless youre putting champagne in your orange juice. Straight off the bat, thats one of your five-a-day. Orange juice and grape juice  That might actually be two of your five-a-day. Its practically a health drink… right   Pretending that satsumas are a treat  Its , for heavens sake. Stop treating easily obtainable citrus fruit as an exotic jewel from the mystic east. Its a Christmas stocking, not your childrens lunch box.  Doing Christmas dinner “with a twist”  OK, OK. Christmas dinner is predictable. But guess what  Its supposed to be. You dont complain there isnt a surprising “-past Belgium” between five-past two and ten-past two on the clock, so dont grumble about the fact its turkey again. You remember what happened when you had goose that year  Exactly. Anyway,youre making Christmas dinner, you are allowed to have only one item “with a twist” or theres going to be mutiny. And, realistically, that means you get to do something fiddly with sprouts. In fact, its chestnuts. Its always chestnuts.  Pretending that sausages wrapped in bacon are a vegetable  Christmas is no time for a vegetarian. The centrepiece of the festive dinner is some meat stuffed with more meat. And then, to garnish this, we add some cylinders of meat wrapped in more meat. And somehow we can eat as many of these cylinders as we like, because its basically just like eating extra carrots or sprouts. Christmas dinner is the the only dinner where you can feel relatively virtuous by eating a roast potato.  Sabotaging pudding  Imagine youre eating a nice dessert, in a restaurant, say. Perhaps a lovely sticky toffee pudding. And youre tucking in happily. And then you bite down on a hard piece of metal. Would you call over the waiter and ask him to pass on your compliments to the chef  Or would you leave a very tart review on TripAdvisor  But at Christmas finding an actual coin in your pudding is considered lucky, rather than actionable. It isnt even an accident. Somebody, in fact, a supposed loved one, has intentionally put shrapnel in your dessert. All you can hope is that one of the crackers has instructions on the Heimlich manoeuvre inside.  Playing board games  It always seems like a good idea at the time. What could be nicer than getting the family around the table to play a game after the Christmas dinner has been cleared away  The family, they say, that plays together stays together. The problem is that the family that plays together, cant decide which game theyre going to play. Nor can they agree on the rules, even though theyre very clearly printed on the box. But there is only one game to which everybody knows the rules, and that is snakes and ladders, and it is impossible to cheat in snakes and ladders on behalf of your six-year-old child. Andyour overtired six-year-old child, who has been up since ., cant win, nobody wins.

Brave Kyle Rhodes, six, was also seriously injured in the crash and suffered agonising injuries including a broken leg, internal injuries, a large cut to his neck and damage to his lungs and spleen. The youngster, who now lives with his paternal grandparents, has sadly said he isnt looking forward to Christmas this year, according to his grandma Pat. But friends of the family are hoping he will have something to look forward to after he won a Christmas party with a Santa Sleepover at Alton Towers this weekend. Kyles mum Rebecca Smith,  and five-year old brother Corey Rhodes ere rushed to hospital following the accident in Draycott in August of this year, The Stoke Sentinel reports.  The vile Christmas con that cost Lillian every one of her planned presents But Corey was pronounced dead a short time later and Rebecca died the following day. Kyle was taken by air ambulance to Sheffields Childrens Hospital, where he underwent surgery and had his leg pinned. He is now living with his dad Jamess parents Pat and Jeff Rhodes. Pat, aged , of Well Street, Cheadle, said: We have had a very, very dficult year - especially Kyle. He saw his little brother die. He was extremely close to Corey and misses him so much - he keeps clinging to his grandad, but doesnt talk about the accident. He has blanked it out. Following the accident, Jeff, aged , who works at JCB, took bereavement leave to help look after Kyle with his we who is retired.  Pat said: We are getting used to doing the school run and dealing with paying for school dinners etc, but its all changed since our two sons were at school. Jeff is due to go back to work soon. Because Kyle is so close to his grandad its going to be very dficult, but well get through it. Kyle, a former pupil of Clarice Clf School in Fenton, now attends St Giles Catholic Primary School in Cheadle, where he has been receiving counselling. Pat said: He has started to make friends at school. Ive seen him playing with dferent children and he does his homework every night, but hes very, very quiet. We are trying to make Christmas extra special for him this year and have put a tree and decorations up but he has ignored them. I overheard a woman ask himhe was looking forward to Christmas the other day - he replied no.  To be nominated to win the Santa Sleepover was very, very nice and so kind. Margaret Chandler, who nominated Kyle and his grandparents, said: I saw the Alton Towers competition in The Stoke Sentinel and Kyle came to mind straightaway. After everything he has gone through, I see that little lad go into school every morning with a big smile on his face. Hes had a bad year and its just heart-breaking, but I just thought a little bit of magic will help make things easier for him and give him something to look forward to.The prize includes: Bed and breakfast in the Splash Landings Hotel A festive evening meal Tickets to the Alton Towers Alice in Wonderland pantomime A day ticket to the theme park A one-day entry to the waterpark A game of nine-hole extraordinary golf Evening entertainment including meet and greets and shows A special farewell from Santa Sentinel Editor Martin Tideswell said: We were absolutely overwhelmed with nominations for this brilliant competition prize donated by our friends at Alton Towers. In truth, every nominee was worthy and it was wonderful to see so many people make the time to put others forward for a special treat. Kyle has clearly had a terrible year. We hope this weekend he and his grandparents can make some lovely memories and know that our readers will join us in wishing him a magical time. Divisional Director at Alton Towers Resort, Ian Crabbe, said: “Our hearts go out to Kyle and his family who really do deserve a special treat this Christmas. At Alton Towers Resort, we are all dedicated to making sure our guests have a wonderful time with us, and go home with magical memories.

Adrian Watts spent months detailing his treatment at Bristol Prison before stashing his diaries in furniture over fears his death would be covered up. The -year-old, from Bristol, had complained about being in extreme pain and a growing mass in his stomach, which doctors initially said was gallstones or faeces . From November  to March ,  he lost about six stone and went from a bulky bodybuilder to a shell of a man, Bristol Live reports. Eventually his pain got so bad he could no longer hold a pen so he hid his journals in prison furniture and personal belongings predicting his eventual death. His family only found them after he died when other cell mates told them about the journals - which can be seen below.   He died in Southmead Hospital in March , days after he was diagnosed with terminal cancer. But the health care partnership used by the prison said considerable efforts were made by many healthcare professionals involved in treating Adrian. The journals started off with him writing around an entry a day about how much he missed his children and his plans to get back to them. But it soon started becoming more frantic as he realised he was not going to get the treatment he needed, and it detailed his medication, food, and every aspect of prison le. He writes that he started to “p*** blood”, doubling over in pain, being unable to eat or drink and having to sleep upright in his chair. Adrian initially lost a stone in just  days, and things got worse.  Drawing up a bucket list of things he wanted to do with his six-year-old son, he had hopes things would get better. They didn’t – and by February , he was writing his last letters to his children. Nine months after he died, his daughter Nikita was found dead at home. After Adrian’s death, the journals were handed over to police and the family only received them back in September this year. Avon and Somerset police said they had taken the journals for investigation into potentially involuntary manslaughter from gross negligence. It was unfounded and no further police action was taken. A spokesman for the Ministry of Justice said: “Mr Watts’ claim that his cell was not fit for purpose was fully investigated and found to be unfounded. It was consequently not raised as an issue at the inquest or by the PPO in their report.   “The prison has improved the procedure in place to manage the dietary needs of prisoners with medical needs, in partnership with the healthcare provider.” Health care at Bristol Prison is provided by a partnership made up of several organisations under the name InspireBetterHealth. A spokesperson for the Inspire Better Health partnership, said: On  November , Mr Watts complained of abdominal pain and was referred to a prison GP for this. “He was seen by prison GPs five times in December  and supported by prison nurses as well. Following a referral for suspected cancer from a prison GP on  January , he was assessed by Southmead hospital on  January . “Further tests were carried out by the hospital but sadly Mr Watts’ condition deteriorated and he died on  March . “We appreciate that  was an extremely dficult year for the family of Adrian Watts. His family were understandably concerned by the comments he made in the journals he kept at the time.   “These journals were considered at the official inquest into Mr Watts’ death, which took place on  August . “At the inquest, the family raised concerns about whether there was a delay in diagnosing the cancer . The inquest found that the cancer Mr Watts suffered was extremely dficult to diagnose, and that sadly, diagnosing earlier - between November and January - could not have prevented his death. “At the inquest, there was also a discussion about the dficulties in managing pain. The prison GP explained that this was made more dficult because Mr Watts had been a heroin user and was taking Buprenorphine as a replacement to help reduce the effects of withdrawal. “Considerable efforts were made by many healthcare professionals involved in treating Mr Watts. We appreciate that none of this will bring Mr Watts back and we were very sorry to hear of his death. Adrians diary entries: Note: The four journals consist of tens of thousands of words, with several diary entries nearly every day. Below are excerpts.  Adrian Watts, journal one Adrian has just started writing after he realised he was not getting the treatment he asked for.

The notorious twins, who had shared a jail wing with Moors murderer Ian Brady, became obsessed with the sickening murder of the young girl. They sent numerous letters to Ann which her son discovered after her death. Terry West also found letters from sadistic Brady and fellow Moors shymurderer Myra Hindley. They cruelly taunted her over Lesley Ann’s rape, torture and murder on Boxing Day in . The Krays’ letters were dferent in tone.   Terry, , said: “They are not the kind of letters you would expect from criminals like the Krays. “Everyone knows how vicious the Krays could be. Maybe mum was trying to find out more about Brady in prison. I’d no idea until after mum died they had been shywriting to one another.”Terry was researching his memoir If Only when he found the letters in a bulging suitcase in his late mum’s bedroom. Ann once said the twins had written to her but was very protective of Terry and his siblings and did not elaborate. He said: “Only now do I really know the extent of the relationship.   “She only ever wanted to know more about what happened to her daughter. If they brought her comfort then I can understand why she wrote to them.” He is unsure who had contacted who first: “Maybe she was trying to get information about Brady in prison, I honestly can’t tell. It’s funny to think of my little mum talking to these two ruffians.” Terry hopes the bizarre relationship brought solace to Ann who never recovered from the trauma of losing Lesley Ann, buried naked in a shallow grave on Lancashire’s bleak Saddleworth Moor. She was one of five children aged shybetween ten and  murdered by the evil pairs.Ann West died in  aged  after a long battle with liver cancer but her lelong campaign to keep the monsters behind bars was successful. Both died in hospital as prisoners - Hindley in  aged  and -year-old Brady last year.   The Krays’ letters are from the s. They had known Brady, who was locked up on the same wing as them in HMP Durham in the late s and early s. In  the Krays’ violent reign of protection rackets, armed robberies, arson came to an end when they were jailed for le for murder. In , Ronnie, , died after a heart attack in Broadmoor. Reggie passed five years later of bladder cancer aged . Their letters to Ann, written in shynear-illegible scrawl, show an unusual side to the violent criminals. Terry said: “When I looked at the letters I could barely read them. They look like they’ve been written by a child.”A letter from Reggie, on personalised headed paper from HMP Maidstone, says: “Thank you for your letter and I pray that you have peace of mind [and] soul.”The letters reveal the twins tried to meet Ann and her husband Andy but Terry insisted this never took place. Ronnie wrote in one letter dated August : “I am very sorry but I won’t be able to see you in September as we arranged as I have had all my visits cut down to seven a month, but I will keep in touch from time to time. God bless.”  Terry, of Withington, Gtr Manchester, said: “It’s nice to see a dferent side to the infamous Kray twins with their polite tone.” Brady was in HMP Durham from  until , where the Krays were also held from .He would later boast at a mental health tribunal that he used to cook steaks with the twins. But Terry believes this was pure shyfantasy. He said: “I think that was shyanother one of his lies. Brady wanted to change the perception of himself from a paedophile serial killer to some sort of Ned Kelly gangster. He wanted to play with the big boys.” Terry is sure the Krays would have turned on Brady because of his heinous crimes.He said: “If they had got shyanywhere near him you can only shyimagine what they would have done to him. I think they would have shyseriously hurt him. “I know they were ruffians and gangsters and all of that but they didn’t hurt children.” Brady and Hindley were convicted of luring children and teenagers to their deaths from July  and October . Brady was jailed in  for murdering John Kilbride, , Lesley Ann, and Edward Evans, , and later admitted to killing Pauline Reade, , and Keith Bennett. The -year-old’s body is believed to be on the moor but has never been found, despite pleas for Brady to reveal his final resting place by Keith’s mother Winnie Johnson, who died in . Lesley Ann’s remains were found in  and laid to rest near her home. It was later moved to a secret location after her grave was heartlessly desecrated. For three years, on what would have been Lesley’s birthday, the graffiti “Myra Hindley” was scrawled in black paint across the headstone. Now Lesley lies in a grave alongside her mother Ann, and Terry makes a weekly pilgrimage to their final resting place to lay flowers.He admits he still feels guilty over her disappearance as he was bed-ridden with flu and had not gone with his younger sister to the fair where she was abducted. He said: “I see the -something man in the mirror and the mental scars of pain look back at me.” When Terry visits their grave on Boxing Day he will lay a wreath to honour their memory. He said: “The pain of her death will never get easier, and I think about it every day. “But I am happy my mum and sister are at peace together. “I imagine them both as angels sitting in heaven – just like the angel on top of the Christmas tree.” "},{"url":null,"title":"lotto results saturdays winning national","story":"NewsLotto results: Saturdays winning National Lottery numbers for £.m jackpotCheck back here after .pm for the winning numbers for tonights National Lottery and Thunderball drawsShareCommentsByNeil Murphy:,  DEC Updated:,  DEC NewsA le-changing sum is up for grabs tonight in the National Lottery draw \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe National Lottery draw takes place tonight and lucky players could win a le-changing amount.

Shes also claimed that Meghan was also their dad Thomas Markles favourite, and she always got the best presents.  In his book Meghan Markle: A Hollywood Princess, royal biographer Andrew Morton claims she would always get exactly what she wanted for Christmas, regardless of the price tag. He describes how Samantha often told the story of the time before Christmas when Meghan was looking at a jewellery catalogue and picking out a ring, which Tom Senior promised as a gt. The book also claims that Meghan teased her much older sister by saying that whatever her father bought [her half-sister Samantha], Meghan would receive the most expensive gt as she was the most favoured child.

Meghan Markle will be attended her second Christmas in the royal household this year, following in the footsteps of her late mother-in-law. Ahead of Dianas first festive trip to Sandringham, her butler Paul Burrell offered her a key piece of advice. And since he has now left the royal household, Mr Burrell hopes Prince Harry will offer the same words to Meghan Markle.  Speaking to the Mail Online, he said: All these people are members of the royal family, they are all larger than le, have character to go with it. Everyone is jostling for position and attention, and theyre bouncing off the walls after four days. Its like a pinball machine. They all want to please the Queen and want airtime with her, its the one time that they can sit down with the head of the family and make an impression. Its what I said to Diana when she first came into the family, try to get airtime with the Queen, speak into her ear. The best time to do it is when shes seated at her card table, before and after dinner, she will sit and play Bridge or Canasta and shell always ask people to join her, thats your chance to get quality time and tell the monarch what youre thinking and feeling.  Mr Burrell is hoping Meghan uses this time to talk to the Queen, rather than talking dresses and jewels with other royals.

Charley Wills was at her lowest ebb after leaving an abusive relationship and spiralled into a dark place which left her crippled with depression. In September, the beauty therapist found herself driving to a multi-storey car park, where she sat on the edge in a bid to end her le. However the -year-old was stopped by a Samaritan who she has now been reconnected with, reports Examiner Live. Charley, who has a one-year-old son named Hugo, said: I just couldnt handle all things that were happening to me. I had lost my home and a lot of people in my le. I felt like nobody understood and I just needed a cuddle. Id got really ill and Hugo was going back to his dads for a few days. That was the day everything went crashing down. I drove to the top of the multi-storey car park - there were so many thoughts going through my head.  In my head I was there for only five minutes but in reality it was probably about an hour. This lady came over and held my waist. She said, lets just go and get a cup of coffee, things are going to be okay. Every time I inched closer to the edge she would just hold me. If it werent for her and the police lady who turned up, my little boy would have no one to tuck him into bed at night. Charley, who is originally from Honley but now lives with her sister Casey in Wakefield, was sectioned after the incident, but has since begun her recovery and is on the mend. She added: I know my worth now. The day I was sectioned, I would have still got back with my ex. Then I got a message from him saying I should have jumped. To say that to your childs mother is disgusting. In a bid to find the stranger who helped her, Charley put a post on Facebook in the hope it would reach her. Facebook delivered, after the post was shared hundreds of times and it was spotted by someone who knew the lady and tagged her in it.  I sent her a message on Facebook just to say thank you along with a picture of my son, said Charley. She replied saying that just knowing I was okay was enough in the way of thanks. I honestly cant thank all these people enough. If it werent for her, the police officer, and my sister Casey, Hugo would be without a mum to put him to bed and to watch TV with. There are so many people in this situation who are in abusive or manipulative relationships and need to get out. I realise now that Im worth  times more than he made me feel.

Jo Tucker, , says  per cent of her hair was gone in two weeks and the rest followed, which happened out of nowhere and for no apparent reason. The mum-of-three, from Bath, said she found the lack of control hideous and traumatic as she not only lost the hair on her head, but also on her body. Having alopecia initially made her feel ugly and lost and with no explanation why, she says she even thought she was dying. But Jo embraced her condition, pulling off vibrant, fabulous wigs and courageously posting pictures online of her bald head to raise awareness of alopecia. She says she was determined to speak openly about living with her condition - including to her little girls. Matilda, nine, Elsie, six, and Ivy, one, have taken their mums alopecia in their stride, and speak honestly about it, asking questions that come to their minds. Jo says they have asked why it had happened, why mummy has no eyelashes, and when her hair will come back.  Speaking to Mirror online Jo said: I talk to them so they know they can talk to me about anything. They ask why it happened. My eldest daughter asks to dress up in my wigs. Matilda will ask would you like to borrow my black hat  Elsie asks the most questions. She asks why dont you have any eyelashes and when will your hair grow back  I give them the answer that it might grow back or it might not, and they move on. I have tried to take an approach where I explain to them that mummy is fine but now she gets the opportunity to wear dferent hair that she likes. They say mummy, why dont you wear this one and oh mummy you are quite lucky because you get to wear this hair. They also say things like mum, one day you can have short hair and the next day long. Matilda has got the best understanding of it -she spots anybody without hair she says oh she hasnt got hair like you.  Jo, who works as a buyer, said her hair loss happened between December  to January this year. She said she noticed a patch missing on the underneath of her hair. But this had happened during her second pregnancy and everything had grown back after she gave birth, so she wasnt worried. After having her third daughter, she says she also had a little patch appear and disappear again. But this time it was dferent.  In December, the shedding ramped up and I was noticing it in my hands, and it escalated, Jo, who used to have a pixie hairstyle, recalled. I went to the doctor and had blood tests but by that point  percent of it had gone - in about two weeks over the Christmas period. It was so rapid, it was coming out in clumps in the shower. I could feel it falling, it was really weird. I could touch the ends of my hair and a clump would come out in my hands, it was really traumatic. When I went back to work after Christmas I needed a wig I had lost that much.  Jo was diagnosed with alopecia areata around January time, a general term for hair loss that can occur at any age. But by February this had developed into alopecia universalis, complete loss of hair on the scalp and body. Her arm hair was the last to go in March. Jo said she had blood tests which showed that technically nothing was wrong with her. She says she wasnt going through a particularly stressful period when she lost her hair, adding it really did seem to come from nowhere.  At first, Jo struggled to deal with what was happening. She said: When it first started happening it was really traumatic. I felt really disgusting and ugly. You just dont feel normal. The lack of control is hideous. I couldnt put a stop to it. I felt really lost. For a really long time it was awful. You just dont know whats going on. I genuinely thought I was dying. Going back to work, I think I just cried solidly for a week. Then I went for afitting, which was amazing. It brought me back a tiny bit of confidence.  She added: I was worried about what my husband would think of me, would he still find me attractive . Itseems so signicant but psychologically and mentally it goes way deeper than how you look. Jo said her husband Joe has taken her condition into his stride and he doesnt seem to notice it anymore. She said that everything just started falling, joking Im the smoothest person I know. Jo said she has even lost her eyebrows, eyelashes, and nostril hair, and says in the end she clipped off the last whispy bits on her head. I even miss the little bit of moustache I used to have, its really strange, she added.  But Jo keeps amazingly positive for her girls and embraces changing her style daily. The mum says she doesnt want Matilda, Elsie, and Ivy to think shes unwell as technically theres nothing wrong with me. She explained: I tell them some people just dont have any hair and its fine. Children adapt really well. They embrace the hair thing with me. I have got a pink wig they love. I was conscious and didnt want their friends to talk about me, I didnt want it to be a negative thing. I have been blatant about it because I change the colours of the wigs. My eldest daughter asks to dress up in them. We always try and talk to the girls and say there are lots of dferent people in the world, who might have dferent ailments.  She added: I had been worried about other people saying things to them - and worried about them worrying about me . Its just everyday le for themnow. I worry it could be hereditary, I worry for their sakes. Jo, who thinks it is unlikely her hair will grow back, says she has found the community of people on Instagram with alopecia supportive. She said: Its like being a member of a club no one wants membership for in the first place.Shes also open with friends about her condition. I take the lead in being open on the subject, so friends are open to talking about it, she said. I try to make people feel comfortable with it.  Jos highs and lows of daily le with alopecia Highs - Embracing the wig wearing - I have cut my getting ready time down as I can whizz my wig on and Im done - Ive got salon looking hair every day - The bond you make with someone  who has got alopecia - its like youre in a sisterhood - Inspiring other people - Ive had messages saying my daughter is suffering and you have helped.  Lows - It feels and looks so strange when I wake up - Its a pain to have to draw in my eyebrows every day - Wearing glasses is a pain with a wig as you have to tuck the arms into the hair- Having a cold and my nose running uncontrollably - which is embarrassing- Girls holidays are challenging - youre either sweating in a wig or embracing the baldness - Exercise classes - you just want to blend in but you stick out.

The tomb is decorated with hieroglyphs and statues and archaeologists are preparing to make more discoveries as they excavate the site. It was found buried in a ridge untouched and unlooted at the ancient necropolis of Saqqara, according to Mostafa Waziri, secretary-general of the Supreme Council of Antiquities. He described the latest find as one of a kind in the last decades.The tomb dates from the rule of Neferirkare Kakai, the third king of the Fth Dynasty of the Old Kingdom.  Archaeologists removed a last layer of debris from the tomb on Thursday and found five shafts inside. One of the shafts was unsealed with nothing inside, however the other four were sealed and teams are expecting to make discoveries when they start uncovering the shafts on Sunday. Waziri is particularly hopeful about one of the shafts, which he believes could lead to a coffin.I can imagine that all of the objects can be found in this area. This shaft should lead to a coffin or a sarcophagus of the owner of the tomb. The tomb is  metreslong, three metreswide and just under three metres high.  Waziri said the tomb is unique because of the statues and its near perfect condition.He said: The colour is almost intact even though the tomb is almost , years old.The tomb lies in a buried ridge that has only partially been uncovered and more discoveries are expected to be made there when archaeologists start more excavation work in January.The Fth Dynasty ruled Egypt from about , BC to , BC, not long after the great pyramid of Giza was built.Saqqara served as the necropolis for Memphis, the capital of ancient Egypt for more than two millennia.Ancient Egyptians mummied humans to preserve their bodies for the afterle, while animal mummies were used as religious offerings. Egypt has revealed over a dozen ancient discoveries this year.The country hopes the finds will brighten its image abroad and revive interest among travelers who once flocked to its iconic pharaonic temples and pyramids but who fled after the  political uprising.

Protesters donned yellow vests and some had hard hats, while others tied scarves over their faces. Those who gathered outside the Custom House overlooking the River Lfey before marching to parliament at Leinster House included pro-Palestinian organisations and socialist republicans. Others involved in the gathering said they were concerned about the use of fluoride in the public water supply. While anti-Government chanting could be heard.  The yellow vest movement in France, which takes its name from the fluorescent safety vests French motorists must carry in their vehicles, emerged in mid-November as a protest against fuel tax increases. It soon expanded into an expression of rage about the high cost of living in France and President Emmanuel Macrons policies. It comes as tear gas has been fired on the streets of Paris during a fth week of nationwide protests against the French government. Ignoring calls not to demonstrate following a gun attack in Strasbourg earlier this week, thousands of yellow vest activists were out in a huge show of strength.  In Paris, police were out in force to contain possible outbursts of violence. Tear gas was fired at small groups of protesters in brief clashes with riot police near the Champs-Elysees. Close by, a handful of topless activists from the feminist protest group Femen faced security forces a few meters away from the Elysee Palace, the presidents residence. The yellow vest movement started in mid-November with protests at junctions and roundabouts against fuel tax increases, but quickly became a wider mobilisation against Macrons economic policies.  Successive weekends of protests in Paris have lead to vandalism and violent clashes with security forces. But several major stores, such as the Galeries Lafayette, were open to welcome Christmas shoppers. Numbers were down compared to Saturday last week, a police source said. Loic Bollay, , marching on the Champs-Elysees in a yellow vest, said the protests were more subdued than in previous weeks but the movement would go on until the demonstrators grievances were addressed. Since the Strasbourg attack, it is calmer, but I think next Saturday and the following Saturdays... it will come back. The Interior Minister said around , police were active on Saturday with a reinforced presence in the cities of Toulouse, Bordeaux and Saint-Etienne.  A police source told Reuters some , protesters had been counted in France, excluding Paris, by am, compared to , at the same time on December . In Paris, where groups of hundreds of protesters marched in splintered groups in several neighbourhoods,  had been arrested by around midday, according to a Paris police official. On Friday, President Macron called for ato calm in France after nearly a month of protests by the so-called yellow vest movement against his governments policies. The demonstrations have hit growth and caused widespread disruption.  France needs calm, order and ato normal, Macron said, after a meeting of European Union leaders in Brussels. In a televised address to the nation on Monday, Macron announced wage rises for the poorest workers and tax cuts for pensioners in further concessions meant to end the movement but many said they would maintain pressure. The government, as well as several unions and opposition politicians called on protesters to stay off the streets on Saturday, after four people were killed in a gun attack at a Christmas market in the historic city of Strasbourg.

So you couldnt attribute that solely to training.\"The staff shortages became part of growing dissatisfaction with rail services, with many passengers hitting out through social media.One was Inverness man David Balfour who said his train trip to Inverness on Sunday was \"packed to the rafters\" with dozens invading First Class and sitting on the floor.And yesterday there was widespread disruption when a signalling fault near Aviemore led to cancellations and delay.There was also a problem with the .am service out of Inverness to Edinburgh after a fault in the brakes was detected only yards from the station and the train was cancelled.Highlands and Islands Labour MSP Rhoda Grant said: ldquoScotRailrsquos performance has been plummeting, official figures have shown.ldquoMeanwhile, reliability is getting worse too and with winter under way, ScotRail passengers have also been experiencing widespread disruption while continuing to pay extortionate sums for failing services.ldquoIf new timetables add to those woes then the Scottish Government must act.\"Labour forced a vote in the Scottish Parliament asking the Government to scrap the ScotRail franchise - but the SNP joined forces with the Tories to vote it down.This week transport secretary Chris Grayling was told he should resign over the \"chaotic rollout\" of new railway timetables in England.A UK government transport select committee report into the widespread disruption to tens of thousands of passengers back in May, said Mr Grayling should have been more proactive to prevent the delays caused by the timetable changes, which saw Govia Thameslink Railway fail to run  per cent of its planned service in the weeks following May , and Arriva Rail North not running around  per cent of its trains.Saturday  Dec  : PM"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04118000/04118738.jpg","title":"Rose Window to enjoy new lease of life","story":"A TREASURED stained glass window salvaged several decades ago from a building demolished in the city centre could see the light of day again.That is the hope of Highland Council who is looking to seethe window, regarded by many to be a work of art, can be fitted into the new Inverness Castle project.A campaigner who has pressed for years to get the intricate window re-installed said it was music to his ears.Bill Anderson, former Inverness Local History Forum chairman, was \"absolutely ecstatic\" and believes many others will feel the same.The giant Rose Window began le as part of an th century Methodist church where it had pride of place at the junction of Inglis Street and Hamilton Street, facing Academy Street.But a road-widening project almost  years ago, making Academy Street two-way and creating scope for the Eastgate Centre to be built, meant the demolition of the restaurant.The relic was packed away and is still boxed at the cityrsquos roads department.And now the Courier can reveal it stands a good chance of becoming an eye-catcher once again, studding Inverness Castle and playing a prominent part in ongoing plans to relocate the Scottish Courts and Tribunals Service from that site to create a ldquomust-see visitor centre \"celebrating the spirit of the Highlands\".There were murmurings earlier this year that it could be a feature in the new station faccedilade at Inverness Railway Station.However, the council said it has other plans, although nothing has been agreed.Stuart Black, director of development  infrastructure, said the window could not feature as part of the original castle building.ldquoThe castle is a Category A listed building so any re-use would have to be in a new build element of the project,\" he said.\"We are a very early stage in the process of concept design for any new building in the vicinity of the castle.Mr Andersonsaid: \"Im absolutely ecstatic that the council is planning on using it there.

It is never going to go.People say racism is taught.At a certain age it is taught.If you are three, four, five, six, seven, eight and you come out with something that you have obviously heard around the home and people you are around, I get that.That stuff withSterling and Scotty Sinclair, the stuff with me. You are not taught that.That one who did that against Sterling. He has chosen to say those things, to try to say the most hateful and hurtful things to somebody.The person in the Scott Sinclair video.That guy is taking a penalty against Aberdeen and he doesn’t want him to score against his team.But why would you ever bring up somebody’s race  I have arguments with loads of people and it doesn’t once cross my mind to bring in what colour I am looking at. Because when I am looking at someone I am looking at a human being.It doesn’t matter what colour they are. So to say something like that, it is your choice.When you are an adult and you get past  to  anything you then come out with or your actions, it’s all down to choice from you.Anything that comes out of your mouth no one can make you say that, unless you choose to say it.It is never going to be gone.I’m not going to say it might be the next game or the next game but there will be a time in a game when somebody feels they want to choose to say something like that.For me you can stand and say it in my face, it doesn’t bother me.I just highlight it because I just want people to know that people like that are still out there.Whether it is an Aberdeen fan saying it against a Celtic player, Rangers player, Hibs player or Dundee player. It is irrelevant who is saying it because I will never be on their side whether they are an Aberdeen fan or not.In this day, it is  and I just think it is despicable.You have to choose your words correctly.If you want to say it, say it – but you will be judged on it.This guy who did it against Sterling had a nice job but he chose to say a word against a player who is playing against his football team.Now he has lost it. Is it really worth it  No.No. It is not just in football, you get it in all forms of le. Football is a job. You are going to get it in a factory, get it in a swimming pool, a library.Racism happens all over and it is a choice. It is sad that it is still going on nowadays but poverty and unemployment are happening now. Things can be done to help prevent itand try to make it better but it is always going to be there.Bullying, poverty, racism you will never get a world when that isn’t there.For me personally I bring up my kiddies and I want them to respect everybody.I always say, show respect to anybody who shows you respect.Andthey don’t show respect walk away from them.You don’t have to be around people like that. If everyone had that idea, I don’t think everyone does, then it would be a better place. That sort of thing might not happen so much, but I guarantee it will happen again.Yes, loads of times.Even now people say about the Tonev thing, there was no proof. But there was proof.They didn’t see the video recordings of the game in the room that we were all in. So they don’t know what has gone on.I would never try to say anyone did anything to me racist to ruin anyone’s career.I am not that person.So when I go and get a ball and people are shouting at me I don’t report it. It is irrelevant to me.You can say whatever you like about me, I’m playing a game of football and you are trying to hurt me.We are probably winning the game and that is why you are upset.Becauseyour team are winning you are not going to say anything.It is only when the chips are down, you are frustrated, that those sort of things come out. Loads of times people have said things.And you know what  It hasn’t been the bigger games and it seems to be against the same sort of teams.I don’t ever bring it up.You can say it to my face and I walk away. It doesn’t bother me.That is what I put up with – it is water off a duck’s back.I am black, I get that.My kiddies are black. I have a white mum, my dad’s black.I have a white nan, I have a white brother.It doesn’t matter to me what colour you are.I love all sorts of people and I show anybody respect who shows me respect.Tonev did not show me respect so I showed him no respect in terms of I reported that. Because he is a professional footballer and at the time there were four or five black people on his team.So you have just said that to me.It was a lack of respect.It is what it is, you don’t cry about spilt milk and that stuff is in the past.I am sure there will be, maybe not towards me, but there will be racism in the game.You just have to deal with it.I think there are bigger issues as well such as the situation with Leigh Grfiths who is struggling with depression or habits.He needs help.Someone shouting things at me, I am of the mindset that it is not affecting my le or my career.Leigh is in a position where the stuff is affecting his le so the focus needs to go on that.Things where people feel in a position where they are really struggling with le.With just getting out of bed.People see him driving a flash car, playing football for a big club but they don’t see behind it when he is at home.When in his head he is thinking all these things.They are the sort of people who need help and I hope he can get all the help he needs."},{"url":null,"title":"bah humbug as oaps told to take down decorations","story":"Residents in an Aberdeen sheltered-housing complex today hit out at the council after being ordered to take down their Christmas decorations for health and safety reasons.A tree and other festive ornaments had gone up at Murray Court in Woodside, but they have all been removed on the orders of Aberdeen City Council.Residents say the move has “ruined the Christmas spirit” and called on the council to ease the rules.The local authority has defended the move – which affects all multi-storey council buildings – saying Christmas trees and decorations “may cause an obstruction”.A Christmas tree went up in Murray Court foyer last Sunday.However, by the following day, it had been removed.A long-time resident was told by staff that she had until pm the next day to take down other decorations.The woman, who asked not to be named, said: “I had been talking to the staff to seewe could get some Christmas decorations up, because it’s already December and by this time last year, we at least had a tree.“I spoke to the manager who said he would look into putting something up. A tree went up by the main entrance on Sunday, but by Monday, it was gone. When we asked what happened, the manager said they were told by Aberdeen City Council to take them down.”To brighten the foyer in the absence of a tree, residents then started putting up decorations – but they too broke the new rules.The resident added: “I decided to decorate our floor, since every year it’s decorated. We put up pictures on the wall and I even made a Santa postbox.“Some other tenants on the floor helped me make it for the kids who come to visit so they could drop off their letters. The next day I was told to take them down.“I almost didn’t want to finish taking them down because I was so upset.”Pam Lynch, , who has lived in the building for the last decade, said the tenants are “disgusted” by the decision.She said: “The council are taking away the Christmas spirit. We have all come together to put little bits and bobs together to brighten up the area.“And they just take it away – it’s just sad. We are all quite disgusted and angry that it’s happened.”Norman Innes, , said this was the first time in his  years at Murray Court that residents would go without any Christmas decorations.He added: “It’s Christmas time and we should be allowed to put up a Christmas tree at least.“Everyone is really upset by this. Someone took the time to decorate our floor and then was asked to take everything down.“The council might be thinking about the health and safety issues, but there must be a way to decorate safely. Christmas is coming up and now it’s ruining the Christmas spirit.”His we, Freda, , added: “During Christmas time, there’s a lot of people in this building who cannot get out. Little things like this can make a big dference to them and the people who come to the building to see them.“A Christmas tree can light up everyone’s day and brightens up the place. It’s just a shame.”An Aberdeen City Council spokeswoman said: “We want all residents in all our buildings to enjoy the festive season in a safe and comfortable environment.“To ensure the fire service has clear and an unobstructed access to all communal areas in multi-storey properties, residents have been advised not to have items in communal areas.“This includes motorised scooters, Christmas trees and decorations, where they may cause an obstruction. We work closely with the Scottish Fire and Rescue Serviceand residents to ensure safety is a priority for all.”Bruce Farquharson, SFRS local senior officer, said: “We want everyone to have a safe and a very happy Christmas. It is a time of celebration but it is also a time when we unfortunately see an increased risk of fire and that is why we this week launched our winter safety campaign.“It is, of course, imperative that any communal areas and stairwells are kept clear of large objects and flammable materials so that residents can make their way to a place of safety in the event of an emergency.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2018/12/pj-cr-091218-04-003-2.jpg-2-847x564.jpg ","title":"groups decorate dozens of christmas trees at aberdeen church","story":"A Christmas tree festival has opened its doors as it celebrates  years of bringing festive joy to Aberdeen.Trees decorated by dferent groups have gone on display inside and outside Cults Parish Church in Aberdeen.Each year church groups, community organisations and businesses get involved with the festival by sponsoring a tree.The event is now a “firm favourite” among members of the community, with young and old making the trip to the church hall to see all the decorations.Members of the public are invited to go along to see the festive offering until Sunday from  to pm each day. vw, px\"  Before they are moved into the church for the festival, the trees are cared for all year round by a dedicated group of volunteers.Trees are taken from the church grounds before being potted and readied for decoration by community groups.Around  trees are on display this year, including ones from Cults Toddler Group, Tor Na Dee Care Home, the Rainbows and Guides and Cults Academy.Sheila Moir, a church elder, told the Evening Express she looked forward to the festival.She said: “The number of trees since the start has increased.

As he says, it is far too dependent on the vagaries of the weather.Tidal power can never fail and here in Mid Argyll we have potentially the most efficient and cost-effective tidal system under our noses. This, in turn, would open up additional tourist and recreational facilities at virtually no extra cost. This would be a win-win situation, but without, I suspect, sufficient profit to satisfy the usual parasitic financial interests.What is this simple and relatively inexpensive answer Simply build a sea wall or dam, call it what you will, across the relatively narrow entrance of Loch Gilp from the Lingerton promontary towards Ardrishaig via the rocky skerries, which would reduce the cost, and finish short of the Ardrishaig lighthouse harbour wall, thus funneling all the tides through a very narrow area.Then simply incorporate as many sea locks and gates as needed to allow passage of boats in and out of the harbour and the Crinan Canal.The additional locks would be used for either lower-able turbines or permanently submerged tidal units such as in the Pentland Firth. This would be simple and cost-effective, as the generating turbines catch the tides both in and out. After all, the Romans were using tide mills , years ago, so the idea is nothing new.In addition to this, Ardrishaig would finish up with an enhanced harbour  and marina and, with a few rocks removed from the beach, the wide open area at low tide back to Lochgilphead # now wasted # would make a splendid international course for activities such as land yacht racing.The other deceitful cuckoo that we should consider debunking is the very misleading fallacy that electric cars are helping to save the planet. Yes, it is ideal and justied for town or city use to keep the fume level down in densely built up areas where fresh air is in short supply among high buildings. But generally their use is unjustiable because pollution would actually increase considerably overall because to generate every single power unit of electricity it takes roughly two polluting units of other fuels such as coal, oil or even gas to produce that single electrical unit.So, unless the electricity is always generated from renewable systems such as hydro, tidal, solar or wind, then total pollution would go up, not down.One more cuckoo destined to be the sham of another expensive white elephant.Bob Henderson, LochgilpheadSir,We would like to say a huge thanks to all the bands who played on the Sunday of this year#s Tarbert Music Festival for making it a successful afternoon after the event had to be moved from the quay to the village hall # this has to be our most stressful decision.Thanks to all the hotels and pubs for organising the great music for the weekend.We raised just over £ at the coffee morning, so thanks to everyone who baked or donated and also to all the helpers # Anne, Gail,Jane, Allie, Nina and Zena.Many thanks also to the award-winning Mid Argyll Pipe Band, who entertained a huge crowd in the pouring rain and also the Loch Fyne Pipe Band who played to the Sunday survivors.To Mrs Brown, our very own collector extrondanaire, her wee buckets totalled £.Finally, and most importantly, thanks to visitors and locals for turning out to support our music festival.Thank you all.Margaret, Duncan, Barbara and Kirsten of Tarbert Music FestivalSir,The National Autistic Society is looking for people and organisations who have done something amazing for autistic children, adults, or their families.Perhaps it’s a teacher who has helped a child achieve something great, an autistic adult who has been campaigning tirelessly or a business that has put a lot of effort into making their workplace accessible.If any of your readers know of a person or organisation like this, please nominate them for our seventh annual Autism Professionals Awards.

We have ended up with the worst of all possible outcomes, with England and Wales voting to leave and leaving, Northern Ireland voting to remain and retaining a foothold into the EU and Scotland who voted to remain being completely dragged out against its will.No one should fall for this  choice being desperately spun by this isolated Tory Prime Minister, that seeks to force us to choose between a #bad deal# or a #no deal# at all.Brendan O#Hara MP, Argyll and ButeSir,We expect over  schools to be represented at next year’s Scottish Schools Pipe Band Championships, based on the number of school pupils being taught in programmes run by the Scottish Schools Pipes and Drums Trust .The trust now has projects going in  council areas supporting lessons to over , young people.We are getting a large number of enquiries from schools wanting to come along to the event on March  in Livingston.SSPDT aims to safeguard our wonderful musical traditions and to help young people develop skills for le, learning and work, with a focus on deprived and remote areas, by helping to introduce piping and drumming tuition to state schools on a par with orchestral instruments.We established the championships in  to offer a positive and friendly experience for players who are new to competition, and as a forum for bands at the very top of their game.The trust has resources to support more state schools in Scotland to introduce piping and drumming tuition, and we invite local education authorities, teachers and parents to contact us.All enquiries can be made via our website sspdt.org.ukAlexandra Duncan, chief executive, Scottish Schools Pipes and Drums TrustSir,Having campaigned extensively for the re-opening of the A after a landslide in October, I welcome Cabinet Secretary Michael Matheson’s commitment to identying a permanent solution to disruption on the road, whilst continuing to invest in shorter term mitigation measures.Closures to the A lead to untenable ersions and re-routing of traffic onto other roads, which is why is absolutely essential for permanent measures to be put in place to end these closures.The safety of the people who use this road has always been the top priority for the Scottish Government, and I am grateful to all those who have been involved in working towards a practical solution to make this road accessible for local people, visitors and businesses in my constituency.Michael Russell MSP, Argyll and ButeSir,The withdrawal agreement with the European Union has now been published.Our industry has consistently called for clarity over what that UK’s new relationship with the EU will look like in practice, particularly on the continued protection of geographical indications, customs procedures and future trade policy.The provisions set out in the withdrawal agreement provide us with a credible foundation on which to build in the next phase of the negotiations, during which a number of critical issues remain to be resolved.A no-deal Brexit would cause the Scotch whisky industry considerable dficulties and would force cost and complexity into production, distribution and exporting.  The withdrawal agreement is a compromise, but it is a positive step towards much needed business certainty.Karen Betts, chief executive, Scotch Whisky AssociationSir,I am struck by the comments of Theresa May that her Brexit plan will stop EU migrants #jumping the queue# when it comes to working in the UK.How low the UK has sunk that its Brexiteer government is now resorting to spreading resentment towards European citizens, classing them as #queue jumpers#. These iniduals took no part in this mess and work here legally and contribute to the country in so many dferent ways.They have the same general right of freedom of movement that allows British people the opportunity to work in Berlin and Paris, or retire in Spain.Even so, their reward seems to be an increasingly hostile atmosphere. Ms May makes no mention of those British #queue jumpers# in other EU countries, symptomatic no doubt of the same attitude that classes those Brits abroad as #expats#, while those from the other EU countries who come to work here are #immigrants#, an increasingly negative term.Since the referendum in  there has been an alarming increase in both veiled and more explicit verbal abuse to EU nationals, and this will no doubt increase as the negative impacts of Brexit become clearer and scapegoats will be required. Step forward those innocent EU nationals in our midst.The UK has taken a wrong turn, as exhibited by the dog-whistle politics of Theresa May and her Tory government.As the UK enters full panic mode, the victim of a bitter and corrupted Etonian gamble gone very wrong, we must do all that we can to support those EU nationals in our midst and defy this vile populist rhetoric.Alex Orr,  Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"luke naisby named red stars new manager","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Subscribe NowAccomplished defender Luke Naisby is Lochgilphead Red Star AFC#s new manager.The new manager#s first challenge was to take charge of Red Star against Ferguslie Star AFC on Saturday November  in Paisley.The Red Star Facebook page said: #The committee is delighted to welcome him to his new role with the club.

No wonder he looked nervous.The boys got to grips with the dferent handling characteristics of Willie Senior#s car and started to up the pace in the afternoon bringing the car home in a respectable th overall and third in class three. This result was enough to secure second position in the overall championship in class.Jamie Miller continued the learning process with the little Citroen C-RMax with Ian McCulloch pointing him in the right direction. A very neat rally from Jamie with very few mistakes saw him finish a creditable th overall and second in class two, only beaten by the Scottish Tarmac Champion for  Michael Harbour in his similar Citroen, who was only one place above him after seven stages.Innes Mochrie was once again out on the stages in the Mightyand this time he had someone whom he might listen to in the co-driver#s seat. His daughter, Kirsty, had elected to fill the silly seat for this event and they, after a few first stage detours, managed to keep speaking right to the end and brought the class one pocket rocket home in th overall and a brilliant second in class. The mind boggles as to what the result could have been , as Kirsty was heard to remark, she had #someone who would listen to her#.Jonothan MacDonald and Chris Wareham were out in the beautully prepared Mull of Kintyre Cheese sponsored Peugeot . Their pace was good enough for th overall and fourth in class three.Mull pair Malcolm MacDougall and Stuart MacLean were out in the class one Vauxhall Nova and were getting visibly quicker as the day went on, a trend that had repeated itself over the course of the year with confidence and technique increasing with every stage mile covered. They finished th overall and a commendable fourth in class one.There were three Argyll co-drivers directing their pilots around the airfield. Ian Parker, recently announced as one of seven # and the only Scot # co-drivers to be selected to join the MSA Academy for , was back in the Honda Civic of Fraser Smith. The Civic screamed its way round the stages with minimal fuss, other than perhaps a lucky trip on two wheels after clipping a tyre, to finish in nd overall and fourth in class two.The final Argyll man out was Eoghan Anderson from Cairnbaan who was shouting left and right for Greg Inglis of Montrose in his quick and agile Lotus Exige. Eoghan had been co-driver for Alan Kirkaldy in the earlier Granite Stages Rally, also held at Leuchars, and they had been first overall that day, so no pressure there, then.Greg found the Lotus was almost perfect for the stages on the day with a great balance of handling, braking and pace when needed. They were surprised, perhaps unjustly, to find out they were sitting well up the leader board after the first few stages. They got the hammer down over the last three and were to finish fth overall and first in class three.They were beaten only by the Kirkaldy brothers, both in Escort MkII#s of the highest calibre, and two WRC cars driven by Brian Watson and Reay Mackay.Last but not least, Oban#s Angus MacNeil was out with Sam MacFadyen in Brian Watson#s Mitsubishi Evo  binging it home unscathed in th overall.The event was won by Alan Kirkaldy in a freshly built Escort MkII, followed by his circuit racer brother Andrew in secondand Reay Mackay taking the last podium place in his WRC Fiesta.

The Scottish Government must in the future not be so urban-centric in its allocation of resources.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and the Islands ward.Sir,I write following the release of the latest figures on alcohol use by the Office for National Statistics .The more you drink, the greater the long-term risk to your health and these ONS figures show a worrying increase in the number of alcohol-specic deaths in the UK, particularly amongst women and  to -year olds.From time to time, we are contacted by the families of people who have died as a result of alcohol and are only too aware of the heartbreak and utter sense of helplessness people feel when trying to lead someone to seek help for alcohol misuse.We must all do more to address the stigma that people feel in reaching out for support. For many of us, there are simple and effective ways for people to cut back on alcohol.Taking more drink-free days each week for example can reduce the overall amount of alcohol you drink and reduce the risk of developing serious illnesses. The Drinkaware website also provides information and resources for people concerned about their drinking or that of someone close to them and our DrinkChat online advisors can direct people, in complete confidence, to local treatment agencies.Elaine Hindal, Drinkaware chief executive."},{"url":null,"title":"mid argyll flower club hosts christmas special","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Subscribe NowMid Argyll Flower Club members welcomed Sandra Robertson from Dumfries to their annual open evening on Monday December .A packed house watched with interest as Sandra created amazing Christmas-themed displays.Lucky raffle winners left with beautul arrangements that, with care and attention, could see them through Christmas.Sandra, who won Best in Show  at Gardening Scotland with a James Bond inspired arrangement, was an excellent demonstrator and told many humorous stories of her #flower le# to an enthralled and appreciative audience."},{"url":null,"title":"the adventures of mr toad a ribbitting performance","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Subscribe NowBy Anne BeckittThe Mid Argyll Musical Society recently showcased their production of The Adventures of Mr Toad in Ardrishaig Hall to great acclaim.The praise was well-justied for the whole production was a shining example of what real teamwork can make from good material.The cast included primary and secondary students as well as adults, covering very ied levels of stage experience, yet they all worked together with a smoothness that appeared effortless but was, in fact, the result of much care and expert guidance.The chorus was as well rehearsed as the principal characters, and the evident enjoyment of every actor and singer meant the audience could relax totally and enjoy it all.Even lost lines, and the problems of dealing bravely with injuries were easily managed with good humour that won all hearts. That kind of team confidence comes from having the care and understanding of first class management.The staging was deceptively simple and the backstage staff produced a delightful cart and car for Mr Toad, plus his horse, and the costumes were not elaborate while most effective.All were well-rehearsed, and the singing was clearly the result of very careful expert teaching. It was a great pleasure to see how some of the young voices have been developing since their last appearance in #The Wizard of Oz#.We would have liked a couple of the characters to project spoken parts more audibly but overall the clarity of words should be complimented.The energy of Mr Toad himself carried all before him, just as it is written in the script and the original Wind in the Willows.No inidual names are here mentioned, quite deliberately, as the outstanding impression of this show was the seamless blending of the entire team involved, with each and every participant a star in their own right."},{"url":null,"title":"camanachd association agm reports income rise","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Subscribe NowThe Camanachd Association#s annual general meeting took place in the Muthu West End Hotel, Fort William, on Friday November .The  accounts showed a £, increase in turnover and a surplus of £,, increasing the association#s reserves to £, at December .Having fulfilled its obligations and met its related targets, the association did not suffer any reduction in its £, funding from Sportscotland, its largest single contributor.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as .

And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13713656.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_CP43067514.jpg","title":"ayr united players pose inbetweeners","story":"NewsAyr United players pose as Inbetweeners stars on hilarious Christmas party nightHigh flying Ayr United hit the town with some of their squad bearing a resemblance to the cast of the Inbetweeners.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  DEC Updated:,  DEC NewsAyr playersJames Hilton, Liam Smith, Daniel Harvie and Michael Rose\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailTheyre flying high in the Scottish Championship.

A positive inspection report from Education Scotland found consistently “good” performance across the board at Stration Primary School and Eary Years Centre. The inspectors came to their conclusions after a recent visit to the school that included discussions with parents, children and staff. The inspection team found the following strengths in the school’s work: • Headteacher Liz Candlish leads the strong staff team to achieve the best quality educational experiences in a learning environment which is nurturing and encouraging. • The motivated children who are engaged in their learning. Their exemplary behaviour is respectful and caring of adults and each other. • The strong links and involvement with members of the community. They feel valued by staff and enhance children’s outdoor experiences and enterprise activities. The following areas for improvement were identied: • The school should take steps to increase the pace and progression of children’s learning to raise attainment. • Assessment data collected from a range of sources should now be acted on more consistently to ensure maximum impact on the attainment of a few learners. • A structured approach to develop more independent learners, who can talk about their learning and be clear about their next steps. Councillor William Grant said: “I’m pleased to see such a positive report for Straiton, with staff delivering high quality learning for all children, something that should come as welcome news to families. “Headteacher, Liz Candlish, was singled out for providing strong leadership, with the school thriving and providing a nurturing environment that is inspiring children to embrace learning and to care for each other. “I would like to thank everyone involved for working hard to maintain the high standards at Straiton.” Inspectors are confident that the school has the capacity to continue to improve and so they will make no more visits in connection with this inspection.

In fact shersquos really quite unique in that shersquos furry, has four legs, a tail, and is the schoolrsquos very own puppy.So how did this adorable pooch make its way into the lives and hearts of the pupils and staff at Priorsford  Did the pupils ask for a puppy on their Christmas list this year I discovered that Peggy was actually on the wish list of teacher Caroline Sharpe, who approached headteacher Sandra Macgregor a year ago with the idea of a therapy dog for the school.Caroline explained: ldquoWe heard about therapy dogs and the benefits they bring to pupils, we wanted to tie it into our health and wellbeing in the school.ldquoI attended the SSPCA conference and there were people there from universities who had taken therapy dogs into final exams for students.ldquoEvidence shows that therapy dogs lower peoplersquos heart rate, gives a general sense of well-being and improves childrenrsquos socialisation skills. We visited a school in Midlothian who had a Cockapoo puppy and we knew we could make it work for us. She has changed the dynamic of the school.Peggy will live with Caroline, but will be in school full-time.Having settled into her new home at Priorsford Primary this week, Peggy is already the most popular pupil in school.Despite skipping five primary year-groups to join the P class, Peggy is at the very start of her journey to becoming a certied school dog.ldquoShe has settled in well and has already met the pupils at assemblies. My daughter is a vet and told me to expose her to everything straight away. The time between eight and  weeks is really important for stamping the personality and the secureness of the puppy, added Caroline.Peggy is learning how to become a listening dog, who will help children read aloud more confidently. She will put her head in their lap and listen without judgement, prompting them to turn a page with her paw.Caroline explained: ldquoNot only will she improve the pupilrsquos literacy skills, Peggy will be there for any children who are feeling anxious or worried, they can take some time out to talk to her.I joined the P class in the library as they read the tale of Greyfriars Bobby to Peggy. But she was worn out after a busy morning and childrenrsquos soothing reading put her to sleep!As I wander through the school with Peggy, pupils eyes widen at the sight of the furry bundle and instantly a smile lights up their faces. ldquoI love her Mrs Sharp, she is soooo cute, cooed one girl.When it came to naming the puppy, it was decided not to ask the children, who, Caroline said, would have come up with wonderfully unique suggestions.Before leaving the school, I am given Peggy to cuddle, and for a split second I consider slipping her into my handbag and making a run for it. But a vision of an angry mob in blue chasing me through the playground fills me with fear and I decide she is exactly where she should be.It is said that dog is a manrsquos best friend. But at this Peebles school, dog is the best friend of over  pupils who have become the proud owners of this gorgeous puppy Peggy, who has brought joy, happiness and love to her new home at Priorsford Primary."},{"url":null,"title":"opinion","story":"This week Bosco Santimano, founder and executive director of social enterprise You Can Cook, shares his thoughts on organic farming.Most of us are already conditioned into believing the so called lsquomagicrsquo of science. That science has or will find solutions to all our manmade problems. The issue with this approach has always been that, experiments carried out in controlled environments like laboratories and then replicated in nature have always been unexpected and sometimes catastrophic.These scientic methods involved limited assessments and tests and mainly conducted for profit by big pharma!Having covered Making Scotland GMOFree in my previous column I will focus on our next vision, which is to make Scotland a  per cent organic country.The green revolution introduced in the s, sprayed fertilisers and pesticides on farm land all over the planet to increase crop yields. This in turn led to many forests being cut down to grow what was then called lsquocash cropsrsquo and small-scale farming was replaced by industrial farming on a massive scale supported by government subsidies.Big corporations acquired land across the globe, food was added as a commodity to be traded for profits on the stock market and this in turn has led to inequalities in health and access to food especially in developing and third world countries.The unforeseen impact of chemicals for growing over the last few decades, has led to the fall of nutrients in the soil, as this was being depleted by over use and irregular crop rotation. Profits were maximised and are even today. For example, soya beans are now grown in many countries as cattle feed for the West! This then leaves no arable land for the local population to grow food leading to widespread hunger and impoverished conditions.We need to go back to our roots and grow food at local levels on a small scale and bring back farming as a lucrative job for people to invest their time and energies. This will be a sustainable long-term approach and remove the need for farming subsidies that are the biggest scandal of our times as most go to big landowners in this country. Can you imagine governments are currently paying farmers in some cases not to grow Organic farming will not only bring back the health of the soil but also stop corporations making money through selling chemicals and hybrid seeds. This will have a positive impact on the lives of all people as lsquoorganic produce will no longer be the domain of the rich and middle class who can afford to feed themselves and their children with good food. This choice should be available to all.So! Whatrsquos happening globally where organic farming is concerned  Denmark is on its way to becoming the worldrsquos first  per cent organic country, followed by Bhutan and Estonia. India has the North-eastern state of Sikkim designated as the first fully organic state anywhere in the world and was awarded the UN lsquoOscar for the Best Policy that is inclusive and comprehensive of all socioeconomic aspects.Can Scotland be  per cent organic  Yes! It can."},{"url":null,"title":"borders-factory-announces-50-redundancies","story":"ONE of the regions major manufacturers has announced that it is looking to pay off more than  members of staff.Jedburgh-based Mainetti UK is looking for voluntary redundancies following a second year of reported losses.Bosses at the Oxnam Road coat-hanger manufacturer are blaming recycling and a reduction in high street retailers as well as an increase in the minimum wage for combined losses over the past  months of more than pound million.Mainettis Regional MD Jim Hutchison stated: \"The last two years have been dficult for the business.\"In  Mainetti UK Limited made a loss of pound, and this year we are forecast to lose a further pound,.\"The business is faced with an ever increasing cost base with increases in the National Minimum Wage, higher electricity costs and higher business rates.\"To add to these cost pressures the business is seeing local UK demand for hangers reducing.\"Many retailers are closing down shops or reducing their selling space and this means there are less hangers required.\"In addition, an increased emphasis on recycling means more hangers are being ed from stores for resorting, which further reduces manufacturing demand.\"Mainetti UK currently employs around  staff.Talks have already started with unions over the planned  redundancies.Mr Hutchison added: \"These changes will only impact the Jedburgh hanger manufacturing unit.\"All other products made in Jedburgh ndash flower buckets, polythene bags, Glastic and The Seatcase will not be impacted and in fact the company will continue to invest in all these areas during , in order to grow those parts of our Jedburgh manufacturing business.\"Local MP John Lamont has been in talks with the company over the past few days.He told us: ldquoThis is disappointing news from a long standing employer in Jedburgh.ldquoClearly their market is changing and Mainetti are having to adapt to that.

their Burnham on Sea microwave joke was worth the admission fee alone.These four crazy characters swayed towards slapstick, flirted with farce and brought down the house with a bombardment of belly-laughs.Despite all the fun and frivolity, though, Sleeping Beauty was still a sensational piece of stage theatre.Julia Noble and Steve Hartley-Oliver were authoritative and appealing as Queen Marigold and King Cactus.And the regular arrival of sinister Witch Hazel, played by both Tracey Borthwick and Julie Smith, in a cloud of customary green smoke made sure the young audience were kept on their toes.The couplet duels between the villainous Witch and Fairy Lilac, played exquisitely by Amanda Blacklock, were both clever and entertaining.Couplets aside, music was at the heart of Sleeping Beauty, from the opening Lazy Hazy Crazy Days of Summer all the way through the seasonal finale, and many of the most memorable numbers came from Fairy Lilac and her supporting coloured fairies of Shannon Mack, Ruby Everett, Caitlin Green and Katie Wilson.From You Can Do Magic and Dream a Little Dream of Me to the luscious Hushabye Mountain, Amanda and her young apprentices were wonderful.A beautul rendition of Born with a Smile on My Face was the highlight of Aimee Richardsons all-to-short appearance as Young Rose.And the childrens fun-filled version of Wake Up You Sleepy Head was also among the many highlights of a fantastic night of musical theatre.The songs came thick and fast - as did the jokes.Hawick, Melrose and Tweedbank were ridiculed regularly, as were Theresa May, the Ladhope Vale one-way system and the residents of Abbotsford Court.The laughs were loud and the cheers, especially when Braw Lad and Braw Lass Greg Kelly and Kimberley OMay turned up for Roses Christening, were even louder.The choreography was both imaginative and eye-catching with dancers Emma Wilson, Jess Thomson, Rachel Falconer and Sara Facchini having obviously put in the rehearsal hours.The score was foot-tappingly good, the scene changes were swt and the stage was picture perfect.But ultimately its the actors, dancers and singers who take a production to new heights.And when the cast is enjoying themselves as much as the audience, the people behind the Right Angle Theatre Company can go to sleep this Christmas with a smile on their faces.CASTFairy Lilac: Amanda BlacklockWitch Hazel: Julie Smith Tracey BorthwickMuddles: Billy RooneyKing Cactus: Steve Hartley-OliverQueen Marigold: Julia NobleNurse Hettie Harpic: Jodie MillarFetch: Antony WilsonCarrie: Katie GordonFairy Red: Shannon MackFairy Yellow: Ruby EverettFairy Green: Caitlin GreenFairy Blue: Katie WilsonYoung Rose: Aimee RichardsonPrince Alexis: Stuart MitchellRose: Amy ThomsonDancers: Sara Facchini, Rachel falconer, Jess Thomson and Emma Wilson.Chorus: Ruaridh Anderson, Charli Black, Tracy Borthwick, Callum Crooks, Erin Gallagher, Nicole Hughes, Mya Lamb, Molly McFarlane, Lee-Anne Robinson, Millie Robinson, Ally Turnbull, Eilidh Walker.Children : Abigail Burns, Ellie Cockburn, Grace Decoteau, Rhianna Devlin, Faith Heriot, Fraser Scott Hermiston, Chloe Noble, Ceijay Robinson, Rebecca Scott, Max Turnbull and Ellie Welsh.: Simona Andom, Sophia Blaen, Georgie Everett, Skye Machara Henderson, Sky Hume, Chloe Johnston, Emily Johnstone, Lucy Johnstone, Ellie mcLaren, Molly McLaren, Carrie Smith and Isla Train.PRODUCTIONStage Crew: Billy Easson, Steven Headspeath, Craig Monks, Adam Nichol and Malcolm Wilson.Prompter: Sheila WilsonMake Up  Hair: Team from Millars Hair SalonMake Up Co-ordinator: Yvonne KeddieProps: Gordon Keddie and Sarah PhilipsChildrens Co-ordinator: Amanda BlacklockChildrens Organizer: Michelle DevlinPhotographs: Jade PringleGroup Bookings: Morag KeddieRaffle: Susan FalconerScenery: Border StudiosFront of House: Lana ThomsonKeyboards: Chris AchenbachPercussion: Graham Borthwick"},{"url":null,"title":"new-housing-estate-for-lauder-given-go-ahead","story":"SCOTTISH Borders Council has given the go-ahead to a brand new housing estate in Lauder.Members of the councilrsquos planning and building standards body voted unanimously to approve an application from Persimmon Homes to build  new homes just north of Thirlestane Drive.Seven people have objected to the development, with a further four expressing concerns, including Kimberly Shaw-Walker, of Thirlestane Drive.She wrote: ldquoThe site is not suitable for the volume of houses proposed.

within which we create synergies, economies and share skill sets.#It is a model that is worthy of replicating where and one which closely aligns with general development in community sport across Scotland.#We firmly believe the new Kintyre Seasports facility will create a hub within the community of Campbeltown where all members of the community can learn, practice, train and enjoy an active engagement in the sea.#Such opportunities are known to provide a tangible connection to improvements in health, social cohesion through volunteering and introduce many, particularly young people, to their first structured employment as instructors within their chosen water sport.#We are clear that developing grass roots opportunities within sailing and powerboating as well as other sports, provides young people with positive habits and skills that last a letime and iniably enhance employability.#We find the club environment is also an excellent place for the development of interpersonal skills, intergenerational relationships and to experience positive role models from many walks of le.#Families enjoy a place which is safe for children and supports the active participation of parents in sport, sustaining lelong participation and encouraging family cohesion through sharing of activity.#The uniqueness of sailing is that there are no barriers to participation.#Those aged from eight-years-old to , with disability or able bodied, LGBT or otherwise can share the same activity, learn and compete on an equal basis with minimal adjustments and are bonded by their love of boating.#There is every reason to expect that the Kintyre Seasports Project will be a shining example of inclusion.#The full potential of the project lies in the wider connections across the communities of interest the facility will serve.#Campbeltown sits on one of the most ied and interesting stretches of water in Scotland having benefits of both the shelter for Campbeltown Loch and immediate access to wider open sea in the Kilbrannan Sound and the Irish Sea.#In addition to becoming a hub of community activity, it is entirely conceivable that future events in dinghy racing, sea

However, when the fall of communism led to the break-up of Yugoslavia, war came to Bosnia in , driven in part by Serbiarsquos desire to create a lsquoGreater Serbiarsquo, including large parts of Bosnia, from which they planned to remove Croats and Muslims in what became known as lsquoethnic cleansingrsquo.Our delegation leader Resad Trbonja was , living in Sarajevo. On April , , he woke to find his city under siege, surrounded by Serbian artillery and snipers on the mountains overlooking the city. The siege would last four years, the longest in modern warfare, longer than Stalingrad. An average of  mortars landed in the city every day, , on the worst day.Resad, who lived through, and fought in, the siege, explained that Sarajevo regressed two centuries overnight ndash no water, no electricity, no phones. The Serbian army allowed minimal UN aid into the city sporadically but nothing .The survival of the siege is a story of human courage, spirit and defiance.Our first visit was to the remnants of a tunnel, dug under Sarajevo airport to reach Bosnian-held territory on the other side. This tiny tunnel was the only way in or out for four years.Through this tunnel extra aid came, for example from Edinburgh Direct Aid, who drove lorries of supplies from Edinburgh to help Sarajevans. My own predecessor, John Home Robertson, then MPfor East Lothian, spent several Parliamentary recesses as a volunteer lorry driver. It was dangerous work and one of his colleagues died on the notorious road known as lsquoSnipers Alleyrsquo.Perhaps the most affecting visit in Sarajevo was to the War Childhood Museum, where those who grew up in the siege display the things they kept to remind them of what it was like, and tell their story.A homemade cardboard knightrsquos breastplate made by a brother who later died a cuddly toy from a UN delivery, cuddled threadbare because it was the only toy a homemade lsquounormrsquo for a childrenrsquos choir which rehearsed and performed in defiance of bombs and bullets the remains of a playpark lsquojungle gymrsquo kept to remember the day a mortar tore it apart and killed your friend ndash no one who visits this museum will forget it.That is true too of Srebrenica. This was supposedly a lsquosafe havenrsquo protected by UN troops. Yet on July , Serbian paramilitary units overran it. Thousands of Bosnian Muslims sought refuge in the UN base at a disused factory.When we visited the museum now sited there, survivor Hasan Hasanovic explained to us how UN soldiers stood by as women and children were herded onto buses and deported, while their men were separated and removed in lorries. They were systematically murdered nearby. Thousands more who tried to escape through the forest were hunted down, shepherded into a meadow, and shot. In all, , Bosnian Muslim men and boys were slaughtered at Srebrenica.Finally, the international community acted. In a matter of days, air strikes lted the siege of Sarajevo, drove Serbian paramilitaries out of much of the territory they had occupied, and forced agreement to a peace deal signed in Dayton, Ohio.Srebrenica was not the only genocide in this war, but it is emblematic because it happened under the noses of the UN and because of the bravery of the Mothers of Srebrenica, who ed home to find out what happened to their husbands and sons, refused to be silenced, and demanded justice.This led to the International Commission on Missing Persons and the forensic anthropology unit in Tuzla, where we saw the incredible work done to identy remains using DNA. More than , victims of genocide have now been identied, allowing their families to grieve and to bury them at the final stop of our visit.We arrive at the cemetery at Potaceri, outside Srebrenica, as the sun sets. On the hillside, , stark white tombstones bring home the enormity of what was done over only a few days a mere  years or so ago.More than , died at Srebrenica , perished in Sarajevo , women suffered rape as an act of war millions fled their homes, some even finding their way to the refugee reception centre at Cheylesmore Lodge in North Berwick.All the survivors I met asked the same question: why did so much suffering have to happen before the international community acted to stop it  In telling us their story, they relived their own pain. They did so in the hope that we learn the lessons of Bosnia. We need only look at Syria or Yemen to know that we have not.That is why we must remember Srebrenica.If any local groups would like to hear more about the work of Remembering Srebrenica, please contact my office on  ."},{"url":null,"title":"the-best-fortnite-gifts-for-christmas-2018","story":"Fortnite is the most popular video game of the year and has taken over not just everyonersquos console, but Christmas lists up and down the country too.If you have family members, big or small, who are mad for Fortnite but find yourself utterly clueless as to what itrsquos all about or what to get someone who loves it for Christmas, we can help out with this guide to everything Fortnite from the game itself to presents you should buy this year.*On some occasions, we earn revenue from content.

Itrsquos time for Mrs May to resign. Letrsquos not vex ourselves with trles like an election. Mr Rees-Mogg had decided that the entire country now needed a new leader because, well ... this just wonrsquot do.Elsewhere at Westminster another Tory with multiple names and a baronial pile had a warning for his party and the country. Before Mrs Mayrsquos confidence vote Michael Heseltine had talked portentously of the prospect of no-deal and a Prime Minister now lacking all authority to govern. But there was no hint of arrogance in his words and none of the thwarted assumption that suffused the words of his fellow aristocrat. A few days earlier Lord Heseltine had called for a second referendum on Brexit and offered a similar warning to the Conservatives: Britainrsquos youth ldquowould never forgive usthey were denied the chance to reverse Brexit. He added: ldquoThose of a certain age who voted : to leave are rapidly being replaced by a younger generation who voted : to stay.Mr Rees-Mogg gives the impression that he has arrived at this juncture in his le never having understood the concept of youth or encountered any of the strange people who belong to this sect. Was there not a slightly jaded fascination to be had from observing the dferent approaches of these two men, who between them would seem to embody the values, fears and aspirations of the Tories and those who entrust their land and money to them  Jacob Rees-Mogg and Michael Heseltine had been kissed by privilege at birth their adult lives anointed by wealth and property. They had sprung from families who expected to rule or to maintain the influence of those who actually did. Each of them, having become a Conservative MP, had rebelled against their leaders.Lord Heseltinersquos revolt occurred in  when, as Defence Secretary, he faced down Margaret Thatcher in a cabinet dispute about the future of Westland helicopters, the UKrsquos last remaining manufacturer of helicopters. Mrs Thatcher favoured a merger with the US company, Sikorsky, while Mr Heseltine sought a deal with a European consortium that included British, Italian and French firms. He resigned because he felt that his boss had treated her cabinet with contempt over the deal and that it had raised questions over the integrity of senior politicians. His protest came from a seat of considerable influence within the UK Government and was driven by principle.Until three years ago Mr Rees-Mogg was little more than a curiosity within his own party who might once have featured in childrenrsquos tours of the House of Commons. His rebellion is at the head of a group of hard-right \"extremists\" in the words of Philip Hammond, the Chancellor. It was not sparked by any sense of ethics or integrity but by opportunism. It seeks to exploit an unstable moment in British history to bring about the top-down, class-driven society of their childhood storybooks and one free from any interference on frustrating issues like human rights or moral obligations to people fleeing death and torture.A chasm seems to be apparent in how each man views the world and the responsibilities that come with wealth and privilege. Never being slow to proclaim his Christian faith Mr Rees-Mogg may be familiar with Luke :. \"From everyone who has been given much, much will be demanded and from the one who has been entrusted with much, much more will be asked. Yet while Mr Rees-Mogg may have read this passage it would seem that Lord Heseltine might actually have understood them. It would be easy for those of a younger generation to be suspicious when an ageing Tory speaks with a degree of compassion. Isnrsquot this what all elderly and affluent men do as they begin to reflect on their mortality and the legendary dficulties encountered by people like these in attempting to access the Kingdom of Heaven Some may deride the concept of a high Tory with a sense of social justice and moral obligation but insofar as this can be imagined Lord Heseltine could be considered one example of such. It may seem dficult to comprehend now but once upon a time the concept of One Nation Toryism enjoyed considerable status within the Toriesrsquo philosophy. This was epitomised by Lord Heseltine when he became an authentic and hard-working advocate for the city of Liverpool as it began to be consumed by an economic apocalypse. He helped drive a visionary and sustainable regeneration in Liverpool and was awarded the honour of Freeman of the City for his endeavours. This was at a time when Mrs Thatcher was preaching her gospel of ldquosurvival of the richest and seeking to dismantle society and Englandrsquos northern working-class communities.Her latterday acolytes are maintaining those wretched values by attempting to create their ldquohostile environment for the Windrush generation and any communities they consider to be somehow less than authentically British. They can be observed in the imposition of universal credit and the nasty and vindictive little stunt pulled by the Department of Work and Pensions this week in depriving Universal Credit claimants their annual one-off pound bonus. If Jacob Rees-Mogg and his band of hard-right Thatcherites get their way another hostile environment for those they consider to be not quite British enough will emerge from their quest to thwart anything but the hardest of hard Brexits.Theresa May will probably fall and she will be replaced by someone like Boris Johnson or Dominic Raab or Michael Gove or Sajid Javid, a man whose incoherent ramblings on the floor of the Commons this week made you tremble that he could ever be thought of as Prime Minister. Once, this list would have included men like William Whitelaw, Sir Geoffrey Howe and later, perhaps Kenneth Clarke. Lord Heseltine would have been there, too, and he must have wept as Mr Javid mumbled and muttered last week while the rest of us

sexual misconduct from two women, which he strongly denies.His legal team insist the process was unfair, and argue the civil servant appointed to investigate the complaints was biased because she had prior knowledge of them.Judge Lord Pentland ruled a batch of emails and notes will now be handed to an external commissioner, Morag Ross QC, to decide whether their contents are relevant.They were previously substantially redacted by the Scottish Government, which argued the documents arecovered by a confidentiality agreement.Lord Pentland said: ldquoEssentially, Irsquom satisfied that it is in the interest of justice for this to be done.ldquoI have given careful consideration to the fact that the respondent gave qualied assurance of confidentiality to Ms A and Ms B.ldquoThe law is clear and

to the case.Further disclosures mdash including hand-written notes and text messages between one of the complainers and a civil servant mdash were released to Mr Salmondrsquos team at .pm on Thursday.Mr Clancy said the documents showed Scottish Government official Judith Mackinnon was appointed to investigate the complaints despite having prior knowledge of them.He said Ms Mackinnon had previously spoken to one of the complainers and met the other, and was identied as the ldquopoint of contact for one of the women.She was also sent an internal email about one of the complaints.This is despite HR rules stipulating the investigating officer should have no prior involvement in the matter, Mr Clancy said.He insisted the ldquofull extent of Ms Mackinnonrsquos prior knowledge needed to be made clear, adding: ldquoWe need to see the material for ourselves.The court heard one of the formal complaints against Mr Salmond was four pages long, but every paragraph except the first was

However, it is possible that people will not notice much change at that point, as the UK has negotiated a -month transition period ending on December   during which it will continue to operate largely under EU rules, but without representation in Brussels institutions. That period could itself be extended to December  . And after that there could be a ldquobackstop period of unlimited duration, during which the UK would remain in a customs union.ndash Why is March  Brexit day Under the Article  process, the EU treaties cease to have effect in a member state exactly two years after the country informs the European Council of its intention to leave. Britainrsquos EU ambassador Sir Tim Barrow handed over a letter from Theresa May to council president Donald Tusk on March  , setting the process in train. The UK actually leaves at midnight Brussels time, which is pm in Britain.ndash Can it be delayed Yes. The European Court of Justice ruled that the UK can revoke its Article  letter unilaterally and continue as a full EU member without seeking approval from Brussels. It is also possible to extend the Article  process, but this requires unanimous agreement from both the UK and the other  member states.ndash Is there an agreement on what happens after Brexit There is a Withdrawal Agreement agreed by the UK Government and European Commission and approved by leaders of the  remaining states in November. This covers issues such as the pound billion settlement of UK liabilities to EU budgets and the treatment of expat citizens, as well as arrangements to keep the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic open. Alongside this is a Political Declaration, setting out plans to forge a close future relationship in areas such as trade and security, with negotiations due to start once Brexit day has passed. However, the deal must be ratied by the House of Commons and the European Parliament before coming into effect.ndash Will Theresa May be able to get the deal through the House of Commons ndash What is the backstop anyway The backstop is effectively an insurance arrangement required by the EU. Once the UK is outside the EU customs area, it can strike its own trade deals with countries such as the US, China or Australia. Brussels is concerned that this could mean imports of goods produced under less rigorous standards in areas such as animal welfare, workplace rights and environmental protection. It insists that such goods ndash like genetically modied crops or chlorine-washed chicken from the US ndash must not be allowed freely to cross what will become the UKrsquos only land border with the EU, between Northern Ireland and the Republic. Neither side wants to erect checkpoints, for fear of reviving tensions from the era of the Troubles and disrupting daily le on both sides of the border. So until a broader trade agreement is sealed, the EU insists that Northern Ireland must remain within the European customs area. On her part, Mrs May insists that the backstop arrangement must cover the whole UK, to avoid creating a customs border in the Irish Sea. Brexit-backing MPs are furious because once the UK is in the backstop it can only leave with agreement from Brussels. They fear it will become a permanent arrangement, preventing Britain from striking lucrative new trade deals.ndash Whatthe PM canrsquot get her deal through Parliament If MPs reject Mrs Mayrsquos deal, she has  days to make a statement to Parliament setting out the next steps the Government will take. MPs will be able to amend her motion to require ministers to take a dferent approach, such as delaying Brexit, calling a second referendum to confirm the  decision to leave or negotiating a ldquosofter withdrawal involving Norway-style membership of the European Free Trade Area. However, the Government retains control over the legislation it puts before Parliament, meaning there are limits to the extent to which MPs can direct ministers on the course to take.ndash Whatwe get to March  with no deal ratied and no delay to the Brexit process The UK would leave the EU without a deal. Provisions in the Withdrawal Agreement on citizensrsquo rights and payments to the EU budget would not take effect and there would be no transition period. Businesses and public authorities would have to switch immediately to trade under World Trade Organisation rules, which require tarfs on a range of goods. The Government is making preparations to ensure that international agreements in areas such as aviation, food safety and data sharing continue to operate. Many experts believe there would be signicant disruption at ports and airports, shortages of food and medicines and queues on motorways, but Brexiteers dismiss these warnings as overblown. Mrs May has promised to protect the rights of EU citizens in the UK, but there has been no such commitment from the EU.ndash And could there be a second referendum The letter from the Westminster leaders of the SNP, Liberal Democrats, Plaid Cymru  the Green Party urging Jeremy Corbyn to join them in tabling a motion of no confidence in the PM ndash helping to pave the way for a #PeoplesVote.

union.ldquoI think it is possible to get this deal through with those guarantees that we need on the backstop.ldquoThe reason I think, in the end, the EU will want to help us as far as they possibly can is because it is not in their interest to provoke a further political crisis in the UK.ldquoBecause, although some people in the EU may say that Parliament would stop a no-deal scenario, they canrsquot be sure of that.Ms Rudd, who recently ed to the Cabinet as Work and Pensions Secretary, said it is possible Mrs May will ultimately be unable to persuade enough of her own MPs to back the

approach was needed for MPs to coalesce around a deal to avert the danger of Britain crashing out of the EU.Responding to the remarks, Mr Hunt said: ldquoAmber is absolutely right that we need all MPs to think about the national interest.ldquoBut, I think we also have to be cautious about the idea that we are going to get large amounts of support from the Labour Party.A combative EU summit left Mrs May insisting she was still on track to win assurances on the controversial Irish backstop proposals.Putting a positive gloss on the bruising EU summit, the Prime Minister said further talks would take place in the coming days on measures she hopes will persuade MPs to back the Brexit agreement in Parliament.EU leaders acknowledged the need to ldquobring down the temperature after appearing to rebuff her calls for assurances on the Northern Ireland backstop.EU tensions erupted into public view when a visibly angry Mrs May was seen berating European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker over remarks he had made during the press conference in the early hours of Friday.The Prime Minister was apparently infuriated after he described the British negotiating position as ldquonebulous and imprecise, and called on the Government to spell out exactly what it wanted from the talks.Meanwhile, Nigel Farage said he believes the UK may face a second referendum in the coming months and urged Brexit campaigners to ldquoget ready for every situation.Speaking at the Leave Means Leave rally on Friday, the former Ukip leader said: ldquoMy message, folks, tonight is, as much as I donrsquot want a second referendum, it would be wrong of us on a Leave Means Leave  not to get ready, not to be prepared for a worst-case

It isn’t intended to be a ‘straight’ narrative as you usually see, but as in a fairy tale there are strange detours, unexplained events, outcomes out of all proportion to what caused them – a kind of rough and dangerous magic working beneath the surface.Aside from that, each page of the book was crafted to be as inidually beautul as I could make it. Every page took at least a few days to create, and some pages took weeks, even months.Where did the inspiration for this book come from There are so many ideas that have fed into The Boy with Nails for Eyes that it’s very hard to pin it down to a single moment of inspiration. When I was at school, I was struck by a painting done by a previous student. It was a very unnerving picture — a spectral, jagged figure with crude smears of black where the eyes should be.Many years later I saw the music video for the Tool song Sober. There was a brief glimpse of a mechanical figure with a metal mask for a face, with one eye missing and the other pierced by this huge swivelling nail. I thought of Norse mythology — Odin, sacricing one of his eyes in the well of Mimir to gain wisdom. That second image married with the memory of the painting from school that same evening, I painted the first picture of The Boy with Nails for Eyes. A few weeks later, the story began to slowly take shape.It’s changed beyond recognition over the years, taking on influences such as the War on Terror of the early s. I was born in Bahrain and was there during the Gulf War. We were all issued with gas masks by the American military, and I remember waking up one night to find the rest of my family in my room, my mum holding the masks, my dad stuffing a towel under the door. It turned out Iraq had launched a Scud — we were all terried of the thought of chemical weapons. I recognised that same feeling of paranoia in the days after September the th, and Bush’s declaration of the War on Terror. That feeling pervades the story.How did the crowdfunding for this book come about I had been shopping the comic around to agents and publishers for a long time. I found it to be a frustrating process. I tended to receive positive responses, which were still rejections. I was running out of options, and was wondering where I’d go nextI wasn’t able to place it with anyone. I received a boost when the book was long-listed for the Myriad First Graphic Novel competition earlier this year.I was speaking to an editor at Unbound, the publisher, about an entirely dferent project — an illustrated poem. Almost as an aside I mentioned that I had this other graphic novel whose first volume was finished and ready to go. I showed her the first couple of chapters and she fell in love with it . We decided to temporarily shelve the other project and proceed with this.What would it mean to you to see this book published It would be fantastic. I’ve been working on the project over  years, since my early twenties. It’s been a labour of love — for myself and my we Anna as well, who had major input into the work. I honestly had no thought of publishing it properly, it was just important to me to allow it to be exactly the story it needed to be. I basically taught myself digital art by working on it, and honed my drawing and writing skills through it. It sounds strange, but I’m as much its product as it is mine.

The first £ payment will be made around the time a child starts nursery, to help with the costs of early learning and a further £ when they start school.Social security secretary, Shirley-Anne Somerville said: “I am delighted we will be delivering the Best Start Grant Pregnancy and Baby Payment earlier than originally planned, providing low income families with increased financial support. I am particularly pleased, that by not capping children, babies born in the last six months who already have a big brother or sister, and had no support from the UK Government because they were not the first child, will be eligible to get their payment.“With the Early Learning and School Age Payments, this means that for a two child family, the Best Start Grant will provide £, # £, more than they would get under the UK legacy benefit. That’s a substantial investment to ensure our under s get the best possible start in le and reflects this government’s emphasis on the early years.“Our focus on supporting people on low incomes, and the action we are taking stands in stark contrast to the UK Government, who last week was criticised by the UN Poverty Rapporteur for being in denial about the damage and misery that their welfare cuts were causing.”Connie is  and lives in Glasgow her baby is five months old.“I heard about the Pregnancy and Baby Payment through One Parent Families Scotland, who told me all about the grant and how to apply for it,” she said.“The payment will go toward clothes, nappies and shoes for my son, babies grow so quickly and he’s five months now.“This will make a real dference to me, it’s not a payment I was expecting. It will make le a bit easier, my income stays the same, but my outgoings are higher as this is my third child. My other children are four and five so the things I had for them I don’t have anymore, so I’m kinda starting again.“I got the baby box which is great, but you get size - month clothes in that, so the £ would be of benefit when he’s a wee bit bigger.” vw, px\"  copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The city’s renowned Festival and Fringe, Hogmanay celebration and other events have also proved to be a powerful attraction.Edinburgh now attracts nearly four million visitors a year and, collectively, they spend an impressive £. billion, supporting the jobs of some , people.However, it is possible to have too much of a good thing and many in the city have come to the conclusion that tourism has now reached that point to the dismay of Gordon Robertson, the chair of Marketing Edinburgh. He told how “everybody hates a tourist” seemed to have become the city’s strapline as people increasingly subscribe to the “tourism bad narrative”.And Robertson is right to raise the alarm over this trend. Scotland’s economy needs all the help it can get and catering for tourists is now an important part of this country’s financial well-being. The only way Scotland is going to tackle poverty, spend more on the NHS and create the kind of country that everyone wants to see is to grow the economy.: Stephen Jardine: Hoaching Edinburgh needs a tourist taxThat said, Robertson perhaps might agree that, in hindsight, his remark that he was “not so sure Disneyfication is a bad thing”, after his family went on a trip to the cartoon-inspired resort, might be a bit of a gt to his opponents.He may have meant Disney’s “well-trained staff” and “fantastic experience”, he may have said “none of us wants to live in a theme park”, but critics who already complain about the Disneyfication of Edinburgh will simply see this as further evidence of their claims.One reason tourists love Edinburgh is its stunning urban landscape: the castle on a hill, Arthur’s Seat, the tangible, living history of the Old and New Towns. There is a place for See-you-Jimmy hat shops, but too many would detract from that.So Edinburgh needs to strike a balance between pleasing tourists and remaining a city where people live and work.

The building will provide not only better facilities and space but will also give staff the help in coordination and equipment to do there job under one roof with less strain and expense to all.I also claim nothing but most people that have lived in Shetland for the last  years will be aware of the problems associated with the Eric Gray building, whether directly involved or not although the thinking and planning of a new building goes farther back than that.Some parents and staff have had a look through the new building at dferent stages of build, and everyone to my knowledge was impressed. I like many other parents and carers look forward to the day its complete and our daughters and sons can enjoy the help and encouragement from staff to live their lives to the best of their ability..."},{"url":null,"title":"watch viking bus station to get new graffiti mural ","story":"Marc Delaye, now based in Inverness, will oversee the graffiti project in August. It is part of the Year of Young People activities.The youngsters involved will come up with ideas but they are also keen to hear what other young people would like to see on the mural.Year of Young People ambassador Jonathan Dorrat said: “We’d really like children and young people aged eight to  years to come forward with designs or concepts for the new mural. Some of the themes could be, #What do you enjoy about Shetland #, #What makes you proud of Shetland #, #What is Shetland famous for #.# Send any ideas, before Friday th July , to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.The SIC#s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.#This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station. It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People .”Are they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be doneI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish##.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc###and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of le or some other pointless title.Over the years art has very much lowered its standards signicantly to make and justy it becoming more commercially viable####.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called # limited edition rubbish #.I would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at###atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.No doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and le experience###..despite the fact everybody  looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.Love the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me .. Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!Why not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like    It#s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.There are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined. Next you#ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!I think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.If you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, #The Arts#, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved    SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, #Status Quo#, thanks, Malcomn Younger and #Scottish National Ballet, #Highland Fling #, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £ million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.Would not even need a bar!!!The Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass. Building methods change along with building materials.I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.Come on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.The Shard is a massive glass pyramid#.I#m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug##.Mareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.If I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used # There#s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.All the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.Call me old fashioned but I would love to see the modernbuilding business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of  to  tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles,all done  years ago.It#s true you really can#t get the staff nowadays. I wonderthe Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops # the British ways of one can#t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is aboutto finish offanother burgeoning industry.I’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up! As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in theirbucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.Aluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.I’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of theterm ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much inidentying the material nature of that being used but more an attemptto denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure Rather like calling a van a box on wheels  I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaningcomments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.@ Haydn Gear.When there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.Pretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.Unless you already know Mareel#s purpose and that its supposedly an #iconic# design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that#s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname #The Pagoda# as soon as it was built.Let us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for #Mareel# to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst#s #Pickled cow and calf.#, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel#s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.I have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel. What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kickout of venting there spleens in those directions.I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.Leaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man Those of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.Purely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda wasin any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it I wondertakeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architecturalsimilarities.The viking was a chippy when it opened.#What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.# Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, # is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments  #, #I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever# and # Pig ignorant prats.# Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!Well Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there  All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.Love hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of someby those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and tomaintaincredibility from the watchful public at large. In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.Look what happened!So let today’s critics mock onit makes them feel better.Paraphrasing MGM#s famous motto, the phrase #Arse gratia artis#, springs to mind. LOL 🙂As an artist myselfdoing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.I have been to many art exhibitions andart shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as # ripping off the customer # with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody  can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.It takes me about  hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.I have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit. Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spenceis an all too common feature in mostwalks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns isnot too far removed from theactions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!So talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.Nobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as #pig ignorant#. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such #arty things#.We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £ million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained consecrated.No doubt it was deliberate and theopportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !Had you checked out Ian#s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I#d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous #Sam the Eagles# among us. That said, it#s a concept I wouldn#t wish to see spread any farther!🙂No insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to #The Black Mountains#. Iwill try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found inMareel#s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing , nasty little creatures!!! .Fairenough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artistswhen it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of le.

LoLThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.Based on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say # there is a strong likeness to themselves # and they are very pleased with the outcome.Alternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.I could always get away with this by saying # It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art # and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lolWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself andyou look at my products you would find this to be true. My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generatesympathetic responses.It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear..."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.It is rare enough for a local game to end -, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.Astonishingly, Delting’s - triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.The final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.Delting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.Devonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.This is the th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back  years for Southend’s solitary success.Apologies to older readersI’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in , but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.The quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw - with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay - away from home.The semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another - draw and another replay was necessary.After Delting won that one - at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.Delting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.Although it was tough ask to play two games in about  hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.So on Saturday th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.Goals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a - lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.Player manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.It was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.But it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.: : : : : : : :In professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.The benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the  clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.During the - campaign the clubs benefited from over £. billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £ million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £ million.Just where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.While players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.On the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Cha, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.In Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.Following Rangers’ - draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.It could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.That was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.Perhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes findsdficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.Rogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.There are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.: : : : : : : :One of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.Although the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and  runs.Much has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.Unfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.I’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.Maybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.The only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.Some apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.In answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 25 ","story":"Those responsible finally saw sense this week, reversing the ridiculous decision to play both Scottish League Cup semi-finals at Hampden Park on the same day.Celtic, one of the four sides involved, had indicated that a draw should be made to determine which game was moved to Murrayfieldthe original plans were scrapped.But the holders’ game against Hearts will now take place in Edinburgh at .pm on Sunday th October. The Rangers v Aberdeen tie will be played at Hampden at .pm the same day.Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers described the process as “irrational and discriminatory”, saying he had never been to Murrayfield in his le.This is the same man who could not offer any comment when quizzed at the weekendit was unfair to ask Aberdeen fans to travel to Glasgow for a noon kick-off.The handling of this by the authorities has been a shambles, and it was a bit rich to hear Scottish Professional Football Leaguechief executive Neil Doncaster say that the U-turn was because the situation had changed.Initially Hampden Park Ltd had insisted on sticking to its contract to host all semi-finals involving Celtic and Rangers, Doncaster said. The SPFL was unwilling to breach that contract and risk legal action and apparently Police Scotland were okay with the original decision. Incredibly it was said to be “the best and most practical solution”.But after the inevitable outcry, Hampden Park Ltd changed its mind and decided to waive the legal obligation.No-one should really be surprised at such a monumental cock-up, however, as you’d be hard pushed to find two organisations with as little credibility as the SPFL and Police Scotland.The idea of staging both games at Hampden on the Sunday, with Rangers taking on Aberdeen at noon and Celtic meeting Hearts at .pm, was beyond belief.Dons supporters were rightly up in arms, having been forced ious times in the past to travel to Glasgow for lunchtime kick-offs. Unless Scotrail, another organisation not known for covering itself in glory, agreed to put on extra trains the first was due to arrive in the city  minutes after the match had begun.Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes pointed out that the scheduling would have little or no effect on his team’s preparations which would just go ahead in the usual fashion. That may be so but for the fans it would have been a complete nightmare.Hearts boss Craig Levein was more outspoken, which is becoming a regular feature of a man who was once seen as boring. He described the SPFL’s decision as absolute madness.The Edinburgh club’s owner Ann Budge also voiced concern, given the dficulties that could arise from having over , supporters from four dferent clubs in Glasgow on the same day.She was quite correct. The probability that it would deter younger Hearts followers from travelling, as it could be a very late trip back to the capital, was a very real one.Budge was one of those who asked the SFPL to think again, saying the body should be encouraging fans to attend and not making it dficult for them.If the first game had gone to extra time and penalties it could have been well after pm before the stadium was emptied. That would not have given much time to clear up the inevitable mess, get rid of , people and get another , in.If any evidence was needed about what is wrong with Scottish football, here it is. The Scottish football authorities had placed all its eggs in one basket with Hampden and had no option but to try and justy the daft move. It really did beggar belief.: : : : : : : :Fortunes have been mixed for Shetland’s rugby teams so far in their mainland competition endeavours.The men’s side began by losing all three games and finishing bottom of group one in the oddly named North Region Referee’s Cup, although they were only well beaten in one of the ties.Then, on the back of a promising home league win against Aberdeenshire, they unfortunately came up short on Saturday after a long trip to the Western Isles, going down - to Stornoway.The revamped Tennents Caledonia North  ision looks very competitive, with the likelihood of most teams being able to beat anyone on their day.Shetland, as we all know, will be a match for most at home. But it remains dficult to do the same when travelling, with so many players not able to commit due to one reason or another.The depth of the squad is very important, which is why it is heartening to see more youngsters coming into the equation. They, after all, are the future of the club.The women’s team, on the other hand, have enjoyed a great start to the season, beating both Banff and Inverness Craig Dunain and currently leading the Tennents North League table.Last year’s league winners Orkney have already lost a game against Inverness, and a fascinating battle could ensue at Clickimin on Sunday when the island rivals go head to head.: : : : : : : :As someone who has supported Manchester United for over half a century, it pains me to see the state of the club under manager Jose Mourinho.This week’s home peformance against Valencia was abysmal, with several players totally devoid of pace and urgency and obviously not doing the business for the man in charge.The stunned silence among the fans was something that has rarely,ever, been seen before. Many of them began leaving Old Trafford with  minutes still remaining, and you really can’t blame them.The once-great club has been on the way down ever since the retiral of Alex Ferguson. The treatment of his replacement David Moyes was shocking, being sacked after only eight months in charge, and the appointment of the next incumbent Louis Van Gaal was a mistake.The worst move of all though was to hand the job to Mourinho. Winning the Europa League and the League Cup in his first season obviously gave  hope to some but he really was an awful choice.This walking advert for narcissism needs to go now before things become even worse. But the question is who will be next in line. Zinedine Zidane has been tipped because of his supposed “humility”, in contrast to Mourinho, although that was hardly evident with the infamous dismissal for head-butting Marco Materazzi in the  World Cup final.Others who have been tipped include Didier Deschamps, who led France to World Cup success a few months ago, or former United player Laurent Blanc who was recently in charge at Paris Saint-Germain.While it will most likely be another foreign manager who succeeds Mourinho, I reckon the club could attempt to reverse the trend by appointing an Englishman.Why not give someone like Eddie Howe of Bournemouth the job  He is one of the brightest young bosses in the country and has performed wonders at a club where the ambitions are basically to stay in the Premier League. But sadly I can’t see it happening.: : : : : : : :Contrary to my views on Mourinho, it was very disappointing to see the likeable Steve Bruce handed his marching orders by Aston Villa this week.Bruce led the club to the final of the Championship play-offs last season, but was sacked on Wednesday after a - home draw with Preston North End the previous evening.Villa are now th in the table but had they beaten Preston they would have risen to fth equal, only five points behind the leaders.

He deserves all the support possible.Tomorrow’s match, despite being outside the Six Nations, should still be hotly contested. In the absence of Hogg and Barclay, English-based Sean Maitland and David Denton, and half-backs Finn Russell and Greg Laidlaw who now ply their trade in France, it gives an opportunity for some youngsters to make their mark.Those include Blair Kinghorn and Adam Hastings who have been named in the starting line-up, while Darcy Graham, George Horne and Matt Fagerson may get their chance later in the game.He won’t be making an appearance on this occasion as he plays for Welsh side Scarlets, but I am particularly interested in seeing Kiwi import Blade Thomson in the next three tests. Hopefully he can make an eye-catching debut to match his name.: : : : : : : :Family, friends, work colleagues and a good number of former footballers gathered on Friday to say farewell to Alastair Johnston from Cunningsburgh.When I first met him in the early s he was still an excellent player. He had represented Cunningsburgh, Ness United and ious Shetland select sides, once making a trip to Faroe with a county squad.Alastair was probably a wing-half in his early days, but after the change from -- to modern formations he usually formed part of the central defence.He played alongside the late Ian Manson for Ness, while for Cunningsburgh his long-term partner was Douglas Halcrow. They were part of a team which enjoyed many successes in Southern League football, and also which won the Parish Cup in  and .Cunningsburgh had a number of outstanding players in that era, not least twins Billy and Malcolm Adamson and the late George Adamson, but Alastair was definitely one of the most consistent.Very similar to his -year career at The Shetland Times, he was as dedicated as it was possible to be, someone you could always count on whatever the issue.As former goalkeeper Peter Farmer said after the funeral last Friday, “I played behind Alistair for  years and he was so reliable, the way he read the game.”Football runs in the family. His younger brother Gordon also played for Cunningsburgh and Ness while another brother Jim represented Shetland in  and . Nephews Raymond and James Aitken and Tony and James Johnston did likewise, with the latter becoming the county’s equal most-capped player.When the Times started a works league team in the s Alistair was persuaded to come out of retirement and take part in the very first match, a friendly against Bressay. That was where his we hailed from and I recall him saying that “I better no score a goal or Margaret will nivver spaek ta me again”.He also came with the works team on a trip to Orkney. He was a bit unsure about that and actually got injured in one of the matches, but as far as I recall he had as good a time as anybody where the after-match entertainment was concerned.Alastair and Margaret had three daughters, Wendy and twins Susan and Alison. They were all musically gted while Susan and Alison excelled at hockey.One of his grand-daughters, Sophie Moar, is a top athlete. At the island games in Jersey three years ago she won a bronze medal in the long jump and was a member of the gold medal-winning # metres relay squad. Alastair and Margaret were there to see it and I would imagine that was one of his proudest ever moments. After his retiral in  our paths crossed a few times but unfortunately not all that often. He was always friendly and good company.The last time I saw Alastair was earlier this year when I visited him and Margaret at Bremmer in Cunningsburgh. It was a very dficult experience as by then the dementia had taken its toll, and he was a shadow of the vibrant figure he had been. He still knew me though, which made it worthwhile.Alistair was a tremendous guy. I know Margaret, their daughters and grandchildren, and the other family will miss him greatly, and I would like to give my condolence to them all.: : : : : : : :News came this week that Crystal Palace footballer James McArthur had retired from Scotland duty as he believed it was the only way he could “continue to play at the top level”.There was a time when representing your country was considered the “top level” but sadly that is not a view shared by an increasing number of people in the game.McArthur, who won the last of his  caps a year ago, says he has found it increasingly dficult to manage a number of physical issues. He is only .The Crystal Palace midfielder will continue to turn out for his club in what could be -odd games a season. However, he has deemed the half a dozen or so he could be required for his international side to be just too much.McArthur follows in the wake of a number of Scottish players who have taken this decision, the highest profile being Celtic captain Scott Brown. Others, such as Alan Hutton, are still performing regularly for their clubs.There were also the recent instances where both Leigh Grfiths, Robert Snodgrass and Kieran Tierney asked to be released from the international squad because of perceived “fatigue”.No doubt McArthur, like the others mentioned, has his reasons for arriving at this decision. But I cannot help thinking that players from a dferent era would never have done so.Some, notably Denis Law and current Scottish boss Alex McLeish, have said they have never retired from their country. They would still be availablerequired. Attitudes have definitely changed, and not for the better.: : : : : : : :The Australian Cricketers’ Associationthis week called for the bans to be lted on the three players who were involved in ball-tampering in South Africa earlier this year.The association has laid part of the blame for the incident at the door of Cricket Australia, who it has labelled “arrogant and controlling”.Steve Smith, David Warner and Cameron Bancroft were all “contrite men who have suffered enough”, a review carried out by the ACA stated.Smith, who was captain at the time, and vice-captain Warner are seven months into their one-year bans, while Bancroft, who carried out the cheating, will be eligible tonext month.While the three may have endured both a degree of humiliation – Smith’s tearful confession was felt by some to be meaningful – and financial penalties, lting the ban now would send all the wrong signals.Cheating in sport, however apologetic the protagonists may appear in the aftermath, is an anathema which needs punishing.

What we haven’t heard is what exactly it will mean for Shetland.”But clarity remained out of reach over the next two and a half hours with a pivotal vote in the House of Commons scheduled for Tuesday.Presenting a view from Westminster Mr Carmichael said: “Every time you think we’ve got to peak madness in the House of Commons something  happens.”He added that Tuesday will likely to be on “another level” and said that he hesitates to “predict anything beyond the next hour at the moment”.Miss Budge said that farmers were particularly worried about the future of subsidy payments in the aftermath of leaving the EU.“The big concern is where the Scottish government or UK government will find that kind of money to put into farming.”The tourism industry was most concerned about maintaining visa free travel for citizens of the EU, said Mr Mathieson, while Mrs Hambleton said that businesses had to scenario plan in order to offset any potential negative side effects from Britain’s departure. which had highlighted government analysis which warned of potential delays of up to six months for pharmaceuticals.“Project fear is now project reality”, he said.Unsurprisingly, the biggest optimism came from Mr Collins, who viewed Brexit as an opportunity for fishermen. He noted that British fishermen caught less than half of fish in UK waters, compared with Norway catching around  per cent in theirs.He later criticised the EU as undemocratic but said he was a committed European and that he and his partner had four EU passports between them. His ideal scenario would involve dismantling the EU and for the project to be rebuilt with more accountability and less bureaucracy.Indeed the EU came in for criticism throughout the night. Mr Carmichael said that his view was not “massively dferent” from that of Mr Collins. But where the fishermen’s chief was keen to depart Mr Carmichael favoured remaining and reforming.A straw poll at the close of proceedings found an overwhelming support for this view. One person favoured Theresa May’s deal, two opted for leaving with no deal and  said their preference was to stay in the bloc.Isn#t the whole idea of Brexit, to do with the Conservatives wanting a trade deal with the USA, without the interference of the EU This will also, I think, be the beginning of the mass privatization of most government responsibilities and duties of care going to USA companies, where the Conservatives will benefit from such a deal  .The impact on Shetland, I fear, will be very damaging indeed, as economic circumstances will mean a vast reduction of Local Authority spending. This will also force the SIC to do huge cuts in budgets and very much streamline and prioritize what money goes where.This will force many other companies and people owning their own business to either reduce the workforce or shut up shop The general outlook does not look favourable for Shetland in the long term.I sincerely hope my outlook is proven wrong  finally Mr Carmichael should know that the only reform of the eu that they will be doing is ever closer integration. Starting with what his former leader called a DANGEROUS FANTASY dreamed up by brexiteers, an EU ARMY. Well that DANGEROUS FANTASY has been seen to be a DANGEROUS REALITY since the referendum with EU armoured personel carriers on the streets of Paris battling french protestors.Is this DANGEROUS REALITY stuff for real Someone may have been listening to Trump and Farage#s comments on the EU army without turning on their b.s. filter.Why shouldn#t EU nations cooperate in defence matters  Is Ali saying NATO is a bad thing Since  it has become politically correct for democratic European neighbours to cooperate. Why not get over it What is this DANGEROUS REALITY Ali fears  Does he imagine the purpose of a EU army would be to attack domestic protesters across frontiers like the Soviet army did in Hungary in   Does he see the EU as a fascist entity that must be stopped  Before you know it he will be advocating the citizen#s right to bear arms so as to protect itself against the government like they do in the good old US of A. Just how whacky is his DANGEROUS REALTY No one gets to choose their nationality Ali, just how we feel about it. There is nothing natural or God-given in being Scottish, British, German or European. Why not celebrate what we have in common and not obsess about invented dferences resulting from random man made lines on a map  Scary scary stuff. and only a line on a map drawn by a king that separates Scotland and England. A separation you are keen to expand upon. I have to say you do seem confusedSo your British now,not a Shetlander, # accepting the majority wanting to be part of the E.U, So much for Wir Shetlandits Wir Westminster then!Fake news strikes again then I guess#Which is this culture that demands you submit without question Ali   Sounds like it owes more to Henry Tudor than Kant and Rousseau. And what culture is it you are being asked to accept that separates us and is abhorrent to you   Eurovision   Persian   Mesophilic Perhaps you can expand on what your gripe actually is Ali,it isn’t pulling sovereignty with folk little dferent from ourselves.FYI should Brexiteers triumph I’d still rather separate Scotland from England and stay European as I don’t much want to be led by English nationalist bigots.

However, on turning , she was required to move home and the family worked with Comhairle nan Eilean Siar#s social work department to put in place suitable arrangements.It took two years to find a solution and in May this year, Eilidh moved back to Stornoway, where she was housed in supervised accommodation with a young male who also suffers from autism.Four complaints by the family over that accommodation provision were upheld by the Care Commission and, following an incident, the male was removed from the house to another unit. However, that sudden change in circumstance sparked an escalation in Eilidh#s behaviour and the family were informed by social work management that they were seeking an order under mental health legislation.Eilidh had been housed on her own in the psychiatric ward in the Western Isles Hospital in Stornoway but was flown to the mainland on Tuesday of this week as that ward faces closure. She is also on a daily course of benzodiazepine # despite never previously requiring any medication. Catherine Ann MacLeod, Eilidh#s aunt, said there had been a #mishandling# of her situation from the moment she was required to come back to the island.#Eilidh is not psychotic,# said Ms MacLeod. #What she was displaying was traits of autism. The male was removed from the house all of a sudden and Eilidh is not able to process sudden changes without careful handling. That#s why she became more aggressive she#s not able to express herself properly. It would never have happened had a proper care plan been in place.#Whatever happens now, they#ve broken Eilidh # she#ll not be the same now. It#s broken my sister, too. I want the whole thing investigated by the proper authorities so this does not happen to another family.#Miss MacLeod, who said the case was #a clear abuse of Eilidh#s human rights#, was not interested in any apology from the council. The case has been raised with local MSP Alasdair Allan.He said: #I have met with Eilidh and her family. I am very concerned that they need to be reassured that there is accommodation for Eilidh long-term on the island, where she can be near her family.#There is no doubt that the family have had reason to be anxious about this question and I hope that we will now see dferent agencies working together in the islands to find a solution. I continue to work with the family to raise a number of complaints which they have about the way they feel they have been treated this far.#The islands currently face a major shortage of staff in the care sector, partly as a result of depopulation.The comhairle denied that decisions over Eilidh#s care were in any way motivated by budgetary constraints. A spokesman said they were #unable to comment on inidual cases#.#As a general principle,# the spokesman added, #we are committed to supporting people with complex needs in their own communities but for a small number of people there are circumstances in which outcomes will improvethey are supported in specialist centres of excellence on the mainland. This is not a matter of a lack of financial resources but rather not having the required levels of specialist care and expertise.#Whilst this is the case for many areas across Scotland it is clearly more acute in an island setting because it involves those requiring such care to live away from home for perhaps extended periods of time. It is also the case that implementing such measures and deciding when it is appropriate to repatriate service users is a matter of assessment and judgement.#The spokesman added that they were currently #in the process of developing a new strategy on learning disabilities and autism and this will consider whether we have the right balance between local support and specialist mainland provision#.By Murray MacLeod"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/web-subs-3.jpg","title":"skye prepares for santa dash","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineA record high number of runners have signed up for the third annual Skye Santa Dash taking place in Portree this Saturday .More than  people have signed up for the festive frolic which starts from Somerled Square in Portree and is organised by Skye Events.In , a erse field of participants including adults, children, and animals embraced the festive spirit and adorned the famous Santa suit to undertake the two-mile charitable run.Although the event organisers will be keen to see white beards swishing and red hats bobbing come Saturday, this year they have added a few twists to the proceedings to make the dash even more inclusive and environmentally friendly.

Ireland north or south was never a concern yet we will all pay the cost for generations to come.Brexit represents a huge threat to the social, economic and political le of this island. The outworking of Brexit could be the imposition of hard border.That is why the people of the north - from all communities and backgrounds - voted to reject it.They knew it would devastate the economy, strip away rights and undermine our political agreements.And that is why, in the immediate aftermath of the referendum result, Sinn Féin embarked on a diplomatic offensive across Europe warning of the dangers of Brexit and putting forward our demand for a unique solution for the north which would respect the majority remain vote.Through intense lobbying in Brussels, Strasbourg, Dublin and London, Sinn Féin led and built support for the idea that our unique position and peace agreements required a unique Brexit solution.Our case for special status for the north within the EU sought to ensure there would be no hard border, that citizens rights would be upheld and the Good Friday Agreement protected in all its parts.As the prospect of a no deal Brexit became more likely, we made it clear the north needed to remain in the customs union and single market in order to prevent our economy being driven off a clf by the Tories and their DUP allies.That was reflected in the backstop which was agreed by the EU and the British government. But as soon as it was agreed the British government, as they always do, began trying to renege on its commitments.Our position remains now as it was then. That backstop must be maintained and protected. It provides the bottom line and is our insurance policy against the worst excesses of Brexit, which we know will be a disaster for this country.The backstop is not perfect and neither is the withdrawal agreement. There is no such thing as a good Brexit after all.There are still issues of concern and clarication required, particularly relating to the issues of rights and representation.Over the course of the last number of days Sinn Féin has met with An Taoiseach and An Tanáiste and have been in contact with Theresa May about all of these concerns.The pro-remain parties represent the majority of people in the north and are fighting on their behalf.By contrast, the DUP are actively trampling the best interests of people and business in the north in their reckless cheerleading for an as yet  Tory Brexit.Sinn Féin will continue to stand with all other parties who advocate for citizens’ rights, our economic interests and our agreements in the face of Brexit.  We will continue to put pressure on the Irish government to act in the interests of citizens, north and south and hold the Taoiseach to his pledge that the people of the north will never again be left behind by an Irish Government.Whatever twists and turns the Brexit debacle takes next, the backstop as agreed must be maintained. It cannot be sacriced in an attempt to save the ailing career of Theresa May or to serve the hard-line agendas of the Brexiteers in the Tory party or the DUP. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27499  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonGUE-NGL has to expand as an inclusive, welcoming group, providing a voice for progressive change.It should act as a catalyst for new alliances with other democratic and progressive groups in the next parliament term which support the need to democratise and reform the EU support workers# rights defend the environment oppose bigotry and discrimination and champion international solidarity and peace.- Declan Kearney MLADimitrios Papadimoulis is a Greek MEP who represents the Syriza party in the European Parliament.He has spent a le time involved in left wing political activism in his native Greece and has been a member of the Syriza central leadership which brought the party from opposition into government in , while the country was still in the midst of its financial and economic crisis and subjected to extreme political and economic pressure by the European Unionestablishment.Dimitrios is ‘laconic and philosophical in the way of Sparta’ – to borrow a phrase he used during a contribution at a recent conference which we attended together in Brussels, organised by GUE-NGL the European Parliamentary group to which both Sinn Féin and Syriza are affiliated.This meeting brought together leadership representatives and MEPs from twenty of the most signicant political parties on the progressive Left in the EU to discuss the future direction of GUE-NGL and future political strategy and co-operation among left wing and progressive parties including the  European elections, and the next term of the EU parliament.During one of our conversations at the conference Dimitrios recalled a story from - years previously, when he was travelling to deliver a speech.Dimitrios told his taxi driver what he was planning to say at the meeting.The taxi man replied:“Remember, you are a politician, not a prophet. Do not promise me things it will take  years to achieve. Make change for me tomorrow.”Dimitrios immediately decided to change his speech. He learned a lesson that day from the taxi driver which has stayed with him ever since.Theories or notions, and even visions for changeremain just that unless they can translate into concrete change in society.People want change which makes a material dference in their lives for them and their families.And thats how it should be.Fair wages high quality education and health services free at the point of delivery and a clean sustainable environment should not be dreams. They need to become realities.So political activists who are committed to transformational change need to be grounded in the real world.They have to understand what they can deliver in the here and now, and then to have a plan to achieve even more.But the progressive Left can only make change when it has the strength to do so.That means setting realistic objectives and priorities, and then devising strategies which work.I said in my opening comments to the conference that Europe is at a crossroads.The political direction, policy orientation, and increasing need for reform of the EU coupled with, and often fuelling the rise of the extreme right wing, now presents an existential threat to the principles of the progressive Left.Social democracy has effectively collapsed both politically and electorally across Europe.There is a need to build a progressive Left alternative, and to popularise a new political narrative or common sense based upon core ideas: To include:·         That economies serve the many and not the few:·         That human and democratic rights are inalienable:·         That the global environment is protected:·         That Europe should act as a force for international peace and solidarity: and·         That racism, sectarianism, misogyny, homophobia and xenophobia are opposed.These ideas should be a common  for expanding the political strength of the progressive Left.However, that potential faces many challenges.Some of these are beyond the control of the progressive Left, but others are not.All of this was under discussion at the GUE-NGL conference.There were many notable contributions.Arnaldo Otegi, the General Secretary of the EH Bildu was in attendance.He had just received the ground breaking judgement from the European Court of Human Rights, which ruled his prosecution was wrong.During Arnaldos presentation he provided a powerful critique of global capitalism and the importance of defending community and social values.Panos Skourletis has been a senior minister of the Syriza government.In a highly signicant move several months ago, he moved from that role to take up the position of Secretary of Syrizas Central Committee.Panos set out an analysis of the situation in Greece and wider Europe and argued that it is time for a common front of left parties and other progressives and democratic forces in Europe.Earlier I argued that unity and cohesion are essential between parties and democratic forces on the left in Europe: and that we must focus on what expands unity, whilst respecting our dferences and uniqueness as parties and national movements.Sinn Féin believes that GUE-NGL has successfully enabled progressive parties from the left to co-operate within the European Parliament, whilst recognising the autonomy of political delegations.This is one of GUE-NGL’s strengths as a parliamentary group and deserves to be consolidated.Unanimity is not required on all issues, all of the time but progressives cannot afford to be disunited.Political sectarianism undermines political strength, solidarity and fraternity on the progressive Left.The collective strength of the progressive Left in Europe stems from the domestic relevance and political strength of its constituent parts.The left will only be as strong in the European Parliament as progressive Left and republican parties are relevant and strong in their national contexts.The success of a real progressive Left alternative,  depends upon securing strategic beach heads of political strength and influence.This is why support for Europes only left wing government in Greece is so politically important.Whilst progressives need to be in a hurry to make change and in pursuit of a social and more democratic Europe, we also need to be realistic and pragmatic.The distinction between strategy and tactical positions need to be understood.Alliances with others are indispensable to the process of changing the overall balance of forces.Rigid or dogmatic ideological positions can prevent agreement upon shared objectives and securing unity among the widest cross section of progressive and democratic opinion.The political discussion and focus upon an emergent European Progressive Caucus embracing the Left, social democrats, and environmentalists is such an innovative and welcome initiative.I proposed to the Brussels conference that a strategic consensus among the progressive Left and others should be based upon support for national independence, social emancipation, citizens rights, and democratic control over the economy.For our part Sinn Féin will contest the European election in  on an agenda which advocates for the creation of a Social Europe.We will be emphasising the need to protect rural and fishing communities the promotion of economic democracy enhanced environmental policy, human rights and social justice as well as defence of the Irish peace process and support for a united Ireland.The onset of Brexit has changed the political and social landscape in Ireland, and also signicantly influenced political discourse within the EU itself.It has swept away all of the established constitutional, political and economic assumptions about the status quo in Ireland and refocused international attention upon the democratic case for Irish unity.During the conference I highlighted the denial of citizens rights and blocking of political democracy in the north of Ireland by the DUP and British Tory government. The point was made that this existential rights crisis, combined with the imposition of Brexit represented the most serious threat to the Good Friday Agreement, and the democratic option for managing change in the north of Ireland.The European Parliament  EU institutions have become strategically important forums within which to promote the democratic aim of a united Ireland and to encourage support for an Irish unity referendum. The level of interest in, and support for constitutional change in Ireland is now at an unprecedented high level across the EU.Sinn Féin will continue lobbying to make the case for a united Ireland a priority for the progressive Left and within other sections of democratic opinion represented in the European Parliament. Irish unity is integral to the vision of a new Europe.Going forward, the progressive Left in Europe needs to focus its collective efforts upon maximising representation and influence in the next parliament.GUE-NGL has to expand as an inclusive, welcoming group, providing a voice for progressive change.It should act as a catalyst for new alliances with other democratic and progressive groups in the next parliament term which support the need to democratise and reform the EU support workers rights defend the environment oppose bigotry and discrimination and champion international solidarity and peace.That is what the shared ambition of a New Europe should mean. Sinn Féin has a central role in promoting that vision.The progressive Left across Europe has much to do.We need to be people in a hurry.The future cannot wait.We need to plan, organise and attract the popular support to make change for all tomorrow: To build a New Europe - a Europe of Equals. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27500  ","story":"• John James Kelly, Jimmy Joe Reynolds and Charlie #Cathal# McCafferty Staff ReporterThe three men were in a back room in the house of Patrick Kelly, brother of John James, when the explosion blew away part of the walls and roof.On  November , IRA Volunteers blew up six customs posts along the border in Counties Armagh and Fermanagh.

Seismic political events, including the Home Rule crisis, the World War, the  Rising and the Conscription threat had shaken the country since the last General Election in . Women had the vote for the first time, other restrictions on the universal right to vote had been removed and the widening of democracy helped to ensure a stunning victory for Sinn Féin on a Republican . Ireland elected  members to the House of Commons in the Westminster Parliament. They were elected in single-seat constituencies on the first-past-the-post voting system, as Westminster MPs are elected to this day. Since its foundation in  Sinn Féin had advocated the withdrawal of Irish MPs from Westminster and the establishment of an Irish constituent assembly. It was only in , in successive by-election victories, that Sinn Fein won Westminster seats and put its abstentionist policy into operation. The swing to Sinn Féin was not only because of the executions and mass imprisonments after the  Rising there was also growing opposition to Irelands involvement in the war and its cost in lives, the inclusion in the British Cabinet of Tory Unionists who vehemently opposed any form of Home Rule, the threat of Partition and the ineffectiveness of the Irish Party at Westminster, led by John Redmond, increasingly seen as collaborators with British imperialism, as well as ongoing repression and press censorship. Redmond died in March  and in April the British government introduced legislation to impose Conscription in Ireland. The Irish Party MPs withdrew from Westminster in protest, thus ending forever any signicant Irish nationalist presence in that Parliament. Sinn Féin, the Irish Volunteers and the trade union movement took the lead in the anti-Conscription campaign. The Irish Party was also involved and it had three by-election successes in  but the writing was on the wall. In East Cavan in June Sinn Féins Arthur Grfith won a decisive victory on the abstentionist  which Irish Party leader John Dillon had called a policy of lunatics. It was widely predicted that Dillons party faced heavy defeat whenever the General Election came. Well before the war ended, Sinn Féins election preparations were under way. The jailing of many of its leaders in the British governments concocted German Plot did not deter the movement. In August  General Secretaries Harry Boland and Tom Kelly reported to the Ard Chomhairle that there were over , cumainn throughout the country. The same meeting endorsed a motion to contest every seat in the General Election “in order to give every Irish voter the opportunity of voting for or against the establishment of an independent Irish Republic”. By the time of the Sinn Féin Ard Fheis in October , many candidates had already been selected, a process overseen by Harry Boland, based at the movement’s Head Office in  Harcourt Street, Dublin. That same month the electoral register was revised to take account of the widened franchise. Women over  could vote for the first time and remaining property qualications for men over  were removed. This meant that the number of people in Ireland entitled to vote in the General Election grew enormously from , in  to ,, in . On  October the Irish Labour Party and Trade Union Congress announced its intention to stand in a number of constituencies. But there was opposition both internally and externally. Sinn Féin requested that Labour candidates take a pledge to abstain totally from Westminster, in which case Sinn Féin would stand aside in selected seats. But the Labour position was to abstain conditionally, retaining the option to attend in certain circumstances. A great many trade unionists were members or supporters of Sinn Féin and opposed Labour standing unless the full pledge was taken. A special conference of the Irish Labour Party and Trade Union Congress was held in the Mansion House on  and  November, at which the decision was taken not to stand in the General Election. Debate has continued ever since about the reasons for this decision and its consequences. There was a wide iety of views within the Irish trade union movement ranging from socialist republicans to Home Rulers to Unionists, so the reasons for non-participation were ied. Historian Dorothy Macardle put it this way: \"The majority of the working men and women of Ireland were members of Sinn Féin or the Volunteers or Cumann na mBan, and, as the disciples of James Connolly, held that the freedom of the nation and the freedom of the working classes must be pursued as one unided aim.\" . The war ended on  November and the British Parliament was dissolved on  November. Polling days was set for  December. The Sinn Féin manesto reflected the republican position adopted by the Ard Fheis a year previously and stated that the party \"gives Ireland the opportunity of vindicating her honour and pursuing with renewed confidence the path of national salvation by rallying to the flag of the Irish Republic\". It was committed to establishing the Irish Republic by withdrawing Irish representation from Westminster, using “any and every means available” to make British rule impossible, establishing a constituent assembly and appealing to the post-war Peace Conference to recognise Ireland as an independent nation. It roundly condemned the role of the Irish Party in collaborating with the British government and attempting to “harness the Irish people to England’s war chariot”. The Manesto endorsed the  Proclamation “guaranteeing within the independent Nation equal rights and equal opportunities to all its citizens”. The manesto was censored by the British authorities when it appeared in the newspapers but the full version was widely circulated. Press censorship was only one of the many forms of repression that the British used during the election. Hundreds of republicans were in jails  – including  of Sinn Féin.s candidates. Raids and arrests were frequent, as were bans on public meetings and among those arrested during the campaign was Sinn Féin Director of Elections Robert Brennan. His two predecessors, Seán Milroy and Dan McCarthy, were already in prison. British soldiers and loyalists had attacked  Harcourt Street on  November and subsequent nights, leading to the death from a stroke of ‘Nationality’ editor Seumas O’Kelly.  On  November the office was raided by a large force of armed Dublin politan Police who arrested Brennan and seized manestos and other election material. Acting Director of Elections James O’Mara wrote to the press: “Each arrest has naturally caused some disorganisation, but the cause of Irish independence will not be stayed or broken by such tyranny. Men have been, and will be, found who will fill the vacant places.” Nominations were due to close on  December. In North-East Ulster the Catholic bishops suggested that Sinn Féin and the Irish Party should not split the nationalist vote in seats where this would allow a Unionist to win. Sinn Féin proposed that a plebiscite be held among nationalist voters in these constituencies. Dillon rejected this in talks with Sinn Féin representative Eoin Mac Néill. The latter acceded to a call for the Catholic Cardinal Logue to propose a four-four ision of eight seats between the two parties. Others in Sinn Féin criticised Mac Néill for not adhering to his instructions. Sinn Féin candidates remained in the race in three of the four Irish Party-allocated constituencies but did not campaign and their voters were urged to support the Irish Party to keep the Unionists out. In taking this position the need to oppose the British threat of Partition was very much to the fore. When nominations closed it was realised that  outgoing Irish Party MPs were not contesting the election and in  constituencies,  of them in Munster, the Sinn Féin candidates were unopposed. Sinn Féin contested  of the  constituencies . Harassment continued right up to polling day with raids and arrests, seizure of Sinn Féin election material and removal of posters by British crown forces. After the death in Usk Prison, Wales, on  December of republican prisoner Richard Coleman, Sinn Féin campaigners wore black crepe on candidate badges. In The Four Glorious Years Frank Gallagher says a final election rally filled Dublins OConnell Street with speakers on several s, each flying a Tricolour with a black cross for Richard Coleman. He describes how on polling day Dublin dockers marched to the polling station behind an advance guard of Citizen Army veterans and hundreds of workers at the new British aerodrome at Collinstown – now Dublin Airport – went to the polls in a fleet of lorries flying Tricolours. The only two women candidates were both suffragists and  Rising veterans - Countess Markeivicz in the St Patrick’s Ward in Dublin’s South Inner City and Winred Carney in the strongly Unionist Victoria ward in Belfast. Markievicz was in Holloway Prison in England and her election address to her constituents she said:“I have many friends in the constituency who will work all the harder for me. They know that I stand for the Irish Republic, to establish which our heroes died, and that my colleagues are firm in the belief that the freeing of Ireland is in the hands of the Irish people today.”There was a two-week gap between polling day and the announcement of the final results on  December. Sinn Féin had won an overwhelming victory, taking  of the  seats in Ireland. Unionists won  and the Irish Parliamentary Party six . The majority vote for Sinn Féin was  per cent:  of the  Counties ed only Sinn Féin TDs. Of Dublins  TDs, all but one were Sinn Féin. The myth of nine-county Ulster being Unionist was exposed. Unionists polled a majority in Antrim, Armagh, Derry and Down but there were nationalist majorities in Cavan, Donegal, Fermanagh, Monaghan and Tyrone. Constance Markievicz was the only woman elected in Ireland and Britain and would go on to be one of the first women government ministers in the world in the First Dáil Éireann. Preparations for that Dáil, the democratic assembly of the Irish Republic so strongly mandated by the electorate, began soon after the General Election that transformed Ireland  years ago. GENERAL ELECTION - MANIFESTO TO THE IRISH PEOPLETHE coming General Election is fraught with vital possibilities for the future of our nation. Ireland is faced with the question whether this generation wills it that she is to march out into the full sunlight of freedom, or is to remain in the shadow of a base imperialism that has brought and ever will bring in its train naught but evil for our race.Sinn Féin gives Ireland the opportunity of vindicating her honour and pursuing with renewed confidence the path of national salvation by rallying to the flag of the Irish Republic.Sinn Féin aims at securing the establishment of that Republic.. By withdrawing the Irish Representation from the British Parliament and by denying the right and opposing the will of the British Government or any other foreign Government to legislate for Ireland.. By making use of any and every means available to render impotent the power of England to hold Ireland in subjection by military force or otherwise.. By the establishment of a constituent assembly comprising persons chosen by Irish constituencies as the supreme national authority to speak and act in the name of the Irish people, and to develop Irelands social, political and industrial le, for the welfare of the whole people of Ireland.. Irelands claim to the application of that principle in her favour is not based on any accidental situation arising from the war. It is older than manynot all of the present belligerents. It is based on our unbroken tradition of nationhood, on a unity in a national name which has never been challenged, on our possession of a distinctive national culture and social order, on the moral courage and dignity of our people in the face of alien aggression, on the fact that in nearly every generation, and five times within the past  years our people have challenged in arms the right of England to rule this country. On these incontrovertible facts is based the claim that our people have beyond question established the right to be accorded all the power of a free nation.Sinn Féin stands less for a political party than for the Nation it represents the old tradition of nationhood handed on from dead generations it stands by the Proclamation of the Provisional Government of Easter, , reasserting the inalienable right of the Irish Nation to sovereign independence, reaffirming the determination of the Irish people to achieve it, and guaranteeing within the independent Nation equal rights and equal opportunities to all its citizens.Believing that the time has arrived when Irelands voice for the principle of untrammelled National self-determination should be heard above every interest of party or class, Sinn Féin will oppose at the Polls every inidual candidate who does not accept this principle.The policy of our opponents stands condemned on any test, whether of principle or expediency. The right of a nation to sovereign independence rests upon immutable natural law and cannot be made the subject of a compromise. Any attempt to barter away the sacred and inviolate rights of nationhood begins in dishonour and is bound to end in disaster. The enforced exodus of millions of our people, the decay of our industrial le, the ever-increasing financial plunder of our country, the whittling down of the demand for the Repeal of the Union, voiced by the first Irish Leader to plead in the Hall of the Conqueror to that of Home Rule on the Statute Book, and finally the contemplated mutilation of our country by partition, are some of the ghastly results of a policy that leads to national ruin.Those who have endeavoured to harness the people of Ireland to Englands war-chariot, ignoring the fact that only a freely-elected Government in a free Ireland has power to decide for Ireland the question of peace and war, have forfeited the right to speak for the Irish people. The green flag turned red in the hands of the Leaders, but that shame is not to be laid at the doors of the Irish people unless they continue a policy of sending their representatives to an alien and hostile assembly, whose powerful influence has been sufficient to destroy the integrity and sap the independence of their representatives. Ireland must repudiate the men who, in a supreme crisis for the nation, attempted to sell her birthright for the vague promises of English Ministers, and who showed their incompetence by failing to have even these promises fulfilled.The present Irish members of the English Parliament constitute an obstacle to be removed from the path that leads to the Peace Conference. By declaring their will to accept the status of a province instead of boldly taking their stand upon the right of the nation they supply England with the only subterfuge at her disposal for obscuring the issue in the eyes of the world. By their persistent endeavours to induce the young manhood of Ireland to don the unorm of our seven-century old oppressor, and place their lives at the disposal of the military machine that holds our Nation in bondage, they endeavour to barter away and even to use against itself the one great asset still left to our Nation after the havoc of the centuries.Sinn Féin goes to the polls handicapped by all the arts and contrivances that a powerful and unscrupulous enemy can use against us. Conscious of the power of Sinn Féin to secure the freedom of Ireland the British Government would destroy it. Sinn Féin, however, goes to the polls confident that the people of this ancient nation will be true to the old cause and will vote for the men who stand by the principles of Tone, Emmet, Mitchel, Pearse and Connolly, the men who disdain to whine to the enemy for favours, the men who hold that Ireland must be as free as England or Holland, Switzerland or France, and whose demand is that the only status befitting this ancient realm is the status of a free nation.ISSUED BY THE STANDING COMMITTEE OF SINN FÉINtest"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27506  ","story":" Aengus Ó SnodaighThe flu epidemic that swept across Britain and Ireland in  struck at the weak and elderly in society. Hundreds died and many more spent many weeks crippled in agony in their beds during the winter months.Richard Coleman was born in Dublin in , one of eleven Coleman children, most of whom were active in the Gaelic League. Brought up in Swords, County Dublin, Richard was a religious and a patriotic young man. He trained to be a Christian Brother, but left to begin a career with the Prudential Insurance Company.When Thomas MacDonagh came to Swords in April  to recruit members for the recently formed Irish Volunteers, Richard was among the first to join. When John Redmond forced a split in the Volunteers later that year, the remaining Volunteers elected Richard as their captain.On Easter Sunday , Richard mobilised his men, the Fingal Battalion, at Saucers Town, ensured that they were ready for what lay ahead and dismissed them till the following day. On Easter Monday they, along with other Volunteers from surrounding areas, came under the direction of Thomas Ashe, whose instructions were to prevent British reinforcements from reaching Dublin. They fulfilled that task heroically that week.On the Tuesday,  Volunteers were sent into the GPO in response to a request from the Commander-in-chief, James Connolly. On reaching the GPO, the group was split up. Six men became the tunnelling unit around the GPO - `the engineering corps - while the others under Richard were instructed to reinforce the garrison under Sean Heuston in the Mendicity Institute. Connollys parting words to them did not augur well for their mission: ``I dont think you will all get there, but get as far as you can.They got as far as the Mendicity Institute unscathed. A Volunteer at one of the barricades they passed through said of them: ``In the midst of the firing, men approached up Church Street towards our barricade. When they reached it, they passed briskly towards their objective - whatever it might have been. They were dressed and, I thought looked, like countrymen... I could not but admire very much they way they went into action.At the Mendicity Institute, the garrison was under severe pressure, with the British attack coming virtually from all directions. By Thursday, things were hopeless and Sean Heuston was forced to surrender to a much larger British force.They, similar to the other captured Volunteers, were corralled at the Rotunda Hospital for identication purposes. They were then court-martialled and sentenced. Richard was sentenced to death, though this was commuted to three years penal servitude.The sentenced prisoners were transported to Dartmoor Jail in England first and then ided up. Richard was sent to Lewis Jail in Kent. When they were released after a very successful campaign in Ireland and abroad for their freedom, each Volunteer was granted £ from the National Aid Fund in America to help them rebuild their lives. They all pooled their money and began the New Ireland Friendly Society, with Richard as a director and a trustee with a superintendents wage.Like many of the other released prisoners in June , Volunteer Richard Coleman of Swords travelled to Clare to help Sinn Féin and the Irish Volunteers in their efforts to get Eamonn de Valera elected in the by-election.While there he addressed the first unormed parade of Irish Volunteers to be held since . For this, he was arrested and jailed for six months. While in Mountjoy Jail, he and the other prisoners went on hunger-strike, led by Thomas Ashe. Ashes death led to such a public outcry that the remaining prisoners were first moved to Cork Jail and then Dundalk Jail before being finally released.Richard was not to remain `at large for long and he was again arrested, along with many of the other republican leaders whod been active in rebuilding the Movement, as part of the British authorities `German Plot conspiracy.The prisoners were assembled first in Dublin Castle on  May  and were then ided up and sent to Usk and Gloucester Jails in Britain. Conditions were harsh in the jail and attempts were made to criminalise them with the order to wear prison unorms. They resisted and at the direction of the Home Office the prison governor, Mr Young, capitulated. On their first night in Usk, the internees won the right to free association, the right to receive and send letters, to smoke and to wear their own clothes.Despite their victory, the prison regime and their confinement weakened the men and with the onset of a severe winter, many succumbed to the influenza virus which had reached epidemic proportions, killing hundreds outside the prison walls. Richard was among a group of POWs struck down by the virus - they were left in their damp and cold cells for three days after the flu struck them down. On  December, a new prison doctor, Dr. Morton took up his new duties in the prison and immediately he diagnosed that Richard had now suffering from pneumonia and he had him transferred to hospital. He died a few days later on  December .Remembering the result of Thomas Ashes inquest - that the prison authorities were culpable - no formal inquest was allowed and when Richards brother arrived he was prevented from getting an adjournment of the local inquest so as to instruct a solicitor. The local inquest heard Richards brother state that Richard was a strong healthy man at the time of his arrest, while three fellow POWs attested to the insanitary conditions in the jail and that improper nursing contributed to his death. These statements got good publicity in the Irish press and added to the campaign to get the POWs released.Richard Colemans remains were released to his brother and were taken to Dublin where they lay in state for a week in St Andrews Church, Westland Row. Over , people filed past the coffin to pay their last respects. Volunteers in unorm formed a guard of honour during that time. A public funeral procession in driving rain from Westland Row to Glasnevin was followed by over , people. Three volleys were fired over the grave in Glasnevin Cemetery by six Volunteers despite a huge police presence. The size of the crowd prevented the police from moving against the Volunteers.Volunteer Richard Colemans death in an English jail, aided Sinn Féin campaign against Britains occupation and their general election campaign which was in full swing at this stage, and two weeks later Sinn Féin won a landslide victory of parliamentary seats. A month later in January  Sinn Féin MPs met as Dáil Éireann for the first time. The escape from Usk Jailby four of Richards comrades on the same day saw that republican POWs were unbroken and unbowed by their comrades death.Volunteer Richard Coleman died of pneumonia in Usk Jail on  December ,  years ago this week.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27507  ","story":" Michael McMonagle“This proposal from Priti Patel really exposes the Brexiteer attitude to Ireland as nothing more than a colonial irritant whose rights really shouldn’t be taken into account. - Chris Hazzard MPThe proposal from a senior Tory MP that the threat of food shortages in Ireland should be used to put pressure on the Dublin government and the EU in the Brexit negotiation exposes the colonial attitude of Brexiteers, a Sinn Féin MP has said. South Down MP Chris Hazzard was speaking after senior Tory MP and former minister Priti Patel urged the British government to use the threat of food shortages which could arise from a no-deal Brexit as leverage in the Brexit negotiations. The Tory MP, who previously stepped down from her ministerial role after revelations of secret meetings with the Israeli government, asked why the threat of food shortages wasnt being \"pressed home\" during the Brexit negotiations. Her remarks have sparked outrage on social media, with comparisons to Charles Trevelyan, the notorious British civil servant known for his role during The Great Hunger. Chris Hazzard said the proposal from the Tory MP were \"crass and offensive.\" “This proposal from Priti Patel really exposes the Brexiteer attitude to Ireland as nothing more than a colonial irritant whose rights really shouldn’t be taken into account.“They know the history of the Irish famine and Britain’s role in it and the very fact that they would seek to inject that into the Brexit debate is crass and offensive.“The Tories couldn’t care less about the impact of their reckless Brexit agenda on the people and economy of Ireland.

Neither had she any misgivings about teaching young Fianna members to fight and bear arms. And she is rightly hailed a hero for taking that stand but the same people who revere her would, in a heartbeat, condemn me and others like me, and would pour scorn on those women on our republican role of honour, and claim that there is a dference.But I wonder could they tell me the dference between Constance Markievicz, who stated in  that:And the words of Volunteer Mairéad Farrell when she stated in :And I would love those revisionists, who laud Constance Markievicz and condemn Mairéad Farrell, to explain to me the dference between the circumstances that drove republicans in  to strike a blow against the British empire, and of republicans in  and  who took up arms to defend small communities like mine – trapped on the fringes of loyalist east Belfast, subjected to sectarian pogroms, ignored by a British government and forced into a state that neither wanted or accepted us.Marie Moore, a native of Clonard, a veteran of republican struggle and Belfast’s first Sinn Féin Deputy Mayor speaking of her le of republicanism rememberedWhere were the revisionists when thousands were being burned out of their homes when frightened mothers were dragging terried children onto buses and trains and being forced as refugees across the border, hoping for help and safety in another state that had abandoned us, and that also neither wanted nor accepted us When those who revere Constance Markievicz’s philanthropy and work among the poor of Dublin are celebrating her le, do you wonderthey ever give a thought to what she would have done had she been there when the hundreds of refugees from ‘the black north’ poured off buses with their meagre belongings in battered suitcases Do they think she would have stood idly by and did nothing I know none of us can speak for the dead none of us know what the other would have done, but we know enough about her to come to our own conclusions and I would like to think that she would have been as much a leader now as she was then.Her commitment and her legacy was an example to young women like me when I was growing up in a war-torn Belfast.

We were republicans in the mould of Markievicz. We were what we were. We are what we are. Unashamed, unrepentant republicans to this day and forever on.And no political opponent or revisionist will tell me, and all those thousands like me, that I should be ashamed of that.But the irony is, that the people who are so quick to condemn today’s republicans for taking the decisions we did, have never once considered what drove so many Irish men and women, young and old, to walk the hard roads we walked during these last  troubled years. We didn’t do for fame or fortune. We did it because it was the right thing to do.There are always reasons and circumstances behind people’s decisions and, we need as much today to consider those journeys, as we do the journeys of the men and women of . Circumstances and history shaped all of us. That’s undeniable.Throughout the decades republican women have been to the forefront of struggles in Ireland in the Suffragette movement, the Labour movements, the Gaelic League, and many other organisations – much as republican women today are deeply involved in every aspect of daily le and organisations working to better peoples’ lives.In every phase of the struggle, women have taken risks. From their involvement in the ’s border campaign, to those who broke the Falls Curfew and carried guns and ammunition out under their coats, in prams and in shopping bags. And, we know many too who lost their loved ones, and their own lives, to plastic, rubber and live bullets on active service for the IRA, and to loyalist and British State murder squads.We all know women who walked the streets wrapped in blankets, in bare feet, in rain and snow, to highlight the plight of the prisoners in the H-Blocks and Armagh who smuggled comms, love letters, and much more into and out of the prisons who marched in their hundreds to the steps of Stormont when Sinn Féin were locked out of talks, demanding their rights and representation.There are women who travelled every week, for years, to visit loved ones imprisoned in this state, in the six counties and in Britain, most times with young children in tow. The hardship of prisoners’ families is often forgotten, and imprisonment impacted on thousands upon thousands of people throughout this island, not just the prisoners themselves.Brave republican women stood as Sinn Féin candidates in the early ‘’s and ’s, when in councils throughout the six counties they were vilied and subjected to the vilest of sectarian abuse and threats of death.And I’m proud to say that the temerity of those who led the way has paid off in idends. Republican women were elected in their hundreds – councillors, MLAs, TDs, MEPs, Senators and including – dare I say it – three very proud and very capable women MPs are walking in the footsteps of the first female MP elected to sit in the British House of Commons the first abstentionist Sinn Féin MP, Countess Constance Markievicz.And still, there are people telling us today that our Sinn Féin MPs, elected by thousands of Irish citizens full in the knowledge that, like Markievicz they would not be taking seats or swearing an oath to a foreign government, should take seats in a British parliament, or better still, resign those seats and gt them to others who are more than willing to doff their caps and swear an oath to defend an English monarch. Do these people even listen to themselves These same people, who are lecturing us, will no doubt be lauding Constance Markievicz for her part in the birth of the nation, with all her history of abstentionism and of physical force republicanism.Do they genuinely not understand irony And do they think that our supporters, those who flock to the ballot boxes in their thousands toSinn Féin elected representatives, don’t aspire to the goal of Markievicz, of a democratic republic that cherishes all of the children of the nation equally Where is the equality for nationalists in the six counties  Where is the respect for the democratic mandate of thousands upon thousands of people who have yet to have their rights and entitlements respected in the British constructed and maintained sectarian six-county state  Where is the support for our democratic mandate  Where is the aspiration to cherish all of the children of the nation equally  Or do they not consider us part of that nation  They need to bear in mind that when the Proclamation was being written there was no border in Ireland – hard or soft.They also need to bear in mind that there is no single narrative to this conflict. Yes, people have been hurt, on both sides, and those who are trying to revise the history of the IRA of , are also trying to revise the history of the IRA of this phase of the struggle to present one side and one side only. As a republican woman I am proud of the rich history of Irish women that we can lay claim to, and many here today were part of that history. And I am proud and in awe of those women who lost their lives as part of that struggle.Unfortunately, throughout the decades of our troubled past people who know nothing about what we went through are writing and rewriting our history.We cannot allow the memories of our dead, the stories of nationalist and republican victims, and the history of repression and oppression that led to young people again taking up arms, in the same way Constance Markievicz and Tom Clarke and Pádraig Pearse and all those others in  took up arms, being airbrushed out of our history. And maybe one day we’ll be in a place where the circumstances that led to those decisions are acknowledged and accepted.Because, rest assured, not one of us woke up one morning and decided on a whim to take up arms, to put our lives on the line, to face imprisonment and death. There are always reasons why people make the decisions they do but some people just refuse to see or accept that.We know those reasons and we need no lectures from people who have not walked in our shoes. is something we should all aspire to.We have a duty to future generations to ensure that our revolution isn’t rewritten. We need to make sure that our young people know why and where our history of struggle comes from to remind, educate and to see that it never happens again to ensure that young women continue to be inspired by Constance Markievicz, by her bravery, her philanthropy and her work for those less well off. But we also need to ensure that the circumstances that led to her and future republican women seeing the need to take up arms, never happens again.test"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.ballymenatimes.com/webimage/1.8737398.1544617405!/image/image.jpg","title":"ian paisley luxury maldives holiday paid for by mystery friend","story":"The trip, which the DUP MP said he partially paid for, was part-funded by a mystery friend who Mr Paisley declined to identy.Ian Paisley, M.P.The holiday for the entire Paisley family was not registered in the House of Commons register of membersrsquo interests.The revelations in a BBC Spotlight programme broadcast on Tuesday night come just a fortnight after the North Antrim MP ed from the longest ever suspension from the House of Commons.That suspension of  sitting days came after it was revealed that he took luxury holidays from the Sri Lankan government and then advocated on behalf of a regime which was facing allegations of war crimes.Mr Paisley told Spotlight that he did not need to declare the foreign holiday and that the trip had not been paid for by the Malian government.The MP, his we and his two sons stayed full-board for five days in October and November  at a luxury resort on one of the coral islands in the Indian Ocean famed for sandy beaches and blue lagoons.Gavin Millar QC, a legal expert on parliamentary rules, told Spotlight that the Nolan principles on standards in public le placed an onus on Mr Paisley to be transparent about why he has not registered the trip.ldquoFor the record, the government of the Males did not organise or pay for my family vacation in , which I do not intend to go into with you.

AndEamonn Higgins of Hot Milk Forge has his way, the skills of yesteryear will be passed down to future generations - thanks in part to global TV hit ‘Game of Thrones’ with its sword and sorcery primetime magic. Hot Milk Forge is a Blacksmithing and Bladesmithing School based on the Lisnamanny Road in Ballymena.It runs evening, weekend and day classes in Basic to Advanced Artist Blacksmithing and Bladesmithing and people have been travelling to the courses from all over the world.Speaking to the Ballymena , Eamonn said he loves teaching his craft to keen and intrigued novices.I have been a professional artist and sculptor since .For  years Blacksmithing has formed an integral part of my practice with public works scattered across the UK and commercial works collected internationally, Eamonn explained.However I love taking the courses and teaching people a new skill, something they wouldnt ever experience.The -year-old said he recently had a lady travel all the way from Kerry to make her own unique creations.This woman drove a long way to do the course and she made a number of intricate brooches and pieces of art that she can treasure.I have many people that sign up to the course who are big fans of Game of Thrones and TV shows like that but a lot of people just want to try something dferent, Eamonn said.At the minute we are making mostly knives which seems to be the trendy item at the minute.“This has probably come from the huge interest in Game of Thrones.”Eamonn has been approached by the HBO series to make specic items for the show and has had many of the actors who appeared on the show taking his courses.Hot Milk Forge offers evening and Weekend Classes in Blacksmithing with an artistic twist. Evening classes are open to everyone above the age of . Participants are encouraged to learn the traditional skills not just because the celebration of wrought iron work is a worthy idea but also because only blacksmithing can introduce you to the full potential of steel as a creative medium. At the forge they weld with a fire and not with electricity. Imagine making your own fire side set, wrought iron gate, gts for your partner, sculpture, the list goes on.FAMILY FARMHot Milk Forge is located on Eamonns family farm and the workshop is where the first milking parlour was located many moons ago. His childhood years growing up surrounded by natural beauty of the nearby Antrim Hills continue to influence his work which often looks primeval, resembling the misshapen bodies of humans and animals miraculously preserved in Irish bogs for thousands of years. I try to give my work a certain austerity, a terrible beauty that is timeless and that can be associated with Irish art through the millennia. “As I come from a rural background, the landscape and its people speak more to me than some of the more conceptual art in vogue. “As a child I grew up playing in mud in haystacks and running about the fields. “I absorbed all of this subconsciously and it comes out in my work.”Eamonn has been demonstrating and teaching blacksmithing as part of his Public Art practice as long as he has been blacksmithing.In  on completion of a two year artist residency in the University of Ulster Eamonn decided it was time his blacksmithing classes had a permanent home Hot Milk Forge was born.

My sacrice and dedication went to motorcycling and I’m very proud to be a Doctor of Letters because of that.“It’s a lelong sacrice. Since I was six-years-old I’ve travelled theand breadth of the UK racing. The injuries I’ve faced, the ups and downs, to actually win a world championship on top of all that is massive.“It’s nice that my family can see there was an endgame after all their sacrice in the beginning.Jonathan Rea shows off his new threads“It’s a very proud day for the whole family. Especially my two little boys , they realise that it’s not normal to be at an event like this. They know the ious race tracks inside out but this is dferent. I hope I can be a good role model for them.”The -year-old said it was the first time he had ever attended a graduation, adding: “I never imagined the first one would be my own.”Asked about his graduate attire for the ceremony, he said: “Of course I feel a lot more comfortable in leathers and a helmet but it’s really nice to be acknowledged outside the sport. It’s something that’s happening more and more recently.”The honorary degree follows the  award of an MBE on the New Year’s Honours list. Rea also finished runner up in the  BBC Sports Personality of the Year.

Jonathan Reas specially made suit for the ceremony“My grades at GCSE were A*s, As and Bs, but unfortunately I didn’t further that. I went travelling the world racing bikes.“After I left school I went to technical college and got an HNC in manufacturing engineering and then went on to work as an engineer.“It was hard to hold down a job as I was taking too much time off work to go racing.“I had what was nearly a career-ending injury. That was a dark time in my le because I didn’t know what was coming, I’d no great qualications behind me, I was working a minimum wage job. I wasn’t in a great state of mind.“I threw myself at bikes for a few years and then it worked out, my big break came.”He added: “Northern Ireland fans are very important to me. The travelling support has been immense these last few years. It just keeps getting bigger and bigger.“On my sighting laps and slow down laps I can see the Northern Ireland fans. I always try to throw out a leg to acknowledge I’ve seen them.”Rea is often claimed by both Larne and Ballyclare and sometimes referred to as a son of Ballymena. Asked where he came from, he said: “I’m a country boy. I grew up in Kilwaughter, then moved to Ballyboley. We were part of Larne Council with a Ballymena area code and a Ballyclare postcode.

A recent survey of RCGP NImembers found that % of GPs surveyed are concerned their increased workload during the winter months will negatively affect their ability to deliver patient care. The college’s Patient Group is reminding people about the important ‘ Before GP’ message. Karen Mooney, chair, said: “This winter, we know that our GP practices are going to be under immense strain, and we can do our bit to help support our health service. Think about what you really need think  Before GP. “Can you care for yourself and manage minor ailments at home  Can you find the advice you need using safe and reputable online resources such as the NI Direct Stay Well website  Can you seek advice from your community pharmacist “We all have a responsibility to help protect our health services and to make sure that those who are the most ill and vulnerable in our society are able to access the care that they need.”Dr Grainne Doran, RCGPNI chair, said: “GPs strive to provide the very best care to all of our patients. Over the winter period, there is no doubt that our workload hugely increases. “For more minor conditions such as coughs and colds, patients can get great advice and over the counter medicines from local pharmacies.

For after much soul searching and deliberating, Christina has decided to take her love for her community on to the next level by becoming a Sinn Féin City Hall rep. Christina has been co-opted on to Belfast City Council in place of the outgoing Councillor Mary McConville, who has stepped down for health reasons.“I’ve been involved in community work for twenty-three years now. One of my earliest memories is of me at five years old walking down the Grosvenor holding a sign that said, ‘We want heat not cold feet’ – my mummy had me involved in community work from no age, it’s in my blood,” Christina told the Andersonstown News, smiling at the memory.“I attended my first Belfast City Council meeting at the beginning of December. I was a bit nervous speaking, but I got through it. It was very interesting watching the dynamics of the Council.”Christina identied some of the issues that pushed her over the line when it came to making the decision to enter City Hall.“There are local issues that I want to make an impact on. I have given this a lot of thought and I discussed it with my husband before I made my decision, we both agreed that it’s the right path for me, I feel that it is a natural progression.“I want to make a dference and I want to carry on the good work of Mary McConville. I live in this area so I am well aware of the local issues and I find them as much a challenge as everyone .“I believe you should feel safe in your area, you should feel happy, you should benefit from generated investment. There are huge developments happening in the city centre, these should be impacting the areas around it to a greater extent, and I feel I can represent people fully in that respect.”Christina’s much-missed mother Belle was a renowned voluntary community worker –chairperson of the Roden Street Development Group at Grosvenor Community Centre.“My mother taught me that community is everything, she also taught me that a community worker is never off duty. She never feared going the extra mile to ensure that people got what they deserved.“I have been described as being parochial, which I don’t think is true, I am very open minded in my thinking. But I would agree I am there to represent local voters, so to a certain extent I must be parochial to genuinely bring that local voice forward.”Christina continued: “I’m the kind of person who works hard, but my mother, well, she worked tirelessly.Her door never stopped, people always turned to her.She gave everything andI can be half the woman she was I will be happy. I’m going to have to learn to manage my work-le balance, though.“Since my mummy passed away I have tried to continue her good work, she showed me the ropes and I think she would be delighted to see me take on this role. At the end of the day I work for this community and I promise to do all I can to ensure the people get what they are entitled to.“There’s a gap between the Grosvenor Road and the city centre that is crying out for investment. The Belfast Transport Hub is going in, which I believe will generate employment. I would love for our young people to be in a position to become engineers and the like. I would love to find a way to get them that training to elevate them to those amazing employment opportunities.“I really want better for our people, I am so proud of being from Roden Street and I will never leave the Grosvenor Community Centre, it’s been too many people’s le’s work. I want to do my Council work to the best of my abilities in my own time.“I’m going to try my hardest to do the best job possible for the people of this area and beyond.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"new report lays out bright future for west belfast","story":"A NEW report detailing the positive transformation that has taken place in West Belfast in recent years will be launched on tomorrow morning . ‘Vision : Transforming West Belfast’ will look to the future as well as outlining projects such as the James Connolly Interpretive Centre, Casement Park and the Roddy McCorley Society interactive museum and visitor centre.The report has been commissioned by Fáilte Feirste Thiar and the West Belfast Partnership Board and will highlight the amount of investment that has gone into the West of the city.Projects in the spotlight in the report include:•£m from Belfast City Council for the new Andersonstown Leisure Centre•m from the Department for Communities and Ciste for Áras na BhFál• £m for the Balmoral Hotel•£.m for the Blackmountain Shared Space Project•£m investment for Brook Leisure Centre•£m for the Falls Park City Cemetery MasterplanIn total, the report will list  projects in West Belfast that have benefited from investment.Speaking to the Andersonstown News ahead of the launch, Harry Connolly, Executive Director of Fáilte Feirste Thiar, said: “In recent years West Belfast has began to secure increased amounts of public sector investment.“Research undertaken for this publication has uncovered that this combined investment totals over £ million – a signicant figure.“Many people involved in our local private, public and community sectors will not be fully aware of the huge amount of work involved nor the scale of the investment secured.

He’s now been issued with a summons and was due to appear in court on Wednesday morning – but the hearing was adjourned for the second time.Speaking to the Andersonstown News, a gobsmacked Seamus said: “I’ve kept horses all my le, they are beautul creatures. I am in poor health and looking after these horses brings me a real sense of joy.”Seamus lives with COPD, is diabetic and has suffered multiple heart attacks.He continued: “I was giving bread to the horses, minding my own business, and these two characters approached me and demanded I stopped. This field belongs to my friend and I have permission to feed these horses. What harm was I doing  I don’t need the stress and strain of this.”Seamus described the encounter that led to the series of events that has left him baffled and angry.“I pulled my car up that morning and walked over to feed the horses, these two fellas shouted over at me and told me to stop. I told them to take themselves off, they said they were ringing the peelers and I told them to get whoever they wanted. One of the men said the birds were lting the bread I was feeding the horses and dropping it in his garden, absolute nonsense. I got into my car and drove off. Your man must have taken my car registration because I received a fixed penalty notice in the post.”Seamus added: “I turned up to court on the arranged date and the complainant never bothered turning up. I showed up again on Tuesday and the same thing, he never weighed in again. NowI didn’t bother turning up I’m sure they’d have something to say about that. This is a complete and utter waste of Belfast City Council time and money and I am urging them to drop it.”Local People Before Profit Councillor Matt Collins said: “This whole situation is ridiculous, whoever made the decision to issue a court summons to Seamus perhaps needs a basic crash course in what constitutes illegal or criminal behaviour. This summons should be withdrawn and Belfast City Council should apologise to Seamus immediately.“It’s also worth saying that Seamus is taking this in his stride and isn’t backing down – and fair play to him for that. But other people would likely be intimidated by this. Nobody wants brought up in front of a court and especially for something so absurd. I’d imagine the vast majority of people would agree with me that Belfast City Council and the powers-that-be in this city ought to put their time and energy into something more productive, instead of hauling a pensioner up in front of a court for feeding horses.”A spokesperson for Belfast City Council said that as this is an ongoing matter they would not be making any comment."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"the fureys uniting generations through music","story":"DESPITE its relatively small population, ours has never been a country with a shortage of musicians on the international stage, but few of them have had an impact as lasting as The Fureys.Formed in the , the iconic folk group has entertained audiences throughout the world for  years. While the band’s line-up has inevitably changed over the years, brothers George and Eddie Furey have continued to tour the globe, bringing the finest ballads to generations old and new.To celebrate their th anniversary they have released a new album, ‘The Fureys  Years On… to be continued’, and will play a headline gig at Belfast’s Waterfront this January.Ahead of the gig, the Andersonstown News met with George and Eddie, who had just ed from the Netherlands leg of their jubilee tour. While their music has touched thousands,not millions of people, George and Eddie are a pair without air and graces. Our chat was an informal one that took place in the Waterfront Hall’s lobby, with school kids, excited by their trip to the panto, providing an excitable background hum. As for the story of The Fureys – it’s one of famous faces, infamous sessions, and more years worth of craic than can be adequately depicted in a single newspaper article. However, with the release of their new album – which foregoes many of the obvious tracks and is jammed full of new material – our conversation almost immediately turned to things more current.“A lot of the songs we would’ve heard as kids and would’ve grown up singing them,” Eddie explained.“Streets of London is one of them, which was written by Ralph McTell, and we know Ralph going back many, many years.”George added: “The first track on the album was written by a Donegal man, Jordy Gallagher, and he wrote the song about eight years ago. “Joe, our manager knows him very well and he gave our manager the song to have a listen to because he thought it might suit on the album because it’s a protest song. A lot of those songs from years ago are all protest songs, from the s.“We grew up with all these protest years ago. There was a great song years ago called The Eve of Destruction, and it’s about what would happen to ussomeone dropped the big bomb – we grew up with those songs. So this song really suits the album.”“The Day’s Gonna come is a great song,” Eddie concurred. “The song tells you what’s happening to the world and those older songs tell you what was happening at that time. The words are ‘the day is gonna come when the water runs out and the wells run try, man’s so dumb, fish can’t swim and birds can’t fly’.”He continued: “There’s also peace songs, love songs, and drinking songs. “We’ve sang an awful lot of love songs over the years too. Songs that our mother used to sing and our father used to sing, Sweet Sixteen and that sort of stuff.”Although it’s an anniversary album, the new CD is new territory for The Fureys, who had not previously recorded much of its material. But much like their previous albums, The Fureys have continued to record songs from some of world’s best songwriters.“The songs are mostly from people we’ve met over the years on our tours,” Eddie said.“We’ve sang a lot of great ballads over the years.“We even recorded an album of Charlie Chaplin songs. Josie, Charlie Chaplin’s second youngest daughter, was cleaning out her father’s house and she found five songs that were never recorded before, written by Charlie Chaplin, and she asked uswe would do the songs. We had to do them, and we had to do them with an orchestra. We had a -piece orchestra in the studio with us recording these great songs.”George added: “We do a mix of stuff – not just Irish songs. If you listen to some of the bands now they’re going back on the old stuff. To me, you can’t beat the real thing.”Unlike some older musicians and music fans, The Fureys are not consumed with thoughts of past ‘glory days’. On the contrary, George admits that music is “probably more versatile now”. Instead the past only serves to make their current concerts more fulfilling as they bring together people who have followed them through the generations.“A lot of the kids that come to see us now, their grandparents or parents would’ve come to our concerts and bought our albums,” George said. “Now we have kids coming to concerts with their grandma and grandpa.”Eddie noted: “People grew up with our stuff and they love to see it live.”The Fureys have united generations and their music has been played everywhere from their hometown in Dublin to the International Space Station – where astronaut Chris Hadfield famously played their track ‘Steal Away’ – but of all other places outside of their hometown, it’s in Belfast where they feel most at home.“We’ve been up here so many times it’s like our second home,” George insisted.“We used to play in the Ulster Hall before this was built. We used to bring the wives up to do the Christmas shopping, because it was cheaper up here. Then we’d smuggle it across the border. If you got caught at customs they’d take it off you – drink and everything – party time. We had some parties like.”He continued: “This is our tenth gig here, which I never knew until this morning. It was only opened up when we first played here. They know what to expect – people are used to coming to see us. They always ask for some of the old songs, and we have to do them. People will ask for some dferent songs too, and we can do them no problem.”Eddie added: “We’ll be singing some songs off the new album too. You have to add them in here and there. If a request comes up for an old song we like to keep people happy.”The Furey’s play at the Waterfront Hall on January , .

Were all going to break our hearts over the decision to close, but unfortunately the shutters must come down.\"Club chairman Jim McLarenand trustee and committee member Ed Boyleboth agreed that it would be terribly sad to say a final farewell to the club and its members on December .\"Were hoping that it will be kept as a sports bar and then we will still use it,\" Jim said.\"Otherwise, well probably see other again at funerals and things like that,\" Ed added."},{"url":null,"title":"arlene foster calls on pm to stand up to eu over backstop as member states veto change","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The party believes the measure would create an economic border between Northern Ireland and Great Britain.Responding to the EUs refusal to countenance changes to the withdrawal deal and Mrs Mays failure to secure legal guarantees that the backstop would only ever be temporary, Mrs Foster said: \"The Prime Minister has promised to get legally binding changes. The reaction by the EU is unsurprising.

They are contained in the conclusions of yesterday evening.“That is our position. That is what we have put on the table. And now we expect Great Britain to respond.”Belgium’s PM Charles Michel said: “The ball is now politically in the British court.”And Mr Tusk said he had “no mandate” to organise any further negotiations.Mrs May’s hopes of a legally binding commitment on the backstop from the EU were dashed on Thursday, when Mr Juncker said there could be “no real changes” to the Withdrawal Agreement negotiated over  months.It seems that the Prime Minister has failed in her bid to deliver meaningful changes to her Brexit deal. We cannot go on like this. The Prime Minister should reinstate the vote on her deal next week and let Parliament take back control.— Keir StarmerDecember , The Prime Minister addressed the EU leaders on Thursday about MPs’ concerns  about the backstop which had prevented her getting her Brexit deal through Parliament this week.Mr Tusk said the leaders had expressed a “firm determination” to work “speedily” to ensure there is an agreement on the future relationship in place by the time the transition period ends in December , so the backstop is not needed.But Mr Juncker criticised Britain’s lack of clarity over what it was seeking from the future relationship.“Our UK friends need to say what they want, instead of asking us to say what we want,” he said.“So we would like, within a few weeks, our UK friends to set out their expectations for us because this debate is sometimes nebulous and imprecise and I would like clarications.”\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker embraces council president Donald Tusk at the Brussels summit The EU hardball approach appears to leave Mrs May with limited room for manoeuvre during the countdown to the UK’s departure on March .The Prime Minister told the summit that a package of assurances around the backstop could “change the dynamic” at Westminster.At the same time, she made clear a failure by EU leaders to offer concessions risked the collapse of the whole agreement, with the UK leaving in March in a disorderly, no-deal Brexit.Mrs May managed a smile at her press conference when a reporter askedshe had had a “trying week”, jokingly replying: “Has something happened this week ”When asked whether the problems with her party at home and dealing with the EU had made her want to quit as leader, she said it is “our duty as a Government and as a Parliament” to see Brexit through.WATCH LIVE: PM @Theresa_May holds a press conference following EU Council https:t.co irtqNcSv— UK Prime MinisterDecember , She added: “I never said it was going to be easy.“Negotiations like this are always tough. There are always dficult times and as you get closer to the very end, that can get even more dficult because you are sorting out the last details of something.”Opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn said Mrs May’s plan was “dead in the water” after she “utterly failed in her attempts to deliver any meaningful changes”, and reiterated Labour’s call for it to be put to a vote before Christmas.PM @Theresa_May has met leaders including @donaldtusk and @Xavier_Bettel at @EUCouncil today and discussed what is needed to get the Brexit deal over the line pic WMInAvAJkj— UK Prime MinisterDecember , Cabinet Office Minister David Lidington rejected that idea and defended Mrs May’s handling of the talks, telling Today: “Anybody who has heard Theresa May in debate, anybody who has heard her around the Cabinet table, knows there is a very clear plan.”He described the talks as “a welcome first step that was the removal of uncertainty” over the EU’s intentions, because it has shown it wants a “speedy UK trade deal” that would remove the need for the backstop in the first place."},{"url":null,"title":"mays postbrexit trade deal suggestion dismissed by taoiseach","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

This is one of our major fundraisers, so it’s very important. I’m just happy I’m well enough to be here.”She added: “I got clearance from the consultant yesterday he doesn’t need to see me again, so I’m firing on all cylinders and ready for the New Year and getting this million together before July.”Mary’s Race to a Million project, which has already raised two thirds of its target, was launched two years ago to invest enough money to ensure funding for our future sporting champions.The first lady of Northern Ireland sport over five decades said she was delighted with the money amassed so far and said she was touched by the letters and cards she received following her illness.“Everyone has been so helpful in getting me back on my feet again, with all their support,” she said, adding that she has been “given a -year extension” thanks to the surgery.Through her tireless work on her project to secure the future of the trust to aid future generations of young sportsmen and women, the -year-old is undeniably a role model — an accolade she accepts with grace.“I feel very privileged that I can help people realise their dreams, because I didn’t have that kind of support,” Dame Mary added.“AndI can make it easier for them to achieve their dreams then we can get so much joy out of seeing them travelling all over the world as our ambassadors.”Film and TV actor James Nesbitt, yesterday’s compere, said he attends the event every year in honour of his host, whom he described as “the most inspirational person I’ve ever met”.“She is an astonishing woman,” the Cold Feet star said, joking that “when Mary asks you to do something you can’t say no.”He added: “More than any other sporting legend, Mary has been the real beacon, the one person who transcended all sectarian barriers when Northern Ireland was at its worst.“And here she is on the eve of her th birthday, recovering from surgery, looking incredible and continuing to raise money and light a pathway for young and future sporting stars.”He added: “History will show that Mary Peters is the very living notion of why sport matters to everyone.”Former Ulster and Irish Rugby international Paddy Wallace, who was there with his partner Sarah Moore, said it was his third time at the fundraiser.“It’s always good to come and catch up with friends and team mates and to support Mary, who’s such a great ambassador for our wee country,” he said.“She epitomises everything that’s great about Belfast, Northern Ireland and sport. We’ve always punched above our weight and we must continue to ensure we do that.” Gymnast and Commonwealth Games gold medallist Rhys McClenaghan said he was there “to support Mary Peters because she has done so much for me”. He added: “She helped get me onto programmes and that has helped me get to where I am today.”Paralympic gold medallist Michael McKillop said he considered the Munich Olympics pentathlon gold medallist “a friend as much as a fellow athlete”.“I can’t describe how highly I think of her,” he said.“The Mary Peters Trust has supported me over the years, and not just with money. Mary has been a mentor and a friend. She was invited to my wedding in November, that’s how close we are.”Golfer Michael Hoey, who was attending the festive dinner for the first time yesterday, said he was “happy to be here”.“My dad Brian had open heart surgery around the same time as Mary and I’m pleased that they’re both doing so well now,” he added.Ireland hockey team World Cup silver medallists Shirley McCay, Lizzie Colvin and Zoe Wilson were there, as was Northern Ireland football manager Michael O’Neill. And North West  Superbike winner Glenn Irwin made sure he didn’t miss the event after his flight was cancelled from Southampton. He hopped in a taxi to Birmingham and caught another flight to the special occasion."},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37625117.ece/6911a/AUTOCROP/w620h342/policeback.jpg","title":"northern ireland woman rang 999 for moth in","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

He said: \"Ive been made even more proud than before,thats possible, by hearing that.\"Mr Brooker, whose le Laura had saved after he suffered a stroke shortly before her  wedding, said his only daughters nuptials were \"one of the proudest days of my le\".\"It was made particularly so by her le-saving actions on me four-and-a-half months earlier, which allowed me to be there to walk her down the aisle,\" he continued. \"Those that have seen her over the past couple of days would have seen that the dress still fits - she would have been so, so chuffed.\"She was the proudest mum on the planet when Lorcan was born on December , .\"The challenge that was presented when Lorcan was diagnosed with cerebral palsy was signicant, and showed Laura as being the most loving, supportive, proactive, understanding, and also demanding when necessary, mum Ive known.\"Her undying love and commitment to Lorcans development has been commented on by so, so many people.\"Mr Brooker said that \"sometimes in le things happen that are just not right, with absolutely no room for debate, and saying goodbye to your daughter is certainly one of them\".\"My darling Laura, mum and I are missing you so, so much already, which I know will last forever,\" he added. \"I would swap places with you in a heartbeat, but sadly I cannot.\" Mr Brooker was given a round of applause after he finished his tribute with another moving poem.Lauras health service colleagues then filed outside, where they lined the route as Keelan, Mr Brooker and Lauras loved ones carried her coffin before she was taken to her final resting place in Sixmile Cemetery.A fundraising page set up in Lauras memory to benefit Antrim Area Hospital intensive care unit and childrens charity The Buddy Bear Trust, which supports Lorcan and other children with cerebral palsy and motor disorders, has already raised more than £,.To donate, visit www.justgiving crowdfunding laura-burns."},{"url":null,"title":"tories urge may to oust karen bradley in bid to win back dup","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

But Theresa May is well aware that there is zero respect among unionists for Karen Bradley. She is here because she is the Prime Ministers friend and will always be loyal to her. There should be more to holding the job than that.\"I dont think anybody could point to a single signicant thing that Karen Bradley has said or done in the year since shes been here. She is totally out of her depth.\"Another DUP source said: \"Karen Bradley hasnt handled things well. Relations between the DUP and the Secretary of State are at an all-time low.\"The party has serious concerns about the Secretary of State briefing against it at Westminster and locally.\"Northern Ireland Office sources last night strongly denied this was the case.\"It is categorically untrue that Karen Bradley ever has or ever would brief against the DUP,\" a source said.The DUP insider said that some Tory backbenchers believed Mrs Bradley was an impediment to a \"constructive relationship\" being rebuilt with Arlene Fosters party.The source said: \"Some of her colleagues at Westminster see Karen Bradley as an obstacle to restoring the good working relationship that the Prime Minister pledged to the  Committee.\"As Secretary of State, Mrs Bradley is not responsible for her partys confidence and supply agreement with the DUP and must be balanced in her dealings with all parties.The Belfastunderstands that the possibility of previous Secretary of State James Brokenshire ing to Northern Ireland was raised in London but such a move was ruled out. Mrs Bradleys approach on legacy issues has made her enemies among right-wing backbench MPs. Mrs Bradley was appointed just  months ago amid hopes she would take a more proactive role in restoring devolution than her predecessor.However, the Secretary of State has drawn criticism from across the political ide for failing to take decisions.She was ridiculed for admitting in an interview with House magazine - a weekly Westminster publication - in the summer that she hadnt previously realised elections here were contested along sectarian lines. \"I freely admit that when I started this job, I didnt understand some of the deep-seated and deep-rooted issues that there are in Northern Ireland,\" she said.\"I didnt understand things like when elections are fought, for example, in Northern Ireland - people who are nationalists dont vote for unionist parties and vice versa.\"So, the parties fight for election within their own community.\"Actually, the unionist parties fight the elections against each other in unionist communities and nationalists in nationalist communities.\"Thats a very dferent world from the world I came from,\" Mrs Bradley said."},{"url":null,"title":"we didnt spend 30 years stopping ira to allow pm and eu to give united ireland by back door says labour mp","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Mrs Hoey has campaigned strongly for Brexit, despite her constituency voting overwhelmingly to Remain in the EU.The Labour MP was heavily criticised in February when she said that the Good Friday Agreement was \"unsustainable\".Speaking at the Leave Means Leave rally Mrs Hoey said she was \"very proud to be pro-union\".\"We didnt spend  years in Northern Ireland stopping IRA terrorists killing soldiers, police, and civilians, in order to get a United Ireland to allow a few jumped-up EU bureaucrats and a complicit prime minister to try and do the same thing by the back door,\" she said.\"Even more ridiculous is that it would not even be in the economic interests of Northern Ireland who depend so much of their trade, to and from Britain. Why is a British Prime Minister dancing to the tune of an Irish Taoiseach  Theres no need for a hard border and theres no need for a backstop.\"Northern Ireland comedian Patrick Kielty, an outspoken critic of Brexit, reacted angrily to Mrs Hoeys comments.Sammy Wilson at the rally\"She’s right. We didn’t. We’ve spent  years building peace in Northern Ireland. Then seen a United Ireland become more possible thanks to a few jumped up Brexiteers who say they’re actually Unionists,\" he wrote on Twitter.\"You couldn’t make it up .\"Speaking at the rally East Antrim MP Sammy Wilson said that the DUP did not want \"assurances\" on Prime Minister Theresa Mays Brexit withdrawal deal.Mr Wilson said that that they did not want Mrs Mays deal \"full stop\".The DUP is unhappy that the deal will see Northern Ireland aligned with EU rules and remain part of the single market with checks on some goods coming in from the UK to Northern Ireland,the Brexit backstop is implemented.“It was thought we ten DUP MPs could make or break this deal. We have become an irrelevancy. Because there are that many MPs against it we might as well sit at home,\" Mr Wilson said.Former UKIP boss Nigel Farage told the rally that he felt a second referendum was now inevitable and urged people to vote Leave in even greater numbers so there could be no doubting the will of the UK to leave the EU.

The latest battery-only cars need just five minutes at the quickest chargepoints to add  miles to their range, compared with an hour for almost all plug-in hybrids to achieve the same benefit. Battery-only cars have no combustion engine, while plug-in hybrids can operate in full electric mode, using conventional fuel or a combination of both.

She said: “If people are presented with really terrible weather they then have the choice to shop online, and they can make other choices about what to do with their time.“That unfortunately offers them sometimes better alternatives than trailing around a town centre or a high street in freezing cold or rainy weather.”Ms Wehrle said while footfall appeared to have picked up for the early part of the week – with a year-on-year increase of .% in high streets, shopping centres and retail parks – it was a  positive as snow last year meant figures were already low.She said Saturday’s figures were “severely down” on last year, on what she described as a “peak trading weekend”.Many shoppers may not venture out next weekend as it is so close to Christmas Day, she added, saying they could have already travelled to wherever they are spending the holidays, and may feel discouraged by unfavourable weather forecasts.We have come to expect discounts. By the time we get to Christmas weve seen % off, weve seen % off, weve had Black Friday.Diane Wehrle, SpringboardFacebookTwitterPredicting a dficult week ahead, she added that retailers will have been hoping for a last festive lt after what has been a dficult year.Figures in September showed the UK to be suffering its worst year on record as in-store sales declined for the eighth month in a row.The bargain bonanza of Black Friday last month also disappointed, with data showing the biggest drop in footfall for that week in three years.She said: “It’s unfortunate that the weather has come in. I think all retailers are finding it really tough, even the ones that are most resilient are finding it tough. And this is not what they need. This is really poor.”She added that the trend now to discount items before Christmas and having sometimes all-year-round sales affects buyers’ attitudes towards price drops.“We have come to expect discounts,” she said. By the time we get to Christmas we’ve seen % off, we’ve seen % off, we’ve had Black Friday.”Rachel Lund, head of insights and analytics at the British Retail Consortium, presented a more positive picture, suggesting shoppers may still turn out for the final few days before December .She said: “While we have seen a slow start to the Christmas period, changing technology and shopping habits means that many consumers will be leaving their shopping to the last week before Christmas – historically the most important for retailers.“Nonetheless, given the challenging year on the high street, retailers will be hoping for strong sales this weekend and next as consumers buy both food and presents before Christmas Day.”"},{"url":null,"title":"arsenal fans cant get enough of this young fans reaction to meeting mesut ozil","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

He is also a member of Victoria Park and Tower Hamlets AC which won the South of England Athletic Association Fell Running Championships on the Isle of Wight in September, with Aaron winning the inidual title. These championships comprise three races in two days, with the first two races on Saturday and the third and longest, on Sunday.The races are not by any means easy inidually, or collectively, the first being .k, but with an ascent of  metres, the second k with an ascent of  metres and the third, on the following day, k with a m ascent.Aaron was first and second respectively in the first two of the races and he calculated that he could win overallhe finished in fourth place in the third race on Sunday morning.His eventual third place left him overall winner and as he said afterwards: ldquoIt was a beautul setting and some very hard racing, good mental preparation for the XC season coming up. How prophetic that was.To further emphasise his versatility, he ran the Amsterdam Half Marathon on October  and came home in ninth place, posting a superb .. which would have placed him fourth in the recent Belfast Half and sixth in the Waterside Half in Derry, so, he is a top quality runner over all terrains.Juniors at CookstownLauren Madine was the only female from the club juniors to take part in and duly won the U- girlsrsquo race at the Cookstown venue and ever-dependable Mackenzie Murray was the only boy from the club in the U- boysrsquo race, and while he found the going tough, hersquos learning by the week and I am confident that hersquoll develop into a top class runnerFirst points for ladiesEast Down ladies were much better represented than the men as they fielded a team of six and were more than pleased to place fth overall and to register their first place points of the current league campaign.The team scorers were Catherine OrsquoConnor , Niamh Kellett , Deirdre Weatheralland Clare Carsongiving a total of  points. Asto emphasise the importance of overtaking everyone possible, right to the very end, that total was matched by Acorns AC, but because their fourth scorer had finished higher than the East Down fourth-paced runner, Acorns get the better team position.In truth, the third-placed team had only six points less than either Acorns or EDAC, so with a few extra places it could so easily have been third place.

We just set about formalising a programme in earnest back in .ldquoOur programme works so well it is held up as a model for other schools across Northern Ireland to learn from and to embed its principles into their schools.Mr Moore says there is a fundamental dference between shared education and integration.ldquoThe main dference is that each school can hold on to their faith and culture but still be able to reach out in other aspects of the curriculum.ldquoOur parent teacher associations, for example, have been working together for some time. And on other levels we pull our resources too.Mr Moorersquos views were echoed by Mr Paul Coulter, his counterpart at St Patrickrsquos, who said the idea for shared education came from parents at both schools.Mr Coulter said that demand had grown over the years and that the schools were pulling their resources to fund shared experiences, such as educational trips.ldquoWhen you talk to the children you will see that they are really excited about coming together. Many strong friendships have been formed.Mrs Helen McEvoy, Shared Education co-ordinator at St Patrickrsquos, says the programme has given children the opportunity to come together and take part in learning together.She added: ldquoThe vision for the programme is to enhance the learning of all pupils in an environment where there is equal opportunity, good relations and mutual respect fostered, while at the same time acknowledging dferences and celebrating them.The Recorder met children from both schools last Thursday morning when they busy designing a new logo for their Shared Education Programme.Ten year-old Mya McCurry, who attends St Patrickrsquos Primary School, said she wasnrsquot able to see any dferences between pupils and teachers at both schools.ldquoWe started doing this programme when I was in P, she remarked. ldquoI am in P now. Itrsquos really fun and I look forward to having my friends from Ballynahinch Primary School coming here or visiting them at their school.ldquoTo be honest we were friends before we began getting together in school. I would have played with them on our street sometimes. Now we get together in school too and its terric fun.Leon Rose, a P pupil at Ballynahinch Primary School, revealed that taking part in the Shared Education Programme has helped him become less shy.He said: ldquoI enjoy it a lot and we maintain the friendships we make outside of school too.Also taking part in the programme is Patrick Pillitteri, a P pupil at St Patrickrsquos. Eager to reveal the best thing about shared education he said it was the trips they got to go on.He added: ldquoMy favourite trip was to the Kingspan Stadium at Ravenhill. Irsquom not big into rugby but this was something . It was a fabulous big stadium and it holds many thousands.ldquoIrsquom more of a soccer fan myself. I love Liverpool and I donrsquot ever see that changing any time soon. By the way, Liverpool beat Burnley - last night. That may not seem important to you, but it sure is to me.It came as no surprise then to learn that Patrick wants to be a Premier League footballer when he grows up.He said: ldquoIrsquom going to play for Liverpool when Irsquom older. I get lots of practice in with my friends from Ballynahinch Primary. Finlay and Leon are my best friends in this programme.Animal lover Becky Martin is in P at Ballynahinch Primary. She said the best thing about being part of the programme was organising and planing activities together.ldquoWe have been to Castleward, W and, as Patrick has said, we went to the Kingspan Stadium. There have been loads of trips.ldquoI love organising events. Together we agree on what we would like to do and see it through to the end.When asked what she hoped to do when she grew up, she said: ldquoI love animals but being a vet would make me sad. I would have to put animals to sleep and I wouldnrsquot like that. I think I would like to be a professional dog walker or groom dogs and cats when Irsquom older.Becky added: ldquoThe boys and girls from St Patrickrsquos Primary School bring lots of energy with them.

However, we can now look forward to  with a new senior football team management in place, but with no guarantees of success, his report states.ldquoWe have to believe, though, that indeed the corner will be turned and as we look back to  years without inter-county senior success in football, there is surely a catalyst there for players to say they are going to make it happen.Mr McAteer points out that it will take a concerted effort from all involved in the game to get Down challenging for honours again.ldquoIt must come from within us all, players must want to make it happen in their efforts in training and on match days.ldquoAdministrators have to make sure that the environment is right for Down teams to be successful. If both of those two forces can come together then I do believe that we can be successful again.The county secretary believes that the project to develop a county training facility at Ballykinlar is another initiative to be positive about and he hopes that planning permission can be achieved in .ldquoThe hopes of many will take a further step forward early in  as we move to appoint a planning consultant and a design team for our centre at Ballykinlar, he says.ldquoThe past year has been spent being careful to ensure that all of the right steps were being taken hopefully to obtain full planning permission by the end of .While Mr McAteer praises written media within the county and thanks them for their excellent coverage of Gaelic games, he reserves some criticism for TV coverage.He says he is concerned by the coverage provided by the BBC and UTV.ldquoThere is an imbalance and this imbalance gives scant recognition of the fact that Gaelic Games are the best attended sporting events in the North of Ireland and also have now the greatest levels of participation by male and female participants.ldquoI do not wish this issue to become a political football whereby MLAs try to outscore each other on the back of an imbalance. I would prefer that this matter was championed by Ulster GAA and the GAA nationally to improve the coverage of our games. We need at the very least, parity in terms of live and deferred TV coverage by BBC in particular and a better recognition of our games by UTV.Mr McAteer also pulls no punches when he covers some of the more controversial moments of .ldquoThere were good things happened in Down GAA in , occasions when we hung out our brightest colours and showed how can deliver to the highest standard.ldquoThere were other occasions when mediocrity was the norm and we became very good at mediocracy and then there was the ugly when we showed the country our poor and unacceptable side.ldquoYes, for Down GAA it was a year of mixed feelings and mixed emotions, pride and shame shared equal space in  in the world of Down GAA.ldquoThe eyes of the country and indeedwe take social media into account, the eyes of the world were focused upon us when images from one of our fixtures went viral and everyone was shocked by what they saw. The images represented all that should not be about the GAA.ldquoPhysical violence has no place in our games or indeed at any level in our association. The fact that they might take place within the confines of GAA property is not excuse for acceptance of and turning a blind eye to such incidents.ldquoIf these incidents were happening on a public street after a Saturday night out they would be deemed to be assault and grievous bodily harm. They would lead to prosecutions and possible sentencing all of which can have a huge impact on the le of the victim and the transgressor. Someone will get badly hurt in some of these incidentsthey are to continue at our grounds.Mr McAteer adds: The one punch message has been part of a campaign by the GAA and the authorities in recent times and it is a very real message. Facts are that one punch could kill and that is in honesty something none of us would ever dare to dream of happening at a GAA game, but reality is that it could.

also be imposed on how long people can leave their vehicles in the Upper Square area in a bid to deter all-day parkers.While it is free to park in Castlewellan and there are currently no time

foundation for the directors to come. Because of Theresa’s intervention Armagh now boasts an unbroken meteorological record of  years for which it has been given a Centennial Weather Station Award from the World Meteorological Organisation.The award was formally celebrated last Monday and Tuesday at events attended by representatives of the World Meteorological Organisation, the UK Met Office and Met Eireann.Theresa Hardcastle’s granddaughter Deb Perceval was in attendance as her grandmother’s special contribution was celebrated.Shane Kelly of Armagh Observatory pictured with the sunshine recorder, a th century device which still performs accurately today. Photo by PresseyeThe role of Shane Kelly, who has been diligently recording observations for almost  years, was also recognised. Mr Kelly’s contribution will soon be the longest since daily records began in .Scans of the measurements recorded in the observer’s daily weather log book can be obtained from the Armagh Observatory and Planetarium website going all the way back to .Simon Gilbert from the UK Met Office added: “We manage an extensive network of surface observing stations known as the Voluntary Climate Network. “Six of these sites, including Armagh, have now been awarded Centennial Station status by the World Meteorological Organisation , recognising their global importance for collecting long records of accurate observations and for providing a unique history of recent climate. Without the iniduals who, over the years, have cared for these sites and submitted observations every day, the irreplaceable record of the UK’s climate would not have survived. “Each site is provided with equipment that is calibrated, installed and inspected by the Met Office, but we are still as reliant today on the iniduals who take additional observations and who maintain and watch over the sites every day.”l Ben Lowry, Page  JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings  Terms and Conditions  Disclaimer  Privacy policy    d.onerror  d.onload  d.src  [\"secure-uk.imrworldwide cgi-bin m ciuk-hcgccsi\", escape, \"rp\", escape, \"tscompactrnd\", .getTime].join"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_auto,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.newsletter.co.uk/webimage/1.8734149.1544692322!/image/image.jpg","title":"transport","story":".... , , , , Would you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast Newsletter via email \"Newsletters\"Would you like to receive more information from Johnston Press , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"By clicking on register, you will be creating an account with Belfast Newsletter and agreeing to Johnston Press# Standard Terms and ConditionsWould you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast Newsletter via email \"Would you like to receive more information from Johnston Press , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \" addCustomTextToCreateAccountTemplateNewslettersWould you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast Newsletter via email \"Would you like to receive more information from Johnston Press , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"  \". s .  \". s  \". s  \".after+text+ .+text+ .before+text+ .after+text+  Transport   Jobs Cars Homes  Directory  Announcements  Advertise My Business NewsletterRegisterLoginEdit Account\"Sign Out\" --\"    --       News Transport Politics Crime Farming Education Business Environment Health Your Say Opinion Offbeat News Politics Crime Farming Education Business Environment Health Your Say Opinion Offbeat Sport Football Rugby Union Cricket Golf Motorcycling Boxing More Sport Whats On Music Theatre  Comedy Arts TV  Film Eating Out Lestyle Nostalgia People Family Gadgets  Tech Outdoors Travel Cars Read This           Transport      Traffic and travel: Collision on Westlink causing disruptionMotorists are being warned to expect possible traffic disruption in and around Belfast this morning following a road traffic collision on the Westlink.

Varadkar, left, speaks with the media as he arrives for an EU summit in Brussels, Friday, Dec. ,  In Brussels for the second day of the European Council meeting, Mr Varadkar said he was “very satisfied” with the summit conclusions on Brexit which made clear the withdrawal agreement was not “up for renegotiation”.He said: “How can we be sure that it is going to be enough  We cannot have someone coming back every couple of weeks looking for something extra, looking for something more. We cannot operate international relations in this way.”The Taoiseach added: “An open border between Northern Ireland and Ireland can’t be a back door to the single market. That’s why European countries also very strongly support backstop. It is not just an Irish issue.”He also said it was a matter of “protecting the peace”.Representing the whole EU meanwhile, Donald Tusk, President of the European Council, said: “I have no mandate to organise any further negotiations - we have to exclude any kind of reopening our negotiations on the Withdrawal Agreement but of course we will stay here in Brussels and I am always at Prime Minister Theresa May’s disposal.”He added: “We’ve treated Prime Minister May with the greatest respect, all of us. And we really appreciate the efforts by the Prime Minister to raty our common agreement.”European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker said he has seen MPs harbour “a deep mistrust in the House when it comes to the European Union... that is not a good basis for future relations”.He added: “We have to bring down the temperature. These attacks coming from Westminster against Europe and the European Commission will not be responded to in the same way by Europe and the European Commission, although I would like to do it.”Alarm at farm deaths, which this year are highest since Recognition for woman who preserved unbroken weather record at Armagh Observatory Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch  TrendingN.I. to see snow before Christmas - gale-force winds and heavy rain arriving this weekendNI farmer killed by bull: Health and Safety Executive investigatingIN PICTURES: Funeral of murder victim Jim DoneganTwenty examples of some of the worst car parking N.I. has ever seenPrimary school evacuated after PSNI receive explosive device tip-off          ..

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here. As members of PODS we have our annual barbecue here every year.But the women say they believe the number of people and groups who use The Kymin has dropped over the years.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoI think its underused, I donrsquot know why that is particularly.ldquoWhen I have come down here, I would just see one group in the building. It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth. Work is currently under way to consider how the Penarth Esplanade area can be further enhanced to deliver attractive uses for the townrsquos residents and visitors.ldquoWe recognise that there will be many people with an interest in the future of the site and we will continue to engage with the town council, as current tenants, and others as work continues in exploring options. ldquoThis will need the council to be creative with our ideas for how the arearsquos assets are managed at a time of diminishing budgets, as we continue our work to further enhance this important location.. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It will be no use people moaning later.ldquoOf course multi-modal proposals can have their place but it is unrealistic to suggest they would ever solve the traffic congestion problem through Dinas Powys without a by-pass and without better park and ride facilities.ldquoBuses are currently used by just two per cent of commuters. Itrsquos no use putting more on the roads without removing some of the current commuting traffic, he said.ldquoDespite all the talk of rail and tram improvements there isnrsquot any scope to increase the minimal park-and-ride facilities at Eastbrook and none at all at Dinas Powys.After the Public Consultation, the WelTAG Draft Stage  Report will go to the Vale Cabinet.Members will probably ask their Scrutiny Committee for Environment and Regeneration to give their opinion.The Steering Group is also seeking to engage Ken Skates AM, Cabinet Secretary for Economy and Transport in talks that could involve private sector developments to help fund a by-pass.But theyrsquove been put on hold awaiting the Stage  report. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has recently written his le story. Journalist TomosPoveysat down with himONE of the culinary worldrsquos most talented figures has revealed his extraordinary journey, from the hardships of being made redundant to achieving the dream of opening his own restaurant, in a new book.James Sommerin released his -page autobiography - Generations - two months ago.The book takes readers on a turbulent ride, which documents the fall and remarkable rise of this multi-award winning chef.In no time at all, it has proved a major hit for the -year-old, with more than  copies having being sold.This is not surprising for this is no ordinary autobiography, as it also contains many eagerly-anticipated recipes and picturesque images.ldquoThe book is basically a round-up of my le so far, he said.ldquoIt also has a lot of personal information about me that people do not know. It has my childhood and when I was travelling, as well as some recipes in the back.ldquoIt was quite hard to come up with the title.ldquoAfter a lot of thinking, I came up with the name and it sums up what the book is about. It was my grandmother who inspired me to cook.ldquoI dedicated the book to her because she got me involved in cooking. I would cook with her on weekends and holidays.ldquoMy children are also involved with cooking. With these two points in mind Generations came forth.The chef, who was brought up and educated in Caerleon, left the area aged  and moved to Scotland.In the book he talks of Scotland in great depth, as this is where he ldquolearnt the craft.ldquoI did corporate and cooking in Caerleon. I then took my first full-time cooking position at the Cwrt Bleddyn Hotel, near Usk. Shortly afterwards I then moved to Scotland and it was there that I learnt my craft.ldquoThere was so much that I learnt when I was there and it helped me a lot in broadening my skills.He added: ldquoWhen I was there I also met my we. Then I came back to Wales a few years later and the rest is history.Despite the dficulty of doing so, Mr Sommerin also re-lives the ldquolowest point in his le by putting into words how he felt when the unthinkablehappened.ldquoThe book also gives the highs and lows, he said.ldquoDue to my wersquos persuasion, I also include the lowest point in my le. This was when I was made redundant from the Crown at Whitebrook.ldquoI had started there in  and was later made head chef.ldquoWhen I was made redundant it was a massive low for me: I went from an exceptionally good salary and having my first Michelin Star to nothing.ldquoI talk about this in depth in the book. I was devastated when I had to go. I even lost my cars.ldquoI had no income yet had to support my family.ldquoTo bring in money, I had to resort to cooking in peoplersquos homes.ldquoIt was dficult to writeabout this. But later I went on to open a restaurant in Penarth and that for me was one of my highest achievements. In the beginning it was a headache. It is not for the faint-hearted to open a restaurant. There were delays and things not falling into place.ldquoBut now Restaurant James Sommerin is a high point because this place is a family restaurant and we are all involved in it. My daughter is training to become a chef too.ldquoAnother high point for me was getting a Michelin Star. It is a hard thing to put into words how it felt, really.And for all the foodies wondering ldquoare there any recipes included  there is a plethora of mouth-watering dishes to cook at the back of the book.Mr Sommerin said: ldquoThere is about  recipes in the back ndash some are complicated and others easy. There are vegetarian dishes too.ldquoSome of the dishes are for a more challenging cook, rather than an amateur.The Michelin Star chef also expressed gratitude to his we for putting the book together, saying: ldquoThe book would not have happenedit were not for some strong people.ldquoThe strongest person is my we, who wrote it all.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

They will also prepare the puppy for her future as a working guide dog by taking her on trains and buses, and into shops.After a year or so in their care, Gem willto the charity to begin specialised guide dog training.ldquoIt was a challenge at first, especially as we never owned a dog before, but we felt it was a really worthwhile thing to do, said Mrs Arthur.ldquoI was aware of the isolation experienced by many people with a vision impairment and wanted to make a dference by giving something back to the community. Itrsquos been le-enhancing for us, and wersquove made all sorts of friends.ldquoPenarth town is a really good place to train a guide dog puppy, with a small arcade and local shops. People are very amenable and love being part of Gemrsquos education. We have the Esplanade, beaches and country parks, and wersquove even taken her to Ikea.\"People are very interested in the puppy and we rarely go on a walk without someone enquiring about what we are doing. Gem is so sociable and would like to say hello to everyone.The couple remember vividly the arrival of their first guide dog puppy, a yellow Labrador retriever named Gilly.ldquoWe were excited, very well prepared, and fell in love with her straight away, said Mrs Arthur. ldquoIt was the most joyful and wonderful experience, but you have to be prepared to put in the hard work to train the puppy.ldquoHanding her back after a year was hard, but we were kept informed of her progress and wersquore proud that she is now a qualied guide dog.The charity is seeking more puppy raisers in the Vale of Glamorgan area. Volunteers need access to a car and must be free to spend time with the puppy for most of the day. Their yard or garden will also need to be securely fenced so that the puppy remains safely within its confines.Guide Dogs supplies basic equipment, covers all veterinary and feeding expenses, and provides a network of support and advice.To find out more about becoming a puppy raiser for Guide Dogs, ring Steve Kersley on   and leave a message, or email Steve.Kersley@guidedogs.org.uk article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It aims to maximise independence, which research has shown is the outcome that matters most to people.The project is informed by a similar initiative developed in Canterbury, New Zealand and has a number of key elements which will improve how health and social services work together.Some these elements include a well-being website which will link services across the community and allow health and social care professionals to share information about patients and multi-disciplinary teams.During a visit to Redlands Surgery in Penarth last week, Mr Gething met members of the Cardf and Vale team and some of the team visiting from New Zealand to see the development of the project.Mr Gething said: ldquoWith an increase in le expectancy and our continued public health challenges, our health and social care services will continue to face increasing pressures. This is why, in our long term plan for health and social care, we have set out the need to truly transform the way we deliver care to ensure it is sustainable in the future.\"This will require better integration of health and social services to reduce reliance on hospitals and deliver care closer to home. The Transformation Fund will be used to fund a small number of projects which have the most impact in developing and delivering new models of care, and which have potential to scale up so they can be used across Wales.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is these very services that are now under threat as a direct consequence of year on year under funding.As the proposed cut to the Valersquos budget is below the  per cent threshold, the authority will not receive any further support during the settlement process, Councillor Thomas says.Councillor Thomas says the reduction of pound.million ldquoignores the impact of inflation on council budgets. He said the impact of pay inflation on the council next year will be pound.million..The Vale council is also facing unfunded cost pressures in   of pound.million due to changes in the pension scheme for teachers.Providing for growing numbers of pupils with additional learning needs, and also complying with new Welsh Government legislation, would also cost the council an extra poundmillion which is also unfunded, Councillor Thomas says.Vale councillor Bob Penrose also added that school cutbacks ldquoare inevitable.Cllr Penrose said: ldquoIn July UK Government announced a . per cent rise in teachersrsquo pay which would cover England and Wales.ldquoThis was followed by the announcement of a  per cent increase in employersrsquo contribution to teachersrsquo pensions.ldquoWhat was lacking was an explanation of how this would be paid for.The council has set out its initial budget for  , which says the authority would need to find an additional pound,, in savings next year.That would be on top of pound,, cuts which have already been planned ndash which include a one per cent funding reduction for schools across the Vale.A council tax rise of . per cent for each of the next three years had been assumed in a provisional financial plan published by the council in September. The final level of council tax is not expected to be set until early in .But the council says raising council tax would only cover a small amount of the money it needs to balance the books. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Stephen, Mum Victoriawith their children CadenCoreySiennaand baby ConnieThe-year-old revealed Stephen had been in bed with a terrible tummy bug. “I informed him that night that I wasn’t going to bed because I didn’t want the bug.“I lay down on the sofa to go for a sleep and I had a wee pop and my waters went.“I had to go get him out of his sick bed. He really wasn’t well and shouldn’t have been in the hospital at all. He was hardly fit to drive never mind deliver his wee daughter Connie Evelyn on th November.“We live in Laurelvale and her head was partially out at Short’s Garage. We got pulled in a Leckey’s body shop and out she came. I was in the passenger’s seat already cradling her head. He got out and popped the seat back and out she shot.“We probably would have been as safe to stay at home but I had woke the kids to tell them we were going to the hospital to have the baby because they had made us promise.“I thought I might have held her in but ... It’s a good job we lted a few towels,” she said.“The operator on the telephone instructed Stephen to take the lace out of his boot.

Thinking about the design, I wanted something that symbolised security and protection, and also represented something my neighbours and I had in common. “So I thought of my dear old Alsatian, Clint, who used to guard our house when I was a kid. “Our neighbours were very fond of him, and used to help feed him, so I thought guard dogs would be the perfect theme. “I drew the gates in a Celtic style, with the elongated, elegant dogs’ bodies and sinuous lines of the tails also reflecting some of the style of Art Nouveau.This sculpture is called Master McGrath falls into the frozen River AltJonny works as Arts Assistant for Armagh City, Banbridge  Craigavon Borough Council, based at Moneypenny’s Blacksmith Workshop, in the beautul, historic location of Moneypenny’s Lock, on the Newry Canal outside Portadown. He reminisced: “When work had finished for the day, I would start work on my gates after hours. “Most of the gates are hand forged in the traditional manner, heating the steel in the forge then shaping it on the anvil, as it has been done for thousands of years. Mayor wishes all a very Merry Christmas Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"“The decorative finials , drop bolts, and most of the dogs’ swirling, interlaced bodies are forged this way. For the heads and lower legs, I used more modern techniques such as plasma cutting and grinding to shape the steel. “Then I joined everything together with the MiG welder. To accentuate the eyes, and the dog collars, I added some brass. One of the last details I added was the traditional latch, which is decorated with two matching hand-forged Celtic trisceles representing the dogs’ hearts.”Jonny first started blacksmithing at Tannaghmore Gardens Animal Farm and then at Moneypenny’s since . “As a member of Moneypenny’s Blacksmith Workshop, I have had the great privilege of learning from two of the best artist-blacksmiths in the country, Steve Murphy and Aaron Leach. “You can see some of the workshop’s work at Tannaghmore Animal Farm, where we made the entrance gates.

Here Emma Deighan scours some of the top NI venues to see how they are catering to the corporate Christmas Arguably the most anticipated social event in the work diary, the Christmas ‘do’ has evolved over the years.And many of Northern Ireland’s top hosts agree and have widened their offering in response.Event managers and venue owners say everything from the format of the Christmas party to its timing have changed to accommodate the demands of employees today. How, when and where we celebrate are top priorities.Take the evening do, for example. For many, that age-old three-course setup doesn’t cut the convenience factor, prompting my employers end the work day early to take advantage of lunch dates. It’s a favourable move that delivers on two fronts – it offers time-poor workers the relief of a shorter day but doesn’t infringe on family obligations.Owner of Bishop’s Gate Hotel in Derry and former president of the Northern Ireland Hotel’s Federation, Ciaran O’Neill agrees. “Christmas has changed over the last number of years for our industry with more businesses looking for lunches, as opposed to the traditional party nights of old,” he said. “We do still have ‘big nights’, but these tend to occur on Fridays and Saturdays.”Ciaran says he has also noted an increase in smaller party sizes over the years.“We are seeing less private large events and more small groups dining with us. Employees are arranging ‘get togethers’ with colleagues or teams that they work directly with.”Bishop’s Gate, which has become Derry’s hospitality jewel attracting the AA Hotel of the Year- accolade, among many other awards, pairs an historic setting with parties for Christmas.The Bullitt Hotel in Belfast is setting the scene for the experience-savvy hipster workforce – and this Christmas Bullitt’s ‘experiences’ reflect the discernment of its guests.General manager at Bullitt, Michael Sullivan has seen a spike in ‘experience’ events, upgrading the turkey feast to a cooler, more casual event.“We have had a number of enquiries for informal gatherings in our Good Room event space, with a festive lunch to follow. The Good Room is the perfect space to blur the lines between work and play for intimate company get togethers ahead of a more traditional Christmas do,” he said.“We’ve also had enquiries for private gin and whiskey tastings and can also organise a number of unique events and team-building activities for groups, from candle-making to chunky knitting workshops for a truly memorable Christmas party.”This December Bullitt has a range of packages to suit private and shared s – from sit-down meals in its restaurant Taylor and Clay to VIP packages in its Baltic Bar or secluded enclaves above in Babel – its rooftop bar. And its ‘Tipsy Tea’ is geared towards the day-time revellers. Prices range from £. to £. a head.“Bullitt has brought something new and exciting to the traditional Christmas party market, with a range of novel spaces set within cool, contemporary surroundings. We like to think that we’re helping to shake up the scene somewhat by offering something a little dferent,” Michael said.If you want to push the boat out with your corporate squad, Titanic Belfast is ready for boarding. Its play on Belfast’s shipbuilding heritage and the fateful Titanic is always a crowd pleaser. Laura Cowan, head of sales at Titanic Belfast said: “We host bespoke private Christmas party nights, which are tailored to our clients’ needs across all of the Titanic venues – Titanic Belfast , SS Nomadic and the Titanic Exhibition Centre. “These can range from private dining, iconic tailored experiences, drinks receptions and gala dinners. We also host our traditional Christmas party nights – featuring a Christmas cocktail reception on arrival followed by a delicious four course banquet and live entertainment.”For sheer luxury, the more refined office workers take to the Cathedral Quarter in Belfast to sample the Merchant’s opulent offering.And Clare Mullin, meetings and events manager there, said the hotel’s renowned afternoon teas are bucking the turkey dinner trend but are every bit as fancul. “Over the years we have seen an increased demand for Christmas parties and festive events that offer something a little dferent, memorable or exciting. People increasingly seem to be looking for something out of the ordinary.“We have seen a trend for corporate bookings where companies are looking for alternatives to a traditional evening dinner. For example, our Festive Afternoon Tea is very popular – especially the Champagne iety. Festive drinks in our famous Cocktail Bar continue to be a popular option for the corporate market too, with bespoke offerings such as our Redbreast whiskey flight extremely popular. gtClient lunches in The Cloth Ear and Berts Jazz Bar are also growing in popularity.”Casual begins in its neighbouring Cloth Ear from £. a person, retro at Berts Jazz Bar will cost you £. for lunch or £ for dinner.For private s The Roof Garden Alpine Lodge at the Merchant can cater to  and for the more luxurious three-courses will be served in the Rita Duffy Suite for £ a person.The newly revamped and extended Ten Square is another setup that combines afternoon tea with tradition.Swapping caffeine for mulled wine and pastries for mince pies, Ten Square’s Loft, located on its top floor and flaunting some pretty impressive city centre views, plays the backdrop to this year’s festive afternoon teas at £ a head, from pm to pm.It also offers more familiar packages in its Linen Hall suite where tradition mingles with s DJs to live bands.And for those who really want to go that extra mile, Belfast’s newest Hastings sibling is ready and waiting.The Grand Central Hotel on Bedford Street boasts unrivalled views from sky-high Observatory, where afternoon tea takes on a Christmas theme or tradition can be celebrated at its Seahorse Restaurant and ground floor Grand Cafe. Allyson McKimm, events director of Hastings Hotels said expectations for hospitality environments to up their game get higher every year.She said Hastings Hotels had “reached new heights this year to keep the format fresh and exciting with new entertainment and new twists on the menus and lots of exciting extras including the traditional and limited edition Christmas ducks.”Allyson said a growing trend for lunch events inspired Europa’s ‘Christmas Caberet Lunches’ with Motown entertainment. The live tribute act theme travels across its entire portfolio. “Once again, our guests have asked usthey could continue the celebrations after Christmas once the party season is over, and to meet this demand, we have launched a whole range of tribute shows between Christmas and the New Year at all venues including ever popular All American Buffet with Elvis at the Europa, Jersey Guys, ABBA and our favourite George Michael and Robbie Williams Tribute Show at the Ballygally, Stormont and Everglades Hotels.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/john1.jpg","title":"majority of ni firms expanding workforce in ","story":"Posted on Friday  November  by John Mulgrew More Northern Ireland firms say they will take on new staff next year than compared to the UK as a whole, according to a new survey.

Meanwhile, % of firms polled said they had experienced some form of skills shortage within the past year, against a UK average of %. The survey also showed that some Northern Ireland employers are finding it harder to recruit staff, due to lower levels of unemployment leading to a rise in wages. John Moore, managing director of Hays in Northern Ireland, said: “Employers in Northern Ireland told us they are pressing ahead with business plans and are generally optimistic about the wider economic climate for the next two to five years. Recruitment expectations are at their highest levels for five years, for both temporary and permanent roles. “Increased competition for talent coupled with skills shortages has helped support above UK-average salary growth in Northern Ireland. While that is positive for those seeking new employment it also has downsides, including negative impacts on productivity, staff morale and the ability to deliver projects. “Given the intense competition and, at times, unrealistic salary requirements from candidates, it’s never been more important for employers to understand the complex factors that influence employee movement. “Salary is still a top consideration, but candidates are now influenced by other benefits, such as le balance and career progression opportunities. However, only % of employers surveyed saw work le balance as a priority, compared with % of employees.” The survey is based on responses from almost , employers and professionals working in a range of industries, including almost  in Northern Ireland.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/chamber_1.jpg","title":"outline your alternative to brexit deal says ni chamber president","story":"Posted on Thursday  November  by John Mulgrew It’s now time for political leaders opposed to a draft withdrawal agreement on Brexit to “outline alternative proposals” as an overwhelming majority of Northern Ireland’s business community back the plans, an industry leader has said. Ellvena Graham, president of the Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said Prime Minister Theresa Mays deal on the table is “definitely much better than a no-deal scenario”. “After a long period of negotiation we now have a draft Withdrawal Agreement which is undoubtedly a welcome step forward for the majority of businesses in Northern Ireland,” she said. “We want the outcome that’s best for businesses, for consumers, for the economy and for the future stability of Northern Ireland – and we’ll do everything we can to ensure that we get it. “We therefore encourage our political representatives who support the draft agreement to do everything in their power to influence political representatives in Britain to join them. “For those that are not in support of the draft agreement, it is now time to outline your alternative proposals. We are willing to listen.” Ms Graham was speaking at the NI Chamber’s President’s Banquet at ICC Belfast. And as Northern Ireland approaches two years without a devolved government, she said that while there is a “vibrant and innovative business community that wants to invest and grow” that it is “stymied because of the prolonged absence of a regional government and the endless Brexit bickering”.

It really is a fascinating mix of the old and the new.“With high ceilings, exposed brick feature walls, high quality wood flooring and the strikingly restored staircase from the entrance lobby, the space reflects innovative contemporary design.”The development is guiding a rental income of £, for each floor.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/sk_123.jpg","title":"more than  of business group members back brexit withdrawal deal","story":"Posted on Monday December  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland’s business community has overwhelming thrown its weight behind a withdrawal agreement on Brexit – with almost % of one major lobby group’s members in favour, it can be revealed.The CBI, Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce, Federation of Small Businesses and IoD are among the groups which have backed the deal on the table. Meanwhile, farming unions in Northern Ireland and throughout the UK have also issued their support for the deal.It would essentially provide a backstop, and create a deeper customs union between Northern Ireland the EU, along with a closer alignment in the single market.Stephen Kelly, chief executive of Manufacturing NI says that the agreement is “the only show in town.”He said a poll of its members showed .% of those who replied were in support.“This is the only show in town. The rules are clear – in order for the UK to move to the most productive discussion on what the future relationship will be, we need a withdrawal agreement. The options are the agreement, or no deal,” he told Ulster Business.“Business in Northern Ireland and agri-business have made it clear that no deal is not an option.”Other business groups backing the proposed agreement include the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium, Retail NI, Hospitality Ulster and the Freight Transport Association.Writing in the Belfast , Prime Minister Theresa May said Northern Ireland will thrive under the proposed Brexit deal, and its position as part of the UK “is guaranteed”.She said her agreement with Brussels “puts Northern Ireland in a fantastic position for the future”, and moved to reassure unionists that “Northern Ireland’s constitutional status as part of the United Kingdom is guaranteed.“Under this deal the future is certainly bright for Northern Ireland.”On the backstop, Ms May said three things made it “an acceptable insurance policy”.She said the transition period could be extended instead of entering the backstop, regulations would be the same across all of the UK, and Northern Ireland would not be treated dferently.Meanwhile, in a joint statement, the Ulster Farmers’ Union, NFU Scotland, NFU England and NFU Cymru, said:“The draft Brexit withdrawal agreement, while not perfect, will ensure that there are no hard barriers on the day we leave the European Union, and will allow trade in agricultural goods and UK food and drink to continue throughout the transition period largely as before. This opportunity needs to be taken.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/cd_1.jpg","title":"it and the city deal","story":"Posted on Tuesday  December  by Ulster Business John Mulgrew looks at what major IT elements Belfast and the surrounding regions could get out of a potential £bn City Deal When it was formally announced that the Government would put forward £m from the Treasury towards a finance pot worth up to £bn for six councils as part of a new City Deal, it’s obvious that IT, innovation and manufacturing technologies would be high on the list. The Belfast Region City Deal will see a series of projects and schemes taking place across, Belfast, Antrim and Newtownabbey, Mid and East Antrim, Ards and North Down, Lisburn and Castlereagh, and Newry, Mourne and Down. And with that, a series of major IT initiatives are being outlined, many in collaboration with Ulster University and Queen’s University, in a bid to grow and expand Northern Ireland’s credentials on a global scale. “Queen’s University Belfast and Ulster University have collaborated extensively to develop proposals for global centres of innovation excellence in key growth sectors in which world-leading expertise in our universities can be leveraged by businesses to create breakthrough technologies, products and services,” the City Deal proposal says. And it adds that a deal “requires a catalyst that will drive forward investment in research and development and help embed a culture of innovation to act as a driver for increased productivity”. The councils took their case to Westminster at the end of October, and following that, Chancellor Philip Hammond announced the Treasury’s commitment. The rest of the proposed funding will come from matched finance from Stormont, with the remaining from the councils. Andthey pull it off, they are predicting as many as , new jobs could be created. DIGITAL HEALTHCARE In a bid to further grow and develop Northern Ireland’s position on the international healthcare market, the City Deal proposes creating a branded cluster of medical device and technology companies that “through a supportive and collaborative eco system of co-location and working will build the size and value of the sector”. The centre aims to attract and develop businesses across a range of areas, especially in the areas of cardiology, diabetes, respiratory and stroke. It says that a key aspect of the proposed cluster is the partnership working with scientists and companies with the existing pilot clinical lab at the Royal Victoria Hospital. Also in the pipeline is the ‘i-Reach’ project. Led by Queen’s University, Ulster University and partners from the le and health sciences sector, those behind the City Deal say it sits within the umbrella of an “emerging health innovation NI concept which seeks to bring a unied ‘front door’ for external investment into the health and le sciences sector”. DIGITAL PARTNERSHIP It is proposing a “physical and digital environment” to allow the academic research community, tech entrepreneurs and industrial partners will come together to address key challenges in business and society through the application of the IoTand data science. Those behind it say it will support a common approach to big data sourcing and management, including early adoption of prevailing industry standards and codes of practice for secure and ethical use of data. There are also plans for a ‘global innovation institute’. The plans say it will draw together the skills of several areas of Queen’s University – which includes electronics, communications and information technology, health sciences and food security – to “anchor and support the creation of a Global Innovation Quarter in Belfast”. MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY According to those behind the City Deal, the will operate at the interface between academia and industry “accelerating new technology developments through the innovation phase and ensuring that real industrial challenges based on market need are solved through collaboration with the best university research”. Queen’s and Ulster University have developed an ‘advanced manufacturing innovation centre’ concept, that will “become the springboard for manufacturing innovation within the region”. CREATIVE INDUSTRIES Northern Ireland has already proven itself on the big and small screen, but there has been a strong move towards growing that further still. Aside from NI providing the facilities and backdrop for most of Game of Thrones, there’s also been the development of the Belfast Harbour Film Studios. Part of the City Deal plan involves boosting that position, with a ‘screen and media innovation lab’ bringing together “transformative production, studio and RD facilities”. SCIENCE PARK Elsewhere, in Mid and East Antrim, plans are under way for the transformation of the former St Patrick’s Barracks site in Ballymena into a new science park – Integrated Industrial Inspiration and Innovation Campus called iC. It’s being proposed that each council area will have some form of innovation hub, which will be directed towards business development. CONNECTIVITY Aside from specic schemes, infrastructure and connectivity improvements are part of the plans. That includes improvements in fibre-optic and mobiles broadband connectivity. It comes as mobile network EE, part of the BT Group, announced that Belfast is among six cities across the UK which have been chosen for the first phase of its G launch. “Our G trials are going well, giving us valuable insight into both the performance of the new technology and the challenges of upgrading sites with this new equipment,” Marc Allera, chief executive of BT’s consumer ision said. “We’re confident that we can bring G to the busiest parts of Belfast and the UK in .”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"ni hospice the best of business and sport championing a force for good","story":"Posted on Tuesday  December  by Ulster Business The Northern Ireland Children’s Hospice wants to partner with business leaders from right across the province. We speak to some of its supporters, including Celtic boss Brendan Rodgers, and why they are firmly behind the charity When Northern Ireland’s top sporting exports and business leaders are getting directly involved in a charitable cause as worthwhile as the Northern Ireland Children’s Hospice, it’s hard to ignore the work the organisation is doing on a day-to-day basis.The Northern Ireland Children’s Hospice was established in  and is the only dedicated palliative care service in Northern Ireland. Among those working closely with the charity are Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers, founder of Vanrath, Wayne Sullivan and Pinnacle chairman, Ken Montgomery.The organisation cares for around  infants, children and their families, each year. With annual costs of £.m, the children’s hospice depends heavily on donations from the public to keep vital services going.But in addition to that, the children’s hospice is focused on boosting and growing philanthropic relationships with Northern Ireland business leaders who want to establish long-term links and a partnership with a charity who make a positive and meaningful impact across Northern Ireland.And as a result of that, it’s Time to Care programme was created – looking at new and innovative ways to reach out for key support.Heather Weir is chief executive of the NI Hospice. “The NI Hospice costs £m to run each year, and we have to raise £.m for direct care costs every year through our fundraising efforts,” she says.“As well as relying on the local community, we rely on business support too. With the vast amount of charities out there, we have been looking at how we can align the charity with business leaders and their companies, in terms of a fresh partnership approach.“We looked at how we could make supporting a charity feel really meaningful for businesses.“As a charity we need business insights, and not just in fundraising support. Having a network of business leaders is a practical way of supporting the hospice.”Heather says, aside from helping young people with le-limiting conditions, it’s also a chance for them to help improve their companies corporate social responsibility agenda.For Co Antrim man Brendan Rodgers – who paid a visit to the organisation’s Newtownabbey base alongside Wayne Sullivan and Ken Montgomery – the connection started with a letter from the NI Hospice, back when he was manager of Liverpool.“When I met Heather and came over, it was something from a personal perspective. We are all brought up as carers in Northern Ireland, and we want to give back. But I also felt that my role and responsibility as a manager – sport touches a lot of people and I could use it in a way that would hopefully open up doors for the NI Hospice in a dferent way.“In the last number of years, it’s been a great opportunity for me to meet people like Wayne, who I have met before – like-minded people who are very driven in their professional le, but alongside that, they have a real duty of care for organisation they support.”“What you have when you support the NI Hospice is something tangible.”Wayne Sullivan, founder of Vanrath, said: “What we have come up with is a project where all donations and funding goes into a specic account that is designated solely for the use of spending on nurse salaries.“You know where the money is going and that really ticks a box from our perspective. The nurses also come out to provide presentations of what they have been doing.“But asfor this, we get to use the brand and we co-partner. This is a marketing partnership.”The Time to Care relationship with companies also includes a Business Ambassadors network, which brings leaders together across a range of events.Ken Montgomery, chairman of Pinnacle, said: “For us at Pinnacle, my interest was the corporate social aspect of it and giving back to the community. Running a successful business in the community, I think there is a big role for corporates to play.”“It was also selling it to our own employees – the people working in the company. One of the things that appealed to me was having the direct contact with a particular nurse, and you felt the direct impact of what you are doing.”The key focus is enabling businesses to fund the cost of a qualied children’s nurse for a year. That relationship then offers a company access to co-branding opportunities and its own business network.The Northern Ireland Children’s Hospice has opened two new cots this year, at a cost of £, each. And for each cot, the children’s hospice needs five paediatric nurses.And the target for the NI Hospice in the next three years is focused on achieving maximum capacity, bringing it to  cots and beds, serving over , infants and children living with a le limiting and le threatening illness. That’s an additional £.m over the next three years that’s needed.   So, what’s the key message to get Northern Ireland businesses of all shapes and sizes involved “For most top businesses, their brand will have a set of values which is important to them.” Brendan says.“The key word is alignment... you want to align yourself with those values that will drive your business, your people and your customers or beneficiaries.”This year, it has also launched its Jingle All the Way campaign. It encourages businesses, organisations, schools, clubs, churches and iniduals across Northern Ireland to get involved and fundraise through a iety of areas, including a k run, a Jingle bake-off and a Jingle Jumper Day.Time to Care is a unique offer for business leaders to support the children’s hospice and the specialist nurses who  provide vital care to infants and children with a le limiting illness across Northern Ireland.

Here Emma Deighan looks at the who, what and why of STEM initiatives in the business sector According to the most recent Skills Barometer report the biggest shortage of skills in Northern Ireland falls within the science, technology, engineering and mathssectors.The research, compiled by Ulster University for the Department for the Economyin , shows an urgency to train future generations in what are the fastest-growing areas of our economy.In its analysis the report concluded: “The subjects forecast to be predominantly under-supplied are engineering and technology, maths and computer sciences and physical and environmental sciences. It is estimated that the economy will require an additional  engineering and technology graduates and a similar number of additional maths and computer science graduates each year. Strong demand for the STEM related subjects is forecast.”It’s a concern given the growth within those business isions here. An influx of international STEM related employers have set up shop here, investing in a skillset that still needs much attention. Meanwhile our homegrown hub of STEM related employers are expanding at a phenomenal rate.Some of these investments include Lisburn-based firm Camlin’s announcement that it will create  new roles in the engineering field thanks to a £m expansion. And in earlier in the year, financial services firm, FinTrU revealed it would add a further  employees to its team across Belfast and in the North West.Then there’s the hugely successful sports device firm, STATSports, that is seeking another  staff members. And two years ago Belfast-based global aerospace and defence system manufacturer Thales’ opened up a whole new field here when in it launched a £m space propulsion facility signalling a whole new area of expertise that would open up to graduates here. With the future looking bright in terms of employment in these sectors, sirens sound when the Skills Barometer says STEM related subjects have been regularly under-supplied. It described it as a “consistent finding” across several years of research but fortunately activity to level out the supply-demand flow within the STEM world here is by no means passive. Governmental, third sector organisations and indeed those businesses reliant on that talent pool have been engaging in initiatives to support a deficit in talent. Clinical diagnostics firm Randox is one such employer. Software development, IT support, engineering, science research and mathematics make up the bulk of its operations and as such it promotes roles within the latter fields through STEM programmes.Linda Magee, head of human resources at Randox, said: “At Randox there are plenty of opportunities to work across a wide iety of STEM disciplines. Our APEX programme, which offers first year university students a complete career package, includes work experience between first and second year, a paid placement in third year and, finally, a graduate position post-degree.“Students accepted on to the Randox APEX programme work with, and learn from, the most experienced professionals in the industry, across a range of departments within their discipline.“They might be assisting our ground-breaking research into tests for cancer, kidney disease and Alzheimer’s, working in our engineering department developing diagnostic technologies, contributing to the output of a busy forensics laboratory, or joining our business development teams as they expand the Randox portfolio across the globe.”Linda said the firm also encourages “established talent” to come back and join the company through a ‘ers’ programme, a six-week scheme aimed at those who have had a break from the workplace. It includes induction, training and mentoring.“There are endless opportunities for career progression at Randox – the sky really is the limit,” she said.Another firm with training high up its agenda is FinTrU, the investment bank services firm, at the Gasworks in Belfast.In terms of recruitment, FinTrU developed its two-year Graduate Programme with a long-term commitment to providing analysts with support, training and industry qualications such as Investment Operations Certicates .It also offers financial services academies which have resulted in almost  jobs for graduates in Belfast. Named Academy X,  this year’s intake welcomed a range of graduates from non-financial backgrounds to allow them to forge a career in the sector. Founder of the company, Darragh McCarthy, believes such programmes create an “ecosystem” that gives back to the talent pool and economy here. “I see FinTrU as having a social purpose to create high-quality professional employment in Northern Ireland,” he said.One of the most active firms in nurturing a talent pool in IT is Kainos. Each year the NI digital services giant donates over £, and , man hours to safeguarding the IT sector’s future. Kainos’ technology outreach manager Gemma Crothers said: “You can go into schools and they have this tumbleweed idea thatyou’re going to work in IT you literally get a PC and type stuff. And we want to change that perception.“There are so many dferent areas to IT. And it’s lucrative and that’s the message we’re trying to put across. We are trying to change the way the schools are managed and bring computer science in at a nationwide level and we are lobbying the government for that.“One of the big areas for us is trying to train teachers on all levels so they have the confidence in the classroom to weave the skills in and give the students the exposure they need so they can chose to follow through.”Kainos recently announced that it was seeking applications for its ‘Earn as you Learn’ scheme. It’s a funded computing systems degree that also allows students to earn a salary while they study. Brendan Mooney, Kainos’ chief executive said of the scheme offers students the best of both worlds. He said: “The pace of technological change is faster than ever. So, anyone who can obtain both industry experience and an education at the same time, will have the advantage. They get to apply what they have learned in university and also get a head start in their career.“At Kainos we pride ourselves on our determination to nurture and invest in the talent of the future and are committed to broadening access and offering dferent routes to school leavers from dferent backgrounds.”In the science field, Craigavon-based global pharmaceutical company Almac Group also works closely with schools and universities to encourage interest in STEM subjects and careers.Frances Weldon, STEM outreach manager at the firm said Almac believes it has a responsibility to drive interest in the field to “grow a dynamic and innovative economy that benefits all”.“At Almac we are hugely focused on engaging with the next generation and helping them gain skills that they will need for their future careers. We rely on the talent, skills and expertise of our dedicated employees to drive continued growth and realise our vision to advance human health. We know that to ensure our success in the future we need even more skilled and knowledgeable recruits.”Among its initiatives are the Sloane McClay and Almac McKervey awards, work shadow placements, apprenticeships and industrial placements for third level students, some of which do not require a science background. “In the new year, through a partnership with W, we will launch a £m project aimed at enhancing STEM knowledge, skills and understanding among school pupils. An interactive exhibition will explore the human body and the diagnosis and treatment of illness as well as telling Almac’s story,” Frances said.The objective she says is to “inspire a new generation of students to gain skills to help them secure exciting and innovative roles such as those we offer at Almac”.The latter investments represent just a fraction of STEM activity ongoing here. The wider picture of such initiatives is not just beneficial to STEM businesses but the economy as a whole here.

Seamus Leheny is just one voice in the increasingly tumultuous debate around the main concerns and issues that still exist around the border, following the UK’s exit from the EU. We currently sit on the precipice, a Schrodinger’s cat scenario, where we on one hand have some form of early agreement on ensuring noto a hard border, and at the same time, don’t, while waiting to see whether the Prime Minister can sell it. We then establish what will be done to avoid any severe impact to cross-border trade here. The BBC’s Chris Mason garnered attention with an honest abstract on Brexit progress a couple of weeks ago - ‘I haven’t for the foggiest idea’ he told his colleagues back in the studio. “When we turn our attention to commercial goods vehicles crossing the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, it’s a very dferent story,” Seamus Leheny says. More than . million goods vehicles crossed the border in , according to official stats. And of those . million movements, the majority was recorded on the A Belfast to Dublin road. “When we break down the figures on cross border traffic, this equates to an average of , goods vehicles crossing the border daily, which is  per hour – or to illustrate it in comparison to cross channel movements, it’s a large freight ferry fully laden every  minutes,  ,  days a year,” Seamus says. For Dale Farm for example, and other food processors, its concern is over the certication process, following Brexit. “It’s basically an export certicate for dairy products. You are not allowed to export without this certicate,” Nick says. “For example, we have signed a quite public announcement with Lidl. We are supplying Lidl all over the world. If Lidl were to ask me in the morning, can you guarantee that you can supply my countries outside the UK on April   I actually can’t. “It’s nothing to do with tarfs or costs. If I don’t have animal health export certicates approved well-ahead of Brexit – these things take about six months to negotiate. “I’m screaming at DEFRAand DAERAhere to get this done now. “Why don’t you agree the wording, and have the work done, so when the agreement is or isn’t made… now you can start. “It’s a huge risk for this industry here,we can’t get stuff off the island.” Around % of Northern Ireland’s dairy, as an example, is sold where. A study by InterTrade Ireland said a signicant share of cross-border trade is accounted for by firms that trade “simultaneously in both directions”. “These two-way traders make up around % of ﬁrms, but accounted for over % of exports and over % of imports,” according to Seamus. With transport, Translink boss Chris Conway says it remains unclearthe company will be able to run cross-border bus services,no deal on Brexit is secured. During an evidence session in Westminster, he said that the organisation runs around  cross-border services – some which, he said, “meander” between Northern Ireland and the Republic during a journey. There’s also the issue of whether drivers will be able to operate between jurisdictions following the UK’s exit. That’s due to a question mark floating over the head of licences for drivers in the EU. Elsewhere, the Road Haulage Association has said with around three months left to go it is not prepared for what’s around the corner. It’s a two-way street, of course, for both firms from Northern Ireland selling south, and those from the Republic selling north. Figures from the ONS show Northern Irish business with the Republic of Ireland accounted for around % of exports and % of imports. “The share of intermediate products in imports from Northern Ireland to Ireland is higher in almost all sectors than trade in the same sectors from the rest of the UK,” Seamus said in a piece examining the impact of a ‘no deal’ scenario. “So for example, a company could transport ingredients or components across the border several times before the finished product is completed in Northern Ireland, and is then ready for export to consumers in Great Britain. “Naturally the intermediate products will be of lesser value compared to the completed product, hence the disparity in value of goods crossing the Irish Sea compared to the land border. “In recent Brexit discussions the signicance of the value of trade between Northern Ireland and Great Britain has been highlighted. “This is quite right and we must ensure this hugely important market for us is not jeopardised or impeded in any way as a result of Brexit. “What has often been overlooked is our reliance on being able to move goods quickly, cheaply and without tarfs across the Irish border, in order to assemble those valuable goods we end up shipping to Great Britain. “If the all-island supply chains are impeded with subsequent increased costs and subject to tarfs, then those exports we champion and put on those ferries to Great Britain will suddenly become less competitive in price – or, in the worst case scenario, won’t exist anymore.” Seamus says a “holistic approach is required when trade from Northern Ireland is discussed and used as a bargaining chip due to the fact it’s a unique economic region that is finely interwoven with that of another EU member state”. “To pursue, or indeed to sleep walk into, a no deal Brexit would unravel the carefully tailored economy of Northern Ireland and potentially leave it in tatters.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
