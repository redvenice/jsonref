Tom Jenkins has been taking an enforced break from action photography and pursuing a different kind of vision in his gardenI have never appreciated my back garden so much.At this time of year, I’m usually caught up with all the to-ings and fro-ings of the sporting world: taking photos of traditional spring events like the Boat Race and Grand National, or key matches as the football season builds to a crescendo. Normally I’m away a lot, not really passing an eye over developments in my garden. But this is not a normal year.It was mid-March, and I was sitting despondently in my tiny postage stamp of a garden. The previous week I had photographed the Cheltenham festival, an event I associate with the end of winter, spring coming, the light getting better. A chance to look ahead to a summer of sport, going to events that I love. But this year, the festival had felt all wrong – more like a dangerous party on the eve of war. It seemed all around me the news was harrowing, and sport was getting hammered as event after event was cancelled. My world had suddenly been turned upside-down.I realised then that I had to reframe and refocus. With all my normal avenues for taking pictures closed off, I needed to find something else. I recalled the words of Ed Jackson, a former professional rugby player whose portrait I had taken exactly a year earlier. After suffering an awful accident that had left him partially paralysed, he had developed a mental process to cope with his new situation: focus on what’s in front of you, focus on things you can affect, and try to forget what’s out of your control.Remembering this, I looked round the edge of the tiny piece of lawn and noticed some tulip bulbs that my wife had planted in terracotta pots. Lush green leaves with buds full of promise had emerged from the soil, ready to bloom. In these plants, I saw hope. I saw normality.It occurred to me then that this process of growth and positivity deserved to be documented. Despite the global madness, nature was thriving – and these tulips seemed to be begging me to tell their story. To me, photography is more than just a career: it is my passion, and in these flowers I found the perfect opportunity to take pictures without leaving my home.To test myself, I decided not to use any of my main professional cameras. These are more used to the hurly-burly of sport, all fast focusing and speedy motor-drive. Instead, I turned to what I call my “holiday camera”, an upmarket point-and-shoot that I take away on trips with the family (the last thing I want on holiday is to be surrounded by items associated with work, many of which are heavy). Light, easy to manoeuvre around the plants, and – most crucially – able to focus close-up, this small camera actually turned out to be perfect for this project.As the sun moved round the garden during the day, backgrounds became dark and shadows on the flowers created gorgeous patterns. I would note which times were best to photograph certain plants, and would periodically drop whichever household task I was doing (much to the irritation of my family) to race to the garden and catch the flowers in the perfect light.Like all photographers, I look to light as another tool in the box, an opportunity to create something different. By varying angles, I could make petals look like paper, tightly bunched flower heads look like lips. Going in tight, I attempted to show the beauty of the flowers in a surreal way. The warm spring sunshine of the last few weeks had not only ushered the tulips into full bloom but enhanced their colour and vibrancy, so some of my photographs gained an almost unearthly quality.I’ve never felt so lucky to have my garden, this tiny oasis in densely crowded north London. In the land of quarantine, my house has never felt more like a castle, defending me from the warzone outside the front gate. In that castle, my garden is the green inner sanctum, a place of peace and tranquillity.As I sit here now, in the sunshine, I hear birdsong and the rustling of leaves, with the chirruping of children playing wafting in on the breeze. The sky above my head is free from planes and pollution and a brilliant blue. The sun, bright and sharp at this time of year, makes everything look crisp. In times like these, we remember that nature truly is life-affirming, and the simple act of flowers growing means so much. It shows that in an abnormal world, normality is king."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ff8c576f8137ae93f0cb4fa07eda2b4ef623e0ae/0_292_4384_2631/master/4384.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3a8c83c17c535ad69dc80adffb057cbc","title":"face masks mandatory spread coronavirus government","story":"The government’s objections to this seemingly effective measure appear more political and economic than scientificThree months on, even as more than 30 countries, including Germany, have mandated face coverings outdoors for the public, the UK government has been adamant that there’s not enough evidence to support such a move here. The government, advised by the scientific advisory group on emergencies (Sage), is expected to make a decision shortly on whether face masks will be mandatory. Reports suggest that the advice will be a compromise, with the public allowed to choose to wear scarves or face-coverings rather than medical-grade masks. So why has there been such a ergence on this issue?Most of us would probably ask how well a mask, especially a one made from cloth, may protect us from Covid-19. But the notion of “personal protection” misses the major reason why calls for increased use of masks and face-coverings have gained momentum around the world. From February, data was emerging that, unlike Sars – where patients were most contagious several days after showing severe symptoms – people infected by Sars-Cov-2, the cause of Covid-19, were “shedding” most viruses (that could infect someone else) just before or at the time symptoms first appeared, often in very mild form. This had two implications: first, efforts to “contain” coronavirus would be orders of magnitude more difficult than for Sars. Second, and as it has turned out more contentiously, the official World Health Organization and UK government advice that masks should only be worn by members of the public showing symptoms, and members of their immediate households, is probably wrong.So what are the objections that have been raised against masks in public as policy? There have been repeated statements that the evidence in favour of masks is flimsy and ambiguous. For medics, the “gold standard” of evidence is the randomised controlled trial (some people take the medicine or undergo the intervention, and some don’t, and we look to see if there were benefits or risks). There have been a few trials looking at masks for preventing influenza, and results were disappointing – although crucially, most of the group meant to wear masks actually didn’t: it turns out we’re just not that scared of catching the flu.But if one looks at the same level of evidence for the other measures strongly advocated by the government, for example hand-washing, studies have been similarly disappointing. And for other advice, such as the two-metre rule, or lockdowns, there have been no trials at all. So masks seem subject to a different standard of evidence than other measures. And while controlled trial data is not available, “natural experiments” do suggest at least a correlation between mask-wearing and reduced Covid-19 transmission. The city of Jena in Germany introduced mandatory mask-wearing on 31 March and recorded no new infections for eight days, while surrounding cities continued to see a rise.That perhaps leaves the final objection, which is that the public wearing masks will ert this scarce resource away from hospitals and care homes. In this sense, the government may simply be dragging its feet because of scarcity – which is a political and economic issue, not a scientific one. It might also explain the recent focus on cloth masks or face-coverings over masks: by advocating these, there is no competition with the NHS. And although less PR-worthy than collaborations with Rolls-Royce to produce ventilators, other partnerships between government and industry could ensure high-quality cloth masks for everyone in the country.As the government equivocates, unlike our European neighbours, the British public may end up being the “control group” for the face mask experiment the government has been demanding all along. But do we want to be?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b72bff2a682aaca63053be15e63ffec62981826e/0_93_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b8a32986b61d17de43c8be4e0c960eb5","title":"lockdown kids screen tween culture real world","story":"My five-year-olds’ screen time is creeping up. Yet when we step out into the real world, everything seems more vivid to them “There’s a ghost fish called Hank in Bora Bora,” said my daughter, finding me in the kitchen after a morning spent on screens.“Fiction or non-fiction?” I said. We bring this question, previously raised by the librarian at my girls’ kindergarten, to every hideous video they watch. It makes me feel slightly better about the whole school of YouTube.“Non-fiction?” she said, and after a long pause, “what’s Bora Bora?”Over five weeks of lockdown, my kids’ daily screen time has crept up, along with the age bracket of the stuff that they’re watching. Gone are the days of endless slime videos and Ryan’s Toys. Now it’s hours of Minecraft and Roblox. YouTube is largely out. TikTok is in. I try to filter the content as much as I can, but at five years old, they’re definitely getting a crash course in tween culture. “You’re the worst,” yelled one the other day – it was like a rehearsal of the slammed doors to come.There are various tricks I perform to make myself feel better about all this – chiefly persuading myself that there’s no other way to occupy two five-year-olds and get any work done. I tell myself that, as kids, we all watched uninterrupted hours of TV and still managed to read books and go to college. I remind myself of those parents who severely limit their kids’ screen time and are, invariably, the same fusspot parents who make their kids go to bed early in the holidays and are one step away from making them wear school uniforms at the weekend.And not all of the screen stuff is as bad as it seems. Minecraft, along with Block Craft and its other versions, is less passive than the baby video stuff. You can build and explore. You can get killed by a zombie, or run away from a wolf. In Roblox, a seemingly infinite series of digital worlds, my kids can be in the same game at once, and when I hear them chatting and strategising I breathe a sigh of relief.I’m trying to hold various lines. I won’t pay for in-game accessories, no matter how hard they beg. And after we’ve done a long day at the coalface, there are no screens in the evening. Being inside and online all day has also changed the way we experience the material world. At the weekend, after spending the best part of the week in our apartment, we go out for a walk and the effect is amazing.The sky is insanely blue. The world, as Louis MacNeice put it, is “suddener than we fancy it”. You’d think my kids had never seen colour before. All of us stand, rapt, before a bank of red tulips, while I take a stab at remembering how pollination works. The online world looks suddenly very shallow and dim, and I’m reminded that misinformation exists IRL, too. Later, my daughter looks at me expectantly after the question about Bora Bora. “It’s in a country called Afghanistan,” I say with confidence."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9887f748b29b61fd0c565c7e15093d80fce67ba2/0_102_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2be011afb7c7eae3b6e11ab26e2e5fcd","title":"the guardian view on the eu and covid 19 better late than never","story":"Europe is in the pandemic frontline but unity among the nations has been rare. That may be changing – not before timeAlmost seven weeks after the World Health Organization confirmed the pandemic, Europe remains in the frontline of the battle to contain the Covid-19 virus. Five of the six countries reporting most cases are in Europe. Seven of the 10 countries reporting most deaths are in our continent too. Yet Europe has struggled to make common cause against the virus. In particular, it has bickered over how to support the most affected European economies against the consequences of the lockdown. In spite of innumerable acts of cross-border solidarity on the medical front, the rich nations of Europe have proved reluctant backers of the continent’s embattled poorer economies.The good news, relatively speaking, is that this ide has not got worse and may, just possibly, have eased a little. This week, leaders of the 27 EU nations finally signed off on a €540bn rescue package. This gives countries such as Italy and Spain, which stand second and third to the United States in Covid-19 cases and deaths, the right to borrow from the eurozone’s bailout mechanism. The problem is that the EU’s southern member states are reluctant to borrow their way out of the problem, in part because they fear that to take on more debt would deepen the inequality between the EU’s south and north.Instead, France and the southern member states want the EU to make financial transfers to its worst-affected members. Some rich states, notably Germany, balk at this. All of them, though, want to avoid a prolongation of the EU’s damaging isions of March and early April. As a result, the EU27 decided on Thursday that they would pass the parcel to Ursula von der Leyen and the European commission, who have been tasked with creating a recovery fund alongside the EU’s next seven-year budget, which is required by the start of 2021.No figures have yet been agreed, but the recovery fund device could prove a smart way of allowing the EU and its richer member states to stand by the poorer ones. In Thursday’s virtual summit, Angela Merkel said that Germany, already the EU budget’s largest net contributor, would make a significantly higher contribution “in the spirit of solidarity”. Ms von der Leyen said afterwards that the EU would be trying to create a funding mechanism that allowed for a balance of grants and loans.This will be anything but easy. Familiar disputes about the size of the EU budget have not disappeared. Indeed, the UK’s departure had made them trickier. Now, in time-honoured fashion, the EU has also kicked the can down the road over the recovery fund. But it cannot do that for long. Ms von der Leyen has only weeks to come up with a package. The package is likely to be enormous. But the economic damage caused by the pandemic means this issue is urgent and could still pose existential questions, as Emmanuel Macron said this week, for the EU itself.This is a huge moment for the EU. But it has direct implications for Britain too. If the Brexit transition was to be extended into 2021, the UK would have to extend its budget contribution too. It is hard to see the current British government contributing to the EU recovery fund as well. Yet there are no easy choices for any government in the wake of the pandemic shutdown. The EU may be ided over the economic response. But if the choice for Britain lies between cooperation with a ided EU and cooperation with a United States led by a delinquent president who advocates ingesting disinfectant, it would be a no-brainer."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4a22ec53abcdd3c04c4e8b954567b314ddfca6ad/0_343_1200_720/master/1200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a46b34aee7f28d6c5dba2ac0fe0d0d08","title":"lockdown culture camera obscura photography","story":"Locked down with your family? Want to impress the kids with a technique Canaletto used in 18th-century Venice? Our writer goes through the pinhole• The best arts and entertainment during self-isolationOur lives could all do with a bit of magic in them right now and Justin Quinnell is promising just that: “Using nothing more than a piece of card,” he says, “people can turn their rooms into camera obscuras and create some true lockdown wonder,” he says.Quinnell helps run World Pinhole photography day, which has been going for 20 years and takes place on Sunday 26 April (Quinnell’s birthday). Last year, more than 2,000 people from 57 countries made pinhole images – usually projecting inverted images of the outside world on to their inside walls – and uploaded them on to a gallery of pictures taken on that day. I suspect there will be more this time around because, as Quinnell points out, “more than ever, we need to see our world in a new light”.When I call the Bristolian university lecturer at midday, he’s wearing a face mask and reading Viz while photographing himself in an inverted room projection – all part of an unusual idea he has for a pinhole photograph. “It’s incredibly stupid,” he admits. “But although this is such an awful time it’s also a vital opportunity to play and experiment.”Quinnell is certainly passionate on his subject. He talks about Canaletto, the 18th-century Venetian painter who used the technique to accurately depict his hometown, and explains how experimenting with different pinholes and materials – thin slits projecting on to shower curtains – opens up whole new worlds. “If you get me going on camera obscuras,” he says, “the pandemic will be over by the time I’ve finished.”After watching a couple of videos (from Quinnell himself and his friend Di Stoppard in New Zealand), I realise I have already done most of the legwork for this project – our youngest child is nine months old and his solitary bedroom window has already been blacked out with military precision in the hope he stops waking us at 2am. That’s the main thing you have to do: pick a room with minimal windows – ideally facing north-ish if you live in the northern hemisphere – and then seal up all the light that comes in using cardboard, bin bags, T-shirts, black tape, tacks … whatever you have to hand. Then cut a tiny hole – about the size of a 5p piece – in the card covering a window to let a tiny beam of light in. Turn off the room’s lights and - hey presto - an inverted image of the outside world should be projected along the back wall.Using a sharp kitchen knife I sliced a hole in my child’s blackout blind. I then stood on a ladder while holding a duvet draped over the door frame (not how I imagined my journalism career at 40 years of age, admittedly, but these are unusual times) to try to block the light coming through the sides. By this time impatience in both children was creeping in, and I had to assuage my three-year-old daughter and her endless questions (“What are you doing?” “Why are you on a ladder?” “Why have you got a knife in Teddy’s bedroom?”) by promising that she would soon witness something both “magical” and “spooky”. I stretched to turn off the bedroom light with my toe and we stood back to gasp … at not much. There was no projection. My little boy started crying in the dark. My daughter was bereft. Meh presto.I tried holding up some white card nearer the window and … well, it wasn’t exactly a super sensory delight. But it was undeniably a murky, upside-down version of the top of the tree in our back garden!“A good start,” said Quinnell politely when I emailed him my efforts. But looking at the work of Abelardo Morell – the “master at this sort of thing”, according to Quinnell – I realised I had some way to go. Morell has projected vast colourful visions of New York’s Central Park, the London Eye and the Pantheon in Rome into his rooms.Quinnell gave me some tips – the sunlight was probably too direct and the hole was probably too narrow and too high. Sure enough, when I next attempted my camera obscura, with a lower, larger hole and the sun having risen further, my card lit up with the back garden in full colour – yellow brick work, green leaves, blue skies and the unmistakable jet black of our satellite dish. Just call me Canaletto.It didn’t photograph too well (Quinnell says you ideally need to use a camera with a 20-30 second exposure) but I could see why people might get the bug for this kind of thing – especially right now. After all, you’re getting the chance to bring the forbidden outdoors inside."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2f2c2c9759ec77d7710a5f2f6ab38cc1d8eef78f/0_0_2968_1781/master/2968.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ce3afac479d75f7249bbf7ff44f80c9e","title":"laura marling webchat post your questions now","story":"To mark the release of her seventh album, Song for Our Daughter, the singer will be answering your questions at midday on Tuesday 28 AprilWhile many musicians have pushed back their planned album releases mid-pandemic, others such as Fiona Apple and Charli XCX have recognised that, actually, fans might quite enjoy hearing a familiar voice at this point in time.Among them is Laura Marling, who released her new album, Song for Our Daughter, in early April, several months ahead of schedule. While it has precisely nothing to do with the coronavirus, it’s an album suited to the potential for self-reflection that this time can offer, finding Marling – the one-time teenage prodigy now 30 years old – assessing her history and landing upon a version of femininity that fits. “Those first two albums were a woman thinking, ‘Why is this my lot in life?’” she told the Independent recently. “As I’ve got older, I’ve changed that to: ‘That won’t be my lot in life. I won’t be reduced to a cultural trope.’ I was indulging in the tragedy, and now that I’m 30, I’ve put reins on those demons and I’m driving them myself. I’m not just a victim.”On the album – her seventh – she projects these revelations on to her future daughter, wondering what kind of experiences she will have. It’s classic Marling – rich with a sense of her own songwriterly mythology, both cryptic and bracing – yet also her most realised work yet.You can ask Marling about any of that, her collaborations with Tunng’s Mike Lindsay as Lump, her love of Seinfeld, Little Women and Instagram comedy, taking inspiration from Paul McCartney’s 1970s solo output – or indeed, anything else that takes your fancy – when she submits to the  webchat experience from noon to 1pm BST on Tuesday 28 April. (Usually these take place in our office – the celeb unspooling their best yarns while Ben or I type frantically – but obviously, lockdown means it’ll be a video chat-facilitated interaction.)

In Scotland, the government has announced a £5m package of emergency financial support.The NUS has called on the government to supply a £60 million hardship fund that would provide students with a “safety net” during the coronavirus lockdown. The NUS also demanded that universities reimburse students’ tuition fees and allow them to retake the year to make up for the disruption to their degrees.This has been echoed by cross-party MPs, who have asked the chancellor to set up emergency maintenance grants for those who are not entitled to claim universal credit.Lily Taylor, a master’s student at Sheffield Hallam University, lives off £90 a week after being furloughed from her bar job, along with her savings that will run out soon. “The hardest part is having no space to study,” she says. “In the house I rent we have a high-up dining table with stools. I have a bad back after an accident a couple of years ago and I can’t sit here for longer than 20 minutes without it being a strain.”Taylor tried asking her university if it could supply her with a desk chair. She was told to apply for the university’s hardship fund, but says her application was denied. “I’m stuck on my own in Sheffield, 160 miles away from my friends and family, and I’m worried about how I’m going to be able to complete my dissertation.”Sheffield Hallam has launched a crowdfunding appeal to raise money for struggling students after its usual hardship fund was overwhelmed by requests from students as a result of the pandemic.Similar measures have been announced by the University of York and the University of Greenwich. Greenwich has also offered free laptops and broadband for students and staff, while students at the University of Loughborough can request free meals if they are struggling to cope financially while stranded on campus.But students will need to meet certain eligibility criteria to receive support. Sophie Cartwright, a master’s student, applied for the University of Birmingham’s hardship fund after losing her income from three part-time jobs. Although she comes from a single-parent, lower socioeconomic background, she says she doesn’t meet requirements.“The university requires any postgraduate applicant to have a minimum average of £180 a week in income throughout the academic year in order to even apply to the fund. This is extremely counterintuitive as it means those who most need the financial support are immediately not eligible,” she says.Some students who have lost their jobs were employed by universities themselves – in campus shops or student unions, for example – and are frustrated by the lack of clarity around the future of their employment.Issy Emmitt, a third-year student at the University of Bath, was working two jobs on campus before the outbreak, as both a student ambassador and in the campus supermarket. When the lockdown began, she and other student employees were informed via a Facebook page that there was no more work available at the shop.“Those of us working zero-hour contracts on campus still haven’t been told whether or not we have been officially furloughed or just plain fired yet – four weeks on,” she says. “A coursemate of mine lost three campus jobs and estimates her losses to be already around £1,000.” In the meantime, Emmitt is worried about how she will pay rent. “I have no savings because of how expensive living in Bath is, and so I’m suddenly in a position where I not only can’t afford my rent, but even basic living necessities,” she says. “I also can’t move home at the moment as my father is severely immunocompromised.”Rent is a major concern for hard-pressed students. Nearly 75,000 students have signed a petition for universities to suspend all student accommodation rent for those who have returned home due to Covid-19.For students like Cartwright, the financial pressures may be too much. “If I do not receive additional support, I will likely not be able to finance somewhere in Birmingham to live for the remainder of my degree,” she says. “I won’t be able to afford a deposit or save up rent upfront for the new property. Due to the hands on nature of my degree, I need to be in Birmingham to complete my dissertation. I do not wish to drop out, but this is something I’m unfortunately forced to consider.”Some names have been changed"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/70b1df72795ce06ae25c7c73dbf6bfd75d1ba117/0_275_4724_2835/master/4724.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2d1f67acb0fae7ae5cc77d44a083f7cb","title":"italy home schooling coronavirus lockdown what weve learned","story":"Schools in northern Italy were the first in Europe to close. Since then, teachers, parents and kids across the country have all had to adapt to a new existence – and the results have surprised everyone. By  Tobias JonesMost of us in Emilia-Romagna, in northern Italy, remember the weekend of 22 February very clearly. To begin with there were just rumours – phone calls and messages flying around between friends – but then it was confirmed: all schools in the region were going to close for a week.The decision was, in many ways, shocking. At that time, there had only been three deaths from Covid-19 in Italy, and only 152 reported infections. It seemed strange that education was the first social activity to be sacrificed. I guessed it was because it wasn’t perceived to be economically productive. Nothing else was closing: football grounds, bars, shops and ski resorts were still open for business, and no schools in any other European country had closed.Still, to our three kids – Benny (15), Emma (13) and Leo (9) – the idea of a week off seemed like bliss. We had moved back to Parma from the UK three years earlier, and by comparison with the UK, education here seemed relentless. Many pupils go to school six days a week and there are no half-term holidays. But my wife, Francesca, who is Italian, and I were both worried. She works with Syrian refugees, which isn’t a job you can suddenly drop, and I had just been offered a 9-to-5 job, after 21 years of being freelance. We, like all our friends, suddenly had an acute childcare crisis.The announcement had been so sudden that schools had few plans or resources in place to teach remotely. Italy spends a lot less on education than almost every other western country. Spending per student (from primary school to university) equates to $8,966 per annum, compared to $11,028 in the UK and $11,502 in Sweden. The under-investment is so serious that in December 2019, the education minister, Lorenzo Fioramonti, resigned in protest.Nor did many Italian teachers seem to know how to approach this new world in which they found themselves. There is minimal teacher-training in Italy. University graduates are often thrown into a classroom without any knowledge of pedagogic theories or practical experience. Inspections are almost unheard of. The result is that Italian education is, at its worst, particularly conservative and condescending: the pupil is seen as an empty vessel to be filled with knowledge that is regurgitated in exams.But if Italian schools weren’t perfect, they were surely better than nothing. The idea that we now had to recreate formal education within the narrow walls of a city flat with no garden was daunting. We lacked the time, energy or even knowledge to replace their teachers. Nor, the kids made it clear, did they even want us to try.Parents and teachers across the country had to scramble to devise ways continue our children’s learning. But slowly – over the course of two months – something rather unexpected happened. As we started to ponder how this experiment of home schooling could best be delivered, it began to feel as if it was us, the parents and teachers, as much as the pupils, who were being educated.The first week off school was the lull before the storm. It genuinely felt like a holiday. Being pragmatic and slightly puritan, we don’t let the kids watch TV, or ourselves drink alcohol, on weekdays. When it was announced that school was closed, we lifted the rules. On 1 March, another week of school closures was announced, so we went up to the mountains, half an hour outside the city, to plant trees and play cards. On 4 March, a new government decree announced that every school in Italy would be suspended the following day.In those early days it was all fun. I left the children spelling tests under their plates or pillows, and if they wanted to watch TV they had to learn elements of the periodic table or the bones of the human skeleton or how to tie knots. It felt as if we were, finally, the right side of that ancient Roman dichotomy of “otium-negotium”, an idea to which Italians occasionally refer. Otium was the time of creative repose when you were able to freewheel and follow your fancies – unlike negotium, which was all about business and the practical side of life.We had a few advantages, I suppose. The ages of our kids mean that there are no tantrums at one end, and no alcohol or boyfriend issues at the other. We enjoy just hanging out together. I’ve also spent much of my life teaching. I’ve taught everywhere from primary schools to prisons and universities. For years, at home, we’ve had mealtime quizzes. One Christmas, Benny even gifted the family three bells of the kind they have in hotel receptions so that we could truly have “fingers on buzzers”.The few educational theories I have come from the British psychoanalyst Donald Winnicott, who believed that play is the path to a child’s wholeness and wellbeing. Games give children the chance to make decisions for themselves and provide an opportunity for spontaneity, fun, deceit and calculation. So for those first two weeks we played incessantly: perudo (“liars’ dice”), blackjack, euchre, backgammon and epic table-tennis tournaments with various handicaps (playing left-handed or subtracting your age from your score). The kids weren’t learning much, but at least poor old Leo was learning to be a good loser.Being the youngest, he needed some fun, and since at this point his class had as yet no lessons organised, I asked his teacher if we could make 10-minute English lessons for his classmates. The aim was as much to cheer them up as to learn English. We would wear wigs and teach his peers the English names for body parts by sawing them off and using lots of fake blood. We taught grammar through declining lavatorial verbs. Emma would edit the videos and we would send them to the class WhatsApp group, which had, until now, been a basic tool for school admin and parental gossip.Despite all those good intentions, it was hard not to feel inadequate, even anxious. Well-meaning messages were circulating among parents about which museums, theatres, aquariums and zoos had opened their virtual doors. Many were posting pictures of their well-behaved children clicking their way through the Guggenheim, while ours were watching House on Netflix. We quickly felt defeated by the sheer volume of offerings, and guilty that we weren’t sharing these cultural delights with our children.The following weekend, on 8 March, the government announced that the whole of Emilia-Romagna (plus Lombardy and the Veneto) was to be placed in lockdown, and that schools would be closed for at least another month. Three days later, on 11 March, the entire country went into full lockdown.We were slowly realising how dark things were becoming. On 12 March, we passed 1,000 nationwide deaths, and only four days later passed 2,000. There was defiance and denial as we sang on balconies and people hung out bedsheets with the wrong-headed slogan “andrà tutto bene” (“it’ll all be fine”), but the mood was turning as the death toll continued to rise.It was at this point that teachers dumped a load of homework on their pupils. Having had a fortnight to plan how to teach through the crisis, many decided that the best way was to send out entire chapters of books for children to learn, and hundreds of pages of exercises to complete. After a fortnight of freedom, pupils were now overloaded.The other thing that changed was that my new job started. For the first time this century, I had bosses and meetings and responsibilities. It brought to an abrupt end my educational clowning. Suddenly no one in the family had much spare time and nor, it seemed, such good cheer.The closing of all Italy’s schools meant teachers found themselves having to invent a new kind of classroom from scratch. There were no ministerial guidelines or approved websites. “The entirety of this new form of online teaching,” said Daniele Martino, a middle-school teacher in Turin, “was created by us teachers at the last minute.”At the beginning, it was chaotic. There was little coordination between different teachers within the same schools, let alone across different schools, and parents reported finding themselves boggled by a vast array of IT platforms: Meet, Classroom, Zoom, Jitsi, Edmodo. The problem wasn’t only that sites and servers crashed as the country’s almost 8 million students all logged on. Many kids couldn’t connect at all.At the start, I got the sense that no one really knew how to do what was becoming known as “DAD” – didattica a distanza, or long-distance learning. When teachers were struggling with IT, it was often their pupils who came to the rescue. “I have an exceptional digital consultant”, said Claudio Dionesalvi, a literature teacher in Calabria. “He’s 11, and is one of my students. He’s like a junior version of Mr Wolf in Pulp Fiction.”The teacher-pupil balance also shifted. In an online classroom, if pupils aren’t interested or motivated, they can hide far more easily. They can feign technological issues, freeze the camera, mute the microphone. Around this time, I did a few online lessons for various schools and saw the problem close up: when the pupils weren’t engaged they would drift away and, not having them there in front of you, you couldn’t bring them back into the circle.Teachers were having to learn new ways to draw their students out. “I could no longer do the classic head-on, knowledge-passing lesson,” said Betta Salvini, a history teacher in Parma. “I now involve them all the time, I turn the lesson upside down so that they are the protagonists, so that I hear their voices.”But school was also being reinvented because Italy’s traditional educational stick had been removed. Usually pupils are given many tests each month and if, at the end of the year, their average score is insufficient, they’re bocciato – failed – and have to repeat the year. Now, teachers quickly realised there was no way to stop students cheating in tests. When someone is in their bedroom, and all you can see is their face, you have no idea if they have the book open on their lap, or are messaging friends or Googling the answer.Traditionalist teachers were beside themselves. One parent in Umbria told me how a teacher stormed out of the virtual classroom when she discovered how many pupils were cheating. Then the new education minister, Lucia Azzolina, suggested that in the circumstances, no pupils would be sent back to repeat the year again. Between the cheating and the automatic promotion to the next school year, teachers who needed a big stick suddenly found themselves disarmed.“Many of my colleagues are really struggling”, said Riccardo Giannitrapani, a maths teacher in a secondary school in Udine. These two months, he told me, have been more about a re-education of teachers than of pupils. “Before, we used to discuss students in meetings by giving them numbers, even down to decimal points – 5.4, 5.5.” These marks, he said, became an end in themselves, creating acute anxiety among not only the children, but also their parents.There has always been a battle in Italy between hardliners and child-centred reformers such as Maria Montessori. It now seemed as if progressives had the upper hand. Salvatore Giuliano, a headteacher in Brindisi and a former deputy education minister, told me: “A child of 15 has far more creativity than we have. Every time you give them the freedom and tools to create something, they will astonish you.” Giuliano described some memorable student-led presentations he has seen in recent weeks. His favourite was an extended family – parents, siblings and grandparents – all dressed up as the planets and moving around the room.Many teachers have had to soften their approach, to take into account what their pupils were going through. “Some of them have lost a grandparent”, said Paola Lante, a primary-school teacher in Milan. “Their parents are losing their jobs or are fighting at home. At the end of the day, a teacher has to be a steadying influence, a social worker and a psychologist.”At the beginning of the lockdown, Giannitrapani, the maths teacher in Udine, published an open letter to his pupils saying that he shouldn’t be the one overloading them, but vice versa – they should be bombarding him with their questions. Sara Scotellaro, in Naples, has 120 pupils in various classes: “They no longer have a timetable and you have to be constantly available”, she said. “They have this need to be immediately reassured – that their work has been received, that it’s OK, that you’re happy with them.”That fluidity of boundaries has had advantages and disadvantages. In video lessons some pupils have found it embarrassing to share their personal spaces – their bedrooms and, in the background, even their embarrassing parents. Many teachers describe seeing a new side to their students. “There’s no longer the intimidation of the pack,” said one teacher, “and so they’re bringing out what they really know. I’ve got a 13-year-old, the son of two ex-offenders, who has produced some diaries of extraordinary depth.” Lante told me about a very timid student who never speaks in class but who, it only now emerges, is exceptional at languages. “It makes you understand”, said Lante, “that we need a very varied form of education”.By the third week of March, after a month with no school, Francesca and I were also beginning to see our children in a new light. Like most kids, they’re monosyllabic when describing their days at school – “fine” usually does it. Now, as lessons were literally taking place in the kitchen, we were unexpectedly in the classroom with them. We could see what was going on.It was both painful and funny. We realised that one of our children, exuberant and confident at home, often froze when asked a question in class. Another, usually conscientious and honest, was asked by her teacher to show her artwork. Because it hadn’t turned out too well, she held up her drawing up against the window, and held the painting she was supposed to have copied behind it, so it showed through behind her own. That mini-deceit made her work look rather sophisticated.Another consequence of lessons taking place at home was that the greatest problem in schools – boisterous disturbances – suddenly subsided. One of our children has a class that is usually very noisy: the kids misbehave and the teacher yells, and soon everyone is shouting over each other. Now, with the children subdued by their parents’ presence, and the teacher aware that parents could be listening, there was a new-found calm to the lessons and, we thought, a genuine warmth to the encounters.But there was no timetable to our children’s lessons. There were odd hours here and there, sometimes in the early morning, sometimes mid-afternoon. Our elderly laptops and wifi were often inadequate, and so the only working devices were passed around. There wasn’t a lot of rhythm or relaxation to our day. Francesca and I were still trying to take up a lot of slack, but as March turned into April, our initial energy had subsided.We had passed 10,000, then 15,000 deaths from Covid-19. Even though the kids had enough spare time to be habitually bored, they were no longer cleaning the house or doing their daily learning tasks. Spelling tests and fitness regimes were forgotten. They seemed to have become – if not agoraphobic – certainly “agora-meh”. They wouldn’t even walk around the block. They were getting up later each day, and even when vertical, it became hard to persuade them to get out of pyjamas.As often happens when you stop doing something, you suddenly wonder why you were doing it in the first place. Benny, who has been obsessive about ballet all her life and attends a dance academy, entered a profound crisis. She said she wanted to stop dancing altogether. Even Leo, a football fanatic, barely mentioned or played with a football any more. It felt as if their passions had evaporated somehow.It’s hard, as a parent, not to be frustrated, especially if – as a writer – you regret that they never read books. Every time I emerged from my office, I would see them all on their screens, headphones on. Lessons had become indistinguishable from down-time. For all the idealism about digital learning, it seemed extraordinarily passive to me.I tried to take things in hand. Mealtimes were raucous because they had so much pent-up energy, so I thought “if they’re not going to read, I’ll read to them”. I would bring a book to table, not realising that I was becoming just like one of the conservative teachers I had always scorned, force-feeding them my passions and using knowledge to sedate and subdue. They would snigger and scoff. “I just don’t get poetry,” Emma grumbled.Fortunately they have a wiser mother. We have no garden, but four balconies, and as spring came on, Francesca was planting and weeding. The children were drawn to the gardening, perhaps because it was everything their schooling isn’t – outdoors and manual. Emma propagated her succulents and so needed more shelf space, and went to the garage to do some carpentry. They began sewing, and cooking cappelletti, croissants and – their much-missed English snack – digestive biscuits.It’s hard to know how much it was more to do with psychology or spare time, but they all began rearranging their bedrooms, moving beds and desks. It was as if they were rearranging their internal and external furniture. Photographs, pictures and books were culled, others were added. They asked for new haircuts. Francesca and I watched it all and tried to work out ways to keep bringing them out of both their closed bedrooms and their private worlds.I changed my approach. I know that theatricality is sometimes helpful in teaching, so one evening, as I read a poem, I put a small shiny box on the table. They pretended to listen, but were all watching that box, wondering what the game was. I had chosen to read Seamus Heaney’s Digging. It’s a poem about how we look up to, and down on, our parents. It’s about the difficulty of a writer feeling worthy of agricultural ancestors because the pen is nothing compared with the depth of a spade. But it’s also about the need for children to go their own way and not, perhaps, feel unworthy. When I had finished, I just passed them the box. Inside I had cut up all the words of the poem. “Go on then,” I said, “write it your way.”Suddenly they were excited about poetry. They snatched words from each other, tried them out here and there. As they laughed, the slim pieces of paper flew around the table. With its farmyard diction – “squelch”, “slap”, “rump” – the poem now seemed earthy rather than erudite. Instead of being told to admire a Grecian urn, they now had the clay in their hands.As they found their new hybrid role of being both pupils and teachers, we said they could award themselves marks both for content (a letter) and effort (a number). It was really, of course, just a way to show them that marks aren’t about approval (external) but honesty (internal).The more you look at the educational conundrum in lockdown Italy, the more you see everyone’s vulnerabilities. Students have always felt fretful because of their weekly tests and the stigma of being held back a year. But now many teachers feel insecure, too: not just because education seems like the last priority of government, but because they are scared of digitalised learning and fear being replaced by screens.Even those who relish the technology, like the Calabrian teacher Claudio Dionesalvi, are concerned: “Distance-learning is a strange video game,” he said, “but in the end it’s a torture. A teacher can’t be holed up in front of a screen. They risk becoming two-dimensional – an artificial TV personality.”Many parents are anxious, not just because their children are losing out on formative months of learning, but also because – without those marks – they have no measure of their offspring’s progress. Chiara Esposito, a middle-school teacher, told me “parents are the most conservative element in the school ecosystem. They become paranoid if their child isn’t ‘an eight’ or hasn’t completed the set book. They’re the ones we really need to educate.”Surprisingly, even the education technology firms promoting digital learning platforms to schools feel apprehensive. Lorenzo Benussi is the chief innovation officer of the Fondazione per la Scuola della Compagnia di San Paolo, which promotes inclusivity and creativity in education, and a former technical adviser to the minister of education. He is concerned that teachers are using new tech to reproduce the same old teaching methods, instead of grasping this opportunity for a completely new kind of teaching. “When all this talk about digital learning began back in March,” he said, “I was very, very worried, because it’s not about technology. Technology is just a means. Its effectiveness depends entirely on your didactic approach.”Edoardo Montenegro from Betwyll, which is launching a new social reading app with educational publisher Pearson for Italian schools in September, says something very similar: “A WhatsApp video call or a Zoom meeting isn’t digital learning. Those encounters can be just as frontal and rhetorical as an old-style professorial lesson.”No one knows when formal schooling will resume, and everyone feels uncertain of what their role will be when it does. But uncertainty is, according to the great educationalist Loris Malaguzzi, actually a vital ingredient for inclusive, collegiate learning. Only “a willingness to question all your own abilities and knowledge”, he said in 1992, two years before his death, leads to humility and listening. That, he said, “is how we educate each other together.”It’s exactly two months since the schools closed in Emilia-Romagna. And to us, in our city apartment, it does feel as if, in the gentle argy-bargy of family life, we’ve been educating each other. Maybe it would have happened anyway, but it’s changed how we see ourselves. The girl destined to be a ballerina seems to be mourning the end of that dream. The perfectionist has glimpsed a goal that’s deeper than marks out of 10. The boy who seemed riotous has been revealed as nervously studious. The teacher has become an accompanist and the gardener our guide. And with almost five months to go until schools (possibly) reopen in mid-September, I’m sure we’ve still got a lot to learn.• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8526881daf2daa8f50bd3e9345fb1ad7d4d568ec/0_191_5200_3121/master/5200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f03f76549143dbbaa01f75ce69e2f8d9","title":"coronavirus detected particles air pollution","story":"Exclusive: Scientists examine whether this route enables infections at longer distancesCoronavirus has been detected on particles of air pollution by scientists investigating whether this could enable it to be carried over longer distances and increase the number of people infected.The work is preliminary and it is not yet known if the virus remains viable on pollution particles and in sufficient quantity to cause disease.The Italian scientists used standard techniques to collect outdoor air pollution samples at one urban and one industrial site in Bergamo province and identified a gene highly specific to Covid-19 in multiple samples. The detection was confirmed by blind testing at an independent laboratory.Leonardo Setti at the University of Bologna in Italy, who led the work, said it was important to investigate if the virus could be carried more widely by air pollution.“I am a scientist and I am worried when I don’t know,” he said. “If we know, we can find a solution. But if we don’t know, we can only suffer the consequences.”Two other research groups have suggested air pollution particles could help coronavirus travel further in the air.A statistical analysis by Setti’s team suggests higher levels of particle pollution could explain higher rates of infection in parts of northern Italy before a lockdown was imposed, an idea supported by another preliminary analysis. The region is one of the most polluted in Europe.Neither of the studies by Setti’s team have been peer-reviewed and therefore have not been endorsed by independent scientists. But experts agree their proposal is plausible and requires investigation.Previous studies have shown that air pollution particles do harbour microbes and that pollution is likely to have carried the viruses causing bird flu, measles and foot-and-mouth disease over considerable distances.The potential role of air pollution particles is linked to the broader question of how the coronavirus is transmitted. Large virus-laden droplets from infected people’s coughs and sneezes fall to the ground within a metre or two. But much smaller droplets, less than 5 microns in diameter, can remain in the air for minutes to hours and travel further.Experts are not sure whether these tiny airborne droplets can cause coronavirus infections, though they know the 2003 Sars coronavirus was spread in the air and that the new virus can remain viable for hours in tiny droplets.But researchers say the importance of potential airborne transmission, and the possible boosting role of pollution particles, mean it must not be ruled out without evidence.Epidemics of infectious diseases behave in different ways but the\u0026nbsp1918 influenza pandemic\u0026nbspthat killed more than 50 million people is regarded as a key example of a pandemic that occurred in multiple waves, with the latter more severe than the first. It has been replicated – albeit more mildly – in subsequent flu pandemics.How and why multiple-wave outbreaks occur, and how subsequent waves of infection can be prevented, has become a staple of epidemiological modelling studies and pandemic preparation, which have looked at everything from social behaviour and health policy to vaccination and the buildup of community immunity, also known as herd immunity.This is being watched very carefully. Without a vaccine, and with no widespread immunity to the new disease, one alarm is being sounded by the experience of Singapore, which has seen a sudden\u0026nbspresurgence in infections\u0026nbspdespite being lauded for its early handling of the outbreak.Although Singapore instituted a strong contact tracing system for its general population, the disease re-emerged in\u0026nbspcramped dormitory accommodation\u0026nbspused by thousands of foreign workers with inadequate hygiene facilities and shared canteens.Singapore’s experience, although very specific, has demonstrated the ability of the disease to come back strongly in places where people are in close proximity and its ability to exploit any weakness in public health regimes set up to counter it.Conventional wisdom among scientists suggests second waves of resistant infections occur after the capacity for treatment and isolation becomes exhausted. In this case the concern is that the social and political consensus supporting lockdowns is being overtaken by public frustration and the urgent need to reopen economies.The threat declines when susceptibility of the population to the disease falls below a certain threshold or when widespread vaccination becomes available.In general terms the ratio of susceptible and immune iniduals in a population at the end of one wave determines the potential magnitude of a subsequent wave. The worry right now is that with\u0026nbspa vaccine still months away, and the real rate of infection only being guessed at, populations worldwide remain highly vulnerable to both resurgence and subsequent waves.Prof Jonathan Reid at Bristol University in the UK is researching airborne transmission of coronavirus. “It is perhaps not surprising that while suspended in air, the small droplets could combine with background urban particles and be carried around.”He said the virus had been detected in tiny droplets collected indoors in China.Setti said tiny droplets between 0.1 and 1 micron may travel further when coalesced with pollution particles up to 10 microns than on their own. This is because the combined particle is larger and less dense than the droplet and can remain buoyed by the air for longer.Prof Frank Kelly at Imperial College London said the idea of pollution particles carrying the virus further afield was an interesting one. “It is possible, but I would like to see this work repeated by two or three groups.”Other research has indicated correlations between increased Covid-19 deaths and higher levels of air pollution before the pandemic. Long-term exposure to dirty air is known to damage lung health, which could make people more vulnerable to Covid-19.• Coronavirus and volunteering: how can I help in the UK?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6c80883bdbe3e3a30a2bbc3f5bba26ace40e38b2/0_0_2109_1406/master/2109.jpg?width=1010\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e7a763d4fdfeaad18667fb892c65e9ad 1010w","title":"anna jones recipes quick pickle versatile dal vinegar","story":"Vinegar is an unsung hero of the kitchen, as proven by these any-way lentils, and speedy, any-veg pickleA week or so before lockdown, I ordered a few bottles of vinegar from my friend Andy Harris of the Vinegar Shed.

The left-back made six substitute appearances in the second half of the 2018-19 season but has exploded into life this campaign.In February he mesmerised a world audience as Bayern took Chelsea apart and won 3-0 at Stamford Bridge in the first leg of their Champions League last-16 tie, prompting Lineker to tweet: “Alphonso Davies’ parents fled Liberia in the civil war. He was born in a refugee camp in Ghana and moved to Canada when he was five. Here he is playing beautifully for Bayern at 19. What a wonderful story.” Davies, who extended his contract with Bayern this week, is widely liked for his amiable personality and refusal to take himself too seriously, as evidenced by his daft TikTok videos. Yet he is dedicated in his support of refugees, working closely with the United Nations high commissioner for refugees (UNHCR) as a high-profile supporter. On Saturday, Davies will play three live-streamed matches in a Pro Evolution Soccer tournament against Milan’s on-loan goalkeeper Asmir Begovic, a former refugee himself, to raise funds for UNHCR’s Covid-19 response. Gary Lineker Alphonso, it’s lovely to sort of meet you, even though it’s in these circumstances. First of all, how are you doing in isolation?Alphonso Davies Yeah, I’m good. The team started training a couple of weeks ago so I’m happy for that. But it’s a tough situation right now, so I guess we just have to play our part and stay inside.Lineker I’m sure we’ll all get back to playing football once again. You have obviously had some hardships in your life, particularly growing up as a refugee. Do you remember your formative years in the Buduburam refugee camp?Davies I can’t really remember too much about those years. I wish I could. I can’t even really remember kicking a football around, although I know I did. It’s not a memory they want to share with their kids too often, but they talked about it a little bit because it’s part of our story.Lineker Do you ever feel the urge to go back to Ghana or Liberia?Davies I asked my parents about it because we still have family in both countries but the way things are going right now I will have to wait a little bit longer.Lineker Things have gone amazingly well for you since your family moved to Canada, but it must have been a massive step for them.Davies Yeah it was tough, but it was also an amazing feeling – being able to go to a country and do what you want to do, be who you want to be. I think my family did well. I’m very proud of them.Lineker And you finally had the chance to go to school, which should be an important part of any child’s life.Davies Exactly. I enjoyed every moment of being at school. Football doesn’t last for ever, so you need an education longer term.Lineker When did you start to realise that you were quite good at this game?Lineker You were just 14 when you left home and moved to Vancouver. I heard that your mother was particularly worried that you might go astray and become a bad boy.Lineker Who did you support when you were younger?Lineker Really? And look at what you just did to Chelsea!Davies Exactly! My dad really liked Didier Drogba and there was always a Chelsea game on when I was growing up. There were so many amazing teams to watch but I didn’t particularly have a team. So it was Chelsea by force.Lineker You were just 15 when you made your Major League Soccer debut for Whitecaps and, in 2017, after receiving Canadian citizenship, you became the youngest player to appear for the Canadian men’s team. Then, in 2018, when you were 18, you were Canada’s men’s player of the year. You must have been incredibly proud.Davies It makes me feel like all the hard work I’ve been doing over the years is really paying off. The coach saw something in me when I became a citizen of Canada and he took me to the national team camp… Being men’s player of the year was a shock!Lineker And, of course, in January 2019 you moved to Bayern Munich. How did that come about? I think a lot of European clubs, including Manchester United, Chelsea and Liverpool, were looking at you at the time.Davies There were rumours in the air that all these different clubs were looking at me but I didn’t know which specific clubs. No one told me anything. And then I got a message: “Bayern Munich want to meet you.” I was like: “Oh my god. Really?” It was both exciting and scary. I just had to prove to myself that I could compete at this level.Lineker What was it like on the first day? Was it intimidating meeting all the superstar Bayern players like Lewandowski and Neuer?Davies Yes! I’d watched these guys on TV since I was a kid and there I was, seeing them in person, training with them and playing with them. I was very intimidated. When Arjen Robben introduced himself to me, I just couldn’t believe it.Lineker Do you think your previous experiences in life, as a refugee and then moving from Edmonton to Vancouver as a boy, helped ease your move to Germany?Davies I think so. Those moves definitely prepared me for moving overseas. If I hadn’t already made those moves, I’d be very homesick every single day. I am still homesick but I can deal with it.Lineker We live in such challenging times. You are a supporter of UNHCR. Did you want to give something back perhaps?Davies I want to use my platform to talk about refugees and my personal story to inspire people to reach out and help. It’s so hard for people in refugee camps to do any kind of social distancing. They need clean water, soap to wash their hands and food.Lineker I’ve seen some of your videos on TikTok and you’re quite the personality on there aren’t you? Singing, dancing, all sorts …Davies Football comes first, but I want to be an actor eventually.I like entertaining people and TikTok gives me the platform to do so. It allows fans to not only see what I do on the field, but also to get to know my personality a bit more.

But under lockdown, it’s always quietI live in the keepers’ lodge in London zoo. It’s a big shared house on site where eight zookeepers run a rota to care for the animals and man phones overnight. My mum loves telling people I live in Regent’s Park. I grew up in an animal-loving household. At one point there was me, Mum and Dad, two cats, two dogs, two rabbits, a hamster, a tortoise and a cockatoo, so it is normal for me to be surrounded by animals.After studying marine biology at university, I worked for the RSPCA, taking in injured seals and ducklings near the Norfolk coast. But I had always had my sights set on London zoo. For two weeks, I went there every day, handing out my CV to anyone in a suit until I got an interview. I started work as a zookeeper in November 2001.Eleven years later, I applied for it to become my home, too – a select group of experienced keepers are allowed to live on site in the lodge. It’s an experience like no other, and one every zookeeper wants. There’s a competitive interview process which includes vetting, problem-solving, and an assessment of your housemate credentials. It took me three attempts, but I eventually made the cut.The responsibility was scary when I first moved in. Tiny noises startled me. I didn’t sleep for a month, even with security on site. These days, though, I consider it home. Every morning I wake up at seven when our gibbon, Jimmy, starts singing loudly. I take a coffee into the garden and chat to the harrier hawks and the ibis in the aviary behind the house. We’ve hand-reared baby animals in our lodge. We took turns to feed our sloth, Edward, through the night when his mother couldn’t, and built him a jungle gym from broom handles. Beanie, a newborn giant anteater, lived with us, too.The best time is sunset, when the gates have closed. I’ll take a walk around and hear Bhanu, our male lion, roar and the ringtail lemurs crawl out and relax it sounds as if they’re chuckling.A keeper will say they don’t have favourite animals, but it’s a lie. Mine are small monkeys called emperor tamarins. I helped a pair breed a family of 10 by playing Barry White when I worked in the rainforest house.I’m on overnight duty three times each fortnight, which can involve sleepless nights: answering building alarms, administering medicine to animals or taking calls from the public. Sometimes they’ve found injured animals, which we refer on to the RSPCA. Occasionally someone says an animal has escaped but I’ve never known it happen. Once, the police called for advice when a bag of snakes was dumped outside a tube station.In normal times, I’m allowed to have friends over – as long as they don’t wander off – and we’re close to central London so I can go to the pub when I’m off-duty. My wife of two years lives down the road. When I’m not on duty, I’ll go to her or she’ll be here with me. When we got married, we took our guests around the zoo before opening time.Coronavirus has changed everything. On 21 March, the zoo closed to the public for the first time since the second world war, so it’s always quiet now. Some keepers moved into our overnight visitor experience lodges and about 50 staff are still working shifts. I miss answering visitors’ questions and showing off our animals. The pygmy goats miss being petted and are getting extra massages from staff. We’ve hidden food for the meerkats to find, and puzzles for the squirrel monkeys. The big cats are less fussed and enjoy the spring sunshine.We wear personal protective equipment to prepare food and activities. Colds have passed between humans and primates we’re unsure if coronavirus can, but it’s important to be safe.The animals are being well looked after but this is still a worrying time. The zoo is a charity, so entry tickets fund our conservation work, which filters through to scientists in the field. That’s all dried up now.Living and working here is an unusual existence but, at 42, it can’t get any better for me. I have animals in my back garden that are threatened or extinct in the wild. Even though we’re in lockdown, if I feel low I can stretch my legs and have a chat with a lion or an okapi. It’s a dream job. I couldn’t imagine doing anything else.• As told to Deborah Linton.Do you have an experience to share?

Am I alone? It’s seven years too late to askMy wife and I decided to see what all the fuss is about with this show called Game Of Thrones. I would like to say I haven’t seen it because I haven’t got round to it, but the truth is I have a history of not engaging with things for the sake of being a contrarian. Everybody was talking about it and so I wilfully avoided it, although I was pretty sure I would like it.I have given up on that philosophy. I saw a post on Facebook, something like: “I have never seen a single episode of The Sopranos and people look at me like I’m a unicorn.” I realised I didn’t want to be that unicorn and watched all six series of The Sopranos in a single sitting.You can get misled by the hype. For the best part of last month, social media was comprised entirely of “How mental is Netflix’s The Tiger King?!” posts. I was so suckered by it that I was expecting the story of a man who ejaculates wild cats and raises them as his gay lovers. It was a great show, but the effect had been softened for me.I had no such problems tucking into Game Of Thrones. All I remembered from the days when everyone was talking about it was that it has dragons, bare breasts and a terrible ending. So we sat down to watch it with little expectation beyond that.It is, of course, brilliant. But I have issues, mainly that it was only in season six that I began to understand who everyone was. The sheer quantity of character information and backstory that the show is constantly smashing into your head is hard to take. It makes me acutely aware of the fact that you can hold only a finite amount of working information in your head one day very soon, I am going to forget my online banking password because I know way too much about the Targaryen family tree.But the main thing that has shocked me has been the brutality of the violence. You see people getting their throats slit as often as you see them eating. Everybody dies, and rarely peacefully. One character gets arrowed to death on the toilet. Unexpected death and violence seems imminent for every single person, yet none of them seem to show the slightest degree of anxiety.It’s my reaction to the violence, however, that I have found most surprising. I have gone from somebody who doesn’t mind any level of gore to a pearl-clutcher of the highest order. On occasion, I have looked away from the screen or gasped. It has been a voyage of discovery. My wife feels the same way, and we have wondered if we are weirdos, but the problem with watching a show so late is that you can’t discuss it with other people. I’m not going to phone my friends and say, “Do you remember in Game Of Thrones about seven years ago when they had that Red Wedding? That was mad, wasn’t it?”I presented an award alongside Maisie Williams, who plays Arya Stark, a few years ago. I had not watched a single episode of Game Of Thrones at the time. I am so annoyed now that I didn’t tell her how brilliant she was, even if I know I would have fan-boyed horrifically, before saying: “Isn’t it ever so violent, though?”We will be sad to say goodbye to Game Of Thrones this week, as we watch its final episodes. We are, however, looking forward to starting on our next brand-new show: Breaking Bad."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4a2104a1c6efc717d24bc29b9766fa8f8cd068ca/0_0_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bf57269c41d6b52a7b8711c9a5344f06","title":"i slept with my best friends ex now im terrified of confrontation","story":"Your reluctance to have a conversation with her could mask a deeper desire to always be in control, says Annalisa BarbieriI have a fear of confrontation. Recently, this destroyed my relationship with my best friend, after I slept with her ex. I did not tell her for several months, and developed my own twisted logic that I was somehow protecting her from the painful truth. When I did tell her, she made me realise my refusal to tell the truth had hurt her more than the action itself.It’s been a year, and I haven’t spoken to her or her ex (who was also my friend). My way of dealing with the situation was to suppress thinking about it for months and continue with my life. However, partly owing to my relationship with my new partner (who is highly emotionally intelligent), I have started to reflect on the situation. I know I have to recognise my responsibility to myself and others, and become an active, not passive, force in my relationships. I hate the idea of ruining that with my new partner, which is one of the best relationships I have had.This brings me to my main issue. I live with the fear that my best friend will want another confrontation as part of her way of moving on. I am scared of bumping into her in my home town, or having to respond if she messages me. I am conflicted over the fact that perhaps I owe it to her to instigate a meeting. But I am scared that I will talk too much about myself, not listen well enough, or fail to offer anything new, making her feel disappointed for even bothering with me. What can I do?There’s a lot of living in your head going on. Your friend hasn’t made contact with you, and if she did, you are imagining that she wants confrontation. Often when people fear confrontation, it can be traced back to something that happened earlier in life, but it may not be as simple as that, as psychotherapist Lucy Beresford (psychotherapy.org.uk) helped me understand.“I did wonder if your idea of not wanting to have another conversation was less about fear of confrontation and more a masking of a deeper desire to always be in control,” Beresford explained. She went on to say that the way you conducted the affair with your friend’s ex, and then didn’t tell her, was also about “controlling the situation”. This can stem from a fear of angering others and wanting to be liked.This is really worth exploring: think about your interactions with people, and which of these you deem to be successful and which aren’t, and what the difference between them is. What is it about your new partner that has allowed you to learn more about yourself? You may find that, actually, you can talk in a “confronting” way with some people and not with others the reason for this may be telling. It may be down to the combination of personalities rather than just yours.What to do? Beresford suggests sitting down with your partner and exploring exactly what you are afraid of. I know, you think you know, but I want you to really unpack it. Go through each imagined contact with your friend, talk about what it is you fear, what it brings up, and then get your partner to ask you: “And then what?” Being gently challenged to really think, and not come up with hackneyed answers, can throw up surprises.Your friend hasn’t contacted you yet, and she might not. If you wanted to be less passive, you might consider writing her a letter, asking to meet. You can be in control of what you say, and you can even say you fear meeting and not listening, or talking about yourself, so you are writing this letter first. Then, when you do meet, allow both of you the luxury of not talking much and just listening. Don’t justify yourself, don’t answer back, don’t excuse.• Send your problem to annalisa.barbieri@mac.

This is why I don’t feel guiltyBack in the halcyon days of human contact, a friend of mine was decompressing over dinner. She’d learned that (once again) she had not got the promotion she’d applied for. Apparently the interview committee were not sure about her “leadership qualities”, despite her qualification in leadership. They were sure about the young(er) men they hired instead: floppy-haired elite-school types who refused to wear socks and went by nicknames that sounded like abuse (no employee deserves to be reprimanded by someone called Plumpers).My friend told me that she would not put herself up for promotion again. Not for a while, anyway she needed a break. She felt beaten.I told my friend that some people have a less smooth journey in life, where – whether through structural societal problems or just plain bad luck – their days are full of frictions, small hindrances that make things harder and slow their progress. So it’s OK to press pause.Recalling that conversation has helped me avoid feeling guilty about how I’ve spent these last weeks. This is my sixth week working from home and I am yet to start learning Spanish or reading Tolstoy, because this is a period of maximum friction. Everything is harder, takes longer and hurts more: getting milk requires an hour’s queue freezing video calls with friends barely relax heightened emotions mean a simple disagreement turns into a fight.So I remind myself we are not working from home we are surviving a crisis and trying to work. I remind myself that “new pandemic, new you” is not a phrase for a reason. I feel no shame if my personal progress has stalled. In fact, I’d argue that, when it takes all your energy just to stand still, there is no better time than a weekend to say, “Today, world, I am going to give myself a break.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f8525e8f7a2d30d04bf7c8b2ada313f10d904285/0_0_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0a54403b98fa8273e982f8fda4bac6a9","title":"coronavirus travel shutdown rights voucher refund","story":"Your questions answered on whether you should accept vouchers or stick it out for a refundNo. But that hasn’t stopped a number of airlines doing exactly that. All flights on EU carriers within, or into the EU, and all flights leaving from an EU airport, are protected by the EU’s “denied boarding” rules, which require a full refund in seven days when flights are cancelled.The problem for consumers is that enforcing these rights is proving very difficult. After initially promising to refund passengers within 20 working days, Ryanair has now said passengers should accept vouchers valid for 12 months, or wait until the Covid-19 pandemic is over for a refund.Refunds at British Airways are only being processed by customer services which, of course, is impossible to contact. easyJet, initially only offered refunds through customer services but now has a web portal to request refunds.Note: the EU cancellation rules do not apply to non-EU carriers where the flight started outside the EU – for example, a Korean Air flight from Seoul to London.Taking the offer of replacement vouchers in the current climate is highly risky given the airline may not be around in six months. While some will be happy to accept vouchers, many will not.Coby Benson of the specialist flight compensation lawyers, Bott and Co, advises passengers to submit their refund request in writing, using the following text:If the airline does not respond or does not agree then the passenger can either issue court proceedings or use Alternative Dispute Resolution.If your flight cost more than £100 and was booked using a credit card, you can hold the card provider jointly liable. When things calm down we suspect many passengers will be forced down this route.The fact that the government advised against all but essential travel means travel insurance policies should pay foreign trip cancellation claims provided you bought your policy before the pandemic was declared on 11 March."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/790bdabc9f1055a76b53d2a0a7063525174dff3a/0_121_3721_2233/master/3721.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b6441c37a8566d04eac54e94ec68f43e","title":"brits in lockdown panama beach tribal gathering festival","story":"Panama’s Tribal Gathering was meant to be the ultimate beach party, until coronavirus stranded festivalgoers in a makeshift camp, disconnecting them from their families – and reality• Coronavirus and culture – a list of major cancellationsIf you’ve ever been at a festival on a Monday morning and thought it was something that might happen at the end of the world, you might have some sympathy for performers and crew at the Tribal Gathering in Panama. The British-run festival – which takes place on the country’s northern coast and brings together indigenous peoples with DJs, artists and performers from around the world for cultural exchange and a three-week beach party – was supposed to end on 16 March. But then came lockdown, in this case enforced by the military.The festival has now been turned into a makeshift camp, with many of its attendees unable to return home and complaining of insufficient flights and strained discussions with embassies. The UK Foreign Office told a  reporter that they were “in regular contact” with festivalgoers, who are scattered between the festival and Panama City.“I’ve been camping on a beach for 80 days!” says Doug Francisco, a circus performer and artist from Bristol. Francisco, who designed and led the Extinction Rebellion red brigades at last year’s protests in London, got to the site at the beginning of February. “While the festival was still going on, the military came in and tried to shut it down,” he told me over the phone from the beach.The organisers persuaded the army to allow the festival to finish. After it was over, the battle became how to leave the site. Confused and conflicting orders were given by the army, festivalgoers report. A busload of travellers was held for 12 hours near the site and those without confirmed flights were turned back. But many flights had been cancelled. Embassies became involved with mixed results. “The British embassy sent a bus, but they just took people to the airport,” says Francisco. “There were no flights and they just left them there. They didn’t sort them out flights or anything. That was when it was all kicking off. I was like, I’m not getting on the bus if I don’t have a flight.” He remained at the festival site, where he has a four-metre bell tent.British festivals such as Glastonbury cancelled, but at Tribal Gathering the show went on, of a sort. About 300 crew, performers and public were still on site days after it was supposed to have ended. “People were dealing with it pretty well,” says Francisco. Because they had been quarantined, they were safe from the threat of coronavirus and could avoid the restrictions the rest of the world was enduring. “This might be the last show on Earth. I did my one-man show the other night to the kitchen crew. We had a drag queen party with cocktails on the beach.”Some of those who managed to leave the festival are still stranded in Panama City. One who got back to the UK was Barry Rees, a tree surgeon from Anglesey. He had gone to Panama to work on the build, turning the wild jungle beach, with its spiders, snakes and rampaging monkeys, into a safe festival site. When it was time to leave, he found his flight had been cancelled. Nevertheless, he managed to get past the armed guards. “I don’t know how I did it,” he told me down the line from north Wales. “I put on my pirate hat, that might have helped.” After borrowing £1,000 from his brother, almost being stranded in Miami and taking four international flights in three days, Rees finally got home. “I was really jetlagged, had diarrhoea, couldn’t really go anywhere. I was thinking, why did I leave paradise? But I didn’t have much money and I didn’t want to be a charity case.”Those who remained got on with the festival takedown, “more slowly and methodically than usual”, says Francisco. The organisers kept the food deliveries coming long after they were meant to have stopped. “They looked after everybody at the hell of a cost for food,” says Rees. The festival has reportedly taken out a $160,000 loan and is also crowdfunding via GoFundMe.“Moving anywhere in the country is complicated – you need permissions, there’s lots of checkpoints,” says Francisco. “There’s all this anticipation trying to leave, we’re gonna go, we’re gonna go, and then it’s – there’s no flights, we can’t go. Well, OK, I’ll stay here rather than getting stuck in a hostel.” Rees says some of the crew managed to get put up for a month in a mansion, but it had nothing in it, not even tables and chairs, and no internet. “They were going out of their minds,” he says. Even now, it may be six weeks before anybody can leave Panama.At the festival, a feeling of unreality was persistent. “There’s a strange sense of this whole coronavirus thing happening that you’re not connected with, which would sound like a dream scenario but is quite weird. And the idea that when we leave here we’re going into a really difficult situation is daunting,” says Francisco. “It’s weird because the whole world’s gone mental and we’re stuck in the old days. We can still hang out and do stuff together, which is a real luxury, but you feel disconnected from what’s going on.”And even paradise can wear thin. “I’m not gonna get much sympathy for being trapped on a beach, but it’s quite an intense environment. It looks picturesque, but the palm trees secrete oil at night and everything gets covered in it. And there’s the dust it’s very windy. After 80 days, I’m gagging for a wall.”Along with Maitane Berrozpe, an artist from Spain’s Basque country, Francisco has been continuing his project Plastik Paradiso, collecting refuse washed up on the beaches and turning it into shamanic-inspired art. “It’s shocking, because where there’s houses or tourist places, it’s all cleaned up, you’ve got this paradise vista, but as soon as you walk around the corner you’re knee-deep in plastic waste. It’s just hideous.” He plans to deconstruct the artworks and fit them into suitcases when he does eventually leave. “Francis Drake used the nearby town of Portobelo to extract all the Inca gold. I’m doing the same with all this plastic,” he says.Even the party at the end of the world has to come to an end. Fewer than 50 people remain on the site and the imminent start of the rainy season is focusing minds. “That’s a different story.

He said: “This is the most extraordinary thing, one of the proudest moments of my career, but it’s not about me, it’s about Captain Tom. Thank you for giving him a No 1 on his 100th birthday. You are the best, God bless ya.”Martin Talbot, chief executive of the Official Charts Company, said there was “almost nothing” between Moore and the Weeknd’s respective tracks on Thursday – until the latter’s Abel Tesfaye tweeted encouraging fans to support Moore. “We’re rooting for you,” he said. Moore thanked the Canadian R\u0026ampB star for his “kind gesture”.Sales from the track will add to the millions of pounds Moore has already raised for the NHS after walking 100 lengths of his garden prior to his centenary on 30 April in the hope of raising £1,000. Prince William paid tribute to Moore, calling him a “one-man fundraising machine”.You’ll Never Walk Alone will occupy its chart position at least for the next seven days, meaning that Moore will become the first centenarian to have a UK No 1. The second-oldest UK No 1 holder is Tom Jones, who was 68 years and nine months old when (Barry) Islands in the Stream reached the top in 2009. The success of You’ll Never Walk Alone makes Ball, at 57 years and nine months, the seventh-oldest musician to claim a No 1.Moore was born 32 years before the UK singles chart was first compiled by the New Musical Express on 14 November 1952.

Stephen Robinson, a care home assistant, enlisted the help of 93-year-old Mary Hurst and 82-year-old Brenda Finch to make a series of videos, which have been viewed thousands of times on the platform.In one video, Robinson and Hurst take part in the “flip the switch” challenge, in which people swap clothes to the sound of Drake’s Nonstop. The clip has already received 20,000 views on TikTok.In another clip, Finch acts out the lyrics to Dolly Parton’s 9 to 5, complete with an early morning glass of wine.“We had a ball of a time making the videos with Stephen, and hope they bring a smile to people’s faces,” said Hurst, who praised the staff at Anchor’s Heyberry House in Birkenhead for their dedication.Robinson said residents enjoyed keeping up to date with the latest social media trends: “I have a very close connection with both Mary and Brenda … When I told to them both about TikTok they were more than willing to jump onboard.”Family distributes hundreds of plants to neighbours with home ‘garden centre’When Craig Sullivan, a keen gardener, realised he had a surplus of plants, he put out a call on the hyperlocal social network Nextdoor to ask if any of his neighbours wanted any – and was inundated with more than 100 responses.He and his 20-year-old daughter, Marcella, set to work growing and distributing, and in just a few weeks they have given 230 plants to more than 100 local people, prioritising those who are vulnerable or self-isolating and families with children.“We’ve become a tiny two-person garden centre,” said Sullivan, 52, an internet consultant who has a large garden in Blackheath, south-east London. “But I sensed this need was about more than plants – it’s about people having something to look after, nurture and care for when all the world is in chaos.”Many are first-time gardeners, or are growing with few resources on balconies, so Sullivan provides growing guides to help people care for their plants. “We’re just going to keep going until we run out of seeds,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1fb9e77c4d61627062febe85cb15d6ddf013df8a/0_132_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9e846f386dd3b1c165e5721803385ca8","title":"how the 5g conspiracy theories took hold","story":"’s media editor Jim Waterson looks at why conspiracy theories linking 5G technology to coronavirus have taken hold in the UK, with dozens of phone masts vandalised across the country over the past few weeks Last week a mobile phone mast serving the emergency NHS Nightingale hospital in Birmingham was one of the latest targeted by arsonists who wrongly believe 5G technology is linked to the spread of coronavirus.

The transition can be extended by up to one or two years by mutual agreement.“Finally, we are ready to work to agree a fisheries agreement which reflects our rights under international law to control our own waters, \u0026amp provides for annual negotiations over access based on scientific principles. We won’t agree to continuing the Common Fisheries Policy.”The two negotiating teams have been conducting only the second full week of structured talks since the UK left the EU on 31 January. Barnier cited four areas where progress had been “disappointing”, including on a deal for future trade in goods.Barnier said the EU’s offer of zero-tariff, zero-quota access to its market in exchange for respecting social, environmental standards and state aid rules would give the UK unprecedented access to the European market.But he said the UK had “failed to engage substantially on this topic” and had even “denounced” the basic premise of fair competition.“It argued that our positions are too far to reach an agreement,” Barnier said. “It also denounced the basic premise that economic interconnectedness and geographic proximity require robust guarantees.”Throwing back the often-repeated words of British negotiators, Barnier noted the disparity in size between the two sides.“The UK negotiators keep repeating that we are negotiating as sovereign equals,” Barnier said. “That’s fine, but the reality of the negotiations is to find the best possible relationship between a market of 66 million consumers on the one side of the channel and the market of 450 million consumers on the other side. That is the reality.”Barnier added that devising such level playing field commitments had been agreed as a necessity “with Boris Johnson in our joint political declaration”, ratified at the time as the withdrawal agreement.After 47 years and 30 days it was all over. As the clock struck 11pm on 31 January 2020, the UK was officially orced from the EU and began trying to carve out a new global role as a sovereign nation. It was a union that got off to a tricky start and continued to be marked by the UK’s sometimes conflicted relationship with its neighbours.The French president, Charles de Gaulle, vetoes Britain’s entry to EEC, accusing the UK of a “deep-seated hostility” towards the European project.With Sir Edward Heath having signed the accession treaty the previous year, the UK enters the EEC in an official ceremony complete with a torch-lit rally, dickie-bowed officials and a procession of political leaders, including former prime ministers Harold Macmillan and Alec Douglas-Home.Lisa O\u0027CarrollMargaret Thatcher negotiated what became known as the UK rebate with other EU members after the iron lady marched into the former French royal palace at Fontainebleau to demand “our own money back” claiming for every £2 contributed we get only £1 back” despite being one of the “three poorer” members of the community.It was a move that sowed the seeds of Tory Euroscepticism that was to later cause the Brexit schism in the party.\u0026nbspCollapse of Berlin wall and fall of communism in eastern Europe, which would later lead to expansion of EU.Divisions between the UK and the EU deepened with Thatcher telling the Commons in an infamous speech it was ‘no, no, no’ to what she saw as Delors’ continued power grab. Rupert Murdoch’s Sun newspaper ratchets up its opposition to Europe with a two-fingered “Up yours Delors” front page.A collapse in the pound forced prime minister John Major and the then chancellor Norman Lamont to pull the UK out of the Exchange Rate Mechanism.On 1 January, customs checks and duties were removed across the bloc. Thatcher hailed the vision of “a single market without barriers – visible or invisible – giving you direct and unhindered access to the purchasing power of over 300 million of the world’s wealthiest and most prosperous people.Tory rebels vote against the treaty that paved the way for the creation of the European Union. John Major won the vote the following day in a pyrrhic victory.\u0026nbspTony Blair patches up the relationship. Signs up to social charter and workers\u0027 rights.Nigel Farage elected an MEP and immediately goes on the offensive in Brussels. “Our interests are best served by not being a member of this club,” he said in his maiden speech. “The level playing field is about as level as the decks of the Titanic after it hit an iceberg.”Chancellor Gordon Brown decides the UK will not join the euro.EU enlarges to to include eight countries of the former eastern bloc including Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic.EU expands again, allowing Romania and Bulgaria into the club.Anti-immigration hysteria seems to take hold with references to “cockroches” by Katie Hopkins in the Sun and tabloid headlines such as “How many more can we take?” and “Calais crisis: send in the dogs”.\u0026nbspDavid Cameron returns with reform package.In response a UK spokesman said there would be no progress until “the EU drops its insistence on imposing conditions on the UK which are not found in the EU’s other trade agreements and which do not take account of the fact that we have left the EU as an independent state”.A second problem area, Barnier said, was the UK’s insistence that the future relationship should be made up of a series of separate agreements rather than a single deal with a single arrangement for ensuring compliance by both sides.A third area of “serious difficulty”, he continued, was the UK’s refusal to put into the future treaty that the UK will remain a signatory of the European convention on human rights or recognise the role of the European court of justice in protecting EU citizens’ data when flowing between the bloc and the UK.“This creates serious, serious limitations for our future security partnership,” he said. The UK has said it would be unprecedented for a deal to include a commitment to remain part of the ECHR.“We made no progress on fisheries,” Barnier said of a fourth problematic issue. “On this essential topic the UK has not put forward a legal text. We have made no tangible progress. Despite the political declaration stating that we should make our best endeavours to reach an agreement by July.”He added: “The EU will not agree to any future economic partnership that does not include the balanced, sustainable and long-term solution on fisheries,” Barnier said. “That should be crystal clear to the UK.”The UK spokesman warned that Brussels had to accept that the status quo of the common fisheries policy would not endure but that legal text setting out the British paper could emerge in the coming weeks to aid progress.“The EU’s mandate appears to require us to accept a continuance of the current quotas agreed under the common fisheries policy,” the spokesman said. “We will only be able to make progress here on the basis of the reality that the UK will have the right to control access to its waters at the end of this year.” The negotiations are scheduled to continue on 11 May."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ec5cda3058067202f43ff7cf1f28d4d813cb6a23/0_204_3701_2221/master/3701.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1f920e0aebfb309f69d2734c828cc92f","title":"london marathon race director admits event may include only elite runners","story":"The race director of the London Marathon has refused to rule out staging the event as an elite-only race in the autumn if social distancing rules make it impossible to run as normal.Hugh Brasher told the  that while organisers still hoped to hold the event with 45,000 mass participants on 4 October, they were now scenario-planning around 10 other options because of the global pandemic.“The flame is still burning,” said Brasher. “And is there hope? Absolutely. But you have to do what’s right for society. You usually have 750,000 people out in central London watching 45,000 runners. Then there’s the medics, the 6,000 volunteers and the transport system. There’s masses to take into account when making any decision.”When asked directly whether the London Marathon – which was due to take place this Sunday before being pushed back – might have to be only for elite athletes if social restrictions had not eased completely, Brasher replied: “Honestly, I don’t know. But in today’s society, you can never say never. We are trying to stay really agile and to keep scenario planning. And at the moment, I don’t want to discount anything until it becomes really impossible.”Last month’s Tokyo marathon was staged as an elite-only race, with the field reduced to just 300 runners and the streets largely deserted. Most major spring marathons subsequently decided to postpone their races to the autumn – but those events also look in doubt with no vaccine in sight and, ominously, the Berlin marathon has already cancelled its race in September.“Our decision will be made by the back end of August at the latest,” explained Brasher. “It will be based on the government guidelines, and what we and society think is right and what feels right.”Brasher would not confirm whether Eliud Kipchoge and Kenenisa Bekele, who were due to meet on Sunday in a clash for the ages, had signed up for October’s revised race. However he told the : “We always want to get the most competitive race. This was going to be the 40th London marathon, and its greatest race. It was going to be spectacular. But we want to make October 4 spectacular too. So that’s what our focus is.”Last year the London Marathon raised £66.4m for charities, again making it the biggest single-day fundraising event in Britain. And while Sunday’s race will not take place, organisers are still hoping that thousands of people will spend the day raising and donating money for charities as part of a nationwide 2.6 Challenge – in which people tackle something related to the numbers two and six.More than £1.5m has already been raised for the campaign, and Brasher said he hoped it would prove a lifeline for many charities which usually rely heavily on the race to fund their work.“The London Marathon is normally about so many scripts and so many stories,” said Brasher. “It’s the greatest athletes in the world with the everyday athlete – who are doing this incredible challenge with the gods of the sport such as Kipchoge, Bekele and Brigid Kosgei, on the same day, on the same course, with the same crowd. In fact, the everyday person gets more people watching them. That’s the incredible thing. And, of course, they are raising so much money for charity too.”“Sadly it’s estimated charities will lose £4bn in income as a result of the pandemic. But they are needed more than ever – and they will be needed more than ever as we come out the other side. That’s why we came up with the idea of the 2.6 Challenge, because charities are such an intrinsic part of society and they need our help.“The response has been fantastic,” he added. “And we really hope that Sunday and beyond will show how much we care as a society for all the charities that exist across the UK that underpin a huge part of what makes Britain great.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/807b538573d19eac5591668374a744bb4fc3bb70/32_0_1798_1080/master/1798.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4bef8c3340c0bb107eab3b408d14e7b7","title":"nfl virtual draft television abc espn","story":"As a TV event, the NFL’s lockdown draft felt slapdash, a little weird and less eventful than those in recent years. It was also the first time in over a month things felt slightly back to normalThe first round of the NFL draft should have been a series of fireworks, owing as much to do with the wonky set-up the league found itself in. The mock run-through had been a veritable disaster – a spouse pulling a plug on a GMs computer, the technology chopping in and out, general managers struggling to fly solo in trying to figure out the technology and trade situations.Chuck a bunch of high-wattage, ready-to-go, star players, from high-profile schools at the most important positions in the game, and we should have been in for a broadcast that was equal parts exhilarating and weird.And then … blah. The draft went off, more or less, without a hitch, unless you happen to share a home with Aaron Rodgers. The technology worked fine. The broadcast networks did a commendable job of patching it all together. The teams sat and waited, no one was willing to mortgage their future to jump into the top 10 or shuffle up towards the top five with so much uncertainty over what the next season might look like.Given the downsized feel and general unease of the whole operation, there was a lack of zest running throughout the broadcast. Teams at the top of the board didn’t help their decision-makers were altogether too sensible. The quarterback-needy teams hoovered up the best signal-callers, while Oakland grabbed the quickest available receiver. The Patriots traded down, as they do.The first eight or so picks went off exactly as projected and had mostly been confirmed by the broadcast network’s own talent in the run-up to the first round. The only real action came when Oklahoma receiver CeeDee Lamb slipped to the Cowboys and the Packers traded up to grab Utah State quarterback Jordan Love.Things were supposed to ignite with the third pick, if not the fourth then fifth. Teams were calling about trades, we heard. ESPN’s cacophony of voices was happy to say Joe Burrow and Chase Young would be selected first then second, then the real fun would begin. But that anticipation was met with a collective pffft when everything ran chalk. Without that initial spark, everything fell a little flat.The virtual draft removed all of the excesses and indulgences that make the event so wacky and wonderful in the first place. ESPN leaned into the human interest side of things – understandable given current circumstances – but it left little room for talk of football or team-building or what’s next and stripped an awful lot of fun out of an event that is, objectively, ridiculous. Remove the hilarity of the thing and you’re just left with Roger Goodell delivering his best humanoid impression as he reads 32 names. It’s a little dry.Without an obnoxiously large stage and a crowd and the analysts all sat at a desk together, there was a loss of all of the pomp and circumstance that has come to make the NFL draft such a fun and funky show. The broadcast partners did their best to inject in some of that flavor, offering an overwrought serving of all things Americana. There were shots of a flyover, a musical crossover, and the flogging of anything and everything that could leave you with a hangover. Nobody does chest-beating then beer selling like the National Football League, pandemic be damned.The most interesting subplot of the night: evaluating the home décor choices of all of our main protagonists. Does so and so have an aquarium? I like Mike Zimmer’s fireplace. What’s on Bill Belichick’s book shelf? Is Jerry Jones making his picks from a $250 million mega yacht? Yes. Yes, of course he is. Is Jerry the only one practicing social distancing? I did not have that in the office pool.Why the main broadcast team didn’t have someone on to ponder these questions remains a mystery. A little color, a little fun would have been most welcome.It was left to Goodell to provide the levity. As always, he stole the show. Some standout moments:The draft, at its core, is about hoping and dreaming. Draft picks and prospects can be anything! Much of its entertainment value is in the discussion of football philosophies and economics and team building. But to work as a primetime TV event, it also needs all the bells and whistles – or to lean completely into the nerdy analyst stuff. Thursday night was a little slapdash, a little stuck in the middle, unsure what tone to take and when. And how could it not be given the circumstances?Regardless, for many, this writer included, Thursday was the first time in over a month that things felt slightly back to normal. This year’s first round was different, a little weird, and less eventful than those in recent years. But it was nice to just feel a little bit back."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/15f8e8f6e388dc87f14b07aa4bb956de45052557/1006_1960_4017_2409/master/4017.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bedb4c55b6f02dabfd3a2cedbe451533","title":"government must stop dodging and waffling on covid 19 says david hare","story":"Playwright and director, recently recovered from coronavirus, gives damning verdict of government’s crisis response on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme David Hare has said the UK government needs to “own up to their mistakes, stop dodging and waffling and start to trust us with the truth”, while giving his own damning verdict of its handling of the Covid-19 crisis.The playwright and director – who is arguably the most celebrated living stage writer in the UK – has recently recovered from the virus. He told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme that the government’s handling of the situation is worse than the Suez crisis or the Iraq war.Hare said: “To watch a weasel-worded parade of ministers shirking responsibility for their failures and confecting non-apologies to the dead and dying has seen British public life sink as low as I can remember in my entire lifetime.”The playwright, who has had a 50-year career in theatre – writing plays including Plenty, Racing Demon and Stuff Happens – said that “in return for lockdown, isolation, commercial disaster and social distancing” the British public deserves honesty.“They must own up to their mistakes, stop dodging and waffling and start to trust us with the truth,” he continued.Hare spoke about what it was like to have the virus, which he said would evolve rapidly and unpredictably. “One day it would be fever, next day it would be arctic cold, then it would be vomiting, then coughing, then conjunctivitis, then breathing problems,” he said. “Day 10 was five times worse than day five.”He dismissed those who claimed that “courage and love of life” had seen Boris Johnson through his coronavirus illness. “Those of us who’ve had the virus know you don’t under any circumstances ignore it,” he said. “What helped me survive were pure luck and the assiduous expert care of my first-class GP. Those two things only, not my fabled resources of character.”Hare has been an outspoken critic of the Conservative party since the 1970s and in 2016 wrote a  long read which argued that Thatcher and her heirs had created a selfish and ided society in which politicians and the people regard each other with mutual contempt.Hare also criticised austerity while praising doctors and nurses who have been “nobly putting their grievances behind them” to care for the sick. He also called for more research so that the Covid-19 virus is understood. “Unless we seek not just to treat the virus’s symptoms but to understand its hold and spread we are doomed to fail,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/363f8202a700efe94a94e59fc911d9f1e9088971/0_30_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1e9554d34a92fe58154d2c8b35120894","title":"let there be light the new must have for celebrities lockdown","story":"As personalities and the public film themselves at home, sales of quality lighting kits have risenThe new opposition leader, Keir Starmer, was photographed leaving his house in north London earlier this week carrying a piece of lighting equipment, an Interfit three-head fluorescent lighting kit with boom arm (£239.99), presumably to use for an online interview or the kind of Zoom meetings that have become central to many people’s lives. With the professional lighting of TV studios no longer available since the lockdown began, those who usually depend on it – from TV reporters to chat-show hosts – are having to set up their own lighting at home, meaning companies like Interfit have seen a spike in sales for some of its kits. Judging by Starmer, these lighting skills may be new to many public figures – as Lexi Powner, a creator of online videos, points out, Starmer was carrying the light fully assembled when it could be folded down and put in a case. “That’s like walking around with an open umbrella,” she says. “It’s like this performative ‘don’t worry guys, I’ll bring my own lights’. It’s so ‘dad on TikTok’.”But Starmer is right to worry about being well lit. “It makes it look professional,” says Powner. Something that is perhaps particularly important for politicians: “For people like Keir Starmer, they are talking to us about life or death policies,” says Roz Morris, the managing director of media training company TV News London and a former BBC and ITV broadcaster. “He’s a serious person and he wants to look like one.”The right location can also help with lighting, as the director of Channel 4’s The Steph Show, which is being filmed at presenter Steph McGovern’s home, explains. “We got very lucky with the living room as it has a lot of natural light,” says John Adams. “We use simple panel lights to just help lift levels on Steph’s face.”For those outside the public eye, the long arms of Zoom and Skype are forcing many to think about their video appearance. There are lessons that Starmer – and the rest of us – could learn from the stars of TikTok, YouTube and Instagram. So-called selfie ring lights have been big business. “A small ring light will help to lift the complexion and bring radiance to counteract any shadows that may appear,” says Hayley Hall, a beauty influencer who has a YouTube channel and more than 27,000 Instagram followers. She uses the Selvim selfie ring (£27.99). “If you are concerned about remaining professional and looking your best then the light essentially lifts the shadows that can make you look tired.”With professional life shifting further online, “this is a whole new world of skills people are having to take on and lighting is vitally important,” says Morris, who has seen a recent uptick in demand for her services – a webinar she is running next week has 800 registered guests rather than the usual 300.“As people had to learn to use computers, now they have to learn to use online image,” she says. “People have made the mistake of thinking this is just a kind of visual phone call but it isn’t. It’s a professional encounter in which they have to be like a producer and director.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c9268bbaf07368817b86df4c06e1ba2df4d045cd/1_0_2601_1562/master/2601..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e25184c2d9aaa983a5f5acd01cc4a4b8","title":"dont let a weak bladder stop you doing the things you love","story":"Avoiding playing vigorous sports? Sex life gone from G-spot to pee spot? The London Clinic’s Jane Simpson explains what we can do to tackle incontinence – including kegel exercises that you can do wherever you are As a continence nurse specialist, I’ve seen firsthand how overwhelming and upsetting incontinence can be. Patients visit me when things have gone too far – their behaviours change and they’re suddenly avoiding activities such as playing tennis, having sex or even going to the cinema because they’re worried about having to race to the toilet. When you start avoiding things you enjoy, it’s time to take action.Of course, leakage can be troubling at any moment, but during sex it’s particularly distressing (it tends to happen during an orgasm or because of the physical pressure). But the good news is, it doesn’t mean the end of your sex life. In fact, patients always say they wish they’d sought treatment sooner. Even if you don’t experience leakage, sexual sensation and satisfaction can be improved, too – and who wouldn’t want that? As well as increasing blood supply to the vagina and penis, pelvic floor muscle training (or “kegels”, as they’re also known), can improve muscle tone and maintain nerve activity, meaning better sex.When it comes to treatment for accidental leakage, it depends on the type of incontinence people are dealing with. “Stress incontinence” is when we suffer leakage while doing things such as sneezing, coughing or laughing, and it’s common for women to experience this after having a baby, when the pelvic floor is weakest. Leaking during sports or sex falls under this category, due to weakened pelvic floor muscles. The other common type is an overactive bladder, or “urge incontinence”, which feels like you have to urinate suddenly and often.Pelvic floor exercises can help in both instances, but it’s really important to make sure you’re doing them properly – speak to a women’s health physiotherapist or a continence specialist if unsure. They’re simple – just squeeze, lift and hold the anus and vagina, count to five and repeat five times. Improvement is fast – you’ll notice a change in six weeks if you do them regularly. There’s also a brilliant app called MyPFF, which reminds you to do your exercises.If an overactive bladder is the problem, lifestyle changes are key – symptoms can be worsened by too much caffeine, alcohol, fizzy drinks, spicy foods and stress, for example. Certain medications can also play a part, as well as conditions such as constipation, urinary tract infections and vaginal atrophy. Bladder retraining is great – when you have an urge to pee, you teach yourself to hang on, which slowly expands your bladder capacity. It might also be worth avoiding high-impact sports until your pelvic floor is stronger, since too much exercise can make things worse. Medication and surgery could be considered with a specialist, too.I definitely sense a change coming in the way we discuss women’s health issues and incontinence, and it’s great the conversation is becoming more open. There shouldn’t be any shame or stigma around it any more – this sort of condition affects so many of us. I hope people realise improvement is possible and that once the issue is tackled, it really can be life-changing. Recently, a woman visited me in my clinic and said that just having a treatment plan in place has made her feel better. It really is the very least we deserve.As incontinence affects one in three women over 35, we should all be having more open conversations about this everyday condition that impacts women of all ages.

It implies it’s a time of things “winding down”, “ending”, “drying up”.Well, most things. Because often, along with menopause, comes bladder weakness. And for many women that means that things get decidedly less dry.Unlike when a girl starts her period, which in many cultures is celebrated, and in the UK is now respected with a government campaign to provide sanitary products in schools, when a woman’s periods begin to end, it’s seen as a change towards old age, towards a body that’s “done”. And even for those going through menopause, it has often felt pretty taboo to talk about the daily problems – especially bladder weakness.“Don’t make me laugh, I’ll wet myself!” might seem like an age-old joke, but it’s one that’s true for menopausal women. And when it comes to our sex lives, it’s no laughing matter. There’s fear and shame and women shut down, choosing not to be intimate for fear of leaking urine during a passionate moment.After all, when do you slip “I’d love to have an early night but I’m worried I’ll wet the bed!” into the conversation, whether you’re with a long-term partner or someone new?The good news is this conversation is being reclaimed by women in the spotlight, who are starting to talk about the final menopause taboo of bladder weakness. Well, we talk so much about starting our periods – why would we not talk about stopping them, and how this affects your love life?It seems there has been a realisation that no matter whether you grace the red carpet and TV screens or you’re on the school run with grandchildren or off to the office, menopause will happen to every woman. Take Gwyneth Paltrow, for example, who released a video for her wellbeing site Goop, saying: “I think menopause gets a really bad rap, and needs a bit of rebranding.” Her video Madame Ovary spoke about mood swings and sweats, while British actress Emma Thompson has joked how hot sweats mean she’s not cold on the red carpet.OK, so the conversation is shifting – just like we can now see a tampon string in a TV ad (thanks to Sport England’s This Girl Can campaign), women are no longer sitting quietly while they deal with the side effects of menopause. But there is one subject that still has to work hard to find its way into our vocabulary – bladder weakness.We can talk hot flushes, night sweats, mood swings – all with increasing honesty. But then there’s Nadia Sawalha, who struggled with incontinence in silence. The usually outspoken TV presenter kept quiet about bladder weakness until she was forced to speak about it after having an accident on national TV.Why is it the one part of menopause women can’t talk about? Well, leaking during the day is one thing – the embarrassment of needing to find some alternative underwear, for example – but when it comes to sex, it’s a different matter altogether. Women who have bladder weakness and might have an accident during sex are likely to close off to their partner, so worried they’ll spoil the intimacy that they don’t have sex and even make up excuses, or “blame” menopause. Intimacy is not synonymous with leakage.After all, when you’re not sure whether you might lose control of your bladder, being intimate isn’t always top of the list. Talk about mixed messages! Women are encouraged to embrace their ageing, to love who they are and how they look – to go grey with glamour and grace, or to wear a bikini with pride. Just don’t mention the bladder weakness, right?!As periods end and change, we have to adjust. The problem is, the world doesn’t seem to adjust with us. And women are left in a strange quagmire of going through something so natural and even primal in silence and, often, shame.And with two-thirds of women over 40 affected with bladder weakness, and many revealing it has affected their mental health, it’s time we became more open and honest about how bladder weakness affects us.Meg Matthews, who has been campaigning about the menopause and runs megsmenopause, says: “Bladder weakness, also called bladder incontinence, is a very common consequence of menopause. It’s not easy to talk about this topic, and, because women don’t always feel confident talking about it, they can feel alone. We need to understand that having bladder weakness is OK. This is the message we need to spread.”But just like when we’re younger, confidence can come back when we use the right products. Once a girl knows she can use a tampon or pad, she’s less worried about her period affecting her day-to-day life. And for women with bladder issues, it’s about a pad that can help you forget there’s even a problem. Then you’ll feel freer to have those more difficult intimacy conversations that you’ve been putting off – and perhaps that early night …As incontinence affects one in three women over 35, we should all be having more open conversations about this everyday condition that impacts women of all ages.

Furthermore, five patients in the high-dose group had underlying heart disease, three of whom died.“Despite these discouraging findings, several other observations prevent concluding categorically that high-dose chloroquine was toxic,” authors of a comment article said.Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine in combination with azithromycin were first put forward as potential treatments for Covid-19 in a French study described as “meaningless”. The journal later said the study did not meet standards for publication.But by the time the journal disavowed the study’s flawed design, media outlets had already promoted the unproven and risky drug combination. The treatment was tweeted by the tech billionaire Elon Musk and picked up by Fox News. It was then touted by Trump as a potential “game-changer” despite serious risks and lack of safety and efficacy data. At least one man has died and a woman was hospitalized after taking chloroquine.The letter published in Nature warned of serious heart problems and risk of “sudden cardiac death” in patients treated with hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin. In the letter, which unlike a study is not peer-reviewed, a New York City doctor described 84 Covid-19 patients’ reaction to a five-day, twice-daily regimen of the drugs. The patients were monitored on electrocardiogram. Both drugs have independently been shown to increase patients’ risk of “drug-induced sudden cardiac death”.Among the 84 patients, nine showed signs of potentially severe heart “malignant arrhythmia” which could increase risk of cardiac arrest, although none had heart attacks. At the end of the study, four patients had died of multi-organ failure, 16 patients were discharged and another 64 remained in hospital. The authors concluded patients on the regimen need to be “constantly monitored” for heart problems.Despite the lack of evidence that it is an effective treatment for Covid-19, some American hospitals have used hydroxychloroquine to treat seriously ill patients in the hope of some benefit.However, scientists have repeatedly urged caution. The American Thoracic Society (ATS) and the Infectious Diseases Society of American have both called for the drug to be used only in clinical trials.In clinical guidelines to doctors, Dr Kevin C Wilson, chief of documents and patient education at the ATS, said that while some lab results showed antiviral effects against the virus, they have yet to be replicated with patients.“Thus, the bottom line is, whether hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine confer benefits to patients with Covid-19 are unanswered questions.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/075e4074b6b820dd53425b554a024745abd42316/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ea35412d8f4f7aef8c970854eef3ff9b","title":"coronavirus latest at a glance 24 april","story":"A summary of the biggest developments in the global coronavirus outbreakKey developments in the global coronavirus outbreak today include:Researchers at Johns Hopkins University say at least 193,042 people have died since the outbreak began, while at least 2.7m have been infected. The figures are likely to significantly underestimate the true scale of the pandemic due to suspected under-reporting and differing testing regimes.The Department for Health and Social Care reports 684 more deaths in UK hospitals, bringing the death toll to 19,506. Friday’s update also shows an increase of 5,386 confirmed cases, bringing the UK total to at least 143,464.Authorities in Spain, which has seen the second largest number of confirmed cases in the world, point out that more people are being diagnosed as cured than are falling sick for the first time since the beginning of the outbreak.On Friday, there were 2,796 new infections confirmed while 3,105 overcame the infection. “With all the effort that we have done, the evolution of the epidemic is obviously beginning to be where it should be,” said Fernando Simón, the ministry’s health emergency centre coordinator.Newspapers in Italy are reporting that the country’s lockdown, the longest and toughest in Europe, is to be eased over the next four weeks. There has been no official confirmation, however.Saudi Arabia says it is extending a unilateral ceasefire in Yemen by one month to support efforts to contain the epidemic there. The announcement comes after a two-week ceasefire expired on Thursday. The ceasefire was by the Saudi-led coalition waging war on the Iran-backed Houthi rebel group that had seized control of parts of the country.Government ministers were warned last year that the UK must have a robust plan to deal with a pandemic virus and its potentially catastrophic social and economic consequences, the  reveals.A confidential 600-page Cabinet Office document warned that even a mild pandemic could cost tens of thousands of lives, and set out the must-have “capability requirements” to mitigate the risks to the country, as well as the potential damage of not doing so.The Robert Koch Institute warns against further loosening restrictions. Its vice-president, Lars Schaade, says the situation is too fragile to allow more relaxation after small shops were allowed to reopen this week and some pupils returned to school.Schaade says Germany should only consider further relaxation if the confirmed cases fall to a few hundred per day. There are typically more than 2,000.The World Health Organization announces a multibillion-euro “call to action” for a global response to the pandemic. The programme and its €7.5bn (£6.5bn) fundraising effort will be officially launched on 4 May.Sweden reports 812 new confirmed cases, the highest such number since the outbreak began. That brings the total number of infections in the country to 17,567. It also reports 131 new deaths, taking the total death toll there to at least 2,152, according to data published by its public health authority.Confirmed cases in the Philippines rise to more than 7,000, as the country’s health ministry announces 211 new infections.

The health secretary knows there’s a lot in the balance: the health of millions, his standing among the public and colleagues, perhaps even his career.Hancock honed his politics as George Osborne’s chief of staff, at the centre of the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government, with a desk in the office that linked Osborne’s rooms and David Cameron’s, and a seat at the table for key meetings.His Labour shadow, Jon Ashworth, who once worked for Gordon Brown, recognised Osborne’s talent for framing the political debate in that 100,000-a-day target, which helped to halt a growing sense of government drift.But he describes it as “a big figure, plucked out of the air” and he complains that contract tracing, which both Labour and Hancock’s predecessor Jeremy Hunt have been calling for for weeks, is only just being implemented. “Why are we only doing this now?” he says.Even at the time it was made, the 100,000-a-day promise was regarded by some colleagues as rash. But as the deadline approaches, Hancock’s team insist there is a fighting chance that it can still be met – with capacity dramatically increased, and all key workers now allowed to apply.And No 10 is, for now, throwing a protective arm around the careworn health secretary. One Downing Street source described Hancock’s work as “incredible” in an “unprecedented situation”, saying: “I would point you to our original plan to lower the curve and increase NHS capacity, this was our original aim and it’s been handled very well.”A cabinet source acknowledged that Hancock can seem “irritating” to fellow ministers, rubbing them up the wrong way in part because of his insistence on keeping lockdown measures in place to guard against a second peak. But they insist he is not becoming the fall guy in a growing blame game.“He might be rather irritating some of his colleagues but I don’t detect an operation against him in No 10,” the source said. “People are knackered and some very difficult conversations are going on about how things could and couldn’t have been done. But that doesn’t mean he’s being lined up to go.”Hancock, 41, is known at Westminster for his Tiggerish ebullience, and the iron-clad self-confidence that propelled him into the Tory leadership race last year (slogan: Let’s Move Forward).After he shuttered his campaign and quickly fell in behind the frontrunner, Johnson, he was rewarded with the privilege of remaining in his job – and now finds himself at the centre of the biggest public health crisis for a generation.Perhaps surprisingly there is sympathy, not brickbats, for Hancock among NHS bosses, who lay most of the blame for the shambles over testing elsewhere.The chief executive of one NHS hospital trust told the : “I think he’s doing a good job and most of the public think he’s been open and transparent. When he first became health secretary he seemed too young for such a big job. But, just like Jeremy Hunt before him, he’s really learning his brief.The CEO, however, fingered the department that Hancock leads – and the confusing array of NHS bodies that are a legacy of his predecessor Andrew Lansley, who reorganised the health service in 2012-13 – reserving particular ire for Public Health England (PHE).“The problem is that all of these arm’s-length bodies are separate to the rest of the NHS,” the CEO said. “PHE is a body made up of scientists yet it became responsible for the whole operational response to coronavirus, and left to operationalise its pandemic theory in the NHS, even though NHS England, not them, are the operational delivery arm of the NHS. Why did that happen?“Also, why did the Department of Health decide to commission these testing centres themselves? Why didn’t they just leave it to the NHS, who would have found a few hospital chief executives who know what they’re doing and they would have done it probably pretty well?”The chair of the board at another trust, a senior figure in the NHS for many years, said on Friday : “If you had asked me 48 hours ago I would have said that Matt Hancock was dead in the water over testing. But bringing in the army, increasing the number of testing centres and, especially, finally making it clear who is eligible for a test, means he will probably survive, because the capacity – if not the number of tests carried out – will probably go up to 100k.“Jeremy Hunt is right that we should have had mass testing from the start, like in Germany, so everyone who wanted a test could have had one. But I don’t blame the politicians on this. What advice were they being given on this by their so-called advisers and by PHE?“I feel sorry for the secretary of state in a way. He can only make decisions based on the evidence that he was given. Was he advised to ramp up testing and decided not to do so? If so, that’s one thing. But did PHE say that it wasn’t worth doing that or that there wasn’t the capacity to do so?”Ashworth agrees that it is difficult to disentangle which of the government’s failings lie with Hancock, and which with No 10 or the government’s scientific advisers.But he wonders whether the health secretary has challenged the scientific advice robustly enough. “Scientists are making judgments, based on data, and they’re making judgments about human behaviour,” he says. Asked whether a non-medic – the health secretary is an economist – would have the capacity to do so, he adds: “Hancock is immensely self-confident.”Perhaps the biggest judgment about how to weigh the scientific advice is still to come, however, as ministers debate which of the stringent lockdown measures to lift, and when.Hancock is described by colleagues as particularly exercised about the risks of a second peak of the virus – something Dominic Raab, deputising as prime minister, has also stressed.His allies reject the idea that Hancock has clashed with the chancellor over how soon constraints should be lifted. “You couldn’t get a fag-paper between them,” one ally insists, adding that he understands very well the risks to the economy and society of an extended lockdown. “It’s not as if Matt goes into the room thinking about everything through the prism of health.”They express frustration, too, that the government’s successes – including the dramatic expansion in NHS capacity as the huge organisation was repurposed to tackle the outbreak – are skipped over.But Peter Kyle, a Labour MP who has been critical of Hancock’s promises on testing and personal protective equipment in care homes, complains that his approach hasn’t served the public well.“He does not seem to be learning from his mistakes. Just as we saw with Theresa May’s government on Brexit, he overcomes one undeliverable promise by making a bigger one and it becomes a house of cards,” he said.“The inevitable public inquiry will have to look at how these promises came to be made. The system has infected care home residents and led to widespread loss of lives. There was nobody banging on the cabinet table about it for a long time. It was all about the macho posturing of who can make the biggest promise and say the biggest number and who can put up the most bravado for the cameras.”Born 2 October 1978 in CheshireCareer Educated at the independent King’s School in Cheshire before studying politics, philosophy and economics at Exeter College, Oxford, then an MPhil in economics at Christ’s College, Cambridge.He worked at the Bank of England before being hired as an advisor to George Osborne, rising to the position of chief of staff to the then-chancellor.

Outside the Hullebergmyra nursery in Ullern, west of Oslo, William Bugge was dropping off his children Louise, three, and Jonas, five, after six weeks of quarantine.Yellow smileys painted on the tarmac reminded everyone to keep 2 metres apart. Louise and Jonas were happy to be back, their father even more so: the family went into lockdown barely a day after the parents’ wedding.“It’s been a case of adjusting, to say the least,” said Bugge. “The challenge of working from home and looking after two small children has been immense. But we’re still married.” Several Covid-19 cases at his workplace forced them to isolate early.But as younger children in Norway this week followed some of those in neighbouring Denmark back to kindergarten, not all parents were relieved, despite the assurance of the education minister, Guri Melby, that “going to pre-school is safe”.Those who did return found much had changed: no more toys from home specially installed handwashing facilities outside staggered drop-off and pick-up times no parents in the school building. Once past the gates, children must spend the day in the same small groups of three or six, depending on their age.Pupils at Norway’s primary schools start returning from 27 April as the country, which has recorded nearly 7,500 cases and 194 deaths, reopens after a month of restrictions. Many shops have been allowed to stay open, but bars and most restaurants will remain closed and cultural and sporting events are banned until at least 15 June.At the Hullebergmyra pre-school, Tor Garshol, a teacher, said he had stayed in touch with children and parents online during the lockdown. Online videos produced by the education ministry have taught children what to expect and how to react. “We’ve also provided parents with ideas for activities as well as communicating visually with the children,” he said.Lena Løvik, the headteacher, said that while the children would spend most of their time outdoors, the school’s interior had been ided up into smaller areas and was subject to strict hygiene rules. “We’re loaded up with disinfectants, soap and paper towels,” she said.Surfaces and toys are thoroughly cleaned twice a day, and children taught what to do in terms of personal hygiene and physical distancing. Most seem familiar with the requirements there is even a corner to go and cough. “Our view remains: focus on the children, not the virus,” Løvik said.“It seems most plausible to me that they are being infected but are at low risk of developing disease,” said Prof Peter Smith, an epidemiologist at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. “We know that for flu, children are important transmitters of infection, which is the basis for the flu vaccination programme directed at children, but we do not know yet how important they are as transmitters of coronavirus. So closing schools would be based on the assumption that they do make an important contribution to transmission.”Rates of various illnesses are seen to rise and fall at the start and end of school terms. School holidays were thought to have led to a plateau in the 2009 swine flu pandemic. Also advised hygiene and social distancing measures, such as hand washing and reduced physical contact, just aren’t very effective in a primary school playground setting. So there is the potential for schools to act as a local fountain of infection for the surrounding area.“Every mother and father knows that when kids go back to school they’re going to get hammered by colds and flus and sore throats,” said Paul Hunter, professor in medicine at the University of East Anglia.This uncertain science has to be carefully weighed against the certain disruption and cost of school closures, including taking large numbers of doctors and nurses out of the workplace, and unintended consequences such as grandparents, who are among the most vulnerable, taking on childcare and facing greater exposure.She said the school community had been through a process of “speed digitalisation”, with online platforms allowing parents, teachers and children to stay connected and continue working. “The extraordinary circumstances have made us all more competent and actually brought us closer together in many ways,” she said.Denmark reopened schools and daycare centres last week after a month-long lockdown, but concerns that they might become breeding grounds for a second wave of cases have convinced many parents to keep their children at home.“I won’t be sending my children off no matter what,” said Sandra Andersen, founder of the Danish “My kid is not going to be a Guinea Pig” Facebook group, which has more than 40,000 followers. “A lot of parents are thinking, ‘Why should my little child go outside first’.” The prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, defended the reopening for younger children, undertaken on the health authority’s recommendations, saying it would allow parents to return to work and “get the economy going again”.Christian Wejse, a scientist at the department of infectious diseases at Aarhus University, told Reuters he understood people’s concerns “because we’ve spent a month trying to avoid contact”. But any new infections would not cause problems in an age group “where few fall ill, and those who do won’t get very sick”, he said.Looking at neighbouring Sweden – which has kept its primary and junior schools open – it appeared that children were not major transmitter of the virus, Wejse said.In Denmark, as in Norway, strict rules apply in nurseries, where non-washable toys are banned and a small section assigned to each group of children. Authorities have recommended a floor area of 6sq metres per child for nurseries, 2 metres between tables, and expect staff to supervise regular handwashing and disinfect surfaces such as taps, toilet flushes, tables, and door handles twice a day."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/467d23268bad1912cc4fc0d5c0e944c21ac81f46/0_0_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=68328192f781edaa3a8751f2ad3b2b68","title":"revealed dominic cummings on secret scientific advisory group for covid 19","story":"Exclusive: Leaked list reveals presence of Johnson adviser and Vote Leave ally on supposedly independent bodyThe prime minister’s chief political adviser, Dominic Cummings, and a data scientist he worked with on the Vote Leave campaign for Brexit are on the secret scientific group advising the government on the coronavirus pandemic, according to a list leaked to the .It reveals that both Cummings and Ben Warner were among 23 attendees present at a crucial convening of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) on 23 March, the day Boris Johnson announced a nationwide lockdown in a televised address.Multiple attendees of Sage told the  that both Cummings and Warner had been taking part in meetings of the group as far back as February. The inclusion of Downing Street advisers on Sage will raise questions about the independence of its scientific advice.There has been growing pressure on Downing Street in recent days to disclose more details about the group, which provides scientific advice to the upper echelons of government during emergencies. Both the membership of Sage and its advice to ministers on the Covid-19 outbreak is being kept secret.Warner, a data scientist, was reportedly recruited to Downing Street last year by Cummings after running the Conservative party’s general election campaign model. He is also said to have worked closely with Cummings on the data modelling used in the Vote Leave campaign for the UK to leave the European Union.The government’s former chief scientific adviser Sir David King said he was “shocked” to discover there were political advisers on Sage. “If you are giving science advice, your advice should be free of any political bias,” he said. “That is just so critically important.”Told that Cummings was in the 23 March meeting, King replied: “Oh my goodness. Isn’t this maybe why they don’t want us to know who was there?”King said political advisers were never on the equivalent committees of Sage when he chaired them and argued that Cummings, who is not a scientist, could report his own interpretation of Sage advice back to the prime minister.Other former members of Sage also said they could not recall political appointees being on previous committees. David Lidington, a former Cabinet Office minister and de facto deputy to Theresa May when she was prime minister, said: “I’m not aware of any minister or special adviser, certainly not in Theresa May’s time, ever having been involved in the scientific advisory panels.”In a statement provided by Downing Street, a government spokesperson said: “Expert participants often vary for each meeting according to which expertise is required. A number of representatives from government departments and No 10 attend also.”Sage participants told the  the Downing Street advisers were not merely observing the advisory meetings, but actively participating in discussions about the formation of advice.In a letter to parliament this month, Sir Patrick Vallance, the UK government’s chief scientific adviser, who chairs Sage, said the “decision not to disclose” membership of the committee was based on advice from the Centre for the Protection of National Infrastructure.“This contributes towards safeguarding inidual members’ personal security and protects them from lobbying and other forms of unwanted influence which may hinder their ability to give impartial advice,” Vallance wrote. “Of course, we do not stop iniduals from revealing that they have attended Sage.”On Friday, England’s chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, appeared to signal a change in direction, saying the public had a right to know who sat on Sage. He told a Commons science select committee that while it was important to consider security concerns, there was “absolutely no barrier” from him or Vallance. Asked if in the current climate revealing the names of who was on the group would boost public confidence in the scientific advice being given, Whitty replied: “Yes.”Several members on Sage, as well as scientists on its advisory subcommittees, are known to be frustrated at what they view as a culture of secrecy that risks straining public trust in the government’s response to Covid-19.Since the outbreak, ministers have stuck to the script that their policies are guided by scientific advice, while declining to reveal where the advice is coming from or what exactly it contains.Other countries have been more open about the scientific evidence behind their decisions, and the UK’s approach has raised eyebrows overseas.The New York Times reported on Thursday that Sage operates in “a virtual black box”. “Its list of members is secret, its meetings are closed, its recommendations are private and the minutes of its deliberations are published much later, if at all.” understands that Sage first met for a precautionary meeting to discuss Covid-19 on 22 January, then again on 28 January. It met a further nine times in February, and 10 times in March. It is currently meeting around twice a week.It understood that while the chief medical officers and chief scientific advisers of the devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have been allowed to listen in on Sage meetings, they have been doing so as observers. Unlike Cummings and Warner, they were not allowed to ask questions, having to instead submit them in writing in advance.While core members of the committee, such as Whitty, attend all meetings, other clinical experts, scientists and epidemiologists do not attend every meeting, but can be asked in on a rotating basis to provide specific advice. Sage tends to be guided by specific questions that they are asked to consider by the Cabinet Office’s emergency Cobra meetings.Other Sage participants at the 23 March meeting included Sharon Peacock, the director of the National Infection Service at Public Health England, and Ian Diamond, the head of the Government Statistical Service. Neil Ferguson, the Imperial College epidemiologist whose models have been central to government decision–making, was also present, along with fellow infectious disease specialists, Graham Medley and John Edmunds.Others attendees included Brooke Rogers, a professor of behavioural science at King’s College – who also chairs the Cabinet Office’s National Risk Assessment Behavioural Science Advisory Group – and James Rubin, also at King’s, who chairs a Sage subcommittee that provides specific advice on behavioural science.However it is the inclusion of two Downing Street political advisers that will raise questions over whether the structure of the government’s scientific advisory process is free from political interference.A source in Downing Street said that in March Cummings was playing a commanding role in responding to the Covid-19 outbreak. Cummings is understood to be close to Warner, whose brother, Marc, runs Faculty, an artificial intelligence company that the  revealed is involved in an “unprecedented” data-mining operation as part of the government’s response to the coronavirus outbreak.An accomplished data scientist, Ben Warner previously worked at his brother’s AI company, which has teamed up with with Palantir, the US data firm founded by the rightwing billionaire Peter Thiel, to consolidate UK government databases to help ministers respond to the pandemic."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c893a4163c53847ad9362754d38133804fac7777/0_72_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=93ff1392808cb71f7d26e4383ea75b89","title":"tell us what are your experiences of private covid 19 testing centres coronavirus","story":"If you’ve used a private coronavirus testing centre, we’d like to find out what the service was like.

It is no exaggeration to say that the fate of many millions of people rests on the discovery of a vaccine for Covid-19 – the only sure escape route from the pandemic.Yet the optimism that accompanied the launch of Oxford University’s human trials this week has to be put in context, and the hurdles facing the scientists need to be understood.The vaccine hunters are trying to outwit an invisible enemy so small that a million viral particles could fit inside a human cell, but whose biological ingenuity has brought everyday life to a standstill.So what is the path to success?Traditional vaccines work by creating a weakened version of a virus, similar enough to the original that the immune system will be forearmed if the person is exposed to a full infection in future, helping prevent actual illness.The approach has led to some of our best vaccines, but is also fundamentally risky because there is always a chance that a newly developed attenuated virus won’t be as innocuous as hoped. Clinical trials have to be approached cautiously and slowly – especially when there are no effective treatments for a disease.A slow approach is not ideal in a pandemic.So it’s perhaps unsurprising that only two of the 76 vaccine candidates that the World Health Organization has on its radar have opted for this traditional approach.The rest rely on the fast-track idea that the immune system doesn’t need to see the entire virus to generate the ammunition to fight it off in the future. If the virus is the warship, the theory is that the immune system needs only to see the enemy flag to form an indelible immune memory. In the case of Covid-19, this flag takes the form of prominent protrusions, known as spike proteins, that form a halo or “corona” around the virus.Advances in genetic engineering have given full flight to scientists’ creativity in developing this defence.Teams around the world have moved at unprecedented pace, going from having the genetic sequence for the spike protein in January to vaccine candidates a matter of weeks later.But many of these technologies are unproven and the success of any trial is far from guaranteed, as this week’s disappointing results for the drug remdesivir show. Ethical questions need to be navigated to ensure the safety of volunteers.And then, potentially the most contentious question of all: if a vaccine is found, who gets it first?First into clinical trials, just eight weeks after the genetic sequence for Covid-19 was published in January, was the US biotech company Moderna, with its RNA vaccine.RNA is a single-stranded messenger molecule that normally delivers genetic instructions from DNA, coiled up inside cells, to protein-making factories that sit outside cells.In this case, the RNA instructs the muscle cells to start churning out the harmless spike protein as a warning to the immune system. Imperial College London’s team, this week backed by £22.5m government funding, is also developing an RNA vaccine, but in a form that hasn’t been tested before in people.“Some groups have skipped animal studies because their technology has been used in human studies,” said Prof Robin Shattock, who is leading the Imperial team. “We don’t have that luxury. It’s probably cost us one or two months, but it’s much better to be cautious and be sure you’ve got something that’s really safe.”Also testing their candidates in human trials are the Chinese vaccine company CanSino Biologics, and a team at Oxford University led by Prof Sarah Gilbert.Both are using harmless viruses that have been disabled so that they don’t replicate once they get inside cells. These delivery vehicles are known as “non-replicating viral vectors”.These teams had already tried and tested the approach for other diseases, such as Ebola, and had flasks of their vectors sitting in freezers, ready to go. A third approach is that of the US biotech company Inovio, a firm that has existed for four decades without developing an approved product, but whose stock soared after it started its trial earlier this month.Its vaccine uses DNA to carry instructions for making the spike protein into cells, which gets transcribed into messenger RNA, which then orders the protein factories to start pumping out the enemy spike protein.This might seem an unnecessarily elaborate cascade, but some think that getting the enemy flag inside cells and not just into the bloodstream could be important .“Clearly it is true that there are no approved RNA or DNA vaccines on the market today,” said Joseph Kim, Inovio’s CEO. “But I think it’s just a matter of time.”Finally, a fourth strategy simply manufactures massive supplies of the spike protein itself, and injects a dose directly into people.This is what the big pharma team-up of Sanofi and GSK are betting on. Sanofi is repurposing a vaccine candidate that was developed for Sars in the early 2000s, while GSK is providing an ingredient, known as an adjuvant, that boosts the immune response, which has also been tried and tested.It’s too early to say which option looks the most promising, according to Richard Hatchett, chief executive officer of the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (Cepi), which is funding the development and testing of eight candidates.“Some vaccines are going to be very fast to clinic, others have tremendous potential to scale up,” he said. “And the challenge that we face is that there’s going to be a great deal of urgency and pressure to roll out vaccines quickly for obvious reasons. You’re talking about giving a medical product to someone who is well.”A few candidates will be filtered out in toxicology testing in animals. Others might fail because phase one trials in people produce unexpected side effects.There is a chance none of them will work.For some illnesses, including other circulating coronaviruses, the immune system wages its battle, then a few months later forgets it ever happened. Others, like chicken pox or mumps, trigger lifelong immunity.The truth is we’re not yet sure where on this spectrum Covid-19 lies.“Reasonable guesses are that there might be partial protection for close to a year,” according to Marcus Lipsitch, a professor of epidemiology at Harvard, whose team recently predicted that, in the absence of a vaccine, social distancing may need to continue until 2022. “On the long end, it might be several years of good protection. It’s really speculative at this point.”On the positive side, Covid-19 appears quite stable genetically, meaning that the spike protein that vaccines are built around should still look the same next winter.This isn’t the case for flu, which shuffles its genes around so rapidly that new vaccines are needed each year.There are also questions around the type of immunity required.The body overcomes illness through antibodies, which see off the virus itself, and killer T-cells, which eliminate cells already infected by the foreign invader. For some illnesses, antibodies do the heavy lifting, but the balance varies depending on pathogen and even across people.“An ideal vaccine should generate a response in both arms of the immune system - antibodies and T cells,” said Kim. He predicts this could be a weakness of RNA and protein vaccines, which are delivered outside of cells, meaning that killer T-cells are not likely to be recruited.There is also a chance that some trials could grind to a halt, simply because the pandemic has been so well controlled by lockdowns and other measures. “You need a certain hit rate in the population you’re vaccinating to get the statistics to show your vaccine is having protective ability,” said Miles Carroll, head of research at Public Health England’s National Infection Service at Porton Down.The possibility of “challenge trials”, in which people are deliberately infected, have been considered, but there are obvious ethical issues with exposing volunteers to a potentially deadly disease. “There’s a lot of interest in this … because it would really accelerate vaccine development, but there are some major hurdles to ensure the safety of the volunteers in that setting,” said Prof Andrew Pollard, chief investigator on the Oxford study.Vaccine manufacturers talk in terms of yield: how many doses of vaccine do you get out per litre of culture. And there could be significant differences in the ability of teams to produce the number of doses required to make a difference.Shattock believes this will be a strength of Imperial’s RNA vaccine candidate, which has the unique feature of replicating itself thousands of times once inside the body.“We can make the equivalent of a million doses within a litre of material,” said Shattock. “Many other vaccines would need hundreds or thousands of litres for that. It’s the scalability. Towards the end of the year we’ll be hoping to make tens of millions of doses.”“If our vaccine were shown to be successful, if everything goes well – and that’s still a big if – we could deploy it in the UK this winter,” said Shattock. “All these smaller approaches will hold the fort until a larger global solution comes.”By September there could be a vaccine – maybe several – that appear broadly safe and effective.That’s not enough to get a vaccine licensed, but governments are already talking about the potential for rolling out such candidates to high-risk groups, potentially including millions of health workers, under “emergency use” rules in the absence of this ultimate seal of approval.There are precedents for this – in the 2018 Ebola outbreak, more than 200,000 people in Democratic Republic of Congo received the Merck vaccine before it was licensed in 2019.“That might be enough if you are an intensive care nurse or living in an old people’s home, to say that for you, because you have the most to gain from being vaccinated, the risk-benefit balance is favourable,” said Sandy Douglas, an Oxford vaccine researcher.But very rare side-effects cannot be ruled out. And there have been vaccine calamities in the past – recently the GSK vaccine Pandemrix, given to millions during the swine flu pandemic of 2009, which was linked to narcolepsy in one in every 55,000 jabs.The principle of transparent informed consent will be critical, Douglas added. “In this case, that would include the fact that if you’re being offered a vaccine in October that didn’t exist in April, there will not yet be long-term safety follow-up experience, although we do have longer term experience with several similar vaccines.”Iniduals could be faced with tough choices – take an experimental vaccine or leave themselves at risk of infection.At the moment, many teams are trying all sorts of ways to develop a vaccine, but there is no coherent solution for the whole planet. Some are banking on big pharma swooping in with a blockbuster product. Sanofi and GSK, as a joint force, are unique in having the ability to manufacture hundreds of millions of doses without relying on external support.But multinationals are not built for speed and their reputations depend on absolute safety, so there is no prospect of this team making its vaccine widely available before mid to late-2021.Others urge a unified approach governments, the UN, the World Bank and the WHO need to agree a way forward before a lead candidate emerges.National governments are already making advance purchase agreements and looking to secure their own supply chains.Hatchett and others are arguing for a global commitment of tens of billions of dollars to ensure that any successful vaccine is distributed globally and according to need. “In global health terms that’s a very big number,” he said. “But if your point of reference is the global impact that this pandemic is having on the economy, then that’s a very small number. If you buy into the idea that the vaccine is the escape route from the pandemic then that’s a really good investment.”"},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

Photograph: Colin KeeganCollins DublinThe deaths of another 28 people who had been diagnosed with Covid-19 have been reported by the Department of Health, alongside a significant spike in diagnosed cases.However, Chief Medical Officer Tony Holohan said the 936 new cases had to be seen in the context of “an ambitious programme of testing in nursing homes and residential facilities”.Some 794 people have now died in Ireland following a laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of the virus.Modelling data published by the Department of Health suggests that at the moment, the spread of the virus in the community is substantially under control. However, Dr Holohan emphasised that significant risks were still attached to the relaxation of the measures.Warning against complacency, he pointed to data gleaned from seismilogical sensors, as well as mobile phones, which indicated an increase in activity in the last few days.“This is giving us hard evidence that there is more population movement in spite of our continuing advice. It’s giving us an evidential base for some of the concerns we’ve been expressing”He said that while people may feel that Ireland is on “a pathway towards the slackening of measures on the fifth of May, that is not the case. If the decision was to be made today, we wouldn’t be advising any of the restrictions in place be relaxed.“It’s really important that people don’t anticipate that’s what’s going to happen on the 5th of May, it is not a certainty that this is the position we’ll be in”.“It would take very little indeed for us to lose the good work we have done there’s no sense in which we have achieved something here that couldn’t all be undone very quickly,” he said.‘Significant supression’Prof Philip Nolan, chairman of the National Public Health Emergency Team’s epidemiological modelling group, said that the reproduction rate of the virus, the so-called R0 number, was somewhere between 0.5 and 0.8, meaning that on average every infected person is passing the virus on to less than one other person.However, discusssing the potential growth of that metric if measures are relaxed, he said an R number of 1.6 would see “a dangerous peak in cases, perhaps up to 1,000 a week”. If it were to grow to 2.4, “we have a real difficulty, we wouldn’t be able to cope with that, quite frankly”.Prof Nolan said there had been a “very significant supression of the growth of Covid-19. . . in Ireland monitored against all the different indicators you might use”. He said data showed the disease is “heavily suppressed in the general population”, but it was not clear whether it is under control in nursing homes and other long term residential facilities.The latest data shows that 60.8 per cent of those diagnosed with the virus, some 10,004 people, have recovered, with 3,638 (22.1 per cent) still unwell, and 816 (5 per cent) in hospital. The numbers of deaths per day, Prof Nolan said, has been relatively stable since the end of the first week in April, “a final indication that the disease appears to be under control”.Despite the positive trends in the data, Prof Nolan emphasised that “while we are on track to get the level of disease down, but we’re certainly not there yet”.Contradictory datasetsThe Government and its public health expert team published seemingly contradictory datasets on public movement on Thursday, with the Chief Medical Officer saying sensor information showed there had been “slippage” in compliance with lockdown protocals.Pointing to data gleaned from the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies’ National Seismic Network, which appeared to show an increase in activity in recent days, Dr Tony Holohan said it was “hard evidence that there is more population movement in spite of our continuing advice”.He also referred to data captured from Apple-made smartphones, which showed an increase in people walking, driving and taking public transport. While he sympathised with the impact unprecedented restrictions are having on people, he emphasised that positive trends in recent data could easily be undone if social distancing and other measures were not observed.Earlier in the day, the Department of the Taoiseach pointed to data from the National Transport Authority (NTA) which showed the number of cars on Ireland’s road network had fallen by up to 70 per cent compared to the same dates in 2019.Liz Canavan, the assistant secretary at the Department, said that while there is “anecdotal evidence” in relation to more people being on the roads, TII “undertook an analysis of the traffice figures for this week, and the volumes are in line with the previous weeks since the restrictions were introduced.”Stay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4236872.1587747470!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus northern ireland lifts restrictions on visiting graveyards","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA medial worker holds a swab sample of a test for coronavirus. Photograph: Francesca VolpiBloombergThe Northern Ireland Executive has decided to lift restrictions on access to graveyards during the Covid-19 pandemic.In a press conference on Friday afternoon, First Minister Arlene Foster made the announcement, after considerable pressure from sections of the public and religious leaders. She said the North’s Chief Medical and Chief Scientific officers had said it was a “proportionate and low risk amendment”. Comprehensive weekly figures published on Friday by the Northern Ireland Statistics \u0026amp Research Agency (Nisra) indicated up to the week ending Friday, April 17th, there had been 276 Covid-19 related deaths, in hospitals, care homes and other premises in the North. The Public Health Agency (PHA), which provides daily updates of predominantly hospital deaths, said the toll by the same date was 212. The PHA said on Friday that 15 further people had died since Thursday, bringing its total reported death figures up to April 24th to 278. At the press conference, Ms Foster asked people to “heed advice” on going out in public, to respect the 2m social distancing rule, and to wash hands thoroughly. It continues to be the case that wakes should not be held, funerals should be in private with a maximum of 10 people, and there should be no gatherings after funerals. She described it as “a matter of life and death” and urged people to listen to funeral directors.She further urged the public to follow all the guidelines in place at present in an effort to suppress the virus.“We are not out of the woods,” she said. “Making a quick dash for the exit would be a mistake.” She added that “social distancing will be with us a long time”.Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill said the Executive was easing the restrictions after considering the mental health implications of keeping cemeteries closed and after feedback from the public and others. She said the Executive had “recognised the comfort of visiting graveyards”.The first ministers offered their condolences to DUP politicians Jeffrey Donaldson and Edwin Poots, whose elderly fathers both died this week, and to Sinn Féin’s Oliver McMullan on the death of his 22-year-old daughter Tierna. Ms O’Neill said Tierna was: “A beautiful wee star who would light up your day.”She said “life as we know it has changed” for a couple of years if not beyond that. “The virus is still here and not going away any time soon,” she said. She added that now was “not the time to talk about an exit strategy”. A statement on Friday issued by Stormont’s department of finance said the Nisra figures published for the week ending April 17th show that, of the 276 total deaths involving Covid-19, 166 (60.1 per cent) occurred in hospital, 93 (33.7 per cent) occurred in care homes, 3 (1.1 per cent) in hospices and 14 (5.1 per cent) occurred at private addresses or other locations.The 96 deaths in care homes and hospices involved 44 separate establishments, the statement said.The comparative number of deaths reported daily by the Public Health Agency (PHA) to April 17th was 212.Death certificatesThe PHA figures are based on patients having previously tested positive for the virus, whereas Nisra figures are based on the information entered on death certificates, filled out by medical professionals.The provisional number of total deaths registered in Northern Ireland in the week ending April 17th was 424, 11 fewer than the week before, but 134 more than the five-year average of 290.A total of 101 (23.8 per cent) of these deaths mentioned Covid-19 on the death certificate, bringing the total number of Covid-19 related deaths registered to 242.Over the last three weeks in total, 410 “excess deaths” — deaths above the average for the corresponding week in previous years — have been registered in Northern Ireland.Males accounted for about half (49 per cent) of all registered deaths in the calendar year 2020 to April 17th and slightly more than half (54.1per cent) of the 242 Covid-19 related deaths registered over the same period.The majority of all deaths registered this week and the year-to-date were of persons aged 75 and above. This age group accounted for two-thirds of all deaths and almost 75 per cent of Covid-19 related deaths in the year-to-date up to April 17th.There have been 5,245 deaths registered in the year-to-date, 30.3 per cent of which (1,589) were classified as “respiratory”.The number and proportion of respiratory deaths is lower in the year-to-date than the five-year average of 1,613 (31.7 per cent).Daily figuresPHA daily figures cover the number of deaths reported to it where the deceased had a positive test for Covid-19 and died within 28 days, whether or not Covid-19 was the cause of death.The PHA figures may not capture all deaths that occur outside hospital.The Nisra weekly provisional death statistics, are based on death registration information collected by the General Register Office, count all deaths where Covid-19 was mentioned on the death certificate by the doctor who certified the death, whether or not Covid-19 was the primary underlying cause of death.The figures include cases where the doctor noted that there was suspected or probable coronavirus infection involved in the death.As a result the weekly totals will usually be higher than the relevant daily figures — because the DoH daily updates only include those who have tested positive for the virus.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4237225.1587748847!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus traffic volumes steadily increasing during lockdown","story":"Chief Medical Officer, Dr Tony Holohan, says that data provided by the Irish National Seismic Network - used to monitor earthquakes - shows an increase in population movement in recent days, despite continued coronavirus restrictions. Video: RTÉ\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTraffic volumes have increased since the start of the lockdown in March. Photograph: Gareth ChaneyCollinsTraffic volumes are up by about 10 per cent this week since the first three weeks of lockdown, according to the latest figures produced by Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII).The information taken from 350 traffic points around the country is corroborated by both seismic data from the Dublin Institute of Advanced Studies (DIAS) and from Apple mobile phone monitoring.The chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan on Thursday warned against complacency and pointed to data from traffic volumes, mobile phones and seismic sensors that suggested an increase in activity, or a “slippage” in compliance.Dr Holohan said he understood the public’s frustration, but “it would take very little indeed for us to lose the good work we have done”.He stressed that while people may feel Ireland is on “a pathway towards the slackening of measures on May 5th, that is not the case. If the decision was to be made today, we wouldn’t be advising any of the restrictions in place be relaxed”. According to the TII, in the time between the closure of the schools on March 12th and the general lockdown announced on March 27th, traffic volumes were down by 40 per cent on weekdays. They plummeted further by up to 70 per cent after a ban was placed on all non-essential travel outside a two kilometre zone. On Easter Sunday, April 12th, traffic fell to just 13 per cent of what would have been normal volumes. Since the Easter Bank Holiday weekend, there has been an upturn in passenger numbers. An analysis of TII figures for three of the busiest traffic points in the country show that volumes are rising day on day. Between Tuesday April 14th and Thursday April 16th (Monday, April 13th being a Bank Holiday), traffic on the M1 between Donabate and Balbriggan South, on the M50 between the M4 and the M7 junctions, and the M8 between Glanmire and Dunkettle near Cork city are up 7.8 per cent, 6.5 per cent and 5 per cent respectively week on week. Traffic volumes between the first Thursday of the lockdown (April 2nd) and Thursday of this week (April 23rd) indicate increases of 11.5 per cent in traffic volumes on the M50, 9 per cent on the M8 and 7 per cent on the M1. However, even these traffic increases leave volumes a third of what would be expected normally. A TII spokesman said traffic volumes in general are up by 10 per cent on average in comparison with the first three weeks of the lockdown and that figures presented to the Government by the organisation demonstrate that fact. TII information only measures traffic points between towns and cities and not activity within cities. The Irish National Seismic Network earthquake monitor located in the Dublin mountains has picked up a notable upsurge in human-made seismic noise April has progressed.The stations recorded seismic noise up to a third lower than it was before the lockdown dropping to its quietest point on Easter Sunday, but all of the days of this week have seen more activity in the greater Dublin area than any other days since the lockdown started. The graph was used by Dr Holohan at Thursday’s press conference to illustrate his point about more noise. However, a spokesman for the Dublin Institute of Advanced Studies said it would not be answering questions about the data for “fear of damaging NPHET (National Public Health Emergency Team) work in producing the clear succinct messages that are critical at this time”. Apple has made its mobility data available to government from Apple map requests. They show that activity continues to remain significantly below normal.Currently requests for information on driving are down 64 per cent, walking 67 per cent and other forms of transit such as public transport or cycling by 87 per cent. In the first week of the lockdown, though requests for maps relating to driving and walking were down by 70 per cent in total. This would indicate an increase of activity of about five per cent.

Photograph: Olivia KellyDublin motorists are continuing to park in spaces reallocated to pedestrians to enable physical distancing during the coronavirus pandemic, it has emerged.Over the last week Dublin City Council has begun installing bollards blocking off loading bays and parking spaces on the north and south sides of the city to give more space to pedestrians at pinch-points which are particularly busy or where the path is narrow.Council chief executive Owen Keegan said councillors across all political groups had made representations regarding the need for increased provision for pedestrians and cyclists to facilitate greater compliance with social distancing“There seems to be a particular problem in certain villages, where there is significant on-street queuing to access supermarkets etc, on narrow footpaths, which gives rise to pedestrian congestion,” he said.To date the council has requisitioned road space at five locations: Dorset Street outside Tesco Express Stoneybatter outside Centra Capel Street outside Centra Fairview outside Tesco and Rathmines at the pedestrian entrance to the Swan Centre.Next week, the council will begin installing a contraflow cycle lane on Nassau Street in the city centre and it has also introduced an online form on dublincity.ie to allow members of the public suggest locations where they believe additional road space is required.Lane separatorsThe measures, which involve the use of low-rise lane separators known as “orcas” along with vertical bollards, have been in place for a week. Some drivers are ignoring them so they can park directly outside shops. In some cases, the manoeuvre involves driving over the barrier, while in others the motorist has to mount the footpath to access the space.“Motor traffic acts like a gas rather than a liquid – it expands into any space afforded to it. Unless it is made physically impossible it’s not going to stop a lot of drivers,” Dublin Cycling Campaign spokesman Kieran Ryan said.The measures implemented to date had been done on a “micro scale”, Mr Ryan said. “We need to develop this at a macro scale, following the type of measures recently undertaken in Milan, Brussels and Berlin, where they are looking at making large parts of their city centres car-free.”He said such measures would be essential on narrow city streets, such as South William Street where the pavement is particularly congested, when businesses began to reopen but social distancing measures were still required.Loading baysMr Ryan said he hoped as more sections of road were requisitioned, and drivers became more familiar with the measures, a greater degree of compliance would emerge. However, he said: “There is a legacy issue of loading bays being abused by the drivers of private cars, and by the drivers of commercial vehicles who will use them as parking spaces, rather than to deliver to shops.”The spaces reallocated to pedestrians on Dorset Street were at noon on Friday fully occupied by vehicles. The driver of one van said he was aware of the distancing measures and was entirely supportive of them, but felt he had no option but to park in his usual space.“I’m here every week for a maintenance job for Tesco. It usually takes a couple of hours, but, and I don’t like saying anything bad about any area, I can’t park around the corner or the van would be vandalised and broken into.”He said he needed to have quick access to his van, and parking options on Dorset Street were limited. “I have to make 10-15 trips out to the van for each job, but I do my best not to get in anyone’s way on the path, because I know everyone is very nervous at the moment.”The council said vehicles parked in a way that did not respect the new measures would be towed away by Dublin Street Parking Services (DSPS). “DSPS have been instructed to relocate offending vehicles that have parked in loading bays which have been cordoned off to enable social distancing.”Stay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4231819.1587147602!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus brexit a key issue says us special envoy","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tUS special envoy for Northern Ireland Mick Mulvaney: “The president knew that Brexit is going to be a big deal.”  Photograph: Al DragoBloombergThe US special envoy for Northern Ireland, Mick Mulvaney, has said he intends to travel to Northern Ireland as soon as the coronavirus restrictions are lifted, as he prepares to assume his post.Mr Mulvaney said a key focus for him in the coming weeks is how the Covid-19 crisis will impact on Brexit. The British government’s plan to deal with legacy issues from the Troubles, announced on March 18th, also promises to be a focus when normal life resumes, he said. Mr Mulvaney, who was appointed by President Donald Trump in March, had been scheduled to make his first visit to Northern Ireland as US special envoy next month. But the coronavirus has put that plan on hold. “I have been using the time to familiarise myself with the issues. Obviously, Covid-19 is the focus of everyone’s attention right now. It’s a very fluid situation,” he said, speaking from his home in South Carolina, the state he represented in Congress before joining the Trump administration. Like millions of people across the United States, the former White House chief of staff has been working from home where he is based with his wife and three children, as states have imposed stay-at-home restrictions. He says he will visit Northern Ireland “as soon as the door opens”.Interest in positionThe Irish-American politician has been communicating with Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney, and Northern Ireland secretary Brandon Lewis in the past few weeks.He has also spoken to previous holders of the post, such as Richard Haass, chairman of the Council on Foreign Relations, who was appointed by George W Bush. Mr Mulvaney (52), who reportedly had expressed a long-held interest in the position that had been vacant since the end of the Obama presidency, said his appointment was a measure of the Trump administration’s interest in Northern Ireland and Brexit in particular. He said Mr Trump views the post as akin to the role held by his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, who he appointed to manage the White House strategy on the Middle East. “The president knew that Brexit is going to be a big deal – it’s a big deal just generally, and in terms of North-South relations – so he said to me: ‘Jared is going to go and take care of the Palestinians and Israelis, you make sure things go smoothly over there,” says Mr Mulvaney. The husband of Mr Trump’s daughter, Ivanka, is widely viewed to have had minimal success with bringing peace to the Middle East. Trump and PompeoMr Mulvaney visited Northern Ireland in February ahead of his appointment, where he met with First Minister Arlene Foster, Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill and the new permanent secretary at the Northern Ireland Office, Madeline Alessandri. He also met Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and US ambassador Ed Crawford, a Trump appointee, at Farmleigh.The role of Northern Ireland envoy falls under the remit of the US state department, and Mr Mulvaney will report to Mr Trump and US secretary of state Mike Pompeo. Mr Mulvaney was replaced as Mr Trump’s chief of staff by congressman Mark Meadows last month. Like many in the administration, Mr Mulvaney played down the risk of coronavirus as recently as late February.Asked if he missed working at the White House, he replied: “I’m always happy to be home, but it’s kind of strange to be out of Washington at this time.” He says he still talks to the president and points out that Mr Meadows is a friend of his. Both were co-founders of the Freedom Caucus on Capitol Hill, a group of conservative, Republican lawmakers.

An EU official said Mr Barnier was concerned about the prospect of not reaching agreement ahead of June extension deadline. Photograph: Olivier MatthysPoolAFP via Getty ImagesNo progress has been made in the areas of starkest disagreement between the European Union and the UK in week-long talks on the post-Brexit relationship, held over video conference due to the coronavirus pandemic.Lead EU negotiator Michel Barnier accused the British side of failing to engage seriously on some aspects, and said never before had such high-stakes talks had to take place under such time pressure, which was all the more difficult given the need to battle the pandemic and its severe economic fallout.“In this context, the negotiation that has occupied us this week may appear out of touch. It has even been qualified as surreal,” Mr Barnier said following the talks on Friday.Both EU and British sources said progress would have to seriously speed up in order for sufficient progress to be made, and an EU official said Mr Barnier was seriously worried about the prospect of not reaching an agreement.“They listen politely to us presenting our text, but they don’t engage in some of the areas where they don’t have an interest to reach an agreement,” a senior EU official said.“We don’t have much time, and we see that in some of the aspects that the British authorities know for us, the EU side, are indispensable to have an agreement in the end, they don’t want to move. This is why Michel Barnier is concerned.”It was the first of three rounds of talks scheduled to be held before June, when Britain will have its final chance to opt for more time to negotiate its future relationship with its biggest trading partner.British sources insisted that under no circumstances would they accept an extension of the transition period, which expires at the end of this year.If no deal can be agreed between the UK and the EU by then, they will automatically begin trading on default World Trade Organisation terms, which is forecast to deliver a deep blow to the British economy and to its nearest neighbours, particularly Ireland. Even if a deal is agreed, British negotiators say they are perusing an arrangement like those the EU has with Canada or Japan, which would entail significant barriers to trade.‘Level playing field’The four areas of greatest contention are on the so-called “level playing field”, on the governance of the deal, on police and judicial co-operation, and on fishing rights, an area on which Britain has yet to submit a legal text of its position for negotiation.The EU has said it will not grant tariff-free access to its single market unless Britain maintains labour and environmental standards and guarantees it will not intervene to give companies an unfair advantage. Britain has dismissed this as unacceptable.On governance, the EU wants a single overarching framework while the UK wants a series of separate arrangements. The EU insists that Britain should guarantee continued adherence to the European Convention on Human Rights, and that the European Court of Justice should be the final arbiter on disputes that touch on EU law. Britain rejects the jurisdiction of the ECJ entirely.“We will not make progress on the so called level playing field and the governance provisions until the EU drops its insistence on imposing conditions on the UK which are not found in the EU’s other trade agreements and which do not take account of the fact that we have left the EU as an independent state,” a British government spokesperson said.British sources said they had used the latest round of talks to challenge the EU’s argument that Britain’s size and proximity to the EU made level playing field commitments essential, and they defended British labour and environmental standards.They said there was no question of Britain continuing fishing quota agreements with other EU countries, which Brussels has proposed.The two sides meet for further rounds of talks starting on May 11th and June 1st ahead of a high-level meeting before the end of June which will make the final decision on extending the transition.Separately, the Specialised Committee on the Protocol on IrelandNorthern Ireland will meet next Thursday. The EU has emphasised that agreement of a deal depends on Britain demonstrating that it is enacting prior agreements, including on arrangements for trade between Britain and Northern Ireland, which the EU insists entails regulatory, sanitary and phytosanitary checks on goods entering the North from Britain.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

The Prime Minister had issued what he called a “simple” instruction to the country to “stay at home”. But he had also added a caveat. People could go out to work “where this is absolutely necessary and cannot be done from home”.The business in question was a manufacturer, definitely not a work-from-the-sofa-in-pyjamas sort of operation. So perhaps the answer was yes. The legislation came out and, after scouring it, the owner could see nothing forbidding him from operating, so long as he took some social distancing measures. He had two months’ cash and a full order book and who knew how long the lockdown would last? So he told staff that work would continue. But the workforce had been bombarded by messages telling them they risked death if they went outside. The message came back loud and clear: “No.”The Government has now explained that its main virus control strategy after the lockdown will be to test, contact-trace and isolate potential cases, along the lines of successful Asian examples. This is the only viable exit route from lockdown. What we do not yet know is what can reopen and when. As the business example above shows, it is not as simple as it seems when reading a script into a camera lens at Number 10.For one thing, the Government has been bashing us over the head with the same message for a month: “Stay at home or you’ll die!” We get it constantly from letters, TV ads, radio ads, online ads, text messages and all the rest. This campaign has been extraordinarily successful. Contact between households has all but evaporated, deaths and new cases have levelled off, the NHS is still functioning and polls show enormous public support for the measures. At some point, however, even though the risk of getting the virus can never be wholly removed, the message will need to change and the new rules need to be clear. Let’s not come out of lockdown in the same way we went into it, with some garbled message like, “It’s probably fine to reopen.”This won’t be easy to manage because, as chief medical officer Chris Whitty has said, we don’t yet know what mix of activity will optimise economic and social wellbeing while keeping the epidemic under control. What is clear is that the new regime will have a very low tolerance for any rise in transmission rates because of the worry that growth can quickly become exponential and overwhelm the health service. This low risk tolerance is necessary for the economy too in order to build public confidence and improve the working and business environment. If we are living in constant fear of a second lockdown, furloughs will start to turn into redundancies.There is some evidence that the extent of the lockdown we are in is not necessary to keep the epidemic under control. A handful of European countries have implemented slightly softer regimes. Sweden, at the most liberal end, is probably not an example to follow, given its relatively high death rate compared to its direct peers. But the Netherlands, whose epidemic is now shrinking, may have achieved a good balance.On paper, the Dutch rules are similar to Britain’s, but its regime is actually somewhat less severe. Whereas the Netherlands acted early and saw the volume of shoppers and commuters halve, the UK acted a little later and then saw falls of 70-80 per cent. We swung from insouciance, when parks and street markets were packed in defiance of the Government’s advice, to immediate docility when the cops were sent out.The Dutch government’s analysis of various distancing measures has now concluded that whereas banning large gatherings and encouraging people to work from home were essential to control the epidemic, closing cafes and schools probably had little effect. School closures, of course, have a huge economic impact since they deprive most families of childcare.Aside from getting the rules right, the Government needs also to create the right incentives and communicate them effectively. Managers should not be in the dark about whether they are allowed to operate. The Government should not be sending letters, as business secretary Alok Sharma did last week, suggesting in one breath that “there is no restriction on manufacturing continuing under the current rules” and then implying, in the next, that active businesses should be “playing a direct role in combatting Covid-19”. Businesses should not be left worrying about whether they are legally liable if they ask staff to work and then get sued by an employee who gets ill.This is all the more delicate because although it has undoubtedly saved millions of jobs, the furloughing regime has also created a new set of incentives. Many employees, especially those with medical conditions, elderly relatives living with them or children to look after, might rather be at home on 80 per cent of pay than at work for the extra 20.Most businesses do not want to have threaten to fire their staff in order to get them into work and do not want workers to feel they are risking their lives at work or on the transport method they use to get in. At some point, it will have to be made clear that the country cannot allow millions of workers to stay at home at taxpayers’ expense, even if the risk of contagion can only be minimised and never eliminated. The furloughing system will have to taper off. Managed wrongly, this could become toxic, especially given that it is disproportionately working-class jobs that really cannot be done from home.The future is moving slowly into view. It is one where schools, restaurants and factories are up and running, where life has returned to some semblance of normal. But it is also one where we are still obsessing over clean hands, walking oddly far apart from one another and dreaming idly of the day when we can go abroad, attend a sports match or even just convene a book club and have tea with granny.The precursor to any economic recovery and growing confidence is a public released from living in confusion and fear.

It was a popular policy among the public, polling showed, with many recognising its effectiveness in \u0027flattening the curve\u0027 of the epidemic. The vast majority have adhered to the lockdown\u0027s rules. But now, people\u0027s searching habits may reveal that the public\u0027s patience is beginning to waver, with the Government offering no end in sight to the lockdown. Searches for when pubs, restaurants, shops and schools will re-open have all increased over the last week. Most people are concerned about when schools will re-open in the UK, according to the figures. This peaked on Sunday 19 April, after Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said I can\u0027t give you a date when schools will reopen.But people are also increasingly looking for a date on which they can re-enter social venues such as pubs and shops.Searches for symptoms peaked in the UK on the 16 and 17 March, over a week before the lockdown was imposed. At this point, cases were rising exponentially in the UK. Since the lockdown came into place, the number of cases of coronavirus has flattened. The R value - the rate at which the disease spreads - is now said to be below one in the community, meaning that each infected person is, on average, spreading it to less than one person. This seems to have led to people being less worried about themselves having the disease, with fewer numbers looking to self-diagnose themselves of symptoms on Google.Now, this behaviour has been usurped by search interest in the lockdown itself, with an increase in people looking for an end to at least some of the measures.This interest for the word lockdown peaked on 23 March, the day the measures were initially imposed, but still remains as a quarter of this level a full month after the restrictions were put in place.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"royal navy submarine crew had lockdown party","story":"A Royal Navy nuclear submarine captain, under investigation for allowing a quarantine barbeque to go ahead, would usually have just received a \u0027slap on the wrist\u0027, the  understands.  An investigation is under way after reports that the commander threw a party for his crew despite social distancing guidelines.Social media footage has emerged of the crew of HMS Trenchant enjoying the barbecue and party in violation of lockdown rules after docking for repairs in Devonport base, Plymouth.The Trafalgar-class attack submarine had been at sea for months and was due to return on patrol after a short maintenance period.Ordinarily, such an incident would have merited a low level disciplinary sanction such as a stern word from a senior officer a so-called slap on the wrist - known throughout the military as an \u0027interview without coffee\u0027. However, the more serious measure of launching a formal investigation has been taken as this is thought not to be the first time the judgement of the commanding officer has been called into question by senior navy figures. HMS Trenchant\u0027s commanding officer has been sent home on leave whilst the investigation takes place.Admiral Lord West of Spithead, the former head of the Royal Navy, said: “These guys have been locked up in a boat for a very long time and are suddenly told they’re not allowed to go anywhere because they’re needed to go back to sea again, so they can’t go home to see their loved ones.“If I had been the captain I would have let them let their hair down but I wouldn’t have asked anyone, I would have just done it.“I wouldn’t have asked the MoD I would have just said ‘right lads, we’re going to have a few beers’ and just done that.Having returned from a patrol thought to be of some weeks duration, the nuclear-powered boat and her crew were considered \u0027clean\u0027 and are being held in quarantine whilst the routine maintenance is conducted.Having been living in close proximity to each other for weeks at a time, the  understands the issue is less that the crew risked becoming infected with coronavirus, but more that senior Royal Navy commanders thought the decision to allow sailors to party during lockdown was inappropriate given the hardships endured by the British public.A Royal Navy spokesman said: An investigation is underway.

A day after the press conference, Sir Patrick Vallance, the chief scientific adviser, gave a television interview suggesting 60 per cent of people would need to become infected to protect the population. Yet after Imperial College modelling suggested such a mitigation strategy could result in 250,000 deaths, the Government made a rapid volte face, imposing strict social distancing measures and closing businesses and schools on March 23.The impact of such extreme suppression means a second peak, far higher than the first, is now a near certainty – and that has major implications for how Britain must exit the lockdown if such a catastrophe is to be avoided.  Here is what we know about a second wave and how it impacts the future:In the first graphs shown by Mr Johnson in March, squashing the sombrero would cause the first peak to come towards the end of May. The rounded peak appeared to be about half the size of that expected if the disease was left to run rampant through the population.Under that scenario, the NHS would be able to cope and the virus would not present a problem later in the year. Sir Patrick told journalists: We want to… not suppress it so we get the second peak and also allow enough of us who are going to get mild illness to become immune to this to help with the sort of whole population response, which would protect everybody.However, under the current suppression plan, the trajectory of the disease has changed dramatically, with the peak moving to the middle of December. Alarmingly, it appears every bit as high and deadly as the unmitigated wave the Government was so keen to avoid. Although experts believe we have now peaked in the first wave, that is actually only a very low level of what could happen if lockdown is lifted without any means to suppress a second, far more deadly wave. Professor Neil Ferguson, of Imperial College, who led the modelling and sits on the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) said: There is almost no herd immunity and a very large risk of a second peak if we relax current measures without something to put in their place.One of the problems of Britain\u0027s lockdown strategy is just how effective it has been. Suppression modelling was based on all households reducing contact outside the household, school or workplace by up to 75 per cent. Workplace contact rates were to reduce by 25 per cent. On April 13, the Government released its first graphs showing how the public was complying with the lockdown. Workplaces were down 54 per cent, and retail and recreation down 85 per cent.Likewise, people appear to be doing better at self-isolating than was expected. It was assumed that just 70 per cent of people with symptoms of coronavirus would stay at home as instructed, but research by health experts Evergreen Life showed that, in most areas of Britain, more than 90 per cent are complying and even in the worst areas 75 per cent are still staying put.Although the modelling predicted that all schools would shut, it assumed 25 per cent of universities would remain open.Data published by the Department for Education this week showed that less than one per cent of children are going to school every day despite estimates from ministers that the amount would be up to 20 per cent. Likewise, it was thought that 50 per cent of people diagnosed with coronavirus would stay in quarantine for 14 days. Yet there is little evidence of people breaking quarantine, and powers of arrest have now been given to police to stop it from happening.A small study from the Centre for Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine found people had cut contacts by around 73 per cent, roughly in line with Government expectations.While such compliance has been excellent at keeping the virus under control, leading to a noticeable downturn in cases in the past week, it means few people are building up immunity.In the critical Imperial Paper, published on March 16, scientists warned that once restrictions were relaxed infections would inevitably begin to rise again and the bounce-back would be far worse if suppression was too extreme.The more successful a strategy is at temporary suppression, the larger the later epidemic is predicted to be, in the absence of vaccination, due to lesser build-up of herd immunity, the researchers warned.Experts on the Government\u0027s Sage committee now believe that only about five per cent of the population has been infected with the disease and that there is almost no herd immunity in Britain.Under the Government’s mitigation strategy, the reproduction, or R number, would reduce dramatically, but not to below one, so cases would rise, but only slowly, until hitting a peak.Under the suppression strategy, the reproduction rate falls from around 2.6 to below one and the virus dies away. But reducing infections now can store up problems for the future. The Government is carrying out a testing programme to determine how many people in Britain have recovered from the disease and work out current immunity level, but so far it has not published the findings.Several studies have now put it at roughly six per cent, and new results this week from the The Pasteur Institute show just 5.7 per cent of people in France will have contracted coronavirus by the time the country starts lifting lockdown next month.The institute researchers warned of the high risk of a second wave unless drastic social distancing is maintained.Karol Skiora, a private oncologist and Dean of Medicine at the University of Buckingham, has been carrying out his own antibody testing and believes that between eight to 10 per cent of people are likely to have had coronavirus so far. We\u0027re nowhere near herd immunity, he said. We could definitely have a second peak. It is a real worry.Imperial College predicted that strict lockdown measures would be needed for at least five months, but also warned that restrictions and widespread monitoring would have to stay in place until a vaccine was available in order to prevent a second wave. Dozens of research labs across the globe are working on vaccines and a team at Oxford believe they could have a viable jab ready by the autumn. Yet scaling up will present a problem and it is likely that only frontline workers will be given vaccines initially, leaving the general public waiting until at least next year. That delay means restrictions such as social distancing will be in place for many months to come. Sir Jeremy Farrar, a member of the Sage group and the director of the Wellcome Trust, said the virus would not be going away any time soon and future waves were likely.We must assume and prepare for the fact that this is not a discrete one-off episode, he said. My belief is that this is now an endemic human infection. It is likely that this is here with the human race for the future. We\u0027re going to have to find ways to deal with that.The real moving forward is we have to have new tests, we have to have drugs that treat this infection, and critically we need to have vaccines so we can prevent what we should assume are future waves.In recent weeks, journalists have questioned why the Government is continuing to invest in huge numbers of intensive care beds at Nightingale hospitals while cases are on the decline.The possibility of a second peak is likely to be the reason.While the current epidemic appears to have stabilised below 1,000 cases a day, modelling of a second wave suggests that it could be far higher if it is not brought under control through mass testing, contact tracing and isolation after lockdown.Asked whether the Nightingale hospitals were being kept for a possible second wave, a Downing Street spokesman said: I am certainly not aware of any plans to stand down these Nightingale hospitals, and some are still being built.Fears of a second coronavirus wave have made governments around the world nervous about lifting their lockdowns too early and too quickly, and Britain is no exception.A safety net of widespread testing, contact tracing and isolation of those infected must be in place to ensure cases are not allowed to rise, while squashing the sombrero of a second peak may now be a viable option.Ilan Kelman, professor of disasters and health at University College London said: A second peak of infection could be manageable if we protect those who are vulnerable, treat those who get sick, do not reduce other medical services and meet all healthcare worker needs. Another possible strategy is a staged stand-down of lockdown to flatten a second peak, provided that those who are told to remain in lockdown, or who cannot work because of it, are given all the support they need to avoid difficult effects of being isolated while others resume life.In China, a spike in infections after weeks of falling rates has forced the authorities to impose new restrictions.In the north-eastern city of Harbin, a 22-year-old university student who returned from the US was identified as the source of more than 40 new infections, while Chinese citizens returning from Siberia via the border town of Suifenhe led to more than 400 confirmed new cases.The examples show the huge problem in restarting life again after a strict lockdown when so few of the population are immune. In Germany, credited with keeping its outbreak under tight control through its use of extensive testing and contact tracing, there has been a rise in deaths as the country was re-opening some small shops and preparing for children to return to school from May 4.The director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned on Tuesday that any second wave of coronavirus was likely to be even more serious if it coincided with the start of flu season.Robert Redfield told The Washington Post: There\u0027s a possibility that the assault of the virus on our nation next winter will actually be even more difficult than the one we just went through.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"ultra orthodox jewish wedding shut met emerges father bride","story":"Police shut down an ultra-Orthodox Jewish wedding after officers were called twice to celebrations flouting the lockdown ban.politan Police officers warned the families they were breaking government Covid-19 guidelines after neighbours saw the ceremony being set up in Golders Green, London, at 5.30pm on April 22.But the wedding went ahead and police were called again at 9pm after a large group were seen gathering outside the property.

On Thursday, the Health Secretary, Matt Hancock, announced the beginning of Britain\u0027s strategy to test, track and trace, which he said could enable heavier social distancing measures to be eased.The  has spoken to experts in each field to ask how other countries are working their way out of lockdown and analyse how each strategy could work for the UK. On Monday, Government officials in Chile announced that they would issue the world\u0027s first immunity passports, with comprehensive plans expected to be detailed next week. Physical or digital cards will be given to those who have tested positive for coronavirus but have recovered and are likely to have built up antibodies. Those eligible will be free to return to both work and wider society. Dr Rifat Atun, professor of Global Health Systems at Harvard University, has advised Chile on health policy for more than 25 years and said antibody tests can help governments assess the prevalence of the infections, particularly in asymptomatic people. But he added that the tests still cannot tell us whether a person has developed immunity, how long they are immune for or the extent of the immunity – just that they have had the virus and recovered. The only way of knowing if such herd immunity has built up is by mass testing, while reducing restrictions in one area to see if people continue to get infected. You can check the infection levels to see if mixing leads to higher levels of infections, Dr Atun said. If you have a large number of people that are infected and we\u0027re not getting new infections, that suggests that there should be some kind of immunity because the virus is not being transmitted, so transmission between person to person is interrupted. In Westminster, herd immunity has become a dirty term. The attempt to achieve it involved allowing enough of us who are going to get mild illness to become immune, Sir Patrick Vallance, the chief scientific adviser, explained on March 13.But after data from Imperial College London showed how badly hospitals would be overwhelmed, the UK reversed course – and it seems there is no going back.Professor Neil Ferguson, of Imperial College, who sits on the Government\u0027s Sage advisory committee, said it was likely that only five percent of the UK population had been infected with the virus. There is almost no herd immunity and a very large risk of a second peak if we relax current measures without something to put in their place, he said.Even the most hawkish of backbenchers understands that herd immunity is over as a concept. One Conservative MP said: Even if privately many backbenchers wish we had pursued a policy similar to Sweden, it is understood that it is no longer possible.There are also fears among some advisers that it could blur the rules of the lockdown and encourage others to take the restrictions less seriously.Strict social distancing measures initially proved successful in China, which is at a more advanced stage of the pandemic. During the country\u0027s peak, in early February, there were between 2,000 and 4,000 new confirmed coronavirus cases per day. But leading up to March 23, it had no new confirmed cases caused by local transmission for five consecutive days. One report, by the the MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis and the Abdul Latif Jameel Institute for Disease and Emergency Analytics at Imperial College London, concluded that social distancing measures in China have led to control of Covid-19. Professor Christl Donnelly, Associate Director of the MRC Centre, said: At this difficult time, these results suggest that, after containment, a carefully managed and monitored relaxation of effective large-scale lockdowns may be possible even before an effective vaccine is available.There is now debate at the top of the Government over how hard and fast the UK\u0027s lockdown measures should be eased. Cabinet hawks fear the devastation of the economy and are calling for an easing, while doves, including Boris Johnson and Mr Hancock, do not want to risk a second peak.One insider told The : There\u0027s growing concern on the Tory backbenches about a lack of action, but the fear extends to the Cabinet too. Boris and Hancock have put the issue on the back burner. Ultimately a decision has to be taken, and it has to be done in a way that makes it look like the Government is in control rather than being chased by the opposition.While there is an ongoing argument over how to ease measures, it is inevitable that some kind of social distancing will be with us for some time. One Whitehall source said: Until there is a vaccine or an effective drug, people will be asked to maintain a level of social distancing. Britons could have to get used to a very different way of life. Measures aren\u0027t going to be lifted overnight – they will be phased.The chief medical officer, Professor Chris Whitty, this week told the country to brace itself for another year of disruptive measures. He said ministers would have to devise the optimal combination of social distancing to control the virus until a vaccine became available.This could mean workplaces are adapted to ensure colleagues keep a two-metre distance, but one source said: The real hope is that many people will continue to work from home – having that flexibility will be key.”One of the biggest challenges is thought to be maintaining social distancing on public transport, and a Whitehall source said: There is thought going into how to spread the rush hour, and businesses will be required to be more flexible when setting working patterns to try and keep people travelling at different times.Grant Shapps, the Transport Secretary, has said businesses should be asking themselves why everybody has to travel in the rush hour.Sport and cultural activities could also look very different and there is also consideration as to whether theatres could open if every other seat is left empty, it is understood.Schools have long been thought of as one of the first institutions that could reopen as part of any easing. However, Geoff Barton, the general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL), suggested June 1 is the earliest date on which they are likely to be able to do so.When schools are re-opened, a leading Government adviser has said they must do better at promoting good hygiene. Susan Michie, a professor of health psychology at University College London, said: School toilets can be pretty dismal places – that is an area that needs improvement.This strategy has been used in countries in the Far East including Singapore and, more successfully, Hong Kong. It involves trained contact tracing teams piecing together a Covid-19 patient\u0027s movements and potential contacts during the time that the person is infectious. Close contacts are then investigated and quarantined where necessary. Professor Li Yang, who heads the infectious diseases programme at the National University of Singapore\u0027s Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, said: When exiting lockdown, once people are able to move around more freely this becomes even more important as a way of quickly containing potential clusters of Covid-19.Prof Li warned that the method takes manpower and is time-intensive, saying: Singapore\u0027s Ministry of Health had to rapidly expand its contact tracing team and tap on support from the police and military as the number of cases surged. Therefore, it is ideal to combine human contact tracing with other technological applications in order to reduce the manpower and time required. In an updated paper seen by The  and initially published in the BMJ, experts estimate that, in order for the UK to replicate the Far East\u0027s success, it would need between 150,000 and 550,000 total volunteers. The co-authors of the paper, Dr Cam Bowie, retired director of public health, Somerset, and professor of community health, Malawi, and Dr Tony Hill, independent public health consultant and health strategist and retired director of public health, Lincolnshire, said: At the end of the day, control will only be achieved by case identification, isolation and contact tracing, and that can only be done at the local level.It is not complicated – it can be re-commenced immediately without disruption to other efforts. It does not need demonstration sites. It is working in the Far East with Covid-19 right now. The report says that, in order for contact tracing to be efficient, it needs to managed by local authorities, with an average of 2.8 full time local staff and trained volunteers to cope with each new case. Each new case will require 58 hours of time to trace 90 contacts and test 6.3 symptomatic contacts, a third of whom will have Covid-19. Between 800 and 3,000 volunteers will be needed two weeks after peak deaths in the averaged sized local authority, according to the report, which says training using local authority resources would take a single day. The system of contact tracing should, they said, be up and running in five working days, and local authorities would be able to relax physical distancing measures to get schools reopened two weeks after peak deaths. Mr Hancock announced on Thursday that he would be hiring 18,000 people to start testing and tracing for the virus in the community, including public health specialists and 3,000 clinicians. He gave no date for when the process would begin, but said the Government would be training up contact tracers over coming weeks.However, Dr Bowie called the numbers paltry and said getting the volunteers is not a problem, adding: The key point is that the numbers required and the methods used means this cannot be done centrally or regionally but only at local authority level.  The number Public Health England think they need suggests they need to remember that we have not one homogenous epidemic but a myriad of small ones, dotting up in different places at different times, requiring different ways of curtailment. You simply cannot do that from London. It is understood that council staff and civil servants are among those who will be drafted in. However, on Thursday the Local Government Authority (LGA) cast doubt on the plans by insisting that central Government should foot the bill as councils are already struggling with staff shortages because of coronavirus.Cllr Ian Hudspeth, the chairman of the LGA\u0027s community wellbeing board, said the extra demand on existing services would need to be met by additional resources and funding.There has been some disquiet among Conservative backbenchers that the Government ever stopped contact tracing. A senior MP said: A lot of people thought abandoning contact tracing was a bad idea. While some regions were difficult to keep on top of, other areas have seen relatively low levels. Testing could have easily been focused in those areas.The Prime Minister\u0027s official spokesman said: We\u0027ll make sure that we have whatever number of staff it is that we need.While 18,000 people are being recruited initially, the spokesman said that capacity will be quickly scaled up if that’s needed. He was unable to give a start date on when the contact tracing scheme will begin, but said work is progressing well.Digital contact tracing is one of the few ways in which the authorities can keep pace with rapid real-time spread of coronavirus. The model the UK is looking to adopt sees people download an app that logs other mobile phones that come into close contact with it via Bluetooth connections. When a user comes down with coronavirus, an alert can be sent to all the people they had contact with, telling them to self-isolate. This system could get people self-isolating before they even show symptoms – a period when they are still infectious and most likely to unwittingly spread the virus.Digital contract tracing needs a large proportion of a population to take part for it to be effective. Even then, it is still just one element of a successful virus containment strategy and needs to be deployed alongside mass testing to be successful. Without millions of people using the app properly, alongside a mass testing regime, digital contract tracing is unlikely to halt the virus.South Korea and Singapore have both used data from the mobile phones of people diagnosed with Covid-19 to trace the people with whom they have come into contact.The authorities in South Korea have successfully used GPS data to help human contact tracing teams, and on Wednesday reported only eight new confirmed coronavirus cases. Singapore has used apps that track other phones that come into close range via Bluetooth connections. The shortcomings of the system can be seen in Singapore which, despite early successes in containing the virus, now has a rising rate of infection, with total cases topping 8,000 this week. This has partly been attributed to the spread in crowded government-built dormitories for migrant workers, where social distancing is difficult to maintain. Professor Li warned that digital tracing is not effective without mass take-up and if social distancing is not adhered to. He said: Generally, the majority of the population will need to have installed such apps before they become truly useful.A study by Oxford University last week found that if 56 percent of the population were to use a contact tracing app, it would effectively stop the spread of the virus before a vaccine or cure is found. To achieve this in practice, the NHS will have to get its app working efficiently and downloaded by around 30 million people by the time the lockdown eases.A coronavirus vaccine has been long-hailed as the weapon that will defeat Covid-19 and unlock society, and this week the UK joined the US – which currently has two studies – and China, in beginning human trials for a vaccine. Yet Mr Johnson and his Cabinet are only too aware that a preventative jab is unlikely to be forthcoming in this calendar year and, acting on evidence provided by its scientific advisers, the Government now appears to have set sail for a lengthy lockdown.There is a real fear at the top about a second peak, one Whitehall insider said. Sage are warning that there will need to be fairly strict lockdown measures until a vaccine is found. Unfortunately, this may take some time.Mr Hancock this week confirmed that two leading vaccine developments – Oxford University and Imperial College London – would receive a total of £42.5 million to support their clinical trials, saying that the UK is at the forefront of the global effort.Professor Robin Shattock, the head of mucosal infection and immunity at Imperial College London, who is leading its team in developing a vaccine, said: The timelines for rolling out a vaccine for the whole of the UK are too long to stay on total lockdown, but early availability of vaccines that have demonstrable efficacy and safety pre-gaining a marketing license could be used to protect key groups – health care workers, care home staff, providing part of the strategy to relaxing the lockdown. He agreed that, considering the time it would take to develop a vaccine and make it widely available, any nationwide campaign is unlikely to take place before the end of the year. Dr Sheuli Porkess, the director of research, medical and innovation at the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry, said: Vaccination has saved more lives and prevented more serious diseases than any advance in recent medical history. Any vaccine for Covid-19 must be thoroughly tested to make sure it\u0027s safe and effective, and that is what companies and organisations around the world are working on now.Professor Adam Finn, professor of paediatrics at the University of Bristol, said: Epidemics are controlled by generating sufficient population immunity that transmission drops away. Vaccines are the only tool we have to do this aside from just letting everyone get the disease or stopping normal life. Earlier this week, ministers refused to confirm whether UK taxpayers would be first in the queue to receive a successful vaccine. However, it is understood that, if the Oxford or Imperial trials prove successful, Britons will have priority.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/global-health/2020/03/10/TELEMMGLPICT000227447964_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqHFpKXeXCxMIMJz8yhX7SwjhqJjatWbAoPNpik4CultM.jpeg?im","title":"west must ensure china pays role spread covid 19","story":"The dominance of Xi Jinping\u0026#39s China cannot go unchallenged by the WestChina, we all know, is run by an autocratic, dictatorial regime which brooks no dissent and is highly secretive about the problems and challenges the country faces. That has been the case for very many years. However, although its behaviour does seem to be getting worse, logic would nevertheless still dictate that when faced with the outbreak of a novel disease the Chinese government would work hard to contain it. That was certainly the case in 2002, when China responded to Sars by working with the World Health Organisation to bring the disease under control. So why, when Covid-19 was discovered, did China instead respond with what many believe to be cynical lies and denials? The Chinese authorities were alerted to the threat the outbreak posed when human-to-human transmission was confirmed in early December, just as they were about to sign a trade deal with the USA ending the damaging standoff between the two countries. Was the reason that the government closed down any mention of the outbreak through December and January to protect this deal? Phase 1 of the deal was set to lift tariffs on about $200 billion of Chinese exports. However, if the deal hadn’t been agreed on December 15 then the US intended to impose wider sanctions on Chinese exports. As it happened, the deal was agreed on December 15 2019 and then signed exactly a month later on January 15. This was a critical period. Any indication in this time that China had a serious health crisis which may have pointed the finger at their biological labs andor their appalling wet markets could have led to wider sanctions being applied.During this vital period, the Chinese authorities systematically suppressed whistle blowers. Dr Li Wenliang, who first publicly raised the outbreak, was silenced and later died, but he was not alone. He had been reporting observations made by Dr Ai Fen earlier in December 2019 and there were others who observed the human-to-human nature of transmission, a vital fact denied by the Chinese authorities at the time. According to The Lancet medical journal there were at least six known human-to-human cases before December 15 and strong indications this had happened in November. Yet it wasn’t until December 31 that it was first reported to the WHO.All the while, China’s President, Xi Jinping, publicly maintained that everything was under control and only on January 28 did he meet Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the director-general of the WHO. This meeting led to a public health statement of “an emergency of international concern”. Yet at the same time, inexplicably, Dr Tedros applauded the Chinese authorities, saying, “We appreciate the seriousness with which China is taking this outbreak … and the transparency they have demonstrated.”It looks as though the Chinese state placed achieving a trade deal with the US ahead of ensuring the proper systems were in place to manage the outbreak. Yet this is, it seems, a normal pattern of behaviour from a state growing in economic and military power. Just look at the strategic way that China set out to dominate areas of the world which have important raw materials. At present, China owns nearly 20 per cent of Africa’s debt with a combined loan total of $152 billion to 49 African governments. This is one tactic among many that has secured China’s control of around 85 per cent of the world’s supply of rare earth metals, which go into the production of all electronics. Whether it is ripping off technology from Western countries, driving other businesses out of the marketplace by aggressive and state-backed bidding or even economically colonising countries in Africa, China believes, rightly as it turns out, that the West has become too weak for it to fear. Nothing demonstrates Chinese arrogance or disregard of us better than its handling of coronavirus.The problem is that the West has blithely assumed that access to our free markets would lead China to democracy and increased freedoms. Yet instead of free trade causing the country to open up, as its dominance of the world marketplace has expanded, China has instead tightened up with greater central control and more abuses of human rights. Pathetically, after years of Project Kow Tow, we rarely if ever confront it about its behaviour. It is vital that we change all that and break our dependence on this terrible regime. The Government now needs to set up a commission with experts and senior politicians to examine how we can change and rebalance our relationship with China as we emerge from this crisis. There will be a need for financial reparations for the damage it has inflicted. We also need to ensure that China doesn’t exploit its economic power to avoid taking responsibility for this appalling pandemic. Working with other allies, we have to ensure that we never allow such an autocratic regime, one that abuses human rights and ignores the rules-based international order, to become so dominant again. Sir Iain Duncan Smith is a former leader of the Conservative PartyOxford University ‘replacing private school pupils with rich overseas students’Coronavirus could kill cash in \u0026#39months not years\u0026#39, expert warnsWinter flu sufferers who think they have had Covid-19 warned against false sense of security Comment: Let’s not come out of lockdown the way we went inAnna Wintour is \u0026#39ruthless\u0026#39 and incapable of \u0026#39human kindness\u0026#39, claims ex-Vogue editor Andre TalleyRecord breaking month for migrant Channel crossings, as more than 500 arrive since coronavirus lockdownGovernment website runs out of coronavirus home testing kits within two minutesGrant Shapps suggests airport screening will be adopted in the UKTroops to be issued new insect repellant in fight against coronavirusHospitals being offered PPE at 825 per cent markup with market labelled the \u0026#39Wild West\u0026#39 NHS contact tracing app will assess whether people have coronavirus without a testThe way out of lockdown: the strategies evaluatedComment: Kramer v Kramer?

It’s because he “tends to avoid shows about royalty”, by the way. Fry, who has more of a knack for comedy,\u0026nbspwas portraying his Blackadder character Lord Melchett – the personal advisor to Queen Elizabeth I.Little Britain’s TV return stuns viewers with shock ‘bat-eating’ jokePeter Kay has appeared on TV for the first time in two yearsPrince William jokes he hasn’t seen Tiger King during Big Night InSteve Coogan and Rob Brydon served up a lockdown special of The TripThis was one of the highlights of the night, and it felt pretty effortless. The pair just chatted away, whining about being roped into another Comic Relief gig: It would be a relief if Richard Curtis stopped calling. And instead of opting for the obligatory bookshelf backdrops we so often see on Zoom, Brydon’s shelves were stacked with family photographs. Coogan\u0027s were filled with his awards, of course.Peter Kay and Dawn French reminded us of the power of nostalgia In an evening that still felt melancholy despite the large amount of laughs, two particular moments of comedy served as healthy respites: Peter Kay, himself a veritable man of mystery nowadays, expressing gratitude for the response to his 2005 charity rendition of Tony Christie’s “Amarillo”. Seeing such mid-Noughties joy all over again was so heartwarming that you managed to forget most of those involved in it are now dead. French’s Vicar of Dibley return was similarly moving. In the same vein, such a warm hug of a throwback almost managed to block out the fact that half the show’s cast is dead now, too.Matt Lucas and David Walliams deserve kudos for their improvised reunion (the toilet paper holders for wigs was a great shout) – but yeesh was this a reminder of how terribly Little Britain has aged. The wacky accents, racist innuendos and class stereotypes were guiltily funny back in the show’s heyday, when we were all a little bit more ignorant, but it felt beamed from an entirely different universe in 2020.Even the most talented of pop stars can’t survive an echo-y living roomWhile it’s slightly mean to criticise the litany of pop stars participating in a good cause, few of the night’s live singers could escape the horror of an echo-y living room. Everyone from Nicole Scherzinger to Jess Glynne and Celeste to Sam Smith struggled valiantly to combat the limitations of their improvised surroundings, to miserable returns. For anyone hoping that house-bound concerts could replace the real thing, either during or after this pandemic, The Big Night In reminded us all that they can’t.The live blog is now closed.Find out everything you need to know about The Big Night In here, including how to donate to the fundraiser to support vulnerable people of all ages and backgrounds across the UK who will be significantly impacted by the crisis.Children in Need\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspOne World: Together at Home\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

All three companies say that they have used the period of closure to assess how to properly implement social distancing guidelines, but how will they ensure they keep staff and customers safe?Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesDIY retailer B\u0026ampQ is reopening 61 of its 155 of its stores after closing them when the government announced the lockdown last month. The company is allowed to open as it’s designated as an essential business.Services like paint mixing, timber cutting and key cutting have been suspended. Customers will not be able to pay with cash and are advised to use contactless card payments where possible.Created with Sketch.How coronavirus lockdowns changed the world\u0027s most polluted cities Show all 6Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Checkouts have been fitted with Perspex screens and 2m markers placed on the floor.A spokesperson said: “Similar to shopping at a supermarket, we’re strictly limiting the number of customers in store at any one time, and so customers are typically queueing before entering stores.“All stores have a designated queueing area outside and these have two metre markers to help remind everyone to respect each other’s personal space.Aston Martin Lagonda announced that it will resume operations at its St Athan facility, in Wales, on 5 May as it starts to gradually bring back the 75 per cent of its workforce currently furloughed.The luxury car maker says it is following guidelines from Public Health Wales and Public Health England to protect its workforce and will take “learnings in terms of health and safety” into account when it reopens its main car plant in Gaydon, Warwickshire, at a later date.Both sites have been closed since 25 March\u0026nbspdue to the coronavirus pandemic.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The firm should work with the customer to resolve these difficulties in advance of payments being missed, the FCA said.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But the company has now paused the availability of that and some other categories as it deals with false stories around the pandemic.Other topics including conspiracy theory appear to have disappeared from the list, and a Facebook spokesperson confirmed to Reuters that other categories were being hidden as it evaluates the different audience categories.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe removal came after a report that demonstrated it was possible to pick people interested in pseudoscience for targeting with particular posts, presumably allowing them to be targeted with false or misleading information.Such people would not necessarily know they were thought to be interested in such a topic, and would not have given any explicit indication that they were. Instead, the tag was probably added by automated systems based on the kinds of content they engage with.The Markup demonstrated that Facebook was allowing such ads after saying it would police COVID-19 misinformation on its platform. More than 78 million Facebook users were interested in pseudoscience, it said, citing Facebook\u0027s ad portal.Misinformation about the pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus, from bogus cures to wide-ranging conspiracy theories, has also spread on rival social media platforms such Twitter Inc and YouTube, the video service of Alphabet Inc\u0027s Google.Advocacy group Avaaz reported last week that a sample of 104 coronavirus-related pieces of misinformation content on Facebook analyzed by the group had reached over 117 million estimated views.Data gathered by ProPublica in 2016 shows that Facebook assigned pseudoscience to users at that time, suggesting the category has been available for several years.The Facebook spokeswoman said in her email that the pseudoscience category should have been removed in a previous review.Created with Sketch.Gadget and tech news: In pictures Show all 25Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.125 Gun-toting humanoid robot sent into spaceRussia has launched a humanoid robot into space on a rocket bound for the International Space Station (ISS).

Please come back tomorrow … We are currently expanding our allocation of home test kits on a daily basis.”The prime minister’s official spokesman later said 5,000 home testing kits were ordered online on Friday morning in the first two minutes – the total amount available for the day.Another 15,000 appointments for tests at regional drive-through centres were booked before the portal closed, said the No 10 spokesman.He said: “The reason the website stopped taking bookings was because all the available slots had gone. It will be back up and running when the next batch of slots are available for each given day.”Mr Hancock said earlier on Friday morning that the scheme would start in “small numbers”, but he was “carefully” watching to ensure the website could handle the expected online traffic.The cabinet minister also said the home test kits would be collected by a courier and taken to a lab to prevent people having to travel long distances, with results available within 24 hours in most cases.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

One participant was given a dose of the vaccine, while the other was given a meningitis vaccine for comparison.Speaking to BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, Prof Gilbert said the team was looking to recruit hospital workers “who will be at greater risk of infection” in order to increase the chances of gauging the vaccine’s efficacy.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesShe said they were “not convinced” that Covid-19 is still prevalent enough in the UK for the trial to produce results as quickly as they would like.“We’ve been accelerating the trial as much as we possibly can and we’re looking to, for the next phase of the trial, specifically recruit people who work in hospitals who will be at greater risk of infection, because while there are still cases in hospital, that’s where the virus is,” she said.Tracking the coronavirus outbreak around the world in maps and chartsWhen can we really expect coronavirus to end?Everything you need to know on supermarket delivery slotsThe dirty truth about washing your handsListen to the latest episode of The Independent Coronavirus Podcast“We’re going to try and increase our chances of getting the vaccine efficacy result by doing that. But we accept that we may not be able to do that in this country, so we’re also making plans to set up trials in other countries where the transmission of the virus has been a bit slower to get going because we may need to go and test the vaccine somewhere else.”Researchers need to test the actual vaccine against a placebo in large enough groups of people in order to determine its effectiveness. They are testing for three things: the vaccine’s safety, its ability to induce immune responses, and its efficacy in stopping people from contracting the coronavirus.According to Prof Gilbert, the team are aiming to have at least 5,000 people take part in the trials.However, the fall in the rate of infections could delay the production of the vaccine. The Oxford team had hopes of at least a million doses of its candidate being ready in September.“It could still happen over the summer and maybe we will get a signal of efficacy, a trend towards efficacy, a hint that it’s working here, and then be able to add to that by doing trials in other countries.” No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

At this moment we don’t have a treatment for coronavirus so we would have to do this extremely carefully.”On Thursday, Prof Gilbert said she was “very optimistic” that the vaccine developed by her team will be successful, but she added that there was “absolutely no suggestion” the vaccine would become available to the general population before its efficacy was determined.The Oxford Vaccine Group hopes to repeat the testing process with six more volunteers on Saturday, and will move to larger numbers on Monday.University of Oxford\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

When they do, then the speed in\u0026nbspwhich the number of new cases reduces will frankly determine how long we need to keep the measures on,”\u0026nbspMr Hancock told Radio 4’s Today programme.He said it was not quite the case that mass testing and contact tracing needed to be in place before the current restrictions are eased, but said contact tracing worked better when the number of infections was\u0026nbsppushed right down.“The truth is that we need to get the number of new cases down, right down, and the lower you go, the more effective contact tracing is because the more resources you can put into each inidual case that gets a positive test.“You can really make sure you can get hold of all of their contacts and get them, in many cases, to self-isolate.“The smaller the number of new cases, the more effective the test, track and trace system will be.”Social distancing was driving down the numbers, Mr Hancock said, adding that the contact tracing operation would be functioning in a “matter of weeks”.\u0026nbspHe said mass testing, contact tracing and a new contact tracing app “are so crucial to holding down the rate and level of transmission of the disease”.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

But a new study suggests that such visitors might have been alongside us all along.The researchers suggest that the objects came from other stars, billions of years ago, and have been orbiting around our Sun undiscovered ever since.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe objects were first pulled out of another\u0026nbspsolar system in the relatively early days of the universe, when the stars were closer together and so upset each other\u0027s gravity more easily.\u0026nbspThis enabled asteroids to be pulled from one star system to another, said Fathi Namouni, lead author of the study, in a statement.Just as with those other visitors, researchers hope they can use the objects to understand the differences between objects that have spent all of their time in our solar system and\u0026nbspthose alien visitors.“The discovery of a whole population of asteroids of interstellar origin is an important step in understanding the physical and chemical similarities and differences between solar system-born and interstellar asteroids,” commented Dr.\u0026nbspMorais.The researchers came upon the discovery after running computer simulations that allowed them to look at how the solar system may have looked in its earliest days. When they looked the asteroids in question, they found they were orbiting the Sun in a distant region beyond the disc of gas and dust that would form the rest of the asteroids, and along a different orbit to the other planets and asteroids.That strange placement led the researchers to speculate that the asteroids were not native at all but had actually been plucked out of interstellar space as the planets were forming.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s groundbreaking decade of space exploration: In pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Mystic Mountain, a pillar of gas and dust standing at three-light-years tall, bursting with jets of gas flom fledgling stars buried within, was captured by Nasa\u0027s Hubble Space Telelscope in February 2010The first ever selfie taken on an alien planet, captured by Nasa\u0027s Curiosity Rover in the early days of its mission to explore Mars in 2012Death of a star: This image from Nasa\u0027s Chandra X-ray telescope shows the supernova of Tycho, a star in our Milky Way galaxyArrokoth, the most distant object ever explored, pictured here on 1 January 2019 by a camera on Nasa\u0027s New Horizons spaceraft at a distance of 4.1 billion miles from EarthAn image of the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy seen in infrared light by the Herschel Space Observatory in January 2012.

The firm should work with the customer to resolve these difficulties in advance of payments being missed, the FCA said.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It is a charity that has adapted with incredible speed to the crisis to help the most vulnerable in our community. In just five weeks, they have responded to the increased demand for food by quadrupling their output. We hope that our donation, coupled with the campaigning power of The Independent, will help the project grow and reach as many as possible of the one in five Londoners at risk of food poverty.”Another substantial contribution came in yesterday from the Julia and Hans Rausing Trust, which has assigned £16.5m\u0026nbspto charities at the forefront of the coronavirus pandemic and has donated £50,000 to our appeal.How to support our campaignJulia and Hans Rausing,\u0026nbspheirs of food packing giant Tetra Pak, said: “We have been impressed not only by the speed of The Felix Project’s response to the crisis, but the way in which they have managed to get a number of organisations working together to help people across the capital. Efforts like this support communities across London at this time of need, and we are glad to support their inspiring work.”We launched our appeal, in association with the Evening Standard, on Friday 27 March\u0026nbspand have reached £3m\u0026nbspthanks to the generous backing of dozens of London foundations, philanthropists and corporations, including Garfield Weston Foundation, Lansdowne Partners, the Westminster Foundation, Sir Peter Blake, Burberry, Eranda Rothschild Foundation, Citibank and investment holding company Temasek.More than 1,170 members of the public have contributed, donating £103,837 on our Virgin Money Giving page.But there is a sense that we are still in the foothills of the economic crisis, with experts warning the government that food poverty is about to get far worse. The Food Foundation has reported that eight million people in Britain face food insecurity and that three million have been missing meals since lockdown. The Institute for Social and Economic Research at University of Essex estimates that 6.5 million jobs could be lost in the coming months, causing a huge rise in demand for free food.As the biggest supplier of free food in London, The Felix Project has been operating 12 hours a day, six days a week, distributing surplus food to giant community hubs, including Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in Haringey, as well as to 80 charities and schools across the capital.The Independent\u0026nbspis encouraging readers to help groups that are trying to feed the hungry across the country – find out how you can help\u0026nbsphere.

But they have had to manage this with a small staff of 22 and a 30-fold reduction in volunteers – from 3,500 to just 115 – as many of their volunteers are over 70 and can no longer work due to Covid-19 restrictions.These super volunteers are the backbone for London’s fourth emergency service –\u0026nbspfood provision to the capital’s hungry –\u0026nbspand Felix could not function without them. Today we meet six of them and ask why they joined and what volunteering means to them.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHow to support our campaign“Going back 10 years, we were instructed by our bosses at Sainsbury’s to destroy all surplus food, but then the likes of Felix came along and suddenly there was no excuse for waste. I was so impressed by Felix’s operation that I promised to volunteer when I retired. Since coronavirus, I do a 65-hour week. I start at their Park Royal depot, drive to Hello Fresh in Banbury and to Mindful Chef near Birmingham, returning with a two-ton\u0026nbsppayload. Later I deliver to community hubs, charities and schools that have set up food drop centres.“Recently I supplied a school in Ealing and as I arrived one boy said to his friend, “now we’ve got something to eat tonight”, and I thought, bloody hell. To think some parents have to choose between paying rent and feeding their children and that Felix is the only reason they can do both — it brings a lump to your throat.”Retired facilities manager for City officesRuns a fundraising\u0026nbspconsultancy for charities“I came across Felix when it launched in 2016 and was hired to help them raise funds. I promised myself that one day I would go back and volunteer –\u0026nbspand that’s what I did last November. It was amazing to see how Felix had grown into a major lifeline for thousands of Londoners. I thought, incredible growth, incredible impact –\u0026nbspit really does walk the talk. In my job, I see the distress inequality causes, but when I go out in a Felix van, I feel I am doing something good for the community. It might sound schmaltzy but, for me, it’s my war effort.”Economics graduate, works for Cisco Systems“I started volunteering for Felix in January and the thing that struck me when I first walked into their Park Royal warehouse was the unbelievable quantity of food that would otherwise go to waste. It is such a bustling place and since coronavirus, it’s even busier because major suppliers like Hello Fresh and Sainsbury’s have even more surplus food. It’s a boost for my morale to help during lockdown and satisfying to see the smiles on people’s faces as you arrive in the green Felix van.”Tracking the coronavirus outbreak around the world in maps and chartsWhen can we really expect coronavirus to end?Everything you need to know on supermarket delivery slotsThe dirty truth about washing your handsListen to the latest episode of The Independent Coronavirus PodcastLawyer and non-executive director of Investec Wealth“I joined Felix last year because my friend Gary had been there 18 months and loves it, so I went out in the van and got hooked. I started doing one day a week but since coronavirus, I have been doing two full days as a co-driver. It’s hard physical work but it never fails to put a smile on my face. Since lockdown, my partner Rob drives me and today we were on the road for four hours delivering 16 crates of food to six charities and each time we were made to feel like Father Christmas.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

A number of our churches across the capital, particularly those that host and run food banks and homeless shelters, have successfully partnered with Felix in the past. Never has there been a greater need for us all to come together to support the vulnerable in our local communities.”Imam Mahmoud, who ran a half marathon to support Felix in 2017, said: “I applaud the good work that The Independent and The Felix Project are doing to feed and support the elderly and most vulnerable members of our community during this time of crisis. In difficult times, it is important that we all come together regardless of background and support each other as a community and as a nation, the best we can.”With the start of Ramadan today, Imam Mahmoud added that he was particularly “moved by the good spirit” that people have shown towards others of late. “This project is close to my heart because I’ve seen first-hand the benefit that it has bought to the community. I urge everyone to continue to support Food for London Now and other projects like it.”Rabbi Mirvis called for a sense of community at a time when many feel isolated. He said: “The great Jewish sages taught that ‘anyone who saves a single life is considered to have saved the whole world’. In these extraordinary times, it is not only the heroes of the NHS who are called upon to fulfil this noblest aspiration. The efforts of The Independent and The Felix Project, together with their partners, make it possible for us all to play our part in saving the lives of the most vulnerable among us.“Today, as many thousands of people face the agonising uncertainty of not knowing where their next meal is coming from, we must reach out to them with compassion and reassurance. I urge everyone who is able to support the appeal.”How to support our campaignThe Independent\u0027s appeal, in association with our sister newspaper The Evening Standard, was set up to fund The Felix Project, London’s biggest surplus food distributor, to provide for the delivery of food to the poor and elderly who are unable to afford supplies, or are stuck at home at risk of losing their lives. Felix currently delivers the equivalent of 100,000 meals a day to giant community hubs run by local authorities as well as charities and schools across the capital.The Independent\u0026nbspis encouraging readers to help groups that are trying to feed the hungry across the country – find out how you can help\u0026nbsphere.

Northern Powerhouse Rail have asked government for £25m to get on with working up the outline scheme that they want to do,” Sir John told the Commons Transport Select Committee.“Those are the sort of things that the government can do to get things moving because in the first place it’s not about digging holes, it’s actually about doing lots of environmental work assessments, design, consultation, land acquisition. There’s several years of work that will take place on Northern Powerhouse Rail before you can start digging holes.”The scheme is backed by northern cities and will share some infrastructure with the north-south high-speed railway HS2, the construction of which was green-lit by the government last week.Sir John said the best way for the government to ensure there was capacity to build multiple schemes all at once was to “give more certainty to its long-term plans and long-term strategy” so that contractors would feel able to invest long-term in their capabilities.The chair of the Commission – which is conducting a review into phase two of HS2, connecting Birmingham to Manchester and Leeds – said the construction of new lines was a good idea.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It’s called High Speed Two, but frankly it’s more capacity to the north. Rail will continue to grow the demand is there.”He warned critics of the project that it was difficult to accurately draw up an economic business case for it because that would involve making predictions.“We’re talking about a project that is going to be beneficial to the country for the next 75 years at least, and forecasting how those long-term socioeconomic benefits will play out is difficult enough for anyone. I think occasionally you need to say, ‘This looks a sensible thing to do, so let’s go ahead,’” he said.Created with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The cruise ship Ruby Princess departs from Port Kembla, south of Sydney, , after a few hundred virus-free crew members disembarked to begin the process of repatriation to their home countriesAn activist performs on the roof during Earth Day in Wroclaw, PolandMalaysian army personnel set up barbed wire in the locked down area of Selayang wholesale market in Kuala LumpurA trader walks inside a pen as he arrives to purchase vegetables and fruits at the Agricultural Produce Market Committee market in Navi Mumbai during the nationwide lockdownA bride, poses for a wedding photographer next to East Lake in WuhanPeople shout at police officers during a demonstration of conspiracy theorists as other demonstrators protest against the lockdown imposed to slow the spread of the coronavirus in BerlinA pair of rare morepork owl chicks have become the first in more than a decade to survive on Norfolk Island, in the South PacificA squirrel runs across a fence as the sun shines in Berlin\u0027s Kreuzberg districtElection officials count after general election voting in Seoul, South KoreaNotre-Dame Cathedral in Paris, which was damaged in a devastating fire one year ago todayWild bluebells, which bloom around mid-April turning the forest blue as they form a carpet, pictured in the Hallerbos in BelgiumPope Francis delivers his Urbi et Orbi message following Easter Sunday Mass behind closed doors at St Peter\u0027s Basilica in The Vatican, during the country\u0027s lockdownA man watches Krakatau spewing ash during an eruption, in Serang, Indonesia\u0027s Banten provinceWomen queue for distribution of food for those suffering under Kenya\u0027s coronavirus-related movement restrictionsFirefighter Sittiporn Singthong, dressed up as Spider-Man, sprays disinfectant at the Wat Tha Mai Buddhist temple in Samut Sakhon province, ThailandTulip fields in Plomeur, western FranceA employee and a resident of the house for the elderly De Ravenstein react as nurses dance and sing in the garden, following the coronavirus disease outbreak, in Boortmeerbeek, BelgiumA man stands in the balcony of his home with the moon in the background in Cali, ColombiaA man holds a traditional lamp from the balcony of his house as torches and candles illuminate houses and high rise residential buildings as Indians mark the country\u0027s fight against the coronavirus pandemic a suburb of New Delhi, IndiaMedical staff load an infected patient into an ambulance at the Nimes air base, south of France, during an evacuation operation from the hard-hit east of the country where hospitals are overwhelmedA man prays inside the closed Moussawi Grand Mosque in BasraA City Hall health official wearing a protective suit sprays disinfectant at the entrance of City One condominium as the residential building was placed under lockdown after 17 cases of COVID-19 were detected, in Kuala Lumpur, MalaysiaMigrant workers wait on marked areas on the ground to maintain social distancing as they queue to receive food packets at an industrial area during a government-imposed nationwide lockdown as a preventive measure against the Covid-19 coronavirus, in ChennaiWedding dress and evening wear designer Friederike Jorzig adjusts a mannequin wearing a wedding dress with matching protective mask in her store Chiton in BerlinA stray dog walks in front of an empty historic India Gate, as nationwide lockdown continues over the coronavirus in New Delhi, IndiaA man watches a TV screen showing a file image of North Korea\u0027s missile launch during a news program at the Seoul Railway Station in SeoulHong Kong\u0027s skyline is seen with some of its lights turned off to mark the Earth Hour, an environmental campaignUkrainian citizens queue at the Polish-Ukrainian border during the coronavirus pandemic in Korczowa, Poland.

He had vowed to continue preaching unless I\u0027m in jail or the hospital before his death from coronavirus earlier this month.The bishop told his congregation that he believes God is larger than this dreaded virus just days before Virginia Governor\u0026nbspRalph Northam\u0026nbspurged people to avoid nonessential group gatherings.During a 15 March service, which nearly 200 people attended, the bishop said: I\u0027m glad to be in the Lord\u0027s house. It didn\u0027t have to be this way. The government could have said we couldn\u0027t gather at all. Just imagine if the government had the authority to say, you and me, we can\u0027t go to church. Aren\u0027t you glad you were free to get up and come?Most congregations are following stay-at-home guidelines,\u0026nbspaccording to recent polling\u0026nbspthat found that nearly 90 per cent of congregations have closed their churches and been encouraged to worship at home.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The survey found that evangelicals were more likely to report worshipping in person. In states with restrictions on attending church as well as those without, nearly a third of church-attending evangelicals said they continued to attend in person.Though many Christians have continued to practise their faith at home or by watching live-streamed services held in empty churches, places of worship across the US have been linked to several outbreaks.A report\u0026nbspfrom the\u0026nbspCenters\u0026nbspfor Disease Control and Prevention showed how religious services in particular can be deadly vectors for the disease.The\u0026nbspCDC\u0026nbspillustrated how a Chicago funeral became a super-spreader event that played a significant role in transmission of the virus.Among several people who became ill following the service, one patient who developed\u0026nbspCovid-19\u0026nbspsymptoms two days after attending the funeral was hospitalised a week later and put on a ventilator. The patient\u0026nbsplater died.Wife of arrested pastor Spell flashes wad of cash as she bails him outChurches sue US governor for right to hold religious servicesChurches mark Palm Sunday with virtual services amid Covid-19 lockdownChurches remain packed as pastors ignore coronavirus lockdown ordersPastor arrested for repeatedly violating social distancing rulesFlorida Pentecostal pastor\u0026nbspRodney Howard-Browne\u0026nbspheld several services in packed churches despite warnings from health officials and doctors to avoid large gatherings to prevent spreading the disease, which he called a phantom plague before his arrest for violating social distancing rules.Hillsborough\u0026nbspCounty Sheriff Chad\u0026nbspChronister\u0026nbspsaid that the pastor\u0027s reckless disregard for human life put hundreds of people in his congregation at risk along with thousands of Florida residents.Republican Senate Majority Leader\u0026nbspMitch McConnell\u0026nbspeven intervened in Louisville\u0027s social distancing guidelines as the mayor warned residents about packing churches on Easter.He said: Religious people should not be singled out for\u0026nbspdisfavoured\u0026nbsptreatment.Some Christian pastors plan showdown with coronavirus at EasterThe right to worship has emerged as one of the chief battles within the looming culture war brought on by the coronavirus, dramatically emphasising the outsized role of fringe American conservatism across the US and in the White House.The pandemic has also renewed defence of the Second Amendment, with the National Rifle Association claiming lockdowns during the pandemic a chance for them to want your guns, while gun stores are closed along with other nonessential businesses. The claims have been echoed by Donald Trump in his string of tweets to liberate states with Democratic governors, including Virginia, where he said gun rights are under siege. Republican officials have also used the crisis to close abortion clinics and deny abortion care under government orders to halt nonelective procedures.Roy Moore, who was endorsed by the president during his failed bid for a senate seat in Alabama, defended Louisiana pastor Tony Spell after he was charged for continually shunning a statewide ban on large gatherings.His Life Tabernacle Church has been linked to at least one death from coronavirus.The East Baton Rouge Parish coroner determined that the death of a 78-year-old man who had visited the church was due to Covid-19. The pastor has said the results are a lie.Mr Spell has been embroiled in a legal battle over his opposition to the state\u0027s stay-at-home order, stressing to his followers that it\u0027s their duty to continue attending church services despite the pandemic.He was recently arrested and charged with aggravated assault for allegedly attempting to back over a protester with his church bus. He said he\u0027s not guilty.His attorney Jeff Wittenbrick was admitted to Baton Rouge General hospital last week with a high fever and persistent cough after attending two events at the church earlier this month.Mr Spell, meanwhile, had planned to host a 2,000-member service on Easter Sunday.Central Police Department Chief Roger Corcoran said he had counted about 330 people who entered the church.Reverend Spell has also directed parishioners to donate their federal stimulus checks —\u0026nbspsent out earlier this month to support unemployed and under-employed Americans during the crisis —\u0026nbspto his website.Several other prominent evangelical leaders and televangelists on the Christian right, who rely on miraculous healing in their ministries, have also attempted to capitalise on the crisis.Kenneth Copeland urged viewers to pay tithes despite losing their jobs amid unprecedented unemployment claims. Jim Bakker pleaded to viewers to donate to his ministry to avoid filing for bankruptcy after he was cut off from credit card processing companies for selling a fake coronavirus cure for $80.But the pandemic has created unprecedented legal friction between state and local governments and churches that conservatives suggest will continue through the quarantine.This week, a federal court judge in California denied a request from three churches in the state to continue holding in-person services, which one pastor claims are commanded by scripture in order for them to lay hands on people and pray for them.The judge rejected arguments from Shield of Faith Family Church, Word of Life Ministries International and Church Unlimited that claimed Governor Gavin Newsom\u0027s stay-at-home order violates their First Amendment rights.Following the ruling, Harmeet Dhillon, who serves on the Republican National Committee for California and as the CEO of Center for American Liberty, said Americans should count on more restrictions on all your civil rights with no end in sight.Centres for Disease Control and Prevention\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

His government has “made mistakes” — and so has ours.But presidents and prime ministers have a lot on their plates. When it comes to health alarms, they rely on experts.It would take a very brave prime minister indeed to ignore the people appointed to safeguard the nation’s health when lives are at risk.And the advice from those experts — the sprawling Public Health England in particular — was that Britain faced no more than a larger-than-usual dose of winter flu.PHE was against German-style mass testing and, when caught flat-footed, rejected help from commercial laboratories in providing those tests.PHE failed to build stocks of personal protective equipment — including masks, gowns and gloves — despite a  test run showing these were a priority.PHE dragged its feet over sourcing ventilators for intensive-care patients and extra hospital beds.Frequently when running short of crucial gear, PHE resisted offers of outside help, leaving the NHS scrambling to catch up.And when it came to opening London’s ,-bed Nightingale emergency hospital, it was the Army that did the job in nine days.It was also PHE who insisted the British public would be protected by “herd immunity”.The sooner  per cent of the population had contracted the virus and become immune, the better, it said.Boris faithfully followed their lead until another expert, Prof Neil Ferguson, issued a nightmare prediction of , dead unless Britain was locked up overnight.It was Ferguson who in the Blair years forecast mass burials on the scale of the Great Plague during the “Mad Cow” scare and the foot-and-mouth outbreak.Neither Armageddon scenario came remotely close.Once this is over and the inevitable inquiry is held, Boris and his government will inevitably be in the dock.So will PHE, a fiercely territorial quango with a giant £.billion budget.Much of this goes on pay and perks for well-cushioned executives, with  staff on six-figure salaries — a nanny-state rich list.Its website boasts its job is to “protect and improve the nation’s health and wellbeing”.And yet this box-ticking bureaucracy — obsessed with sugary drinks and ersity — has failed at the first hurdle.It shares with the higher reaches of the NHS a suspicion of fleet-footed commercial rivals and deep-seated hostility to the “profit motive”.Criticism, still muted, is widespread within the medical community, including frontline doctors and consultants.Every Thursday at pm, a grateful nation stands and applauds NHS staff working around the clock to save lives at the risk of their own.The same cannot be said for the inflexible, politically correct quango that binds the hands of medical staff in the name of an outdated socialist credo on health provision: State good, private bad.Much will need to change after Covid-. And that change must start with Public Health England.MINISTERS are looking at a traffic-light system to lt lockdown. Red for Stop, green for Go, with amber in between.Overzealous cops and councils are being reined in. ­Common sense is taking over. Families can now attend funerals.We might be able to say goodbye to dying ­relatives. Parks will reopen to the ­public. Benches have been deemed safe to sit on.So how about allowing non-contact sporting activities that boost both physical and mental health Swimming pools are surely safe.

Do they really think that is the priority right now The Sussexes - from their Los Angeles bolthole - issued the tetchy statement saying they would no longer deal with The Sun and Britain’s other tabloid newspapers.It was reported on the front page of the republican sympathisingnewspaper.s story mentioned that the Sussexes were thought to be “angered” by a Sun exclusive that they were relocating to North America.That story was, of course, true.I fear Harry has already soaked up too much of the Hollywood “me, me, me” culture.He and Meghan appear to want to shape their media profile by press release and their own social media channels.That way they believe the coverage will be more glowing.It’s how celebrities try and control their public image.But I think British public will see through all that.I suggest the Sussexes time right now might be better spent writing letters to NHS workers and people who have lost loved ones to this awful virus.Or sending letters of comfort to those confined to their homes or the soldiers who have been helping Nightingale Hospitals across the country rather than whining about the media.To receive The Suns Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.If they need to see how it should be done they only need to look at the way the Queen, Charles and Camilla and William and Catherine have gone about things.They’ve shown resilience and leadership in these dark times.

On each phone there is an app that reports back to the authorities on the users’ health and online activities.Nor is there any escape in the home. The very concept of privacy barely exists when the state can use sophisticated technology to keep watch on our behaviour.This vision sounds like a nightmare, but it could become all too real thanks to the coronavirus.In its fallout, Covid- may end up causing as much damage to our essential freedoms as to our health - with the new menace of Big Brother on its way.Already the current emergency has led to the first comprehensive lockdown in British history.Evenit has been necessary to slow the spread of the virus, it is nevertheless a draconian measure that would have been unthinkable only a few weeks ago.Effectively the entire public has been placed under house arrest.Normal le has been brought juddering to a halt, while the police have been given unprecedented powers to enforce the quarantine.Even sitting for too long on a park bench or taking a leisurely drive have become offences against the state.With heroic stoicism, the vast majority of people have accepted this policy, seeing it as the only realistic means to protect the NHS and lessen the transmission of coronavirus.They hope that once the worst of the crisis has passed, there will be ato the Britain that they love, where inidual rights are respected and the power of the state is limited.Above all, this is my deepest wish too - though the chances look slim.One of the reasons why I, as an Irishman, admire this country so much is because of the British tradition of liberty, reflected in Magna Carta, parliamentary democracy and the defeat of Nazi tyranny.Unfortunately, even when the current lockdown is lted, it is possible that heavy-handed control by the state will remain.Quarantine may be temporary, but authoritarianism could be permanent.This is because officialdom, shaken by the unexpected scale of the coronavirus crisis, will be determined to prevent its resurgence by any means necessary.That will involve far more than just the maintenance of social distancing and the wearing of face masks.An arsenal of other measures could be deployed in the fight.One will be the reintroduction of curfews at the first sign of any new flare up in cases.If there is such a setback, the mood of the authorities will be even more intolerant towards any breaches. Fines will be heavier, jail terms longer.The skies will be filled with the sound of helicopters and the sight of drones as police — or even the Army — embark on ruthless enforcement.Another change is likely to be the advent of biometric identity cards, backed up by a comprehensive database of the entire population.Such a system has long been the dream of bureaucrats in Whitehall, and the aftermath of the crisis provides the perfect excuse for its imposition.Its appeal is all the greater because the latest type of cards operate with biotechnology that scans eyes and fingerprints.Only last year, the European Union passed a regulation requiring all national identity card systems on the continent to comply with new biometric standards.The British state will not stop there in its new crusade.In the name of health protection, mobile phone companies could be required to share data on their clients.According to the New Statesman, British Telecom, which owns the EE network, is already “in talks with the Government about handing over phone location and usage data” for the purpose of monitoring adherence to the lockdown.Similarly, tracking apps on devices could also be made obligatory so that the Government will be able to trace the contacts of anyone infected and ensure compliance with quarantine rules.Just as some criminals on release have to wear electronic tags, anyone who has tested positive for the virus may be ordered to wear a medical wristband even when self-isolation is over.Alternatively, those who test negative could be given immunity certicates.These initiatives will be accompanied by a political drive to reinforce support for the state, as happens in wartime.In a distinctly un-British way, people will be encouraged to snitch on those who fail to abide by the rules.Challenges to ruling orthodoxy will be seen as a form of subversion.If that sounds far-fetched, consider how laws to tackle discrimination or terrorism are now used to uphold fashionable ideology, as highlighted in the outrageous recent case where Lincolnshire businessman Harry Miller was questioned by police for allegedly sending a “transphobic” tweet.In the new Britain scarred by corona, the whole relationship between the state and the public will be inverted.The Government is meant to be accountable to the people.But, burdened with ID cards, curfews and tracking apps, the people will be accountable to the Government.There is an echo here of the George Orwell’s novel , which painted a terrying picture of Britain under totalitarian rule.In Orwell’s society gripped by permanent crisis, the citizenry were monitored day and night by the state.The propaganda and all-seeing eye of Big Brother could never be avoided, “always watching and the voice enveloping you, asleep or awake, indoors or outdoors, in the bath or in bed.In the present global crisis, many look to the experience of Asia, which has had far lower Covid death rates than the West.But that is a dangerous stance. First it ignores the fundamental point that China is responsible for the spread of this disease through its cover-up, persecution and lies.The country should be in the dock, not garnered with praise.Second it glosses over the oppressive nature of many of these Asian regimes, particularly that run by the tyrannical Chinese communist party.China has eagerly embraced new technology, like tracking devices, facial recognition cameras, eye-scanning security barriers and online data gathering, precisely because they drastically enhance the power of the state machine.Indeed, the country likes to boast that it is building the “world’s largest camera surveillance network”.As an example, in Guangzhou province, the commercial hub of southern China, tablets have been recently installed on buses to promote safety.Passengers are expected to lean their foreheads close to the tablet so that their photos and temperatures can be taken.China is also establishing a sinister “social credit system”, where behaviour is monitored to assess a citizen’s trustworthiness.Those given high ratings by the state can receive rewards like employment offers, shorter waiting times in hospitals and discounts at hotels.It is a recipe for bureaucratic despotism and political infantilisation.Other Asian nations, while nothing like as cruel as China, are also using technology as a tool to corral their public.Hong Kong has introduced mandatory wristbands for those in quarantine so they can be tracked.Taiwan has a monitoring system known as “the electronic fence” where those who are meant to be in isolation will be visited by the authoritiesthey turn off their mobiles.In South Korea, the government gathers huge amounts of data from phone records, CCTV images, and credit cards to help track citizens during the Covid crisis, while in Singapore, phone users are encouraged to download the “TraceTogether” app.This keeps a record of all the other numbers that have been in close proximity to the smartphone, making it easier to trace anyone who might have been near the owner in the event of a positive Covid-test.Not all of these developments are bad, provided they are genuinely used as weapons against disease rather than vehicles for the expansion of state power.But we have seen since   how the excuse of security can be used as a cover for bullying by the authorities, with the result that international air travel is often a miserable experience.A No spokesman said: “The NHS is doing a fantastic job and the nation will want to find a way to say thank you when we have defeated this virus.”SAS hero Andy McNab added: “The award of a George Cross would show an emotional appreciation.”We are asking our readers to please sign the petition below.We should not allow the same to happen on a national scale in the wake of the pandemic.As the great author C.S.Lewis wrote: “Of all tyrannies, a tyranny exercised for the good of its victims may be the most oppressive.It would be better to live under robber barons than omnipotent moral busybodies.”To receive The Suns Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

As I say, this baffling statement will make zero dference to their already fractured relationship with the UK.In an ideal world, every media outlet worldwide would form a pact that they will never again write about or use a photograph of the Sussexes.The effect would be swt and damning.For without the oxygen of publicity, what are they Married to a home-body, I have always rather envied those whose other halves travel frequently for their job.It gives you the house to yourself sporadicallyand makes you appreciate them when they .But in lockdown we are faring well because we are already used to being together most of the time.A friend whose husband usually travels for work called me the other day to say that his sudden, constant presence in the home was causing friction.And yesterday, Boyzone star Shane Lynch announced the sad news that lockdown has put his -year marriage to Sheena White under intolerable strain.He says: “I’m not even in my family home right now because me and her were at each other’s throats.“It wasn’t a good time or a good space.“I’m usually on the road and for the first time I’ve spent three months in my house . . . it can be a struggle.”Indeed it can. Let’s hope they sort it out for the sake of their two children.Now the dust has settled around Professor Neil Ferguson’s original estimate of , Covid deaths, it’s perhaps time to stand back and take a logical overview of the situation.While the death toll is still worrying, the mantra that we are critically harming the economy to protect the NHS from being overwhelmed is undermined by the news that many of the private hospitals repurposed for Covid patients are lying virtually empty and the ,-bed facility set up in London’s ExCel centre is only treating  people.It’s adding credence to the burgeoning mindset that, perhaps, those who are considered vulnerable should remain in lockdown while the rest of the country makes a gradualto school or work while maintaining strict social distancing measures.On GMB yesterday, a gruff, Swedish professor, whose name escaped me, was asked to explain the thinking behind his country’s policy to keep everything open.He replied: “People are not stupid.”In other words, the Swedes are taking personal responsibility for how they behave and, as of earlier this week, the death rate was starting to decline.It remains to be seen whether Sweden’s outlier stance proves to be the correct one, but one thing is for certain: Its economy may be weakened at the end of it, but it won’t be on the critical list like ours.Model and businessman David Gandy talked about the importance of fostering at the weekend, under the headline, “OMG. He’s so cute!”Indeed he is, was my immediate thought. My second was that I would happily foster him anytime.However, it turns out the headline and suggestion of benevolence was aimed at Dora, his rescue pup from Battersea Dogs Home, for which David is an ambassador.He says: “What I love about the evenings now is the calmness of a tired, sleeping dog at your side. I watch Dora dreaming.”Lucky Dora.One wondersshe knows that, when it comes to good fortune, she has won the canine equivalent of the Lottery.Last year, I read to kids in a primary school and, with rare exception, every time I asked what they wanted to be when they grew up, they replied: “A YouTuber.”Yet last week, while queuing behind a mother and her daughter outside the supermarket, the young girldeclared her desire to become a nurse when she left school.Now that is something positive to come out of the Covid- crisis.Jigsaws are getting me through the long days of lockdown.Despite The Bloke’s lame attempts to hide the last pieceI completed my fth at the weekend and, as an exercise in mindfulness, it’s right up there with any yoga retreat.So imagine my joy when Kodak announced last week that it has produced the world’s largest jigsaw with, gulp, , pieces.It is  separate images of world landmarks and, when finished, covers  square metres – about the size of a standard living room. Sadly, it also costs £, so I’ll stick to my ,-piece cheapies. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

First, the EU scheme has spectacularly failed to deliver anything.Indeed — as I suggest below — the EU is coming apart at the seams over this virus.And second, the invitation to join the scheme was sent, by those EU genii, to the wrong address. Duh.It is becoming more apparent with every day that passes that the civil service is the biggest impediment to the UK reforming itself.It is hostile to the Government, to the people — and deeply hostile to change of any kind.It is a vast congregation of time-serving bureaucrats dedicated only to saving their own jobs.The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers.The Who Cares Wins Appeal aims to get vital support to staff in their hour of need.We have teamed up with NHS Charities Together in their urgent Covid- Appeal to ensure the money gets to exactly who needs it.The Sun is donating £, and we would like YOU to help us raise a million pounds, to help THEM.No matter how little you can spare, please donate today herewww.thesun whocareswinsappealEven now, red tape may be stling our efforts to deal with the coronavirus.It will be interesting to discover, once this pandemic has receded, what part the civil service played in the UK’s failure to carry out adequate testing for the virus, right from the start.And the failure to bring in vital equipment.Government ministers carry the can for these sorts of failures, of course.But it is the civil service charged with enacting the decisions.I wonder how many ventilators have failed to arrive here because of some bureaucratic hitch I wonder what would have happenedthe civil service, rather than the military, were charged with building those Nightingale hospitals.They might just about be ready by the end of the century.It was clear, when this Government came to office, that the real opposition wasn’t the ragged hounds and trots on the Labour benches, but from the very people paid to enable the government — the civil service.There needs to be a clear-out, from the top down.Because this battle — between civil servants and Government ministers — will continue long after this virus has been defeated.Their opposition to Government policy hampers almost everything we do.That’s no way to run a country.I see The Vicar Of Dibley is back. Dawn French will reprise her role as the Rev Geraldine Granger for the BBC’s Big Night In this evening.That should cheer us up for a few moments.Here are a few more sitcoms they could update to keep us laughing through the lockdown:Some Mothers Do ’Ave ’Em – Frank Spencer is appointed Health Secretary and has to give briefings every day to the Press. Ooh, Betty, the hilarity.Till Death Us Do Part – Alf Garnett, in self isolation, kindly explains to us what he thinks of some Chinese culinary practices and the Chinese government.Both Feet In The Grave – sadly, there was no ventilator for Victor.Not Going Out – huge laughs as a large number of people don’t, er, go out.Are You Being Served  – um . . .  no, actually.Dad’s Army – Captain Mainwaring orders his men to build a new hospital in two days flat, with hilarious consequences.On The Buses – Stan and Jack vow to wreak revenge on the idiots who won’t give them PPE.How’s the home- schooling coming along then Got the kids up at eight every morning to do a bit of calculus I’ve been enjoying it, although I maybe haven’t given enough attention to mathematics.But it’s been a good chance to redress some of the crap my daughter has been subjected to in ten years of state education.She now has a slightly dferent take on the British Empire, the poverty of Africa and how fun it might be to transition into being a bloke.A mad woman in America has warned that home-schooling is “dangerous”. Why Professor of Law Elizabeth Bartholet said: “It’s always dangerous to put powerful people in charge of the powerless.”.She added that it gave parents “authoritarian control” over the kids.You mean like the authoritarian control they’ve had from the teachers all these years, love It’s comforting to know that even in this crisis, the liberals are still as deranged as ever.You’ve got to feel sorry for Victoria Beckham, haven’t you Poor woman says that last week was the worst of her le.She’s bitterly disappointed with you, the British people.She thinks we were all terribly arsey about her when she decided to use our money to furlough her fashion company workers.How could we be so mean as to expect a woman who has an estimated wealth of £million – acquired largely through singing badly – should dig into her own pockets.Rather than scrounging off the taxpayer.The stinking rich really don’t get it, do they No self awareness whatsoever – and even less shame.But then never mind the witless Posh, whose useless company loses millions every year.Look at old beardo Branson – Sir Richard, entrepreneur and “philanthropist”.He wants YOU to pay HIM £million to bail out his airline, Virgin.This is a man who has paid not a single penny of income tax in the UK for fourteen years.But when his company is in trouble he expects you to bail him out.And this from a bloke who has already been coining it from the taxpayer for his awful rail franchises.This kind of bare-faced cheek almost beggars belief.Or there’s Apple boss Tim Cook boasting about sending a few safety masks to the UK.SO kind of you, Tim.Now how about your company pays its proper share of tax in the UK  Then we might not need your charity.Pope Francis has pleaded with the EU for countries to “come together” to fight the virus.Ha. Fat chance, your Popeship.The European Union is falling apart as a consequence of this crisis.All the member states have been doing the sensible thing – and ignoring everything the EU bureaucrats have to say.Germany introduced very tough anti-immigration measures, for example.But the EU has been criticised for abandon- ing Spain and Italy.There are big rows over a joint debt fund to help the worst-hit countries.There are arguments over what phone app should be used to track virus carriers.One leading European economist said that the EU was in danger of “imploding”.Ah well – every cloud, huh I CAN’T get to my usual snippers in Saltburn. So my we and daughter kindly agreed to cut my hair for me. They gave me a kind of Mohican.I think it’s great. The new me. Liddle, back in the game. Watch out, chicks.KIM JONG-UN is apparently very ill. Nothing to do with the coronavirus.The morbidly obese weirdo who runs North Korea is thought to be under-going serious heart surgery.He’s getting his reward then, for eating like a king while the rest of his country starves. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

At its best, the monarchy shines light on dark places, telling stories that would otherwise go untold and standing up for what’s right.It has been said that the Royal Family’s first obligation is to give back to the British people who fund them. I agree wholeheartedly. It is gravely concerning that these former royals, over many years, have sought to insulate themselves from taking accountability for what they say or do — even when they know it to be distorted,  and completely tone-deaf.When power is enjoyed without responsibility, the trust we all place in these very privileged people is degraded.It is a really hypocritical way of doing business and, quite frankly, it bores every corner of society.I have watched the Duke and Duchess of Sussex ditch crown and country at a time of need, by private jet, to make millions in Hollywood — for no good reason other than the fact they simply cannot bear the fair and honest reporting a free Press brings.With that said, please note I will not be engaging with Harry and Meghan’s PR spin. There will be no corroboration and zero engagement.This policy is also being instated for their long-suffering communications team. My heart truly goes out to their lone UK staffer James Holt, although I have far less sympathy for the dodgy practices offered by Hollywood PR company Sunshine Sachs— a side of the industry relating to celebrities readers never see.This policy is not about avoiding criticising Harry and Meghan.I’ll always be honest. It’s not about shutting down public conversation or censoring accurate reporting.The media have every right to report on — and indeed, have an opinion on — the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, good or bad. But it can’t be based on their lies.I also want to be very clear: This is not in any way a blanket policy for all royals .I’m looking forward to working with other dukes and duchesses all over the country, engaging with members of the Royal Family senior and junior and young up-and-coming royalsto spotlight issues and causes that desperately need acknowledging.And I look forward to doing whatever I can to help further opportunities for more under-represented royals, who are needed now more than ever .What I won’t do is offer myself up to the constant spin, fact-twisting and putdowns of their family members I’ve had to put up with from Harry and Meghan’s long-suffering staff for the past two years.I’m that encouraged this new approach will be heard and respected.Sun readers deserve to know what’s REALLY going on.NETFLIX managed to achieve the impossible this week with sex-obsessed new reality show Too Hot To Handle.They found a cast of millennials more backstabbing, vain, stupid and horny than ITV have ever managed with Love Island, which looks totally tame in comparison.It’s the biggest mind-numbing abomination I’ve seen on television in a very long time.But can I be totally honest with you – I absolutely loved every minute. px,px, px\" data-img\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-BBC--.jpg stripallw\" data-srcSet\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-BBC--.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-BBC--.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-BBC--.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-BBC--.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-BBC--.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-BBC--.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-BBC--.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-BBC--.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-BBC--.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-BBC--.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-BBC--.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-BBC--.jpg w w\" src\"data:image svg+xml,%Csvg xmlnshttp:www.w.org  svg viewBox  . %E%C svg%E\"  px,px, px\" data-img\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-R-KELLY-.jpg stripallw\" data-srcSet\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-R-KELLY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-R-KELLY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-R-KELLY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-R-KELLY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-R-KELLY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-R-KELLY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-R-KELLY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-R-KELLY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-R-KELLY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-R-KELLY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-R-KELLY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-R-KELLY-.jpg w w\" src\"data:image svg+xml,%Csvg xmlnshttp:www.w.org  svg viewBox  . %E%C svg%E\" Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It applies to anyone starting Maternity, Paternity, Shared Parental, Parental Bereavement or Adoption Pay from tomorrow. Tonightaposs move - which campaigners said was welcome, but not enough - comes after fears that thousands of mums were losing out on cash. The aposfurloughapos scheme for more than million people leaves workers on % or less of their usual pay, funded by the state. Because maternity pay is already less than a full wage, new mums were taking a double hit by having their salary docked, and then ided again when they went on leave. Under the new law, anyone who starts maternity leave from tomorrow will now have it based on their usual earnings - not the reduced wage they got on furlough. That means it will be worth at least % of usual earnings for the first  weeks, followed by  weeks at the statutory rate which is currently £.. Business Minister Paul Scully said: These measures will ensure those on the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme continue to receive the parental leave and pay they are entitled to. However, the change stops short of demands by the campaign group Maternity Action, which wrote to the Chancellor earlier this month. Todayaposs announcement does not address the plight of pregnant women who feel forced to leave their work by government guidance on vulnerable groups. Pregnant women, along with the over-s and people with an underlying health condition, are being told to signicantly limit face-to-face contact. The government has said the move is a precaution while scientists work outpregnant women are more at risk. But Maternity Action says the advice has led to pregnant women feeling they have to stay away from work, when they would otherwise still have to go in, or kept on statutory sick pay in what is unlawful discrimination. Director Rosalind Bragg said the move was welcome but did not go far enough. She said: We are still waiting for the Government to provide employers with clear guidance on health and safety for pregnant women.

Matt Hancock today spelt out more of his thinking about how the UK will know when to ease restrictions on peopleaposs lives.The Cabinet minister said the key factor in easing lockdown will be speed at which new coronavirus cases come down.But once it’s eased, thereaposs the risk of a second peak - and lockdown being re-imposed -the virus spikes again.So the key factor inkeepinglower restrictions will be a test, track and trace programme, designed to track down people whoaposve been in contact with Covid- and swtly isolate them.Some , officials are being recruited to monitor the movements of infected people, with the help of an NHS app. Mr Hancock said this programme could allow the UK to “hold down” the number of cases with “fewer restrictions”. But unlike the Scottish government, which has said schools and some shops could be first to reopen, he refused to say what areas of society might open up first. Ministers have previously said pubs and restaurants will be among the last to reopen. Speaking to ITVaposs Good Morning Britain, Mr Hancock said it was too soon to lt the lockdown.  Although each carrier is on average infecting less than one other person, it wouldn’t take much to lose that grip we’ve got on it, he said. And although easing lockdown depends on the fall in the number of new cases, that number is still unknown. Mr Hancock told BBC Radio aposs Today programme: Now that weaposre at the peak, and we very much hope that things will start to slow down and,and when they do, then the speed with which the number of new cases reduces will frankly will determine how long we need to keep the measures on and that is as yet unknown. He said it was not quite the case that mass testing and contact tracing needed to be in place before the current restrictions are eased. But he said contact tracing worked better when the number of infections was pushed right down. He added: The truth is that we need to get the number of new cases down, right down. And the lower you go, the more effective contact tracing is because the more resources you can put into each inidual case that gets a positive test. You can really make sure you can get hold of all of their contacts and get them, in many cases, to self-isolate. The smaller the number of new cases, the more effective the test, track and trace system will be.

The mother told the Mirror she feared for her child as she risks her le daily while caring for Covid- sufferers on a dedicated ward. The mum, who spoke on condition she was not named, blasted the Government over supply problems which have triggered huge shortages of vital personal protective equipmentfor NHS staff. Revealing why she decided to speak out, she said it was “terrying” having a child at the heart of the pandemic without sufficient protection. She added: “There are too many people risking their lives for the good of the nation, and I am one cross mother. “There is no amount of money I wouldnapost spend to give my daughter PPE, but that I have to do it is shameful.” Her daughter was so desperate for safety equipment she asked her mum to dig out her old scrubs from her training days – and begged to her look online for extra masks. The devoted mum trawled the internet for face masks and ordered one batch of  for £ and a second shipment of five for £.  “I did what any self-respecting mother would do,” she said, admitting she paid “an extortionate rate”. “I had to go from company to company. “There is no amount of money I wouldnapost pay to bring my daughter protective care, obviously. “Sheaposs working on a aposdirtyapos ward with repeated exposure.” The mum, who admits she is “privileged” in having the money to help, makes occasional deliveries of food parcels so her exhausted daughter does not have to traipse to supermarkets and queue at the end of her shts. She plans to deliver the PPE gear this weekend when she drops a food package to her daughter, , who works at a hospital in the South West. But she said she was “heartbroken” at the situation in which her daughter finds herself, so soon after making the pledge all doctors make at the start of their careers. “My baby girl took the Hippocratic Oath so she is going to continue to serve the British people with or without a mask on because she took an oath to,” she said. “But the UK Government is exploiting young people who took an oath to serve as doctors, and exposing them to danger well beyond what they should be experiencing in their first few years of medicine is absolutely heartbreaking.”  The mum gave an insight into the challenges faced by young medics battling a virus which only emerged four months ago. Now, they are at the heart of our countryaposs fightback against the pandemic. Asked how her daughter is coping, she said: “It depends what kind of day it is. “There are days when she is enlivened with the opportunity to do what she has always wanted to do, and itaposs an exciting time. “She is at the forefront of medicine and they are allowing her to be of service in a way she has always wanted. “Then there are the days when the effects of mismanagement are really wearying.” The crisis has made her wish her daughter had followed a dferent career path. “Do I want to sacrice my daughter  Itaposs days like this I wish she had started Arts,” admitted the mum.  In a phone call to her mother, the young doctor spoke of her fears for lower-paid NHS staff also working on the frontline. She told her mother: “Itaposs one thingyouaposve chosen to be a doctor and this is your calling and you put yourself in the line of fire because of your commitment.“Butyouaposre the woman rolling the trolley to take the lunch orders and youaposre still in the Covid ward “This isnapost your calling, this is your way to make a living – and itaposs very unlikely that he or she has a parent to buy them a mask.”Like the rest of the country, doctors, nurses and carers are bound by strict social distancing rules governing their contacts with people outside their households.

But as we head into another warm, sunny weekend, calls are growing for the government to spell out how it will eventually be relaxed. Tory MPs have piled on pressure to save the economy - while Scotland and Wales have tightened the screws by pushing ahead and saying what will happen next. For all the argument and debate, we still donapost have a date when lockdown will be relaxed. And we know it wonapost actually end - it will just be eased bit by bit. But details have dripped out in recent days about how that might happen. Weaposll relax lockdown once the infection rate is low enough, and then use a test, trace, track strategy with an NHS app to keep it low. Hereaposs everything we know about how lockdown will be relaxed, but why we must also get used to a aposnew normalapos that looks dferent to the UK we knew before.How long is the UKaposs coronavirus lockdown  The lockdown expires on May  - six weeks after it began. But thataposs just the legal date it has to be reviewed by. Emergency lockdown powers in the Health Protection Regulations  must be formally reviewed every three weeks. In reality the government will renew the lockdown for longer, at least partly. The question is how much of it will be extended, and for how long.  When will the UK lockdown end - and how  The UK lockdown will start to be relaxed once five tests are met:The NHS is able to cope A sustained fall in deaths New infections dropping enough Adequate testing and PPE No risk of a second peakBut once it is eased it wonapost all happen in one go. Instead the lockdown is set to be relaxed in phases while some social distancing measures stay in place. So while the strictest restrictions should start to ease this summer, some measures look set to be in place until next year. Stand-in PM Dominic Raab adds we might see restrictions tighten in some ways and loosen in others. How will the government decide itaposs time to relax the lockdown  The UK government will have to fulfil all five testson ending the lockdown. Downing Street adds the key test will be how far and fast the infection rate drops. aposRapos - the number of people each carrier infects - is already below , which stops Covid- spreading exponentially. But Health Secretary Matt Hancock has warned it wouldn’t take much to loose that grip. Any change to the restrictions must not risk the aposRapos number going above .So how will we know when thataposs happened  The key piece of evidence will be a study by the Office for National Statistics on the infection rate - expected to be published in early May. That could be crucial in deciding what the government does next. Despite pleas from Tory MPs, Downing Street insists the decision will be based on science before the economy. Boris Johnsonaposs spokesman said: We will have to take decisions based on the best available scientic and health advice. it’s not going to be a case of choosing between the economy and public health.”Once lockdown is relaxed, what happens then  If the virus spikes again, lockdown could have tomultiple times with little notice. So the plan is to stop that happening with a three pronged strategy - test, trace and track. The government is hiring , human contact tracers and will encourage people to download an NHS app. Put together, the system should noty people when theyaposve been in contact with a Covid- carrier - so they can immediately isolate and stop it spreading further. But there are concerns about how well it will work. The NHS says the app will be launched in the coming weeks. It will use Bluetooth to log each time your phone moves near another personaposs phone with the app. If one of those people is later diagnosed with Covid-, you would get an alert warning you to get tested and self-isolated.  What will reopen first and what will stay shut  The UK government has refused to say officially - and thereaposs not yet a firm decision. But plenty of speculation has been leaked. And we can also pick up clues from Scotland and Wales, which have been more open about their plans. Schools and some non-essential shops seem very likely to reopen first, with modied layouts to ensure people can stay two metres apart. But hairdressers and nail bars could remain shut for six months, sources told The Sun. Working from home could become the new normal until thereaposs a vaccine, government advisors have said. And UK and Scottish ministers have warned pubs and mass gatherings could be among the last to reopen. PM Boris Johnsonaposs spokesman said: There will be judgments based on scientic and health advice of what is possible without increasing the risk of a second peak.” That could have to mean extending the aposfurloughapos scheme for staff to get up to % of their pay while out of work. The scheme currently expires in June but No will continue to keep it under review. It’s our intention to stand by both workers and businesses, a spokesman said.  Will some people be let out earlier than others  Itaposs possible. The government has looked at an idea of loosening restrictions on younger, healthier people first in order to get the economy moving again. And people could meet small bubbles of wider friends and family under one idea being looked at in Scotland. If that idea does happen, youaposd have to pick the same small aposbubbleapos of people to meet day-to-day, week-to-week - and carry on staying away from everyone . None of you would be able to go outside your aposbubbleapos.  Why have Scotland and Wales got dferent plans - and what does it mean  Deep splits have opened up in the strategy across the UK. Wales and Scotland are both pushing ahead with telling the public what post-lockdown might look like, but the UK government refuses to say. So far, the actual plans remain pretty similar in each country - in fact, Matt Hancock has said Scotlandaposs plan is pretty similar to what heaposs been looking at. Itaposs just the communication with the public that has been split. But that risks changing as Wales and Scotlandaposs chiefs - who sit on crucial COBRA meetings about the lockdown - pile pressure on Boris Johnson and have powers over places like schools and care homes. The split forced the Health Secretary to plead for unity, saying: So far we have moved as one United Kingdom and I think that has been a very good thing. My preference is that we work together as one country. A Downing Street spokesman warned the nations: I’m sure they like us will be guided by the science - and won’t want to do anything that could risk a second peak”. Whataposs happening in Scotland  Scotlandaposs First Minister set out a -page blueprint for easing the lockdown. Nicola Sturgeon said businesses might be able to reopenthey can keep customers and staff  metres apart. The same would have to be in place in schools with modications needed in some classrooms. But pubs and mass gatherings would likely have to remain closed for longer. Despite spelling out an exit strategy, Ms Sturgeon warned normal as we knew it is not on the cards in the near future. Nicola Sturgeon said lting the lockdown is not a flick of the switch moment but more of a gradual change to the current conditions. No insisted Scotlandaposs plan was actually pretty similar to its own in terms of what needs to happen before lockdown ends.  Whataposs happening in Wales  Walesapos First Minister Mark Drakeford said lockdown could be left in three phases, like a traffic light in reverse. The red phase would see only the most careful and controlled lting of restrictions, amber would see more restrictions lted andthe virus does not re-emerge, Wales could move to the green zone. But he believed that UK ministers were nervous about entering into a similar conversation with the public for fear it would undermine the message to stay at home. The Welsh Government will also need seven questions to be answered before easing the lockdown. They are:Would easing a restriction have a negative effect on containing the virus  Does a particular measure pose a low risk of further infection  How can it be monitored and enforced  Can it be reversed quicklyit creates unintended consequences  Does it have a positive economic benefit  Does it have a positive impact on people’s wellbeing  Does it have a positive impact on equality "},{"url":null,"title":"canary islands could reopen soon","story":"NewsCanary Islands could reopen as soon as Monday - but not to UK holidaymakersThe Canary Islands, which include Tenere, Lanzarote and Gran Canaria, may see beaches and restaurants reopen in the coming weeks as lockdown measures are relaxedShareCommentsByRita Sobot:,  APR NewsLockdown measures in the Canary Islands may be relaxed in the coming weeks \" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - The Coronavirus BriefingSubscribeWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

However, the islands of Fuerteventura, El Hierro and La Gomera have had no fatalities.Canary Islands president Angel Victor Torres has reportedly been in talks with government officials in recent days about the phased plan to reopen the islands. Phase one would see relaxed measures be introduced, with a timetable drawn up allowing dferent groups of people such as the elderly or children to leave their homes at dferent times so that social distancing can be adhered to. People will be advised to wear masks in public and to use hand gel on a regular basis. The first week would allow hair salons to reopen as well as small shops. In the second phase, shopping centres would be able to open, as will gyms and possibly some hotels and tourist establishments but all with specic conditions and health regulations. The third week would see the opening of restaurants, with no more than four people per table, together with the beaches and swimming pools. In the fourth week, bans on inter-island travel would be lted so that more flights could resume between the islands, which include Tenere, Lanzarote and Gran Canaria. It is understood the governmentaposs emergency committee would like international travellers back for the late summer or the fourth quarter of the year, which is the high season for the islands. However, it is far too soon to say when Britons and other international travellers will be allowed to visit the islands again.  There will most likely be access controls at ports and airports when international travellers are allowed to visit the Canary Islands, with tourists tested for coronavirus regularly. The package of proposals are expected to be presented to Spainaposs Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez on Sunday. The Spanish government has already indicated that dferent regions will be allowed to reopen in phased stages, depending on how badly the coronavirus pandemic has hit them.Speaking to the Spanish newspaper El Mundo, Mr Torres said the road back to recovery from the  coronavirus  pandemic would have to be gradual."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus nurse left shocked anxious","story":"NewsCoronavirus nurse left shocked and anxious after heartless vandals trash her carThe newly-qualied nurse, who works on the coronavirus ward at the Royal Derby Hospital, has been left so shocked by the incident that she is struggling to sleepShareCommentsByNoah Martin:,  APR Updated:,  APR NewsTwo of tyres on the car had been slashed by vandals \" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - The Coronavirus BriefingSubscribeWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

The newly-qualied nurse was left shocked when she noticed white paint had been thrown all over her car while parked outside her home in Derby on April . The front windscreen had also been smashed while two tyres had been slashed, Derbyshire Live reports. I was very emotional, I didnapost know what to do, whether I should stay at home or go to work. I just stood there, said the woman, who works as an outpatient nurse on the coronavirus ward at the Royal Derby Hospital. In the end I made the rational decision and put the patients first, the patients are more important, I had to get public transport. I wasnapost thinking about myself, I was pretty shocked and worried. I donapost knowI was ing properly.

It really got to me, obviously we have to stay professional but I canapost switch off my emotions at work, she said. It does distract you, I donapost need it right now, especially in a Covid- ward, it has a huge impact. The nurse spoke with her manager and was told to go home and deal with the overwhelming situation.  The -year-old washed the paint off the car, and also noticed a stone which had been painted white had been placed outside her front door. Obviously I did contact the police and they have said itaposs a case of mistaken identity, she said. The nurse added: Itaposs just tiring and overwhelming, Iaposm already stressed in work so for that to happen, I just wish people could have respect. Although her insurance company gave her a temporary courtesy car, the nurse said is has been a big blow financially. The vehicle could be a write-off, she claims.  The nurse added: Iaposve been a student for so many years, Iaposm just starting out and Iaposve still got debts to pay. When I bought the car I told myself I needed to make an investment and keep it for a few years, my whole plan has to change.

Well, spare a thought for one unlucky librarian who couldnapost believe her eyes when she arrived at work this week. She discovered cleaners had carried out a deep clean of the book shelves and then reorganised books by size instead of genre alphabetical order. Kate Ashton, manager of Newmarket Library, in Suffolk, has told of her shock after walking in to discover the mishap.Her colleague Krystal Vittles went viral on Twitter after sharing the hilarious mistake, with over , likes. She tweeted: You think youaposre having a bad week  My poor colleague has just been in to do her weekly check of the library building. The cleaner has stared deep cleaning the spaceand has cleaned the shelves but has put . bays of books back on IN SIZE ORDER. Libraries and other public places were closed down in March as a result of coronavirus. But cleaners and librarians are still visiting regularly as part of weekly building checks. Now Ms Ashton has said she can see the funny side of the mistake - but admitted it will take a bit of time to reorganise the books.She told Mirror: “Our cleaner was taking the opportunity to give the shelves a thorough clean – nothing to do with coronavirus, it’s just good to give the shelves a thorough clean whilst the library is closed.Unfortunately the books were put back in size order rather than by genre alphabetical order! “I was a bit shocked at the time as it’ll take us a bit of time to reorganise them but I can see the funny side now.  We’re all still really busy at the moment running library activities online for our regular customers but sadly it looks like libraries will be closed for a while so we’ll have time to sort the books out. “Our cleaner is lovely and does a great job in the library. It was an honest mistake and just one of those things so I would never want her to feel bad about it.  “I’ve been bewildered at how much interest there has been in the story – I think the story has been retweeted about , times and lots of fellow librarians have got in touch. I think people are just pleased to be able to share any light-hearted stories at the moment as it helps to cheer everyone up.  In the grand scheme of things it’s not really that important. “Don’t worry all the books will be back in the right order ready for our customers when we’re open again!” In a follow-up tweet, Ms Vittles said she would be buying the cleaner a bottle of wine. She wrote: A quick update: our cleaner at this library is a great lady. Bless her for being neat and tidy. She doesnapost work in libraries as such so she was just doing her best, and to be fair, the books were neat as heck.  I might have to buy her a bottle of wine after this. The hilarious blunder struck a chord with many on Twitter as people suggested new ways of storing the books. One person joked: Just go with it. Or do the colour thing. It’s a new world. Another joked: You might attract a whole new clientele who were previously triggered by books being in random sizes, who will now be totally happy with the neat new layout!

Usually a time for fasting, reflection and charity work,  has seen Muslims looking for new ways to observe rules and share food and time together. Digital technology is being used to help people enjoy online prayers and sermons, as well as to give to charity during the month-long celebration. Some key elements of Ramadan are undergoing radical change.Iftar, the meal to break the fast at sunset, is usually a time when friends and family come together to enjoy a feast of delicious food. Muslims then attend the Mosque for special Ramadan prayers called Taraweeh.But as we approach week six in lockdown, Iftars and Taraweeh prayers will be taking place in isolation as Mosque doors remain firmly bolted. Instead, many Mosques are going digital, offering online sermons, Islamic teaching sessions and live streaming prayers so Imams can still engage with the community. One of these is the Karimia Institute in Nottingham - they’re hosting a special Iftar programme on their community radio station at :pm. Readings from the Quran and short prayers will be shared via their Facebook page, which people can watch online before praying Taraweeh at home.Dr Musharraf Hussain OBE, CEO and Chief Imam at Karimia Institute says this year sees people being urged to find new ways to observe and celebrate. As he says: “We are telling people to stay home and don’t share Iftar with each other, technology has allowed us to communicate with the community, it is better than nothing.“Ramadan is always a time for inner development, reflection, patience and sympathy and of course charity. Muslims give a lot of money to charity during this month as well as recite the Quran. “The Quran plays an important role during Ramadan, they both tie in together and during the pandemic, people have turned to the Quran and many have improved their spirituality.”Since the lockdown Dr Hussain has also been giving online Islamic sermons and reciting short prayers called the Jummah Khutba on Fridays. Earlier this month, around  worshippers joined Dr Hussain online for Shab-e-Barat. The special day happens every year in the Islamic calendar and it is when Muslims believe Allahwrites their destinies for the coming year, after taking into account their past actions.  Ramadan is a month where Muslims give to charity too, with many people making donations to their local Mosques. Mosques rely on this cash to sustain services and maintain the buildings but since the pandemic, it has become increasingly dficult to raise funds.In response, Muslim crowd-funding  LaunchGood has launched The #SupportOurMosque campaign, which has been supported by the Muslim Council of Britain.This is just one example of Muslim communities coming together to support mosques.Harun Khan, general secretary of the Muslim Council of Britain, said: “The message for this Ramadan is clear - fast and pray at home and share Ramadan digitally. This is the way to help save lives.“Ramadan is about connecting to God through worship, reflection, compassion and giving back to others.“It is important to use this time to reconsider, to reflect on the way we live our lives and the way we relate to our Creator, our communities and those in need. We must be sure to celebrate Ramadan in the safest way possible - in our homes.”In London a group of Muslims from dferent nationalities have created a Facebook video project called Ramadan Together - and they’ll be using other social media s including WhatsApp to reach out to friends and family.Photographer Mohamed Abdulle and filmmaker and writer Basma Khala will be sharing content showing how dferent cultures from around the world celebrate Ramadan. Mohamed - known as Mabdulle - is Somali, while Basma is a Sudanese, Irish Afro-Arab. The pair, who have made the short video, will discuss how the lockdown will affect Muslims during Ramadan this year.It features Muslim voices from across the world, including Egyptian blogger Dina Tokio, modest fashion model Mariah Idrissi, the first woman to model in a hijab, and BBC Radio presenter Mim Shaikh.Mabdulle said: “For me, Ramadan is about new beginnings and fresh starts. The thing that makes it so special is that it’s an experience we can all share as a community.

John-Paul Drike, the director of Drakes Supermarkets in Adelaide, Australia, says he responded simply by giving the alleged hoarder the middle finger. In a stunning YouTube video, the supermarket boss has vented his anger at those who have taken advantage of the desperate rush for basic household supplies amid the coronavirus pandemic. He claimed that one unidentied customer had been audacious enough to purchase  -roll packets of loo roll and  units of one-litre sanitiser from his shop - and then later ask for a refund. Follow the latest coronavirus updates here “I had my first customer yesterday who said he wanted to get a refund on  packets of -pack toilet paper and  units of one-litre sanitiser, Mr Drake says in his video on April . Flipping his middle finger at the screen, he added: “I told him that.  Branding those who have been panic-buying supplies such as toilet paper absolutely ridiculous, he continued: That is the sort of person that is causing the problem in the whole country. Speaking to News, he said the man wanted to get rid of the items because he was no longer able to sell them on eBay after his site was shut down. He claimed that he had as many as  people working with him to buy up the highly-sought after commodities. Australiaaposs Home Affairs Minister, Peter Dutton, has said that the government will come down like a ton of bricks on supermarket hoarders who have been clearing shelves of basic supplies. Speaking last month, he said that that anyone caught profiteering from buying up essential groceries such as food and toilet paper will be prosecuted.

I wasn’t there at the time but nobody really remembers the Roma European Cup semi-final too fondly but they’ll always recall Barcelona and Monchengladbach.“Getting into the final was a massive thing for the city and the club but at the time, as players, nothing was really a surprise for us.“We were expecting to get there so when we did it was great to do, don’t get me wrong, but it wasn’t as much of a surprise to us as it was outsiders.“At that time there was the European Cup, Cup Winners’ Cup and the other teams went into the Uefa Cup.“When you think about that in recent terms, Liverpool didn’t win the league last season but they won the Champions League.“That was the sort of level we were up against. It was a huge achievement.”Bowman recalls United going into the second leg riled up after witnessing some premature celebrations from the Monchengladbach players after a stalemate in Dundee.The -year-old also remembers a rare occasion where legendary boss Jim McLean inidually congratulated his players after the final whistle.Bowman, who made  appearances in tangerine, added: “Under wee Jim we were always taught, unless it was the second leg and you had to win at home, as long as you didn’t lose a goal it was OK.“That was the biggest thing, from our point of view, we didn’t get beat and we weren’t up against it.“I remember they were celebrating after the first leg and that probably gave us a bit of impetus to go on and beat them.“They were high-fiving each other because they got a - and thought the tie was over so that annoyed us a bit.“It made such a dference for us going there at - and Iain getting the goal just before half time.“They had to really come at us because they needed to score two.“Going into half time it was a massive advantage but I can’t really remember us being under that much pressure.“We knew they had to score two which was a tough ask against our defence. It was quite comfortable.“They didn’t have a lot of chances. Big Thommohad some great games and made some big saves that season but I can’t really remember him having to be brilliant.“Heggiesaid to me after it, ‘You should take this all in,’ and I was probably very naïve and just thought this happens every year, we’ll do it again next year.“I probably didn’t appreciate it as much as what I probably should have. It’s only when you look back.“It’s probably one of the only times I can recall Jim coming round and shaking everybody’s hand in the dressing-room after the game.“He really pushed us to our limits and got the best out of everybody. If he could see you had something he would get it out of you, how he did it was irrelevant.“He was very guarded towards us but he went round and congratulated everyone inidually.”United went on to lose the final - over two legs against IFK Gothenburg, with a - Scottish Cup Final defeat to St Mirren sandwiched in between.Bowman believes had they beaten the Buddies they might’ve gone on to secure the Uefa Cup, too.He continued: “It shows how much the SFA helped us at the time! We played the Scottish Cup Final on the Saturday and the second leg of the Uefa Cup Final on the Wednesday.“It was for the good of Scottish football we were trying to win it as well. I thinkwe’d beaten St Mirren, we would’ve had a lot better chance.“There’s no way of saying we’d have definitely beat Gothenburg because they were a decent team but the St Mirren loss was the first down we’d had that season.“Everything was on the up all the time, even with the amount of games we’d played that year.“It was the first time the press had questioned our fitness because we’d played that many games.“You’re never tired when you’re winning but as soon as you get beat that can quickly change.“Personally, all the finals don’t mean anythingyou don’t win. You want to have success by winning and savouring that.”🔵 In these troubled times, when many people are struggling to get out for their paper, we are pledging to help readers by providing a FREE digital edition of the Eveningfor three months.

In an ideal world I’d like to see an even bigger league with Dundee given the chance to join United in the Premiership.Whether that can happen, we’ll have to wait and see.We’re right at the start of the process so I’m sure almost anything is still on the table.I hope all the clubs in this area get something out of reconstruction. What we get should be better for Scottish football.I just hope we can avoid the same sort of voting farce we had  days ago with the SPFL.Dundee and managing director John Nelms were left in an impossible position, evensome of the behaviour has been questionable.As far as I’m concerned we should move on now and look to a better future. Ideally one with United and the Dark Blues in the top flight together.I know the existing Premiership clubs would certainly want the Dee up, too.What we know for sure, having seen the goings-on for the past couple of weeks, is clubs will only vote for something that is in their own interest. That’s just the way the world is.The good news, I think, for Dundee in all that is having them catapulted into the top flight would be seen to have plenty of plus points for it.Just ask Aberdeen – having both our city clubs back in the top flight gives them more decent away crowds coming to Pittodrie and their fans good away days.They wouldn’t be the only ones that benefit from having the Dundee derby back in the Premiership.We need the biggest teams at the top table – make it happen!It’s a few days ago now but I want to offer my congratulations to Robbie Neilson and his team after Dundee United were crowned Championship winners.The Tangerines have been in pole position right from the first whistle and it’s more than deserved for all at Tannadice.We don’t know what the top flight might look like come next season but the main objective has been achieved by Robbie – get United back in the big time.That’s been the target for four years now.It’s taken far longer than anyone associated with the club would have liked but they’ve finally done it.With all the noise going on over the past couple of weeks over the season, just having their top spot confirmed must be a huge weight off their shoulders.With the way the world is, relief will be the main feeling I’d bet for Robbie, Tony Asghar and Mark Ogren.They’ve done their bit – now it’s about improving the team for a shot at what is likely to be a bigger Premiership next campaign.Well done United!Having only seen the info that’s come out in the press, I’ve found Dundee United’s fall-out with a supporters’ group strange.It sounds like the money the Dundee United Supporters’ Foundation were looking to put into the club would be a benefit for everyone at Tannadice.There’s obviously been a disagreement behind the scenes but it doesn’t sit right with me having a go at your own fans – and on the day before the club were crowned champions, too.Jackie McNamara being up and about again was great to see last week. We were together in Scotland squads and he helped me a lot at that time. It’s fantastic to hear he’s on the mend again after a real health shock.🔵 In these troubled times, when many people are struggling to get out for their paper, we are pledging to help readers by providing a FREE digital edition of the Eveningfor three months.

Included in this is the Isle of Jura.This is as shockingly reckless as it is offensive.The Isle of Jura is not a #bolthole# as the Daily Mail has chosen to state but a very beautul island steeped in culture and rich history.On both Jura and Islay we, like so many rural areas, are struggling to deal with all of the challenges related to the Corona virus out break. Our local health services have very limited resources as it is, along side a population that has many elderly residents who are more at risk to the virus.We have seen a local uptick in people traveling to Islay in camper vans and this is happening at a time when the UK government is advising against non essential travel.Those who are choosing to travel to our islands of Islay, Jura and the many other islands in Argyll and Bute in order to avoid the coronavirus may end up inadvertently spreading it to islands who arenot as much affected in the same way as so many built up urban areas are. Such actions are as reckless as they are selfish and I would implore people who do not need to travel to our rural constituency to avoid doing so until this global pandemic has passed.Jura, Islay and the rest of Argyll are some of the most beautul places you will ever visit and you won#t find an area where the people are more hospitable and friendly but while this crisis is ongoing I would ask everyone who is not currently living here to avoid traveling here for the time being.Councillor Alastair Redman # Kintyre and Islands ward.To the Scottish public,During this time of unprecedented uncertainty, we are all concerned about the safety and wellbeing of our families, friends and colleagues.Our hearts go out to those who have been affected personally by the outbreak of coronavirus , as well as the many communities around the world that are facing extreme measures in an attempt to slow its spread.We appreciate and are mindful of the challenges iniduals are currently facing as well as the impact this pandemic has had on our vital emergency services as well as the grocery retail sector, supply chain and producers.Like our retail partners, we want to take this opportunity to assure you that Scottish farmers, auctioneers, hauliers, processors and butchers are doing everything they can to maintain the ongoing availability of fresh, locally sourced Scotch Beef PGI, Scotch Lamb PGI and Specially Selected Pork.We would like to thank all those who work in the Scottish red meat industry and their families for their ongoing and unwavering efforts to keep our supermarket shelves and butcher shops stocked, fuelling Scotland with top-quality red meat during this challenging time.As bodies supporting the Scottish agricultural and red meat industry, we are constantly reviewing the developing situation and are doing all we can to support everyone involved in putting nutritious food on your plates.Alan Clarke, chief executive, Quality Meat ScotlandMartin Morgan, executive manager, Scottish Association of Meat Wholesalers Duncan Todd, secretary, Scottish Beef Association Jen Craig, president, National Sheep Association Scotland Penny Montgomerie, chief executive, Scottish Association of Young Farmers Clubs and Gordon King, executive manager, Scottish Craft Butchers.What on earth is going on  It was banal enough when Ben Goldsmith # English financier and environmentalist # tweeted that #overgrazing# by upland sheep farmers, was responsible for the devastating floods in South Wales, rather than record-breaking torrential rainfall.Unbelievably we now have a government official, Dr Tim Leunig, suggesting the whole of the UK does not need farming, and his comparison of the UK to Singapore in this context is absolutely ludicrous. You truly have to wonderthere is something in the water that he is drinking – could it be flood contamination Surely, every person having a full and ing set of neurons and synapses, the complete opposite is the truth, as we dearly need our hard working farming community.The UK Government should be fully supporting the farming industry and indeed, good land management. The Welsh Assembly has totally lost its way with its mindless policy of devastating Welsh forests with thousands and thousands # an understatement # of trees being felled for wind farms, and compounding the felony by covering acres of land with very limited electricity generating solar parks # Wales is not the Sahara and the sun disappears at night! Solar  will generate about  per cent of their maximum capacity in the UK.Returning to farming perhaps some kind person should tell Dr Tim Leunig that the answer lies in the soil and then lead him to a darkened and quiet room so he can lie down and contemplate the truth # wise men recognise that truth is the daughter of time, not of authority.Dave Haskell, Cardigan."},{"url":null,"title":"the voyages of the fulmar part 10","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWhat a night! All of us were agreed that never had we experienced anywhere a worse one and we were glad we had been in Loch Aline on Sunday night not in Tobermory as intended as, from what we heard, that night had been similar but twice as bad.It was a wild night lashing with rain and a big swell was rolling in from the north-east causing us to pitch and roll horribly. Everything banged and rattled and the ropes, despite their lashings, slapped on the mast, the chain rugged continuously on the bobstay, and there was one most annoying thump that kept everyone awake .We could not trace its origin until in desperation the Pilot donned oilskins, sou’wester and seaboots, and went on deck and found it was the tiller end bumping on the bulwarks. The Pilot had a very justiable grouse about this as he had suggested lashing the tiller, but the Skipper had said that he did not think it necessary and that we would lie easierit was allowed to go free.About six we heard Murdoch in Venture hailing us and the Skipper and Pilot hurried on deck. The yachts in the harbour were all lying higgledy-piggledy owing to the swell, to there being little or not wind, to the strong surface current from the swollen river, and to it being about the turn of the tide.Venture and Fulmar were lying stern to stern and what had aroused Murdoch was that the Venture had got her mizzen boom over our main boom and as we pitched we had lted it up crutch and all – how nothing was broken was a miracle. She had then swung round and her now free boom had knocked the cap off our jackstay. As the Skipper came on deck Venture again surged towards us and started pitching and her counter came down with a terric slam not six inches from our bulwarks. We put our helm over and swung clear.Murdoch and Barclay were both in their dog-house and the Pilot and Skipper stayed in ours until the new tide took charge and the boats began to swing in normal fashion and all were able to retire once more to their bunks. Luckily the rain had cleared off shortly before this episode took place.At a quarter to eight we heard the usual poor forecast but for the first time since the cruise began there was not a gale warning for any area. The glass had risen well during the night. What wind there was was from the north-west.The Skipper went ashore for the milk and rolls. The dinghy had a lot of water in it and owing to the rolling it was impossible to get into it and balance on the thwarts till it was baled so the Skipper got his feet thoroughly soaked – the simple remedy of wearing seaboots had never occurred to him. Again the rolls were sold out and again he had to take porter biscuits.On board the Pilot lit the fire then started in to get our breakfast of bacon and egg. After our meal the sky cleared and it became a beautul sunny day, and everything we had was up on deck drying off or airing. The owner of Rose came alongside and for a good time tried to get us to persuade him to go north against his better judgement, but when we heard he had the lady member of his crew of three sick in her bunk our advice was that he go south and that immediately and reluctantly he was forced to agree and half an hour later he sailed. Hervor also went out about the same time and she turned north and we were to meet her later in Iona."},{"url":null,"title":"worldwide ceilidh community sign up for tunes in the hoose","story":"Fiona ScottUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsCapercaillie founder Martin MacLeod, originally from Oban, and his son, also Martin, have came up with an innovative way to connect musicians from all over the world and allow them to play together for the enjoyment of others.#Tunes in the Hoose# was inspired by Scottish musician, and family friend of the MacLeods, Peter Wood, who was posting videos of himself playing tunes in his home during self-isolation.Having saw the footage Martin senior, called his filmmaker son to askhe had the technology and know-how to put a video together of him playing along to Peter’s video.#I run my own production company based out of Glasgow, so it’s relatively straight forward work for me ,# said Martin Junior.#From that first successful attempt, our new idea was to create an online community for all Scottish musicians to help them connect and continue to play together during these uncertain times.#Housed in Facebook, Tunes in the Hoose amassed over  followers last week with ,+ views worldwide.

From his throne he dispensed news, advice and anecdotes – albeit not always historically accurate. His inimitable irony, perfectly-timed humour and the occasional reprimand to a wayward customer were all fuelled by a generous glass.As former president of the Scottish Licensed Trade Association and Keeper of the Quaich, Donald knew the intricacies of the business intimately from personal experience. His taste was eclectic and his appetite substantial, extending from Dom Perignon and Saint-Émilion Grand Cru to Tennent’s lager and Glen Dronach single malt. On a hot day he’d have an icy Martini or a gin and tonic, proportionately scaled up in a pint glass. Being askedhe had time for a quick ‘small one’, he would reply: #I’ll decide the size for myself,you don’t mind.#The records suggest that his frequent claim to be Scottish Slimmer of the Year, after getting his weight down from  stone to  stone, was fancul.Big D, as he was often called, was fastidious about standards in the little public bar, training his regulars to clear tables of empty glasses and plates promptly, and to keep the log fire stoked on winter evenings.If one of his regulars turned up untypically well-dressed, Donald would raise an eyebrow in mild surprise:  #What’s the occasion for the suit   A funeral   Your latest marriage   Or has your court case come up #In summer, an erratic stream of foreign tourists would have their first encounter with a Scottish pub, standing in the doorway bewildered as to what happens next – sit or stand  Fight their way to the mobbed bar or go to a table and wait for the non-existent waitress  Donald would call them over to his corner and was soon plying them with drinks, food and conversation, not infrequently paying the entire bill for his astonished guests.When a tourist asked him about the quaint red GPO telephone box in Church Square, he told them: #We have the fastest modern communications here – telephone, teletext and tell Donald.#Donald was a Francophile and loved his summers in Collioure, where #Le Grand Ecossais# was almost as well-known as in Argyll. A fixture of the local bars and restaurants, and frequently crossing the border to patronise Spanish hostelries, he revelled in the region’s seafood, wine and culture.His hobbies included cooking, opera, reading and lively conversation on a sweeping range of topics from local history to civil engineering. His knowledge was genuinely wide, but when occasionally encountering someone with a superior command of the topic in question, he would quickly change the subject and admonish: “Och, you’re showing off now.”Donald Clark was born on  July , in Rotten Row hospital, Glasgow. He was the youngest child of Donald Clark and Elizabeth Inglis, following by nine years his only sibling, Fiona.His early years were spent in Inveraray where family le revolved around his parents’ hotel in the little white-washed town.He was schooled at Inveraray Primary and Larchfield in Helensburgh, then Strathallan from  to  where he acquired his love of sports. Contrary to what his dimensions in later le would suggest, he was athletic when young, excelling at rugby and playing for his school and West of Scotland First XV and the old boys’ As.Donald also enjoyed curling, motor boating, snow skiing and water-skiing, where his party piece was to mono-ski down Loch Fyne while drinking a pint of beer.Although not a shinty player, he used his sports experience to coach the Inveraray team in the s and like his father chaired the club.

The burst of le and colour with the longevenings resurrects my mood, enlivens my nature-loving soul. It makes our days feel longer while also giving us the extra energy to enjoy them.How can we not be uplted by the sight of a tree in full blossom bathed in sparkling sunshine, or a carpet of wild flowers especially after months of winter when the land sleeps, and the sun seems to have forgotten us But these are not normal times of course and the ability to roam in nature and soak in its wonder has been temporarily restricted. In fact for many of us our normal le routine has been totally suspended.While we are in lockdown, nature is enjoying the opposite itrsquos flourishing with new le and beauty. And while itrsquos frustrating that we cannot venture out in ways we might be used to, I have been able to listen more closely to the stories that nature is telling on my doorstep.Over the last few years I have deliberately lsquore-wildedrsquo my small garden which I am so lucky to have. By that I mean I have allowed nature to do its thing, and nature has accepted the invitation. Elder, rowan, silver birch and cherry trees now enclose my wee patch of the world. Wild flowers such as dandelion and forget-me-nots have sprung up and last year I had foxglove, so Irsquom waiting to see what this summer will bring.A strange effect of all this has been the enlarging of my garden. Not literally, but in the power of its presence. Irsquove noticed how a space full of nature feels bigger than one thatrsquos bare, lsquoneatrsquo and manicured.I like to call it the forest horizon effect. Compare standing in the middle of a wide open treeless park with standing in the middle of a wood surrounded by trees and humming le. The area of the wood may be much smaller than the park, but its impact on our senses is much greater. We are embraced by nature, not just physically but also,we feel the connection, emotionally and spiritually. The space actually feels larger than it is because there is more in it.I am missing this embrace so much right now because of the inability to visit my favourite woods. But the lockdown has compelled me to spend more time in the natural world on my back doorstep.And within the embrace of my gardenrsquos re-wilded forest horizon, although only a space of around  metres by , I have discovered the truth contained in the wonderful book by Scott Sampson How to Raise a Wild Child.In his book, Scott states: ldquoWhen I began on this book, I had a certain sense of self-satisfaction, convinced that a letime of outdoor play, hiking and campinghellip had forged within me a deep bond with naturehellip Instead, I found that, like most of us, I was oblivious to most of the natural goings-on around me.He explains how he then spent time with his daughter absorbing the sounds and sights of nature on his doorstep, which fostered their lsquointernal wildnessrsquo more than any trip to a remote wilderness. They listened to birdsong and sat quietly as small creatures played out their lersquos dramas under the shadow of their house. ldquoWildness just outside the front door, Scott writes, ldquowas helping us deepen our bond with nature. Such interactions, I have come to realise, are essential to nature connection.Reading this has given new meaning to the confinement imposed by the lockdown. Never before have I had such time to simply sit and absorb the tiny goings on in the garden, embraced by my own mini forest horizon.A garden is a privilege, of course, and I understand many donrsquot have one. But wildness can also be found on our walk to the shops, on verges and public green spaces, with trees, bushes and wild flowers that grow in our urban spaces. The trick is to pause and absorb the wonder of it, listen and look for the wee miracles that we usually donrsquot notice and walk by. Itrsquos easier now, even on a normally busy street, with so much reduced traffic noise and absence of bustle.On my exercise walk yesterday I did just this and was overwhelmed by the beauty of renewed le. It occurred to me that this precious one-walk-a-day has intensied the connection it gives me to local nature.And never have I enjoyed the privilege of having a re-wilded garden so much. On Easter Monday I sat in it with my five-year-old son. His attention span can be short but I explained what we were doing and he stayed with me for  minutes. The first thing I noticed was the absence of normal background noise, which heightened the volume of naturersquos spring melody.Our garden attracts many birds which sit on the branches and sing their hearts out. I know they donrsquot sing for us, but my young son thought they were doing just that. In just  minutes we heard or saw coal tits, wrens, wood pigeons, willow warblers, magpies and a robin. Irsquod never have previously known what some of these birds were, but now we are in a mindset to get to know who is inhabiting our lsquodoorstep wildnessrsquo.We also watched a peacock butterfly explore our garden as it fluttered and paused in equal measure. The sound of bumblebees arrived and we saw them hover over the dandelions. Then a small honey bee made an entrance, likewise visiting the dandelions. As we sat quietly, the sound of honking above us raised our heads and we saw two V formations of geese heading north.When my boy got restless, I suggested we crawl like explorers in the grass to see what we could find.

But such drama happens all around us.

We are part of naturersquos story because we are part of nature.

This coming Friday, at .pm on the dot, around  fans from all over the world will be logging in to join a virtual tasting by one of the greatest bottlers of them all ndash Adelphi.If you know whisky, that one world will have made you stop and take notice. If you donrsquot let me explain. Adelphi is like the Linn of hi-fi, the Aston Martin of motoring, the Gleneagles of hotels ndash basically,you see anything with that name on a bottle, you know yoursquore in for a serious treat.So why does a company like this need to get involved in virtual tastings  Surely they donrsquot need the money, or the publicity  Connal Mackenzie, group sales manager with the company, says the reason theyrsquore doing it is much more basic than that.ldquoThis is the only way we can get out to the Adelphi people, he says. ldquoIf it wasnrsquot for this virus, wersquod be gearing up for festivals.ldquoWe were going to be launching a new whisky list anyway, and we usually try to fall in to some kind of festival to do that, get feedback them and pour some drams for people.ldquoWe wanted to bottle up some samples and get them to the people who are missing out on festivals around the UK and further afield. This was the ideal  to do that.Interest in everything that Adelphi produces is usually huge, and new bottlings usually sell out very quickly, so it came as no surprise to me when Mackenzie told me that when the event was publicised, the tasting packs ndash five new expressions that will be tasted during Fridayrsquos session ndash sold out within  hours, with interest from as far afield as Australia and America.Mackenzie will be conducting the tasting, alongside Alex Bruce, managing director of Adelphi, and Arthur Motley, of Royal Mile Whiskies, which sells Adelphi whisky and has worked closely with them on Fridayrsquos event.But he is at pains to stress that the tasting is no exclusive event. ldquoA total of  people will have a tasting pack ndash however, this is not just for those people. Yes, the tasting pack will be part of the discussion, but there will be plenty of people around the world who have bottles of Adelphi open ndash or any whisky for that matter ndash and we want them to join us.ldquoAlex, Arthur and myself will be just having a general chat about whisky ndash yes, the focus will be on our whiskies ndash but we want to invite anyone whorsquos a fan to open a bottle and join us.So, to the critical question ndash whatrsquos going to be on show  Irsquom speaking to Mackenzie by phone, but I can almost see the glint of excitement in his eyes. ldquoWersquore pretty pleased with this list ndash and we hope the people who join us will be too hellipSo here are the drams:bull Ardnamurchan   Year Old Single Cask .% not- this is a bottling from Adelphirsquos own distillery, and the first taste of the actual whisky ahead of an release hopefully later this year.bull The Glover  Year Old Batch  .% not- a special mix of Ardnamurchan and whisky from the legendary Chichibu Distillery in Japan.bull Linkwood   Year Old Single Cask .%bull Caol Ila   Year Old Single Cask .%And just for a special treat:bull Bas Armagnac   Year Old Armagnac Single Cask .%So, how can I get involved, I ask Connal. ldquoWell, he said, ldquoeven though all our tasting packs have sold out, donrsquot let that bother you.

Yet caring, sharing Jacinda Ardern has done exactly the same in New Zealand. No foreigners have been permitted to enter since the Antipodean country the lockdown.Nor is there any certainty that New Zealandrsquos borders are going to reopen any time soon. At the very least, future immigrants will have to put up with quarantine and long delaysthey are allowed into the country at all. Itrsquos a Brexiterrsquos wet dream.In Scotland, the Government is under pressure to explain why, as The Herald reported recently, , people have been allowed to enter the country apparently with barely any health checks at all. This seems to be a UK policy. Border controls are not devolved, and the UK Government seems to want to keep airports open for business.SNP MSPs and MPs are also talking about closing Scotlandrsquos border. MP Joanna Cherry has demanded, at the very least, rigorous health checks and quarantine at airports. Commentators, like our own Neil Mackay, are calling on Nicola Sturgeon to detach Scotland from the failing Westminster Government and introduce a rigorous independent policy of test, track and trace following Germanyrsquos lead.You only need to look at what is happening in Singapore to understand why voters are concerned about the UKrsquos laissez-faire approach to border security. This scrupulously tidy city state had been the poster child for Covid management. Thanks to its experience of SARS a decade ago it was well prepared.The lockdown was rapid and the country adopted mass testing and contact tracing from the start. By the beginning of April, Singapore seemed to be well on top of he disease. Then came the second wave.On Monday, Singapore recorded more than , new cases of Covid , its highest ever. The country of five million people now leads south-east Asia in the virulence of this disease.And who are they blaming  Well, the one million migrant workers, from countries like Bangladesh, who sweep the city streets and tend its butterfly gardens. The most virulent new outbreak is in their cramped dormitories.The Singapore authorities have quarantined thousands of migrant workers into what are to all intents and purposes Covid concentration camps. Eye witnesses report squalid conditions, rats and poor food.Now, New Zealand is one of the most liberal and open societies in the world. But it is going to allow migrants to enter the country freely any time soon  Is it going to allow the four million or so annual tourists  My daughter is one of them. Shersquos been in a Queenstown backpackers hostel under lockdown for the last month.The ethnic dimension to Covid is going to be a huge issue in the near future. Itrsquos already clear that BAME people are more prone to getting this disease. That may be genetic, or it may be to do with their social circumstances and over-crowding. But it means that, in authoritarian countries, they risk being singled out for epidemiological social cleansing.Covid is changing the world in dramatic and disturbing ways. We are seeing a big increase in economic nationalism. The European Union has been riven with tension over Germanyrsquos reluctance to share the Covid-related debts of Italy.Global companies are suffering billions in losses from the disruption of international trade and are repatriating supply chains. This re-shoring, as it is known, had already been happening before Covid, as wages have risen in China, making manufacturing there less attractive.Apple canrsquot market its new phones because of disruption to factories in China. It canrsquot rely on foreign sweatshop labour any more because the sweatshops are going to be transformed to combat the disease.But the pandemic has added yet another dimension to it. There is huge uncertainty about when andborders will relax. It is beginning to look aswe may have economic disruption until a vaccine is found, and even after that.This is why Mr Trumprsquos much-criticised travel ban makes a great deal of sense from his nationalistic, America First, politics. The Presidentrsquos Twitter rants seem arbitrary, contradictory, callous and unthinking. And they are. But they are also politically astute.The Democrats have got themselves into a mess by attacking Mr Trumprsquos border closures. They accused him of racism when he banned flights from the European Union back in February. And again today. But his voters only see him following the example of other countries.America is a vast country, with a erse economy providing most of what it needs from corn to cars. It could effectively shut the world out. Indeed, the US is arguably much better placed to do that than New Zealand because it can do without many of the imports other more open countries depend on.Here, SNP supporters argue that, since Scotlandrsquos death rate is currently running at around half of Englandrsquos, Ms Sturgeon should be following Jacinda Ardern and locking the border. There is immense frustration that Nicola Sturgeon appears to be dictated to by the UK Government.Health is devolved and the Scottish NHS could have pursued a dferent policy. However, as this column has repeatedly pointed out, the Scottish Government is following the same scientic advice as England. There is no evidence that Ms Sturgeon would have followed a dferent course had Scotland been independent.But social media is echoing to demands to lock foreigners out of Scotland for safetyrsquos sake. Ms Sturgeon is an internationalist and will never do that. But the resurgence of nationalism across the world is making borders ever more important to voters.

Within Scotland there are, after all, wide iations, for example National Records Scotland reports that, up till April  NHS Grampian, population ,, had  Covid- deaths, or  per million, and Greater Glasgow and Clyde, population .m, , or  per million, almost three times as many and nearer Londonrsquos  per million.Similar wide iations occur across the UK, so I can understand Nicola Sturgeon and the UK Government considering dfering approaches on lockdown and resourcing that are regional or situation based, but why Scotland vs rUK What astounds me is the attempts to blame it all on politicians, and UK politicians at that. Undoubtedly there have been screw-ups, but little is made of the Herculean efforts to build the Nightingale hospitals, including one in Glasgow that will probably not be needed, arguably because the politiciansrsquo, expertsrsquo and NHS strategies and efforts are working.On Channel  last night , Professor Dame Anne Glover, the Glasgow-based former scientic adviser to the EU, opined that experts had been advising on the basis that this was a flu epidemic, did not advise lockdown earlier than it was carried out, and did not strongly propose mass testing.Tellingly, she said it is the expertsrsquo job to advise the politicians, but that politicians do not always want to hear. But in the case of Boris Johnson and Nicola Sturgeon they have by and large been following a strategy based on their expertsrsquo advice.Who can imagine either leader attempting to force us into a lockdown that the estimable Jason Leitch, for example, said wasnrsquot yet required, and in the face of public and press outrage Allan Sutherland, Stonehaven.HAVING watched the excruciating performance of UK Heath Secretary Matt Hancock on Tuesday eveningrsquos Downing Street briefing, I feel that I must agree wholeheartedly with the views expressed in Neil Mackayrsquos article .Surely the present UK Cabinet must be one of the most incompetent on record. Despite the Tory Party being in government now for some  years it is utterly depressing that the leadership of the UK is so manestly weak. It is tragic that a time of such national crisis we look in vain for Government ministers who can at least give a much-better impression that they know what they are doing. Instead the last few weeks have been characterised by missed opportunities, strategic mistakes, confusion, a failure to learn from the experience of others and a chronic inability to be honest with the public. I would absolve the Scottish Government from this criticism. Of course there have been mistakes and problems, but at least they are being tackled with an honesty and transparency sadly lacking where.What a contrast with New Zealand. In todays edition you quote Helen Petousis-Harris, a vaccine expert at the University of Aucklandwho very succinctly summarises the misery being endured in the UK. ldquoThe countryhas managed to avoid the confusion and half-measures that had hampered the response in many other placeshellipNew Zealand got everything righthellipdecisive action, with strong leadership and very clear communications to everybody. What a contrast with Westminster.A glance at the membership of Boris Johnsonrsquos Cabinet helps explain why the UK is in such a dreadful situation with a shockingly high death rate. Mr Johnson has surrounded himself with a team of sycophantic young Brexiters with virtually no track record of successful ministerial responsibility. His vindictiveness on taking office has seen most of the Tories of experience and ability such as Jeremy Hunt, languishing on the back benches or, like Dominic Grieve, driven out of politics altogether. It is not decisive leadership on the part of the UK Government that is pulling us through. Rather it is the hard work, dedication and sacrices of the devoted members of our NHS together with all those others support and care workers who are doing their best at great risk to their safety and emotional well-being.Eric Melvin, Edinburgh EH.I WOULD have thought thatthe Tory Party had any real sense of duty to the British public it would have invited the experienced Theresa May back into power as acting PM while Boris Johnson is hors de combat. I doubt, however, she would accept, having been stabbed in the back by the very same people.The one good thing about the Covid- pandemic is that for the generation to come at least, the records of the time-line from the initial whistleblowing of Dr Li Wenliang until we find ourselves back to normality will be embedded in their psyche. We will not, I pray, have to require drills and exercises between pandemics, as next time we will be fully prepared. Wonrsquot we What will be the date we stop clapping frontline staff every Thursday evening  I understand that Mr Johnson likes to quote the ancient Greek historian Thucydides. He would be better referring to Bertolt Brecht, who said: ldquoUnhappy the land that is in need of heroes. Thank goodness we still have so many ordinary people who can become valiant and heroic. The ordinary people of the UK have shone while our leaders have proved wanting.It is, however, a lesson in preparedness that only  years after the signing of the Treaty of Versailles to formally end the ldquowar to end wars we were at war with Germany yet again. It is within the grasp of humanity to learn nothing.Questions have to be asked, therefore,the World Health Organisation has the power and capacity to effectively force the containment of another such viral outbreak to within its own zone  Perhaps there is the need for a newly-drafted international health treaty with robust penalties on all nations where they fail to act decisively and swtly.Bill Brown, Milngavie.Martin Redfern, Edinburgh EH.IT is clear that this country will be facing immense economic and social challenges throughout the years ahead. There is already a widespread recognition that much has to be done in order to restore public expenditure to a level appropriate for any enlightened country. For instance, no longer must those essential workers we celebrate each Thursday evening be refused decent levels of remuneration. No longer can we be indferent to the consequences of  years of austere Conservatism for those at the margins of society referred to by David J Crawford in his letter of  April.There needs to be a debate on the redistribution required to create a far less unequal society. That means that those of us who are in receipt of generous salaries and pensions must face up to the consequences for us of any such redistribution. This is not only a matter of sourcing the resources needed. It is a matter of demonstrating that we, the more fortunate, must admit that our relative prosperity is dficult to justy while child poverty, being one example among so many, is such a scandal.I quote the recent words of the Bishop of Kensington.

How come this pound million project was delivered safely while all other construction work in Scotland is on lockdown A lot of construction work can be achieved with simple social distancing measure Ts. so why is the Scottish Government not looking to give this industry the same advice and support issued by the UK Government his would be one industry that could start to support the Scottish economy immediately as well as many of the self employed who will not benefit from the UK Governments wages support schemes. The last thing the Scottish workforce needs now is further contraction of an already seriously diminished market.On whose advice is the First Minister basing her Governments guidance when the industry is operating normally everywhere  John McWilliams, Coatbridge.THERE appears to be growing unease in some countries about the part played by the Chinese government in allowing the initial spread of coronavirus.The US state of Missouri is suing the Chinese government for \"lying to the worldrsquorsquo and \"silencing whistle-blowers\". The Chinese Embassy in Australia has accused Aussie politicians of joining in US orchestrated anti-Chinese rhetoric.The last thing the world needs at the moment is a witch hunt and blame-pinning exercise, but anyone following events from the start would, I am sure, agree that the Chinese authorities have at the very least serious questions to answer.At the end of the present nightmare, a thorough investigation is needed and lessons learned.Alexander McKay, Edinburgh EH.News from trusted and credible sources is essential at all times, but especially now as the coronavirus pandemic impacts on all aspects of our lives.

Being ahead of everyone , what I can tell you is that being isolated from friends and family does have an impact on ones emotion wellbeing and mental health. I am becoming emotionally fatigued by it. I can also say that for the chief scientic and medical officers to continue to state such measures will continue into next year further compounds the dficulty.May I say, both UK and Scottish governments have to appreciate that it is totally unrealistic for the population to be asked to socially distance from family and friends for such an extended period. It is undoable. It would forever damage the fabric of what makes up community and society.I not only speak for myself, but many friends and family, who are abiding by the guidelines presently, are also voicing their view, a shared view that le is not worth livingthe one thing, social interaction is forbidden. My prediction is that community could possibly last a further few weeks, but then many, myself included, would break out and disobey the guidelines and the Scottish Government and even UK Government could do little against mass disobedience or it would risk civil unrest.The governments in the UK are democracies, not autocracies. The public must have a say in roadmapping what happens next and be given the opportunity to challenge or buy into it. It is our freedom that is being curtailed.Ian Johnstone, Connel, Argyll.THE best news to come out of France in recent weeks is the U-turn made by President Macron on his earlier decision to continue the confinement of the over-s after the restthe population was set free on May .In the wake of his earlier speech, pensioner spokespersons warned: \"The prolonged containment of elderly people will cause great physical and mental suffering, and almost certainly lead to a loss of the will to live.\"Mr Macron accepted this caveat, saying that \"the Swedish option will be available\" ndash that is, the final decision will be left to the inidual. How I wish we \"oldies\" were allowed such personal freedom by Holyrood and Westminster.Dr John Cameron, St Andrews.WITH veriable facts surrounding Covid- hard to come by, the only thing beyond dispute is that we are currently led by two of the most isive administrations in a generation who, for the last decade have fomented ision in society, in pursuit of their own ideological brands of nationalism: Brexit and Scottish independence. This fact makes it all the harder to give them credence, when in the midst of this crisis, they call for society to come together. They are lauded and decried in equal measure.The First Minister has, thankfully, kept the most ideological weirdos on her front bench away from the cameras, with only the Health Secretary getting a regular airing and even then, she mostly parrots whats just been said by the FM.Meanwhile, circumstances have dictated that the PM has had to rely on his Cabinet colleagues. The paucity of talent there has been obvious from Dominic Raab, who clearly baulks at being anything other than partisan, to the simply awful Gavin \"I was sacked by Theresa\" Williamson, they inspire no confidence whatsoever.That the politicians have let the scientists do the heavy lting so far, is another indisputable fact. One hopes that they have done this in order that they can bring their vast political experience to bear on how we turn the economy around  Here, we have to rely on their past record to give us hope that they can.But lets look at that record:  years of Tory LibDem, then Tory again, politically-driven austerity a nine-year SNP council tax freeze, again politically driven, to woo middle-class voters to the independence cause, which saw council budgets and services slashed, and the third sector left to pick up the slack. If there is hope in this mediocre bunch, I simply cannot see it.May you live in interesting times, someone once said. We certainly are at the moment. The other indisputable fact is that it will be our children and, to use the hoary old quote, our childrens children, who will be left to pay off the eye-watering debt that the pandemic has caused. Other than that, very little is certain at the moment.Stuart Brennan, Glasgow G.IT is true, as the Chief Medical Officer of England said, explaining why there is no Covid- testing of passengers at UK airports, that a person can be tested there, show no symptons of Covid-, but develop signs a day or two later in the wider community. It is also true that border control is not a Scottish Government competence, so it can only ask for review of UK policy . But once passengers pass passport control and customs, they come within the Scottish Governments competence and can be tested before being allowed to leave the airport, or placed in quarantine.The CMO of Public Health England may be correct about one passenger, but surely not of all coming off an aircraft, and it is most unlikely to be true in respect of every one of the , coming into Scotland on a weekly basis. We dont need a review of UK policy to institute testing at Scottish airports, and it would seem wise for the Scottish Government to exercise its powers to do so.Jim Sillars, Edinburgh EH.YOUR front page todayhighlights the problem of deaths other than from coronavirus. I know from the way I feel that we will avoid going to the doctor or hospital in case we get infected. But I also think that a big part of the problem is Boris Johnsons slogan \"Protect the NHS\". The NHS is there to protect us. The deaths in care homes are a disgrace and it would seem likely that some of the deaths would not have happenedthe patients had been transferred to hospital and given the best care.Jim McAdam, Maidens.WE are constantly hearing about challenges in procuring personal protection equipment and have heard recent reports of PPE being delivered to the UK from countries such as China, Turkey, and Myanmar. Why on earth arenrsquot we producing more of this vital equipment in the UK I was in a care home this week and was kitted out on arrival with the most basic face mask and gloves, and the flimsiest gown I could ever imagine. If a motor car business can adapt to making ventilators how canrsquot some of our textile and industrial clothing companies not adapt to making these vital items  We have better quality aprons and household gloves in our kitchen than I wore the other day. Surely to goodness some UK companies must be able to produce PPE to the specication required by our health protection agencies.Brian Watt, Edinburgh EH.AFTER Covid- has subsided we must tackle inequality by making sure the wealthy pay their fair share of taxes and clamp down on offshore investments, trust funds and the use of tax havens by companies and iniduals.However, the signs are not encouraging when Dominic Raab dismissed Ian Blackfordrsquos call at PMQs for a Universal Basic Income , and more so when the new Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer aligned himself with the Tories and the DUP by failing to sign the cross-party petition, which included many Labour MPs, calling on the Chancellor to introduce a Recovery Universal Basic Income in response to the coronavirus crisis.Last week Reform Scotland published a briefing paper ldquoOne For All: The Case for a Basic Income Guarantee proposing that every citizen, regardless of income, gender or employment status, received a set amount of money, free of tax, but in place of personal allowances, tax credits and a number of other benefits which would ensure no one would slip through the complex net of DWP bureaucracy. Reform Scotland suggests it is set at pound, per year for adults plus pound, per year for children.Fraser Grant, Edinburgh EH.FURTHER to the Issue of the Day article on contact tracing apps , it will be easy to undermine this initiativeconcerned about Big Brother: either leave the phone at home when you go out or alternatively switch it off. The Government should focus on testing rather than spending money on app development.Bill Eadie, Gfnock.THE excellent anti-virus measures currently undertaken by supermarkets could be negated by customers who bring their own multi-use plastic bags on to their premises.These bags are often dirty, and could easily be infected.The answer would be for supermarkets to ban customers own bags, and issue single-use paper bags at the checkout. These could then be burnt after one journey.Malcolm Parkin, Kinnesswood.IN view of the large number of FTSE companies either reducing, or withdrawing their idend payments understandably due to the impact of Covid-, may I presume that Chairmen, CEOs, and Board Members of said Companies will also be withdrawing their bonuses, and taking reductions in theirsalaries Lesley Mackiggan, Glasgow G.News from trusted and credible sources is essential at all times, but especially now as the coronavirus pandemic impacts on all aspects of our lives.

Slightly awkward, standing with my cousin Noreen on my first trip away from home, I glistened and gleamed with shiny black hair and bright red lips. We went out in London, to a club and I remember feeling lsquoseenrsquo for the first time. It was like the much over-used shot in films where the camera moves through groups of people in a club. The little glances, and smiles from those we passed, people half-stepping out of our way to let us through, striking up interesting conversations with people we met for the first time. The attention was intoxicating and addictive. I confess, I loved being seen.Fast forward  years later, when I found myself in a club in Glasgow on an impromptu works night out. Two well-toned young men are sitting opposite me and my friend, every so often their gaze straying towards the dance floor. There are lithe girls in heels and bits of string, cleverly gyrating and somehow keeping the strings in place, blaring Latin American music that causes a disturbance in my right eardrum and strobe lighting that plays havoc with my ocals.Instinctively, I bend over, almost hitting my head off the table and scream, fishwe-like, above the music: ldquoThere you go boys. Is that better  Can you see now Seeing the Me at  posts inevitably makes us compare then and now, and for me came the realisation that in the space of  years Irsquod gone from being seen and enjoying being seen, to being invisible and I wondered how and why this happened and how I feel about that.Discussing this phenomenon with friends, Irsquove discovered Irsquom not alone. One -year-old fumes indignantly about being jostled in queues, cut up on pavements and ordered-over at bars by people standing behind her. ldquoItrsquos as , with my youth going, Irsquom not relevant or important, and thatrsquos quite hurtful. At parties or social gatherings she feels her voice isnrsquot heard and her opinions donrsquot matter. Talking to her puzzled me. With her sharp mind, great wit and an attractiveness I have always admired, she was the last person I would have thought of as invisible.Another friend, a comedian, has an explanation. She thinks we might be projecting how we are feeling about ourselves as we age. For her, it is more about how we, as women, were conditioned aged  to see our value. ldquoMy whole self-worth, when I was young, was based on how people, but mostly men, saw me. If they complimented me I valued myself. Now Irsquom older I donrsquot get the compliments so much, but whereas on the one hand you can lose your self-worth because of that, or like me, you can change the yardstick.In the intervening  years shersquod come to use a dferent yard stick, and maybe for some of us, we havenrsquot quite got there yet.But itrsquos more than that, I think. I have sat at the dinner table with my teenage sons and felt invisible. The way they jabber away excitedly about online strategy games or bits of new tech to one another, reminds me of Wendy Craigrsquos character Ria in s sitcom Butterflies ndash happy to see her boys cheerful and animated but ostensibly a ghost in her own home. And, asfulfilling the prophecy, we are encouraged to cut our hair short, wear more neutral tones , and tone down our make-up. I call it ldquoInvisibility Chic and it should really be resisted at all costs.Having said all that, therersquos a lot to be said for invisibility too. In the age of the selfie, Instagram and now, of course, video calls via Zoom, being lsquoseenrsquo, is  hours of being camera ready, with all the insecurities that can bring and the endless stream of looks-related comments on the social media feed from all corners of the globe.Uzma Mir: Are we all playing happy families during lockdown  No  Me neither...Being lsquoseenrsquo is being seen through the lens of a skin-tone softening, teeth-whitening filter that, once removed, leaves a sense of intense disappointment, and gut-wrenching fear of what people might be thinking or saying about the unfiltered material.Invisibility brings with it that sweet liberation of knowing that the worldrsquos gaze is averted where leaving us the power to just be our authentic selves, and to be comfortable with that.

Taking the best from history and finding a way to interpret it thatrsquos interesting or unexpected.All their spirits are made by hand in small batches of less than  bottles, with a direct-fired copper pot still, and aged on-site.Since launching in , they have released three distinctive gins starting with their London Dry. Believing that classics shouldnrsquot be messed with, they have stayed true to style by creating a punchy juniper-led spirit, easing into warming spices on the palate and a bone-dry finish.This was followed by their New Tom - a modern take on the ldquoOld Tom style favoured by Illicit distillers prior to London Dry. New Tom is sweeter in character: distilled with pink peppercorns, rosehips, and tonka beans, and sweetened post-distillation with bee pollen and honey.Finally, in late , Blacklist gin was released. Setting out to create a gin with the rich smouldering character of some of their favourite whiskies - bringing together Scotlands two great spirits - they smoked juniper berries over Scottish peat to impart a deep smoky flavour to the spirit.Complimented by the addition of black cardamom, lapsang souchong tea, black peppercorns, and finally infused with activated charcoal to anchor and enhance the flavour, the result is an unconventional gin - jet black in colour - and with a heady undercurrent of smouldering peat and warming spices.All three products are currently available to via their websitewith free UK delivery during the lockdown period.See illicitspirits shop------------------------------------------------------NUDIE SNACKSNudie Snacks are a local based healthy Snacking Company headquartered in Ayrshire.

The event was to raise money for the NHS and social care charities. The composer,he can be so described, is the man who flew from New York in  just to vote in the Lords in support of a bill to cut tax credits to the working poor. He was also caught up in a tax avoidance controversy, as was the man who sang the first few lines, Gary Barlow who, along with two other members of Take That and their manager, had to pay back pound million to HMRC. A sick bag is called for.Or, as Clement Attlee, the Prime Minister who introduced the NHS put it, ldquoCharity is a cold, grey loveless thing. If a rich man wants to help the poor he should pay his taxes gladly, not dole out money at a whim.You donrsquot need a weatherman hellipAs far as I know there is no brass plaque on the wall of the Millennium Hotel in Glasgowrsquos George Square to record the first visit to this country of a Nobel prizewinner and solid platinum legend called Robert Allen Zimmerman. If the ledger of that visit still remains, with his signature and room number, it would fetch hundreds of thousands of pounds at auction.It was in the early afternoon of May , , that he checked into what was then the North British Hotel, in the days when British Rail was not only nationalised but ran hotels as well as a huge property empire. He, like the hotel now, had adopted a dferent name, Bob Dylan. He spent one night there with his band, The Band, then called The Hawks.This tour was to become historic, notorious for the barracking he received. In the second half, just as he was to do in the Odeon in Renfield Street that night, Dylan would strap on a Fender Stratocaster and, with The Hawks, blast out a set of his new electric songs.The night before, at the Manchester Free Trade Hall, someone had screamed ldquoJudas at him. He replied ldquoI dont believe you!....Youre a liar, before telling the band to turn up the volume and cascading into Like A Rolling Stone.So he probably wasnrsquot looking forward to that nightrsquos show at the Odeon . From being the darling of the folk purists -year-old Dylan had become an object of pure hatred and the heckling had become part of the spectacle on the tour. Glasgows Young Socialists even dragooned as many members as they could to go along and boo, but they were overwhelmed and largely drowned out by the positive response.There were some walkouts and chants, perhaps organised by the YS, of ldquoWe want Dylan, to which he replied, ldquoDylan got sick backstage. Im here to take his place.On YouTube therersquos footage of Dylan with Robbie Robertson from The Hawks in the NB Hotel bedroom jamming a -bar blues called What Kind Of Friend Is This. Therersquos even a brief cutaway to the Odeon sign.That bedroom was the scene of a sadly typical Glasgow event. A waiter arrived at the door bringing food and suddenly screamed, ldquoF*** him at Dylan, accusing him of being ldquoa f***ing traitor to folk music.Dylans driver-bodyguard Tom Keylock quickly huckled the man out of the room. He recalled: ldquoHe pulls a kne on me. Ive still got the scar to prove it. So I gave him a good kicking. The bands tour bus was also tanned, with recording and hi-fi equipment stolen.Next day, prior to travelling to Edinburgh and the ABC, Dylan was in a good mood. Therersquos an outtake from an unreleased documentary, Eat The Document, by the \"Dylanologist\" DA Pennebaker, where Dylan watches police dog handlers in George Square with pipes skirling off-camera, probably from a police band. As as he gets into the car to leave Glasgow a crowd of kids surround him waving autograph books . He asks themthey were at the gig the night before andthey had booed. They vigorously deny it. ldquoI want the names of all the people who booed, he jokes before driving off.Headline of the weekSurely  lsquoScots sex offender in coronavirus prison rooftop protest lured down with pack of super noodlesrsquo.

We will only be able to make progress here on the basis of the reality that the UK will have the right to control access to its waters at the end of this year.SNP MPs have urged the government to extend the transition period, saying it is the ldquoonly responsible option.Alyn Smith, Shadow Foreign Secretary, said:It would be unthinkable for the Tory government to hammer the economy with a hard Brexit at a time when it will need all the help it can get to protect jobs, businesses and living standards.ldquoTory ministers must cast aside the Brexit dogma, take their responsibilities seriously, and agree an extension of the maximum two years on offer, so we can get to the other side of this emergency.ldquoSecuring an extension is the only responsible option. Crashing out of the EU with a bad deal or no deal this year would be the final blow for many businesses that are already struggling to survive - and it would leave people even poorer and worse off at a time of greatest need."},{"url":null,"title":"no-need-scottish-government-take-different-stance-says-chief-medical-officer","story":"According to the interim Chief Medical OfficerGregor Smith, there is no need for the Scottish Government to take a dferent approach to that of England, Wales and Northern Ireland unless the outbreak pattern dfers greatly than where.His comments to the Westminster science and technology committee yesterday come after Nicola Sturgeon published a -page framework document which sets out how Scotland could lt lockdown measures.Stressing it was a high-level plan, the First Minister acknowledged that lting the lockdown was not ldquolike the flick of a switch and said ldquoato normal as we knew it is not on the cards in the near future.:Coronavirus: Nicola Sturgeon: Lockdown exit will be more challenging for police enforcementHowever it prompted calls for UK health secretary Matt Hancock to publish a similar document showing what measures may be taken to lt the lockdown where, while he insisted the Scottish Government plan was the same as his own five measures set out two weeks ago.Speaking to the committee by video yesterday afternoon Mr Smith and the CMOs from Wales and Northern Ireland were asked by SNP MP Pete Wishart whether they should follow an independent route out of lockdown.The MP said: ldquoAs we start to think about coming out of lockdown, surely it would be practical for the four nations to determine their own approach to that given that each nation is in a dferent place on the curve and there is a disparity in the severity across all the nations of the United Kingdom.Mr Smith replied that ldquothe science is the science no matter which part of the United Kingdom yoursquore in. ldquoHe said that it was important to maintain a consistent message across the country, so people did not become confused.:Former Watchdog presenter Lynn Faulds Wood dies at The CMO added: ldquoThere will be dferent stages to the epidemic in the UK but there is a value in making sure the messaging to the public [is consistent], so the measures are applied with consistency, and we see the right level of compliance form the public.ldquoOnce you start to develop a mixed message there is always a risk that people will misunderstand the message, and wont know in one part of the country what they are supposed to do compared to another.Mr Smith explained that it is possible to take a dferent approach, but said ldquoWe should just be very confident that it is the right thing to do at that point in time.He said there had been a few times where Scotland had taken ldquoa nuanced approach, such as cancelling large gatherings before the rest of the UK, and said: ldquoIf that applies on the way in to the measures, it equally applies to the way out of the measures, however I would emphasise again there would need to be very good reason to make sure that was absolutely necessary.ldquoThe dferences might be that the stage of the epidemic was so wildly dferent in Scotland than in the rest of the country that there was a need to take a dferent approach, or the alternative is the approach taken in other parts of the UK was so dferent that it wouldnrsquot be right for Scotland. then we would apply the scientic evidence through the Scottish context, so we can give the right advice to our ministers.It also emerged at the committee that the devolved administrationsrsquo CMOs were not consulted before Westminster announced the roll out of an online portal to expand testing for key workers on Thursday night.The UK Governmentrsquos website for tests was overwhelmed during its first two minutes of operation yesterday when all  home testing kits were ordered by eager members of the public.The authorities later apologised after the site stopped taking bookings due to the unprecedented demand.When Welsh CMO Dr Frank Atherton was asked by an MP whether the decision to launch the online portal was something which was ldquorun past him, he responded that while the four CMOs had been working well together and sharing information, some issues remained with administrations working together.He explained: ldquoI think we should distinguish between the sharing of science and understanding, and the sharing of policy.:New Holyrood laws to make stirring up racist and homophobic hate a crimeldquoSome of the areas like that portal were really not discussed in detail across the four nations.There have been occasions where we would have liked it a little earlier notication of some of the practical details.Meanwhile, committee members quizzed English CMO Chris Whitty on why minutes from the governmentrsquos scientic advisory group for emergencieshad not been published for more than a month, and why membership of the group was being kept secret.Committee chairman Greg Clark MP said it would boost confidence to know who was in Sage and what evidence they were using, ldquoin keeping with the tradition of science of robust scrutiny and openness.Mr Clark suggested a similar model to the Scottish Governmentrsquos scientic advisory group, which publishes its minutes and membership details, would be welcome.Professor Whitty said he agreed ldquo in principle that the details should be made public, but added: ldquoWe were given quite clear advice from the Centre for the Protection of National Infrastructure basically based on the fact that Sage e is a sub-committee of Cobra and meets under a range of circumstances, some of which are very security-related, this is not...The idea that itrsquos secret I think is rather strong. I suspect most members are actually known one way or another and all of the sub-committees are extremely open.Last night Transport Secretary Grant Shapps announced a funding boost for transport including poundm for ferries, including routes between Scotland and Northern Ireland.He also gave the green light to trialling the use of drones to transport medical supplies."},{"url":null,"title":"common-cranes-emerging-extinction","story":"But, by the s, the common crane had disappeared entirely from the UK as hunting and the drainage of wetlands drove it to extinction.Now ornithologists are celebrating after  pairs were recorded last year ndash a new record high.The total population is believed to be more than  birds, with Aberdeenshire firmly established as a key stronghold.Meanwhile, in another boost for wildle lovers, a landmark international study suggests terrestrial insect numbers in the UK have broadly held up despite a global slump.Welcoming the cranersquos resurgence, Hywel Maggs, a senior conservation officer for RSPB Scotland, said recent sightings were ldquoreally exciting and a sign the slender-necked animals could have a bright future.North of the Border, they were first recorded ing to breed in , with Aberdeenshire becoming their home after an absence of around four centuries.Since then, the area has hosted Scotlandrsquos only breeding cranes.Two pairs have successfully raised nine chicks and it is thought some of these are pairing up with others to add to the population.Eleven were also seen together last August, a record breaking tally for the area that sparked huge excitement among bird-watchers and conservationists.Positive signs have continued to emerge this year. In February, common cranes were recorded at potential breeding sites, with pairs also ing to the most established nesting grounds in March.Today, around one in  UK cranes are thought to be living in Scotland.South of the Border they are breeding in Norfolk, Suffolk, Cambridgeshire and Yorkshire, as well as Somerset, Wiltshire, Oxfordshire and Gloucestershire.Wildle officers said they were hopeful of a further expansion in numbersbut stressed this would depend on the availability of safe nesting sites.ldquoItrsquos really exciting that early sightings this year suggest cranes may have occupied three new nesting sites in addition to the three establishedsites that are occupied most years, said Mr Maggs.ldquoThe increase in the number of birds we are seeing for long spells in the summer also suggests we could be on the cusp of a signicant population expansion.ldquoHowever, for this expansion to be sustained, we need to ensure there are places for the new pairs to nest safely.ldquoMany of the potential nest sites such as peatlands and other wetlands are threatened by drainage and disturbance.The increase in Britainrsquos crane population comes as hope grows for much smaller members of the animal kingdom.A major new study, led byRoel van Klink, of the German Centre for Integrative Bioersity Researchin Leipzig, indicates terrestrial insect numbers here have remained more or less stable even though theydropped by nearly one per cent per year globally during recent decades. The research incorporated more than  longer term surveys from almost , sites and found that, while freshwater species had fared better overall, there were alarming species declines in places such as Germany and Americarsquos mid-west.Maria Dornelas, from the Centre for Biological Diversity at the University of St Andrews, said the analysis provided a ldquohopeful message.ldquoThe figures for terrestrial insects are not showing a decline for the UK, or only a very marginal one, she said.ldquoThis could be due to a number of factors. In the UK there are perhaps more mixed agricultural practices, and types of agricultural practices ndash for example, in agricultural farming ndash that are beneficial and are not allowing such dramatic declines here as you have perhaps had in other places.ldquoIn places where you have very intensive use of agricultural pesticides, for example, you have these much more dramatic declines. [The data is] telling us itrsquos not all doom and gloom, and that some of the things people are doing in the UK are not harming insects.She stressed more data was needed, adding: ldquoWe need a lot more to really understand whatrsquos happening in particular places and at particular times."},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"April ,  at : pmPolice are appealing for information after two large sections of pipe were removed without authority from the Orkney Islands Councilyard on Shapinsay.

However, he urged the Justice Secretary to reflect on what was happening in England and Wales, where court services were making use of telephone, video and other technology to allow remote hearings and procedural business to take place.Kirkwall Sherf Court has been closed due to the coronavirus crisis, with emergency business transferred to a ‘hub’ in Inverness. However, concerns have been raised about the impact of this transfer, as well as obstacles in the way of securing new ship orders and Powers of Attorney.The Justice Secretary acknowledged these concerns, and offered to pursue the issue with the Scottish Courts and Tribunals Service.Mr McArthur said: “Nothing is ‘business as usual’ at the moment, and the well-being of court staff and the wider public has to be the number one priority.  However, there are many aspects of civil court business that we cannot afford to put on pause.“Over recent weeks, I have been contacted by local solicitors in Orkney, extremely concerned at the dficulties they have faced in getting urgent business completed.  Delays in getting a new ship Orders or Powers of Attorney in place, for example, can have serious consequences. Vulnerable people rely on effective and timely court processes that make sure their rights are properly safeguarded.“In England and Wales we are seeing technology being used to enable more court business to be undertaken. There is no reason why a similar approach cannot be adopted in Scotland.  Indeed, Sherf Courts already conduct procedural hearings by tele-conferencing.“The justice secretary insists that progress is being made, but has offered to take up these concerns with the Scottish Court and Tribunals Service. I welcome that assurance and hope it will allow access to justice for more people in Orkney, and where in Scotland, who need it.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The yoga postures we’ll be doing in the sessions bring some easy, relaxing movements for the body. Mindfulness allows us to be in the present moment rather than worrying about the past or future which can make it easier to accept change and to make the adjustments necessary to feel well.”Angela Mitchell, national director of Diabetes Scotland, said: “We are proud to have over  local groups serving communities across Scotland. Of course, not everyone can attend a group, especially now when we’re advised against all but essential trips out of our homes.“We had already planned to introduce digital peer support groups this year but due to social distancing measures we brought our launch forward.  Many people at home are feeling isolated and,you’re also managing a long-term condition like diabetes, it can be even more challenging. We want to support people with diabetes in any way that we can at this time. As well as online peer support groups, yoga and mindfulness, we also have a helpline, online forum and the Diabetes Scotland team can be reached as we continue to work from home.”Groups meet in private sessions over Zoom. Peer support group times are still flexible while a schedule is created to meet demand. Mindfulness and yoga will run on Wednesdays at pm and Fridays at pm for the next four weeks.Anyone who is interested in joining either peer support or mindfulness and yoga should email scotland@diabetes.org.uk to be invited to a group and given instructions on how to access Zoom .Guidance regarding diabetes and coronavirus can be found at www.diabetes.org.uk coronavirus or by calling the Diabetes Scotland helpline on    or emailing helpline@diabetes.org.ukcopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This might included certain businesses being allowed to reopen where customers can safely stay at a two metre distance, and the reformatting of classrooms before pupils canto schools.The First Minister has advised that restrictions are likely to continue in some form for at least the rest of this year, and possibly beyond that.She added that the Scottish Government would be relying on the latest data to inform it of what the best approach for Scotland will be and explained that work to expand the nations testing capacity was ongoing. When asked about whether certain regions of Scotland might undergo a more localised approach, the First Minister said she wasn#t ruling out anything that might help us deal with the virus.#Today I am seeking to start a grown up conversation with the public about the complex decisions that lie ahead of us as we look beyond lockdown,# she said.“As we have done all along, we will seek to inform the public with the best scientic advice possible, but the science will never be exact and we are in uncharted territory so we also need to make careful judgements and be prepared to adapt and change course as we go.“We want to ease restrictions, but we cannot rule out having to reapply them should the virus run out of control.#Nicola Sturgeon said she and her colleagues would be relying on the latest data to inform them of what the best approach for Scotland will be and explained that work to expand the nations testing capacity was ongoing.“Every day we see evidence that this virus causes real harm, but so too do the lockdown measures we are taking to contain it,# she continued.#This is causing harm to the economy and living standards, to children’s education and to mental health and wellbeing.“That is why we need to try to find a better balance than the one we have now, but as we do so we cannot take our eye off the need to suppress the virus and minimise the damage it does.“It is only when we are sure the virus is under control that we can even start to ease any of the restrictions because the virus will not have gone away.#Nicola Sturgeon has advised everyone to take part in the conversation about how we might leave lockdown.

Until late last year, a suitable vessel proved dficult to source, said the council.It then became known that the Nordic Sea, which operated on a number of passenger routes in the far north of Norway, had become available.Following visits and sea trials involving Orkney Marine Services and Orkney Ferries staff, the vessel was considered as a suitable replacement for the Golden Mariana.As the Nordic Sea was operating under a Norwegian Passenger Certicate, it was known that a number of requirements would have to be met before she was considered ready for a UK passenger certicate.With surveys now completed and a works list developed, the decision to complete the purchase was made and the vessel departed Bergen for Orkney yesterday morning, Thursday.On arrival, the vessel was handed over to Orkney Islands Council, but due to Covid- restrictions and the need for some works to be carried out to bring her up to the full UK Classication and Certication, it will be a while yet before the residents of Papa Westray are able to benefit from their new passenger ferry.The purchase of the new vessel was part funded by the Scottish Government and Transport Scotland.More details in The Orcadian Marine Scene section next week.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This means the door can be locked while the toilet is in use to ensure privacy and social distancing from anyone  waiting to use the facility.Hayley Green, OIC head of IT and facilities, said: “We have received messages from key workers askingsome toilets could be re-opened on routes they travel while at work.#So, we have come up with a solution which takes account of the guidance around social distancing to combat the spread of COVID- and provide these key workers with the facilities they require.”The toilets will be stocked with hand soap and toilet roll and will receive a daily clean.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

For urban wildle, which includes mammals and birds living alongside people in towns, this will affect levels of disturbance from humans and food availability.In recent weeks there have already been reports of animals adapting to the reduced human activity including Kashmiri goats roaming around Llandudno, North Wales, troops of monkeys in Singapore, wild boars in cities across Europe and Coyotes wandering streets during daylight hours in the US.Lead researcher Professor Dawn Scott, an expert in Mammal Ecology and Conservation, will use this unprecedented time to try to collect information and answer the study’s overarching question # How have urban animals responded to changes in human activity during the COVID- lockdown The research will collect records on any observations of unusual animal behaviour during the lockdown, determine the effects of reduction in human activity in city and town centres on urban wildle, and the effects increased human activity in gardens and outdoors space is having. The data from the survey will then be combined with other data from media searches to produce a report on the response of urban animals to lockdown across the globe.Professor Scott, head of the School of Le Sciences at Keele University, said: “Urban animals have been able to adapt to our landscape and live alongside towns, cities and suburbs so we know they are already highly adaptable. This flexibility in behaviour means they can usually quickly respond to changing conditions, including the absence of humans, which is happening during the lockdown.“Across the world we have seen reports of animals roaming cities and in locations that they wouldn’t normally be seen during the day. Social isolation is an opportunity for many to learn more about nature and how we can support it. We’re asking people to take part in our study and help us discover how urban animals are responding due to our change in behaviour.”To find out more and take part in the study visit: www.keele.ac.uk wildlestudycopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Considering his past record as a caring inidual, including his efforts to help the homeless, that was not really surprising.But apart from manager Daniel Stendl, who waived his salary, others at the Edinburgh club appeared reluctant to follow Naismith’s example. Reports later suggested that no other Hearts player would be asked to take more than a  per cent reduction.Also last week it was claimed that Scotland manager Steve Clarke had accepted a  per cent cut, simply meaning his salary would go down from £, to £,.In England the men’s and women’s international bosses Gareth Southgate and Phil Neville apparently agreed to take  per cent less. In the former’s case he would still be pocketing £. million while Neville would get £,.At club level south of the border the situation is very inconsistent. Some managers, such as David Moyes, Eddie Howe and Graham Potter have volunteered to take a cut while Pep Guardiola donated a million euros to help fight the outbreak in Spain. There was a terrible poignancy to Guardiola’s generosity a few days later when it was reported that his -year-old mother had died as a result of the virus in Barcelona.But while most Premiership clubs have placed most non-playing staff on some kind of temporary leave, some receiving  per cent of their salary through the government’s job retention scheme, the situation with the majority of players is still unclear.This is a dficult situation and UK health minister Matt Hancock ruffled some feathers when he suggested that well-off footballers should consider doing more to help.Some journalists have even criticised Hancock, saying he was completely out of touch with what was actually happening. That was unfair. The minister was not speaking about the game in general, where players at lower-level clubs are paid a pittance compared with those at the top. He was merely highlighting the fact that many could easily survive with no pay at all for the foreseeable future.To put this in perspective, most players at Premiership level are earning several million a year, an increase of roughly two and a half times what they took home six years ago. A high proportion are on more than £, a week.At the top of the tree are Manchester United goalkeeper David De Gea and Man City midfielder Kevin De Bruyne, who are on over £ million and £ million respectively.Even a player I confess to never having heard of, Tanguy Ndombele of Tottenham Hotspur, is reportedly bagging £. million a year.In the Championship the average annual pay is considerably less, around £, a year or £, a week. And in the lower League Two it drops to £ or £ weekly, not all that much above the national average.During the current situation all these figures need to be taken into consideration. We should have no issue with lower-paid players still getting  per cent of their wages for doing nothing. They, like everyone , still have bills to pay.But for the multi-millionaires to grumble about being hit is about as hard to take as the coronavirus pandemic itself.: : : : : : : :No decision has yet been made about whether the football leagues in the UK will be completed, whenever the action begins again.In Scotland it has been proposed in some quarters that the title should just be handed to Celtic, as the Glasgow side had an almost unassailable lead when play stopped.Now a director of the other half of the Old Firm has suggested thatthat happened, their rivals would only be able to claim “eight and a half” in a rowthey were crowned champions.Personally I feel that this season’s scheduled fixtures should be played out, however long it takes. Only then should the - action start, evenit means a shortened campaign.: : : : : : : :There are currently eight premier ision football clubs in Shetland, all of which have been in existence for dferent s of time.Scalloway are the oldest, dating back to , with Lerwick sides Celtic and Thistle being able to trace their beginnings back to the early part of the th century.Spurs and Ness United both emerged during the s, with Whitedale, Whalsay and Delting joining the senior league more recently.Someone suggested to me that a best XI from each could be selected, to give players and supporters something to ponder over during the current period of uncertainty.There will no doubt be controversy over this, but that’s what opinion is all about. If anyone would like to submit their thoughts, or their own ideas of what their respective best sides would be, feel free to send them in.Next time I will give you the line-ups, in alphabetical order, from the past  years.

It is expected to be pressed into service as soon as possible.Health board chairman said demand for testing on the Scottish mainland had seen tests take up to five days for processing.But having the kit on-island, he said, would see results turned round in a matter of hours.Mr Robinson said he recognised there had been a #hiatus# after initial testing coronavirus had stopped.#We recognised in NHS Shetland that capacity for testing was going to be an issue.

It almost makes a case for education in the humanities to be compulsory into adulthood!Reading it helped me to reflect on how dangerous it is for us to accept a narrow and rigid definition of what makes for a permissible #Shetlander#,and how important it is to reject the idea that some are entitled to more of a voice in that discussion than others.Those wishing to contest the need for such points to be made should first read Malcolm#s recommended article and then reflect on how recently a SMUHA squad featured a black-faced member of the NHS.As the article points out there is a prospect that this visus will not lead to more harmonious societies.The price of the peaceful cooperation we should wish for with all our neighboursis vigilance against those who would needlessly turn us against each other.Ilove how Peter and Malcolm appear to be so in veneration of each other, just a tad too preachy for me. As for #an education in the humanities to be compulsory into adulthood!# I would respectfully suggest a basis eduction in the STEM subjects would be of far more value to humankind. That way most would understand what a virus is, how a vaccine works. The sort of simple science stuff that lives depend on.Humanities educated, Like Boris Johson and Rees Mogg. Go for it, Peter!One hesitates to perturb so a warm a socialist embrace. However, re the linked article, any author who discusses Nazism and bigotry in one breath and then Trump, Bolsonaro and Modi in the next while omitting to mention China’s Xi Jinping or the North Korean monster, Kim Jong-un, is clearly peddling a dishonest agenda.It#s a wonder people #educated in the humanities# didn#t see that. Interesting.Having installed himself as president for le, Xi is reportedly responsible for the most appalling, vicious repression and imprisonment of a million Uighur people and the relentless destruction of their culture in China’s Xinjiang province. The “ View” is clear: “Speak out or be complicit.”“Without sustained pressure, the grotesque human rights abuses seen in Xinjiang will not just continue but intensy. The time to speak up arrived long ago. Countries should be shouting about this from the rooftops.”If you want a chilling reminder of Nazism, guys, look no further.Does anyone want to remind John the NHS is socialist in intent and inception Did he learnall this from the wonderful British Empire ,I wonder, so ,he is a poor apprentice.John Tulloch#s unwillingness to engage with the main points previously made is unsurprising.Have I missed something here  An article about testing equipment arriving in Shetland allowing results to be available in hours rather than days has very quickly turned into a debate about immigrants, racism, humanities -v- STEM Education and extreme left right wing politics. It’s not always necessary to find something to disagree about.@Stephen Johnston, I agree. That#s precisely why I hadn’t commented on any coronavirus item, here or where, until my above post. The coronavirus pandemic is a rapidly unfolding tragedy, a national and global emergency. Using it as a political football is completely inappropriate.However, there comes a point when people pompously touting their supposedly superior educations to bolster bogus arguments, endlessly stirring the pot of social ision and bitterness, must be challenged. Ideally, we would support those faced with tackling the crisis # at all levels # and keep our criticisms constructive. Or keep quiet and let them get on with it. Lessons can be learned later, with the benefit of hindsight, once all the facts are knownAs they say, # you won#t help, at least, get out of the way.#JT, straight from the right wing playbook# Tell them to be quiet. It#s an effective way to silence people # who could disagree that the coronavirus is a terrible tragedy after all  But#JT, How is the racism suffered every day for thousands of NHS staff not up for discussion  Why do you wish to silence that discussion Why don#t you deal with issue, rather than making a series of accusations and personal attacks What facts about racism faced by NHS staff are not known  Maybe not known to you, but lived by the people in the poem. Maybe for you racism and anti-immigrant sentiment is a political football to be put away until you see fit. But for the people who have lived with it through their lives, suffered because of it, it is a matter of day to day struggle. And yes, a political issue.When John declared that “People pompously touting their supposedly superior educations to bolster bogus arguments, must be challenged” I assumed that he was going to say something about Dr Mr Lt.Cdr Tinkler.For what it’s worth John, my own qualications are an HGV and PSV licence sothat’s what you regard as a superior education, you must have the mother of all inferiority complexes.Whenever anyone tries to bring up subjects like racism or social exclusion on this forum, the same few iniduals fly into an apoplectic rage and you, John, are always one of them.As someone once said:“If you won’t help, at least, get out of the way.”Malcolm Henry Johnson, O dear me, that chip on the shoulder. It was actually Surgeon Lieutenant Commander with  years training in Nuclear, Biological and ChemicalWarfare including triage and casualty care. I rejoice I never had time to waste on the humanities, more important work to do, like keeping people breathing.I know, tell me about it Ian. I for one would be fine without HGV drivers. In fact, I have been training our blessed grandson on how to handle a mule and cart . On a side note, I was exposed to radiation as a child in the s. The triage nurse was excellent and the radiation never did me any harm. So what I am saying is you are both valued by old John Thomas.I’ve often pondered the nature of predictability and wondered: What came first, the Surgeon Lieutenant Commander or the wind-up, clockwork toy To Peter Hamilton and John Thomas I say, thank you, for exemplying my point about using the coronavirus tragedy as a political football. Perfect.I hadn#t commented about NHS or care home staff. However, relatives of mine are currently benefitting from their work and their courage and conviction is truly admirable. Whatever their race or nationality, I heartily applaud it.Call me what you like. I won#t be drawn into an unseemly, polemic#Punch and Judy# food fight over the crisis by personal attacks.

Prof Pennington said the Western Isles, which at the start of the week had only six confirmed cases of Covid-, could exit the restrictions as a “test-bed” before wider lockdowns were lted.Politicians said the idea was worth considering, but still carried risk.Prof Pennington said: #There could soon be a case for a geographical lting of restrictions # such as in some of the Scottish islands and the Highlands and Grampian.#The Western Isles and Orkney are the obvious candidates to be the test beds for an exit strategy for the country. Travel is restricted because they are islands and have extremely low levels of confirmed cases. You can control access to them and re-open things like shops and churches etc and get back gradually to normal le again.#As for people travelling to the islands it is to be remembered that the vast majority of people have not been affected.”He added that effective testing facilities, which would give a quick result, must first be in place to allow any restrictions to be eased.Western Isles MSP Alasdair Allan said that while the idea had merit, islanders would be alarmedthey felt their health was being compromised as part of an experiment.He said: #It is unfortunate that the language of ‘testbeds’ has been used by some to describe the Western Isles, which has disturbed a number of people who have contacted me about this subject.“We have a population that is more elderly and more vulnerable to this virus than most, and so slowing down the spread of the virus has to be our overriding priority.“Despite the fact we have a low number of confirmed cases, the true number of infected islanders is likely to be signicantly higher. There is certainly now a need for more testing locally.#We need to keep observing the social distancing guidelines and cannot allow any room for complacency.“Given that we may well be behind the infection curve for the rest of Scotland, there is a good case to be made for a regional approach to lting lockdown restrictions, when that happens. However, this also has to ensure that the islands are not subject to any influx of travellers from other areas where the virus has already peaked.”Highlands and Islands Conservative MSP Donald Cameron added: “Any proposal to trial a relaxation of the lockdown rules must have the full support of local residents with the protection of the most vulnerable remaining paramount, as well as ensuring the NHS is not put under any unnecessary strain.“However, the geography of the islands means they are suitable for a possible trial and Professor Pennington’s suggestions certainly deserve serious consideration.“Given the fragile nature of the islands# local economy at this time, we need to give our communities every chance of not only getting through this pandemic but also kick-starting a recovery as quickly as possible. This proposal may well help in that endeavour.”The West Highland Free Press online shop is taking no new orders until st May .Sorry for any inconvenience this may cause."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/grimsay.jpg","title":"grimsay boat haven virtual launch replaces scheduled weekend of","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineA video has been made to launch the new boat haven in Grimsay after lockdown procedures forced original plans to change.Grimsay Community Association had originally planned a two-day extravaganza of events and activities over the Easter weekend to celebrate the launch of the new Grimsay boat haven.Unfortunately, current travel restrictions and social distancing meant that this could not go ahead.Organisers say that as soon as it is allowed and practicable they will be organising a celebratory event at the new haven. includes a virtual tour of the boats that are on display.

When the tide was out, it was a grey-sanded, multi-rockpooled, playground.The entire village could be found there on a summer’s weekendwhen it appeared that everything celestial had aligned just perfectly.Hang on, rose-tinted glasses being fetched.We changed into our trunks behind towels held up by impatient fathers, determined themselves to let the sun shine, however briefly, on pale skin that hid, perennially, under jumpers and boiler-suits, the unorm of the tweed-mill and croft.Our young horizons were beginning to broaden and, like every islander before us, the sea needed to be properly introduced.These were the halcyon, formative, summer days of my youth and I was a veritable Jacques Cousteau in black, knee-, wellies.We overturned large pebbles and boulders in the pools, discovering quickly the habits of their occupants and that the miniature world, whilst of huge interest and education, was but a microcosm of what lay beyond the surf crashing not too far away with its warning roar.It was a gentle build up to boldness.We were relatively safe and required little, or no, supervision: the worst that could happen to us was a graze from a slip on the rocks, or a nip from a, larger than was wise to attempt to corner, portainn .We learned which fish were ‘horned’ or awkward to handle and delighted ourselves when we managed to capture one in our hands.Everything was done with your pals.Some of us were more adept than others at this new ‘sport’ a lack of fear, and possibly consequences, proving hugely advantageous when it came to the ‘hunt’.We broke open winkles and limpets on the rocks and threw them, defenceless, into the bigger pools and waited and watched.We experimented and we learned.We filled jars and tin cans, wandered home with our capture, and learned the dference between salt and seawater when it came to aquatic le.Usually several days later from the smell in the shed.At the time it seemed like simply harmless fun, but it was just what generations previous had done before us, and it was preparing us for the serious business ahead.The menfolk of the village all had a bamboo pole which they used to fish ‘properly’ with. The trick was to keep it wet so it wouldn’t get brittle and crack, hence the best place for hiding, and protecting, it was usually in the waterone.You might have had some guttering, we had several waterones.The post office at Knock was the place from which to procure such an item and, yes, they did them in miniature sizes too.I watched in awe as my father rigged my first ‘bamboo’.Half-way up the pole he tightly bound one end of theof tarred sisal twine that he had precisely cut just below a protruding culm .The twine was then wound around the narrowing bamboo to the fragile tip.The tip needed to be light and flexible, for casting and for ‘feel’, but strong enough not to break under the weight of anything with scales or fins.He then expertly tied off a secure fastening at this apex, leaving a working portion of twine which was brought back down the pole and loosely bound.We were, I was told in Gaelic, ‘good to go’.‘Look after it !’, I was warned.Of course we weren’t allowed, immediately, to go to ‘the rocks’ on our own: there had to be some kind of schooling before we were let loose where the big fish swam andyou fell in you’d almost certainly drown.These were the early seventies in Lewis, and the only things that knew how to swim were the creatures that you so desperately wanted to catch.We were taken, yet again, to Shinigeadh where, when the tide was full, we had our very own ‘training pond’, full of cuddies, desperate to hit the frying pan.The bodach had attached a hook to the end of the twine with about a yard of monofilament and had spent low tide filling a bag with some bàirnich , which I’m pretty sure we referred to as maoraich .The walk down to the geo, proudly behind my father and uncle , rod over my shoulder, made me proud as punch.In hindsight, yes it was a graduation.Naturally it was a beautul summer’s evening , the sun was behind us and, despite the bay being filled with grey sand, the sea seemed blue-transparent and I swear I can remember seeing the fish shoaling and darting about, ready to tease us with nibbles and tugs, each one magnied to the size of something huge.Possibly a mackerel Plucking a limpet from the bag, my father swtly extracted it from the shell with a squeeze of the thumb.He tore off the working anatomy, the gastronomic bits of the gastropoda, and popped the rest into his mouth and chewed.Not for long just enough to soften the muscular foot of the newly despatched mollusc so that it could easily be stuck onto the end of my waiting hook.It was the one ‘trick’ that I was never to repeat.I was told about the dangers of fishing too close together , the dangers of standing too close together , the dangers of waving a rod around , the dangers of getting too close to the sea .There were dangers from wet rocks , danger from extracting a fish, no matter the size, from a hook when it was thrashing around, determined toto terra-fliuch , and danger, generally, from not paying full attention, at all times, to what was going on around me.Maybe not all at the same time, but, as the night progressed, and my schoolboy enthusiasm spectacularly combined with my schoolboy errors to make repetition often and necessary, I quickly realised that to mistake ‘playing’ with ‘fishing’ could have serious consequences indeed.I was, however, undoubtedly ’hooked’.From the moment that first vibration was transmitted from fish to fingers.I’ve often wondered about heredity and whether or not certain traits get handed down from previous generations.I’m certain that in many cases they do.But we all, certainly most boys of my generation, grew up with the hand-me-down skills of our fathers and grandfathers.I never met my father’s father, the original ‘Tomsh’.He died before I was born.As a long-line fisherman working out of Portnaguran, his was very definitely not the easiest of lives.The photographer James McGeogh, a former Glasgow policeman, married the daughter of his next-door-neighbour.He is well known for his stunning photographs of the guga hunters of Ness.He found time as well to capture many other images of ‘s Lewis, including one of my grandfather in his working gear.‘Tomsh’ here was the same age in it as I am now.Check out the missing digits on his left hand.Not that I would have ever dared to answer my father back, or not pay attention to his instructions at the rocks: but looking at that picture of his father, I’m pretty sure I know why the message stuck.We all had to start somewhere.I think I managed around a half-dozen cuddies that night.Though I had to get someone more experiencedto get these huge fish off my hook.The West Highland Free Press online shop is taking no new orders until st May .Sorry for any inconvenience this may

The UK cannot refuse to extend transition and at the same time slow down discussions on important areas.”Under the Withdrawal Agreement struck with Brussels, the transition period in which the UK continues to follow Brussels’ rules runs until the end of the year.It can be extendedmore time is needed to secure a comprehensive trade deala request is agreed by both sides, but that must be lodged by the end of June.Mr Barnier criticised the UK team, led by his counterpart David Frost, for having “failed to engage substantially” on the subject of the level playing field. with Michel Barnier \"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming fab .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_baa-fa-a-aaf-aadbbd_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming fab .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_baa-fa-a-aaf-aadbbd_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming fab .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_baa-fa-a-aaf-aadbbd_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming fab .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_baa-fa-a-aaf-aadbbd_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming fab .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_baa-fa-a-aaf-aadbbd_embedded w\" data-sizes\"auto\"   with Michel Barnier \"Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeClose with Michel Barnier \"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming fab .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_baa-fa-a-aaf-aadbbd_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming fab .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_baa-fa-a-aaf-aadbbd_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming fab .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_baa-fa-a-aaf-aadbbd_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming fab .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_baa-fa-a-aaf-aadbbd_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming fab .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_baa-fa-a-aaf-aadbbd_embedded w\" data-sizes\"auto\"   with Michel Barnier \"David Frostwith Michel Barnier PA FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappDavid Frostwith Michel Barnier  Overall governance of a future partnership is another area where both sides are “very far apart”, he said.The EU wants a single framework to jointly manage the future relationship but the UK “continues to insist on a number of separate agreements”, he said.Britain also refused to “provide firm guarantees rather than vague principles on fundamental rights and inidual freedoms” creating “serious, serious” limitations for a security partnership, while the UK must recognise a role for the European Court of Justice.And “no progress” has been made on fisheries as the UK has “not put forward a legal text”, Mr Barnier said.Senior figures in Brussels and opposition parties in the UK have warned the coronavirus pandemic means it will be impossible to reach an agreement in time and will lead to a chaotic exit at the end of the year.Mr Johnson has repeatedly insisted this will not happen. His official spokesman has even said the UK needs to be free of EU rules to allow it “flexibility” to respond to the coronavirus crisis.Two more week-long rounds of negotiations between the sides are scheduled, starting on May  and June .A UK Government spokeswoman said that despite “some promising convergence in the core areas” of a free trade agreement the detail of the EU’s offer on goods “falls well short” of recent precedents set by the bloc with other countries.Other “signicant dferences of principle” include the level-playing field, which aims to set common rules and standards to prevent businesses on one side undercutting the other.She said progress on that area cannot be made until “the EU drops its insistence on imposing conditions on the UK which are not found in the EU’s other trade agreements and which do not take account of the fact that we have left the EU as an independent state”.On fisheries, she said there would be no progress until Brussels accepts “the UK will have the right to control access to its waters at the end of this year”.PAMost ReadMeghan’s claim that articles caused row with father ‘objectionable’ – newspaperFirst people injected as part of coronavirus vaccine trialsRoyal family leads the way during weekly clap for carersft corn snake discovered in family’s bathroomDuchess of Sussex asked friend to try to influence story, publisher claims,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The community in Magherafelt responded to a plea from nurses for accommodation in the area and within  hours, a house had been located and refurnished ready for them to move in. Mid Ulster councillor Darren Totten had been alerted to the nurses’ plight and set in place a train of events that would reveal a heart-warming tale of community spirit. He told the County Derry Post: “One of the nurses had been askingthere was any accommodation available – Air BnB or something along those lines in the Magherafelt area. googletag.cmd.push “Somebody had tagged me into it and that’s how I got involved. I sent her a message to give me a ring and she rang me more or less straight away. “That was on the Friday evening and I met them over at the house at a quarter to  on the Saturday morning. It was a bit rough round the edges, it had been lying empty for a while.  “The fella that has recently bought it had said to me a few weeks ago thatit was of any use to anybody, to use away at it. He brought the keys down and left them with me.” googletag.cmd.push Darren posted online appealing for help to make the house a bit more inhabitable for the healthcare staff and found himself inundated with offers from both friends and strangers. “I threw it up on Facebook asking for a favour from anyone who could help kit a house out from start to finish,” he said. “There were people who came here with tins of paint. Four fellas landed and they were painting the living room and bedrooms. “One fella, who I had never met in my le, rang me and said ‘I’m here whenever you need’ so I told him to come on ahead. He landed with dust sheets, rollers, paint brushes and all the rest.  “Bradley’s furniture landed out with a lorry-load of furniture and kitted the whole thing out with brand new mattresses, beds, bedside lockers and all. “The smaller stuff was all made up from donations that people had given. Cloverhill Oil landed with  litres of heating oil and a local fella wired up the TV aerial free of charge.” Cllr Totten hailed the effort as a fine example of community cohesion and said the positivity had helped create a space for the healthcare staff to rest from the harrowing reality of Covid-. He said: “They were over the moon. They would have taken it as it was on Saturday morning, but I asked them to give me a day or two to make it a bit more homely for them. “The whole thing took legs, there’s a real good will out there at the minute and not a penny changed hands. “It was all hands to the pump and it was amazing to be part of it. You would have thought anyone working in that house had been friends for le, they were chatting away to each other. With the house ready to move into on Saturday evening, the mammoth effort left out just one important utensil. “The only thing we forgot about was a tin opener,” said Darren, “but that’s sorted now.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The annual event was due to take place in venues across the city area next month but was cancelled due to COVID-. However, Council have instead put together a digital programme that will be broadcast as a live event on the City of Derry Jazz Festival Facebook each day from Thursday May th to Sunday May th - called the Virtual Jazz Festival…Sofa Sessions. People will be able to see and hear from their favourite bands and artists, as well as taking part in some jazz dance classes. googletag.cmd.push Mayor of Derry City and Strabane District Council Michaela Boyle said the online festival will help lt spirits. There is always such a buzz around Derry and the whole district when the Jazz Festival rolls around every year and while we will unfortunately have to miss out on that this time, I think this is a brilliant way of recreating a bit of that excitement and atmosphere in our own homes. Theres nothing quite like a bit of toe-tapping and catchy music to lt your spirits and ease les anxieties, and this revised online programme gives us all something to look forward to – which is exactly what we all need right now – and with over  artists and bands taking part there will be something for everyone to enjoy. googletag.cmd.push I want to thank Councils Culture Department for their hard work in putting this programme together. Im certainly looking forward to a bit of jiving and singing! Jacqueline Whoriskey, Councils Festival  Events Manager, said they felt it was hugely important to keep the festival going, albeit in a dferent capacity. The Virtual Jazz Festival… Sofa Sessions is an opportunity to celebrate artists from our own district and from all over the world, and we felt that now, more than ever, it was imperative that we find a way to do that. In putting together the programme we have made sure that local artists are well represented in line with the ethos of the festival. Its a really tough time for them, and for all of the artists and bands involved, given the financial hit that they have had to endure in the past few months. This is the th year of the festival, and although it will certainly be much dferent to any that we have had before, we were determined that it would go ahead in some form, and we hope tobigger and better than ever on our th anniversary next year.

Council members and senior management have been meeting regularly to review impacts on Council services, with daily updates on the changing response to the COVID- situation. It was decided that given the ongoing situation and all the guidance from health authorities regarding public safety and the restrictions regarding public gatherings it would be prudent to cancel at this stage.Announcing the decision, Mayor of Derry City and Strabane District Council, Councillor Michaela Boyle, said it was necessary to look ahead and be realistic about what events can safely be delivered over the coming months. I know this will be disappointing as these are both popular events and ones which positively promote health, wellbeing and fitness, she declared.But these are exceptional times and dficult decisions must be made for the greater good.Local people have been responding well to the social distancing advice and I know people will understand that under the current government guidelines regarding public gatherings, it would not be possible to host these events without making major changes to their format that would have a detrimental impact.By making these decisions at an early stage, we can avoid accumulating unnecessary costs and resourcing in terms of planning, and we will continue to review other major Council-led events over the coming weeks.We do however want to send out a strong message regarding exercise and its importance to both mental and physical health at this time. Council is promoting smaller exercise challenges – such as the Family Home k Run Walk on May  – and the online Friday Fitness Challenge, which people can do at home, in their garden or near their home. We will continue to explore other activities and programmes in the coming weeks which will enhance health and wellbeing and offer people the chance to exercise in a safe and fun way.Please take the opportunity to get together as a family and enjoy games and activities, and the extra time we are getting to spend with loved ones.The decision was taken by members during a virtual meeting this week where they were reminded that regulations set out by the Department of Health in their Coronavirus Legislation which came into operation on March  were still in place.The announcement follows on from the decision to cancel the City of Derry Jazz Festival and St Patricks Day programme in recent weeks. Council will continue to adhere to the requirements to keep premises and businesses closed, including burial grounds and cemeteries, and to adhere to the restrictions on movement and gatherings. However, it continues to explore alternative options for the public including the launch this week of an online Jazz Festival. The Virtual Jazz Festival… Sofa Sessions will be broadcast as a live event on the City of Derry Jazz Festival Facebook each day from Thursday May thto Sunday May th- called the Virtual Jazz Festival…Sofa Sessions.For more information on all the impacts on Council services in relation to COVID- please go to www derrystrabane  coronavirus googletag.cmd.push  googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

We are now entering the th day of lockdown with strict regulations in place to curb the spread of Covid-. The current situation is set to last until at least May  and as many seek comfort from the virus’ threat, they are turning their attention towards happier days. Re-runs of old TV programmes are filling the airwaves. The GAA has made  All-Ireland finals available to watch online. News archives are being pored over for hidden gems. Nostalgia is king at the moment, but Maghera psychologist Sarah Connell is not surprised by the phenomenon. googletag.cmd.push “It’s a really comforting emotion,” says the owner of Minding Me Psychologists. “It brings back times when we’ve been accepted and loved, and it provides some badly needed relief in these times of uncertainty. “People are generally frightened by change, because we don’t always feel like we’re in control of things. Having that sense of being in control is really important for our well-being. “We can retreat to the past and think of when times were good, and we felt like we were in more control of things. I think that really helps us to be more stabilised and feel better about things. googletag.cmd.push “I think sometimes we can use it as a wee bit of an escape as well. It can take us out of the situation we are in that, for some people, is really challenging.” Although nostalgia is widely regarded as a positive emotion, this was not always the case and early research into the area deemed it to be a psychological problem. The term was coined by Swiss doctor Johannes Hoffer in , who deemed it a ‘neurological disease of essentially demonic cause’ after studying Swiss mercenaries stationed abroad. It arose from the Greek terms nostos – meaning a yearning tohome – and algos – its associated pain. Hoffer also concluded that the condition may have been caused by incessant cowbells in the Alps causing damage to the soldiers’ ears and brain cells. Even throughout the th and th centuries, it carried the stigma of ‘immigrant psychosis’, a form of ‘melancholia’ and a ‘mentally regressive compulsive disorder’. Sarah describes the concept as ‘bittersweet’ and refers to it as a ‘double-edged sword’. “Because it triggered dissatisfaction and lots of negative emotions like stress, fear and loss, it was interpreted as something you don’t want to have,” she says. “It really is bittersweet. It’s sweet because we’re remembering the good times, all the things that were good in the past, but it’s bitter because we know we can never regain that experience. “It’s gone forever. Time is irreversible and there’s something really sad about that. “The song ‘Days of Our Lives’ by Queen has the lines: ‘Can’t turn back the clock, can’t turn back time, ain’t that a shame’ and I think that really summarises it well. “Although it’s a lovely thing to think back, we can’t turn back the time. It’s really positive in one way but there’s a downside to it as well.” Nostalgia is often triggered by activities that people enjoy, such as music or sport, and Sarah says this is especially the case during a time of psychological distancing. “It can really help counteract feelings of loneliness,” she said. “It’s a huge link because those [music and sport] are things we love. If we think back to times when you played a good match, or went to an enjoyable concert, those are happy memories. “Nostalgic thoughts unite us with people again in our minds. It increases the perception of social support and reminds us of a time when we were with people, doing things and enjoying them.” A rise in nostalgia can often be a result of coming face-to-face with your own mortality and as the death toll in Northern Ireland reaches , people are increasingly worried. “It’s giving them that sense that you actually can die,” says Sarah. “Some people are quite concerned about it, but others probably still feel an element of ‘that’s not going to happen to me’. “One thing many are most concerned about is the economic effect that it’s having. They’re concerned about job loss – a lot of people have been furloughed. “They’ll be wonderingtheir job will continue after this period and what will happen in terms of paying bills and mortgages. The fear that we are going to go into recession is causing worries. Through talking to clients, Sarah has heard many people talk about the unexpected positive aspects that have arisen from the effects of the lockdown. She says: “I am hearing a lot of people really focusing on the positives, which is great. They are loving having more precious time to spend with their families and their children. “Little things like the slower pace of le – you can hear the birds singing more in the mornings. It’s giving time for people to reflect and re-evaluate their lives. Although the psychological distancing that we are currently having to enforce increases feelings of isolation and loneliness, people are adapting. Sarah says: “People are finding ways of coping with it by trying to find a bit of regularity in their lives - doing things like exercise every day and keeping some kind of structure to their day. “We’ve gone from being able to do whatever we want to having massive restrictions on us. “None of us like being told what to do or being held back from living our lives how we want to live them. “We’re having to draw on our willpower to focus and do the things that are right for ourselves and for everyone.” If nostalgia can act as a buffer against the fear and frustration caused by Covid-, then open that GAA archive, put on the old TV re-runs and wallow in reminiscent therapy.

Fireside selectors picking teams is one of Ireland’s national past times. This selection is based on players who took part in county senior, intermediate and junior finals -. It is based on the grade they were playing at that time. Five from each is selected. Just like putting five litres into a one litre jar. Here goes...  - Antoacutein McMullan For years it was the ‘big boot’ in defence who would do the kicking out. Distance was important. Now it has developed into an art form with the qualities being, a cool head, the ability to kick the ball through basketball hoop at a distance of  metres, safe hands and cat like reflexesrequired. Antoacutein has all the credentials. googletag.cmd.push  - Oisin Duffy A good defender is one that the forward hates playing against and the energetic Duffy was one of those prize assets. Firm in the tackle, virtually impossible to stop on the run and full of scores from his defensive position. His display in the Ulster Intermediate championship against Magheracloone, where he scored - from play, was exceptional.  - Brendan Rogers No player can change gear as quickly as the tall Brendan when he motors out of defence. He would excel in any sport and could play anywhere on the football field. A brilliant hurler as well. Seeing a forward chasing him with tongue hanging out is something were are used to. A real pleasure to watch. googletag.cmd.push  - Karl McKaigueThere is a famous film called the Quiet Man. Karl could be titled the quiet marker in defence. He has snuffed out some of the best forwards in the game and still manages to slip forward and get a point or two. Tackles the ball and not the man, so he rarely gives away frees. His anticipation of where the ball is going to drop is exceptional.  - Niall KeenanA neat and tidy footballer. His build would suggest corner forward material but he is actually a quality defender. Came through the minor and U ranks showing class all the way. His display at Croke Park in the  minor semi-final for Derry marked him as a player with a great future and he has lived up to that billing.  - Joe Gray Play anywhere Joewas the heart beat of Faughanvale teams for the most of two decades. He led a young team from the junior ranks to a solid intermediate outfit. Played and managed at dferent times and had a few games with Derry in the s. Has all the skills and a read dead eye free taker.  - Jimmy O’Connor Jimmy was ‘spotted’ by an Derry U scout when he was closer to  than . Now, nearer  than , he keeps up an amazing standard of fitness. Normally listed as a corner forward he is let loose to conduce the orchestra. Not the biggest but he makes light of that with his wide range of skills.  - Enda Muldoon Could have played on any team, in any era. Great hands and a master of the ever accurate foot pass. Always made the game look easy since he broke into a Derry minor team in . Now a qualied coach, passing on his skills to the next generation the youngsters could not have had a better tutor. A gentleman on and off the field.  - Mark Lynch From enthralling Croke Park in the  All-Ireland minor final, at the age of , Mark has continued to show quality. Stepped down two years ago after a long inter county career. Still the heart and soul of Banagher teams. He was exceptional in their senior championship run last year and the intermediate title a year previous. In his all round skills is the mastery of free taking.  - Michael McNaughtGrandson of the great Mickey McNaught who was on the Derry  National League winning team. His accurate left foot is one of the reasons why the Waterside men have become a solid force in Derry football. Can play midfield or half forward and seldom is below par. A very accurate free taker.  - Richard KingRichard broke into the Wolfhound’s senior team at the age of  as a corner forward. Now a commanding figure in the half forward line and an excellent free taker. Was a key figure in the treble winning junior team of . His rather harsh sending off against Red Hugh’s almost certainly cost Limavady the Ulster title. At  there is a lot more to come from this excellent footballer  - Enda Lynn Good enough to captain his county for two seasons. This man is a virtual scoring machine. Such is his dedication that he has been known to train on Christmas Day. His pace and tireless running makes him nearly impossible to mark. Missed a lot of action last season with an injury. Greenlough and Derry will be glad to see him back againthe action ever resumes.  - Paudie O’Neill Probably the best club footballer in Derry never to get a county call. Time after time, he would win games on his own for the Henry Joys. His scoring tallies were mind boggling but like a lot of good footballer had ongoing injury problems. A loyal club player he often played through the pain barrier.  - Kevin O’ConnorEvery year he postpones his retirement is another good year for Foreglen. From being an excellent half forward he now brings his deadly accuracy to the role of target man. A quite superb free taker who is always calm and measured. Played a leading role in their intermediate championship win last season.  - Conleith Gilligan Has to be one of the highest ever scorers in Derry club football. From his teenage years to his mid-s his quality never dimmed. Be it from frees or open play, he seldom missed the target. His pace and ability to be in the right place at the right time marked him as one of the best. His retirement left a huge void in the Shamrock’s attack. He is now passing on his skills to others.

In addition, another  food parcels were delivered by last Friday.Local council officials have been working in partnership with their colleagues across local government, health trusts and the Department for Communities to set up the hubs.Down Leisure Centre has been transformed into a processing centre to organise deliveries, with other sites currently being identied should they be required, with staff working in split shts, while observing social distancing and other safety protocols.The new service covers the councilrsquos seven even district electoral areas with deliveries focusing on food supplies with the packages including items such as tinned and dried food, cereals and some essential toiletries.Requests for help from the council and its community and voluntary partners are arriving via Access NI which is processing calls from across Northern Ireland on a freephone helpline.Council chairman Charlie Casey says he is pleased to see just how many of the districtrsquos most vulnerable residents have been able to receive food parcel deliveries recently.ldquoOur sincere thanks go to all our partners who worked with us over the Easter break to achieve this and all the volunteers who have already kindly offered their help, he continued.ldquoIt is important that we provide a leline to those following medical advice to shield to protect their health, or who are self-isolating, and have no other means of assistance.The council chairman said that during the local authorityrsquos COVID- response, it will continue to work hard to deliver essential supplies to those who need them and ensure no-one feels alone or isolated at this dficult time.A COVID- community helpline is operational, with those in vulnerable groups seeking support asked to make contact between am and pm, seven days a week, with the helpline managed by Advice NI who are processing calls from across Northern Ireland.The Freephone number is   , while the email is covid@adviceni.net. Contact can also be made by texting ACTION to .All calls that are relevant to the councilrsquos community co-ordination hub will be passed on to the local authority for action, including referrals from the South Eastern and Southern health trusts.The Downpatrick-based County Down Rural Community Network, the Confederation of Community Groups in Newry and Community Advice Newry Mourne and Down are acting as lead organisations for the community groups involved in this response.Members of the public are reminded that the Down Leisure Centre remains closed and that anyone who requests a food parcel will have it delivered to them directly.The County Down Rural Community Network in Downpatrick is acting as one of the lead organisations for the community groups involved in the response to the new food parcel distribution service.Any other volunteers who wish to assist in the delivery of food and supplies or ensure residents on their own at this time receive phone calls to help ease their isolation, are encouraged to register with Volunteer Now via their website.Further information about volunteering is available at www.volunteernow while organisations can identy COVID- volunteering requirements at www.volunteernow organidations.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd April 2020 Castlewellan.jpg","title":"Castlewellan dressmaker makes scrubs for frontline workers in lockdown  ","story":"FROM wedding dresses to scrubs ndash thatrsquos the new order of work for Castlewellan bridal dressmaker Shirley Moorhead.Sewing a range of scrubs for nurses and nursing home workers has replaced Shirleyrsquos normal orders of stunning gowns, veils, bridesmaidsrsquo dresses and outfits for the mother of the bride and groom since the coronavirus lockdown.The  year-old was facing a full order book for spring and summer weddings until the lockdown resulted in many weddings being pushed back to the autumn and beyond.The woman behind Fairytale Designs, the mother of five was determined not to let her inactivity and seamstress skills go to waste during the lockdown over the last four weeks.She is now sewing scrubs for over  hours each day in her garden workshop, after  years of experience as a dressmaker.ldquoIrsquom sure that in any home where there is a sewing machine, local people are also doing their bit and working to sew to support the local effort with PPE, said Mrs Moorhead.ldquoAt the moment, while Irsquom being very productive, I canrsquot earn a living with what I do, like so many others. Therersquos plenty like me and we are all in the same boat.ldquoIt started when I received requests from nurses who I made their wedding or bridesmaid dresses in the past for. I ended up making scrubs for some entire hospital wards, male and female and in a iety of sizes.ldquoThat widened out to sewing for staff at local nursing homes. I just want to do something to help, particularly for nursing homes as my daughter, Abigail, works in one in Castlewellan.There is plenty of work to be done to complete her bridal orders, but Mrs Moorhead feels that her priority is for scrubs.ldquoMy weddings have been pushed back until October or November or even next year. There are things that would hamper me. I canrsquot see brides to fit them and I wouldnrsquot want to go too far ahead with orders in case some people gain weight or lose weight, she said.ldquoAlso,the wedding changes seasons, that can change the outfit ordered in style and colour. For instance, a mother of the bride might want a jacket as well or might want to lose or shorten sleeves so I feel I canrsquot go to far ahead with my orders. Brides have needed me to reassure them that everything will be alright for their big day, whenever it happens, and I can absolutely promise that.ldquoAbigail is getting married in November and her sister, Johanna, is getting married next May, so they will be the most special wedding dresses I will make in my letime. I feel that I have to keep going with the scrubs as itrsquos so important. However, I will make sure that I will provide all outfits that have been ordered from me. It has become a family affair as Mrs Moorheadrsquos husband, Joe, who also is unable to work as an engineer in the lockdown, helps with the pressing of the garments while Johanna helps with the sewing.Mrs Moorhead has been creating the scrubs from donated material, much of it brand new, and is very grateful for the donations..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd April 2020 Crossgar.jpg","title":"Crossgar man takes Chance with move to Hong Kong 26 years later opens superstore  ","story":"AT the age of  and without a word of Cantonese, Richard Bowsie left his family and friends behind in his home village of Crossgar for a le of adventure in Hong Kong.Twenty-six years later and now a married father of two, Richard has found love, happiness as well as a successful career as the owner of two second-hand furniture stores in the huge cosmopolitan city with over seven million inhabitants.He and his locally-born we, Mavis, run nd Chance Furniture that provides shoppers in the city and online across the world a virtual Aladdinrsquos Cave with thousands of unique and affordable items - ranging from lacquered tables to pool tables, Chinese vases to Balinese drums.While other young ambitious men were told to lsquogo westrsquo, Richard went east, finding Hong Kong to be every bit as much the land of opportunity as the United States.The father of eight year-old daughter Kailey and son George, whorsquos coming five, literally changed his le in three days when he made the decision to fly to Hong Kong.From working as a leguard at the Tropicana centre in Newcastle and at the former Down Leisure Centre, the former student of the High School, Ballynahinch, had been close to completing his BTec qualication in Leisure Management at the former Newcastle College of Further Education.He ped out of his course a few months shy of graduation due to bullying. While his parents, Margaret and Ken, a well-known architect, were shocked at their middle sonrsquos decision, they were not surprised.He recalled: ldquoI had a friend who had travelled to Hong Kong three months previously. During a phone call he told me that the new international airport was under construction and work was easy to find. Three days later I arrived.ldquoI decided to go by myself as I had been trying to find an exciting job at home for a while but kept being told I was too young for the roles or lacked experience. My parents knew I was ambitious and how frustrated I was becoming with my career ambitions being knocked back all the time.Richard admitted he hadnrsquot a clue what to do once he arrived and took a bar managerrsquos job as an interim position as many of the airport workers drank there.His first job at the airport turned out to be with the Northern Ireland company, Lagan Construction Group, before going to another Belfast-based company, Rotary International, with which he worked for two years.ldquoI felt excited and nervous all at the same time when I first moved to Hong Kong, said Richard.ldquoThe first thing that struck me was the heat, after leaving cold and damp of home. Arriving in  degrees and high humidity was certainly a shock to the system, despite having been on family holidays to France most years with my family and once to America with a cross community group. The heat in Asia was a massive shock.Having grown up in a rented manse on the Rademon estate, Richard swapped a quiet rural existence for the hustle and bustle of the global port and major commerce centre. It was still under British rule and would remain so for another three years before it was handed back to China.Richard said: ldquoLanguage was the biggest shock but I made it my mission to learn the language and enrolled in YMCA lessons but also managed to pick it up from also working alongside locals.It wasnrsquot long before Richard felt confident enough to start out his own business, an electrical supply company which employed  staff.He said: ldquoI knew after the first few months that Hong Kong was going to work for me,you worked hard, nothing could hold you back, age was not an issue here. Opening a business here was very straight forward, just need a bank account and register an address.He met his we Mavis during his first month in the city and the two have been together ever since.They opened their first store in  in the after seeing a large amount of good furniture being thrown away each week and were determined to do something that would reduce the waste and help the environment. Within months, they had outgrown this store and relocated to their current , sq ft premises in Tuen Mun.The couple has recently opened a second, , sq ft premises in Chai Wan which is closer to the busy capital.Fluent in Cantonese for many years, Richard has seen Hong Kong go through many challenges, not in the least with the recent coronavirus pandemic.ldquoHong Kong has handled the virus very well, having been through SARS and bird flu before, said Richard. ldquoAs soon as we heard there was an issue over the border in China, Hong Kong went straight into prevention measures before even being advised to. Now everyone wears masks and observes hygiene measures.The preventative measures must have been successful as the city recorded zero deaths on Monday for the first time since the outbreak before Christmas.While the move to Hong Kong was the right one for Richard, he still misses home and his brothers and sisters, Simon, Gillian, Laura and William.He said: ldquoI miss the food, the greenery and, of course, my family who are all still in Northern Ireland. I miss being close to home as I have lost family members and grandparents.ldquoBut we come home as often as we can. Mavis and the kids love Crossgar, especially AJs Diner. They love the Rademon estate where we lived beside, walks down the Church Road to Kilmore and the open green fields. We have very few here in Hong Kong and any we do have are full of mosquitos.Home is always on Richardrsquos mind, as is his business.He adds: ldquoNext for our business is hopefully more expansion as I would like to start exporting furniture to other countries such as Northern Ireland.

Mr James said bluntly yesterday:ldquoThere are people who had an opportunity to say things at an early stage but did not. Now they have really pulled the carpet out from under our feet at an advanced stage. Irsquom bitterly disappointed at this kind of timing.The problem arose when the Housing Executive was in the final stages of preparing a scheme, which has been on the drawing board for several years, when it was told of the Government objections to a number of potential sites, including the Burren River catchment area and another, the most important, at the Dundrum Road end of the town.The Executive had finally got an agreement to purchase from the landowner of the Dundrum Road site and had made a final routine check with the Government departments before clinching a deal.

It is also my understanding that Newry, Mourne and Down Council and Northern Irelandrsquos other  councils are working closely alongside the government department at this time.Cllr Walker said he would like to see the recycling centres open again, suggesting that strict controls could be introduced to only allow two vehicles access them at any one time.ldquoI would also appeal to people at this time to keep their waste until the recycling centres are open again. I appreciate that many people who are not at work at the moment are making the most of the time they have to clean out their homes, sheds and garages and I commend them for being active.ldquoHowever, it simply isnrsquot on to load up you car with waste, drive to a secluded area and dump it. I just donrsquot understand the mentality of people who engage in this kind of behaviour.Cllr Walker also said the cost of clearing up illegal waste is borne by the districtrsquos ratepayers.ldquoWe have the ironic situation that those who dump their waste illegally end up paying for its removal viatheir rates. This beggars belief, he declared. ldquoThe stupidity of those who dump waste in secluded areas is beyond me.Cllr Walker added: ldquoThe time has come for common sense and people really need to catch a grip of themselves. One of the most worrying aspectsof illegal dumping is that waste which ends up in fields is sometimes eatenby livestock which often results in deadly consequences. To those who dump their waste illegal my appeal is stop now.The local council has confirmed that it is receiving increasing reports about fly-tipping across the district since the start of the COVID- crisis. But the organisation insists that it is currently able to manage the issue within existing resources.A council spokesman said that the organisation continues to work closely with the Environment Agency which also performs a key role in addressing incidents of larger illicit dumping.On the issue of reopening the districtrsquos household recycling centres, the spokesman explained that the decision is continually being reviewed in line with government social distancing measures.He continued: ldquoFly-tipping is illegal and the council will strictly enforce this where evidence can be gathered. Responding to fly-tipping incidents also erts important council resources away from providing other essential services.The spokesman confirmed that the council is unable to remove illicitly-dumped waste from privately-owned land, explaining that where this occurs, both it and the Environment Agency has the legal powers to request its removal.He said the council will enforce this where required.The spokesman added: ldquoThe council would urge the public to avoid producing any unnecessary waste, including undertaking DIY and house and garden clearances at this time due to the considerable pressure being placed on public services.ldquoAny additional waste that is produced should be stored for future disposal at the household recycling centres once they re-open.

Here, he selects his greatest Down team of all timeHIS name alone is enough to rekindle treasured memories of a time when Down football reigned supreme.Paddy lsquoMorsquo Doherty had the deadliest left foot in Ireland and he used it to maximum effect as Down swept all before them.Incredibly, itrsquos  years ago that Down took the sporting world by storm when they defeated Kerry to win the All-Ireland senior football title for the first time. It was also the first time that a team north of the border had won the Sam Maguire Cup.To reinforce their emergence as a new power in Gaelic football, Down retained their title the following year with Paddy as captain of the side which defeated Offaly and he was also a member of the Down team which won a third All-Ireland for the county in , Kerry again falling victim to the Red and Black machine in the final.As well as his three All-Ireland medals, Paddy won seven Ulster Championship, seven Railway Cup and three National League medals.

If we had not beaten them, they would have won another three All-Irelands.Asked how his Down team would fare against present day sides ldquoItrsquos a dferent game now, what with the blanket defence and other things, but the Down teams of the s would have won in any era. Well, thatrsquos what I think, though Irsquom sure there are many people who would disagree. Eddie McKay Eddie won two All-Ireland medals with me in  and . He was a very good goalkeeper believe me, always safe, dependable and brave. He was an excellent shot stopper and made many excellent saves. I also played against him many times when Ballykinlar took on Dundrum. These were local parish derbies and everyone was trying to kill each other, but somehow Dundrum never managed to beat us. George Lavery George also won two All-Irelands in  and . He was the quiet man on the team, but there were few better man markers in the game and he would have been a star in any era. He had played a match of two for Antrim, but Maurice Hayes, who was secretary of the Down county board, persuaded him to sign for Down. He played as sweeper and was a good, tight marker. Leo Murphy Leo was a terric full back, tough and reliable. Not too many players could get past him and he could kick the ball a long distance. He also won two All-Irelands in  and . Pat Rice There was no one better than Pat Rice at catching a ball. His high fielding was magnicent and he was quick at clearing the ball. He gave away few chances and often kicked the ball out for Eddie McKay. He missed little and he wasnrsquot a dirty player at all. Dan McCartan One of only three Down players to win three All-Ireland senior medals along with Sean OrsquoNeill, Joe Lennon and myself, Dan is one of the all-time greats of Down football. He had outstanding ability, tackled hard and always looked for the quick clearance up to the front men. He could play anywhere as he showed when he moved to full back in the  final. Joe Lennon He was our captain in , though he did not play in the second after getting injured. He was a great captain and a terric leader. Joe placed a great emphasis on fitness and pioneered new coaching practices. He thought greatly about the game and was possibly ahead of his time. He was a very talented player. Tom OrsquoHare Tom played in the  team, but was good enough to get his place on any team. He was probably one of our best players that year. He was always steady and was great at delivering a ground ball. Jarlath Carey Jarlath won two All-Irelands in  and . He was a tireless worker, who was at home either in midfield or in attack. He was always forcing his way into the forward line and would wag his finger at me to go back into midfield to cover for him. I didnrsquot mind one bit, because he was good enough and I was fit enough to do what he asked. Colm McAlarney They called Colm lsquoThe Mighty Arklersquo after the famous racehorse because of his long strides up the field. Colm and Tom OrsquoHare were our two outstanding players in  and Colm was definitely one of the best midfielders in Ireland at that time, or any other time. Tony Hadden Tony won two All-Irelands in  and . He could fist the ball further than many players could kick it and he could also move into midfieldthings were going bad. He was tall and well built and could score a point as well as anyone. James McCartan A very strong player. Down would not have won anything without him because he took a lot of the abuse which would otherwise have been directed at me or Sean OrsquoNeill. He played a critical role in the  final against Offaly. We were two goals down in the first half and getting beaten. I crossed the ball to James who turned in mid air and put into the back of the net. Two more goals from Sean OrsquoNeill and Breen Morgan had us a goal up at half time, but it was his goal that turned things around. Sean OrsquoNeill You would have to say that Sean was the greatest Down footballer of them all. He was named in the GAA Team of the Century which says it all. We played well together, wherever I kicked the ball, Sean was there to get it. He had a wonderful sidestep and took a lot of abuse, but he never retaliated. He went on to become a successful manager and won the Sigerson Cup with Queenrsquos University. Mickey Linden Mickey was a flying machine and one of Downrsquos best ever forwards. He could blow defences away with his pace and score with either foot. He was also very versatile. You could play him anywhere and he would still be a threat. Perhaps his only failing was that he was too nice a player. He rarely made a foul. Won two All-Irelands in  and . Patsy OrsquoHagan Full forward and winner of two All-Irelands in  and . He could have played full forward, full back, or just about anywhere . He was that good. One of his best performances was Wembley Stadium during one of the Wembley Cup tournaments when he scored four goals against Galway. Breen Morgan They made them tough in Annaclone and for his size Breen was one of the hardest men on the field. He had broken his jaw before the  All-Ireland final, but went to the field without the protector which was made specially for him. He just threw it on to a chair. He was marked by Offalyrsquos Paddy McCormick, who was made of iron, but Breen was afraid of no one.Paddyrsquos substitutesDanny Kelly , Greg Blaney , Barry Breen , James Milligan , Ross Carr , Paddy OrsquoRourke , DJ Kane , Dan Gordon , Benny Coulter , Paddy Doherty ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/15th April 2020 Queen.jpg","title":"Queen Karen Europe’s best  ","story":"A KILLYLEAGH grandmother is a European powerlting champion at the age of .Karen Burns won the European title in France in March and set a new world record in the process.Powerlting involves three disciplines mdash squat, bench press and deadlt mdash and Karen capped a brilliant performance with a world record breaking lt of  kilos in the deadlt.Itrsquos a fantastic achievement for Karen, who only took up powerlting four years ago.The legal secretary, who has two daughters and four grandchildren, started gym classes at the age of , but within a few months made the switch to powerlting.Coached by Aaron Kelly, from Affinity Fit at the CG Fitness gym in Annacloy, she trained four times a week and was soon competing and winning medals at a national, international and world levels.She was the British champion two years running in  and .

This would be known as Serious Condition Criteria.While widely welcomed, what was not made clear was Departmental staff have discretion around who meets criteria and can overrule a claimantrsquos medical evidence.A number of enquiries were submitted to the Department under a Freedom of Information request.The responses are concerning.The Department stated legislation does not refer to serious conditions but rather whether there is a relevant change of circumstances. The decision not to reassess those with severe, lelong disabilities or health conditions who are unlikely to ever move into work: ldquoTook effect from  September , but did not result in legislative change.The Department was asked about the right of appealing a decision rejecting a claimant for Serious Conditions Criteria, who responded: ldquoThere is no automatic right of appeal against a determination which is embodied in or necessary to a decision. , a claimant has a right of appeal against an outcome decision rather than a determination, which is merely a component of the outcome decision.This was complicated for non-legally trained or represented claimants, so questions were put around full compliance with the Disability Discrimination and Human Rights.The Department responded stating it: ldquoDoes not hold any information relating to this hellip.may have been undertaken by DWP.A copy of the risk-assessment template used by the Department in instances of considering Serious Condition Criteria, was requested, but: ldquoNo template existsInstead, the response referred to assessment procedures where Departmental Healthcare Professionals advise on the re-referral period, and consider whether a claimantrsquos condition meets: ldquoThe new severe conditions criteria andno further assessments are required.However, the claimantrsquos own medical professionalrsquos opinion around Serious Condition Criteria could be over-ruled, with this decided by: ldquoAn Administrative Officer appointed by the Department.In respect of providing the legislation or guidance which permits the Department to overrule clinical opinion provided by a claimant seeking consideration under the Serious Condition Criteria, the response referred to ESA Regulations , which: ldquoProvides for the redetermination of whether someone has limited capability for work. The time period in relation to this is not set down in the legislation but is largely at the Department Decision Makers discretion ndash usually based on available medical evidence including medical reports from ATOS hellip The decision not to reassess those with severe, lelong disabilities or health conditions who would be unlikely to ever move into work, took effect from  September  but did not result in legislative change.As the Freedom of Information request was answerd prior to the restoration of devolution, the Department was asked with a Minister now in post, to comment on current processes around Serious Condition Criteria decision-making and in particular, how it can by discretion supersede a medical diagnosis by a claimantrsquos clinician. It was also askedprocedures are under review andthere is intention to bring forward legislation to allow for scrutiny or challenge.A spokesperson said: ldquo Anyone claiming ESA will be automatically assessed for the Severe Conditions criteria at their Work Capability Assessment by a Healthcare Professional. If the personrsquos condition or its al effects meet the criteria, the Department will be advised that no further assessments are required.In response to the overruling of clinical decisions, the spokesperson said: ldquoThe Work Capability Assessment looks at the al effects of a personrsquos condition, rather than the diagnosis itself. It is not a supersession of the opinion of their clinician.This dfered to the response provided prior to the Minister taking office, which appeared to show the Department was permitted to over-rule the evidence of claimantrsquos clinician.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The Northern Ireland Executive will have its own flexibility and we may see across the country some iations we saw some iations going into lockdown as well.

Itrsquos a place, not a thing.ldquoWe were making decisions the scientists and medical experts were making decisions at that time and planning was going on. This is the point to judge it now when we have two months more evidence is dangerous and a misleading thing to do.Turning to PPE which has been an issue in Fermanagh, Mr. Lewis used his own constituency of Great Yarmouth as an example of where there has been ldquono problems with accessing equipment.He added: ldquoWersquove had gowns sent over to the UK, OrsquoNeills [sportswear] converted to gowns, there is gin distillery in your part of the world producing sanitisers.ldquoWersquore shting five and a half million pieces of PPE across to Northern Ireland.

I am cautious about predicting what will be in a few weeksrsquo time.He believes the government could ldquoflatten the curve of Covid-people continue to stay at home, adding: ldquoWe want to see past the peak, you donrsquot want to see a downward trend and ease up as all you do is let it shoot back up again.ldquoIf you think back to the beginning there were some quite scary numbers being put about by some experts about what the deaths might be. Now any death is too many and we have sadly lost people, friends and family who have gone through tragic experiences recently, and the figures are nowhere near those numbers we saw at the beginning.ldquoThatrsquos because the public across Northern Ireland and the UK have done a good job generally of following the guidelines which means we can flatten that curve, he said.Mr. Lewis explained that he had personal experience of people close to him who had been diagnosed with Covid-, including his parliamentary private secretary.ldquoSomeone I know lost a member of their family this week, I have a few people in family who had the disease.

Picture by Colm Lenaghan, PacemakerDeputy First Minister Michelle O#Neill reiterated that the social distancing message has not changed.This virus is still here, and it#s not going away anytime soon, she said.We#re still in the middle of the pandemic. The message has not changed. Everyone must stay at home unless they have a clear need to be out of the house.Commenting on the Executive#s decision to reopen graveyards - which her party had previously opposed, Ms O#Neill said ministers listened carefully to the genuine distress of families who have not been able to visit the grave of a loved one.I understand that there#s a fine balance and making sure that people do not face additional burden in terms of their mental health and wellbeing and also our role in making sure that people are not put at further risk from the transmission of coronavirus, she said.So the opening of graveyards would only be permitted where there are those in charge of burial grounds that can ensure that we have compliance with the regulations and appropriate social distancing.We continue to keep these issues under review.SDLP leader Colum Eastwood has welcomed the decision by the Executive to reopen graveyards.I#m glad that the latest medical and scientic advice offers some relief for those seeking to visit loved ones and that we can permit the opening of cemeteries and graveyards with controls on social distancing, he said.It is a matter of regret that parties publicly moved to dferent positions this week before hearing the advice necessary to make a determination on this issue. This has caused signicant upset for many people.While today#s decision is a welcome easement, it is important that people strictly follow the lockdown guidance. This is not a broad lting of the restrictions. People are still dying in our communities, health service staff are still putting themselves at risk to keep us safe. We need to keep our guard up or more people will lose their lives unnecessarily.The Presbyterian moderator has welcomed the re-opening of cemeteries.Dr William Henry said:Today#s decision will bring much comfort to many, not just those who are grieving the loss of a loved one who passed away recently, but also those who find comfort in being close to those they miss.Mrs Foster agreed with a description by Welsh First Minister Mark Drakeford of President Donald Trump#s comments around disinfectant as extraordinary.It is an extraordinary thing for a US president to say and certainly sure that it is not based on any medical advice, she said.I would concur with Mark Drakeford#s comments in relation to that. It is important that we continue to take medical advice, certainly Michelle or I don#t claim to be virologists at any time, we aren#t experts in the field therefore we are very much led on the advice that we are given both locally and nationally."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus latest updates from around the world ","story":"FRANCEALGERIAPOLANDSPAINCZECH REPUBLICSWEDENJAPANINDIASOUTH KOREAAUSTRALIARead more: Scientists dismiss Donald Trump#s suggestion to treat Covid- patients with disinfectant"},{"url":null,"title":"dogs trust advice prevent potential pet separation anxiety ","story":"NI may ease restrictions at dferent pace to other parts of the UKCoronavirus: PSNI could have Covid- powers shared with others, Executive to make decisionNewsLatestTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisSportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats OnThings To DoArts and EntertainmentNightleRetroLestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensCoronavirusNewsPeopleDogs Trust advice to prevent potential pet separation anxietyDogs Trust is issuing advice to dog owners following concerns over a ticking time bomb of separation anxiety among dogs post lockdown when familiesto their normal routine.By Elinor GlynnThursday, rd April , : pmUpdated Friday, th April , : am\"\"Food search puzzles are a great way to keep your dog occupied when they are having time alone Dogs Trust is advising...If your dog is used to being left alone, then try to make sure you continue to leave them for periods during the day, so they don’t ‘lose’ the ability to cope.For puppies and dogs that are anxious when left, use the following tips to help them cope alone:  \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...Make sure your dog has a comfy bed or den, where they can relax in peace.Give them something fun to occupy them, such as a long-lasting treat or puzzle toy.While your dog is enjoying their treat, take a couple of steps to the other side of the room. If your dog stays where they are, wait a moment, then go back and reward them with an extra treat.Increase the distance you move away and the time you wait before ing with the extra treat. You should soon be able to leave the room and close the door or gate. Progress to spending more time in a dferent room. Build this into the daily routine.It’s important that your dog remains relaxed. If they show signs of distress, leave them for a shorter period, or don’t move as far away, next time.Rachel Casey, Director of Canine Behaviour and Research at Dogs Trust, said: “For many of us it has been great to spend so much time with our dogs during lockdown andmostly our dogs love us being around too. But all this extra attention could potentially create a ticking time bomb of separation anxiety for our dogs. If they expect us to be about all the time, it will be more dficult for them to cope once we go back to our normal lives and aren’t in the house  .“Now is the time to act to avoid future problems – and it’s easy to do. Just make sure that you factor in time apart from your dog each day to help them be able to cope when alone – this could be separated from you by a door or child gate for an hour or two whilst you’re working or home schooling the kids. By organizing your dog’s day, with time apart, play times, exercise, other activity sessionsand quiet times, you can make sure that your dog maintains their ability to cope with the dferent aspects of ‘normal’ le when we get back to it.”For more ideas on how to keep your dog occupied visit www.dogstrust.org.uk--A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Irsquove grown up on the beach.ldquoI normally take landscape pictures because I love the water and some of the sunsets here are incredible, especially in the winter.Rochelle wrote her Instagram handle on the parcels, so that people who found them could send her a message.ldquoIt was just to make someone smile, and Irsquove had some lovely comments from people who got back to me on Instagram, she said.ldquoThey said they were going to put it up in their room and frame it.ldquoSome people were feeling a bit down and didnrsquot expect to find anything, so it cheered them up.ldquoMy job was done ndash the main purpose was to make people smile and it did - it made me smile too.ldquoI think itrsquos very important to say hello, especiallypeople are living by themselves orthey havenrsquot got their family around.ldquoWhen Irsquom normally walking the dog I say hello and have a chat, but itrsquos quite hard to do that now because everyone is quite wary.ldquoI donrsquot have to have that physical contact with someone to brighten up their day.ldquoArt is just a dferent  to communicate with. You knowsomeonersquos a bit shy and they donrsquot want to speak using words, they may want to draw a picture and open up that way instead.ldquoI think art can show feelings that words canrsquot quite express, so itrsquos a great idea to share that with the community.At a time of uncertainty and doubt, Rochelle ended with a message of hope and solidarity:ldquoI think as a community we could do so much more at this time, she saidldquoEveryone is concerned about how long it is going to last, but I am hopeful we can get past it, andwe all work together and remain positive we may come out of this in an even better situation than we was before.Rochelle would like to make clear that all parcels were fully sanitised.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

If your dog stays where they are, wait a moment, then go back and reward them with an extra treat.Increase the distance you move away and the time you wait before ing with the extra treat. You should soon be able to leave the room and close the door or gate. Progress to spending more time in a dferent room. Build this into the daily routine.It’s important that your dog remains relaxed. If they show signs of distress, leave them for a shorter period, or don’t move as far away, next time.Rachel Casey, Director of Canine Behaviour and Research at Dogs Trust, said: “For many of us it has been great to spend so much time with our dogs during lockdown andmostly our dogs love us being around too. But all this extra attention could potentially create a ticking time bomb of separation anxiety for our dogs. If they expect us to be about all the time, it will be more dficult for them to cope once we go back to our normal lives and aren’t in the house  .“Now is the time to act to avoid future problems – and it’s easy to do. Just make sure that you factor in time apart from your dog each day to help them be able to cope when alone – this could be separated from you by a door or child gate for an hour or two whilst you’re working or home schooling the kids. By organizing your dog’s day, with time apart, play times, exercise, other activity sessionsand quiet times, you can make sure that your dog maintains their ability to cope with the dferent aspects of ‘normal’ le when we get back to it.”For more ideas on how to keep your dog occupied visit www.dogstrust.org.uk--A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

A very tough time for many many people.”SDLP Upper Bann said they were awaiting further details of opening hours and how it can be managed with social distancing but added: “For many people this visit is very important to them as part of their grieving process and something which they did on a daily basis prior to the pandemic.“The lockdown has robbed them of that special moment in the day where they go to visit the resting place of their loved ones.”Cemeteries were closed when social distancing measures were introduced towards the end of March .The NI Executive met on Friday afternoon and agreed that cemeteries throughout Northern Ireland could reopen.“This is about balancing public health concerns with the basic human need for people to visit their loved ones,” said First Minister Foster.Mrs Foster stressed it remains vitally important that the public remember they must continue to adhere to social distancing guidelines and wash their hands.Sinn Fein and the Alliance Party had previously supported the decision to close cemeteries across Northern Ireland.However, deputy First Minister and Sinn Fein vice-president, Michelle O’Neill, said the decision to re-open cemeteries came about because they had “listened carefully to the genuine distress of families who have not been able to visit the grave of a loved one”.“I understand that there’s a fine balance and making sure that people do not face additional burden in terms of their mental health and well-being and also our role in making sure that people are not put at further risk from the transmission of coronavirus,” she said.“So the opening of graveyards would only be permitted where there are those in charge of burial grounds that can ensure that we have compliance with the regulations and appropriate social distancing.“We continue to keep these issues under review,” she said.\"\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bEjcJn boXdXt\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-fOICqy kfiVLF\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bEjcJn boXdXt\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-fOICqy kfiVLF\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportWhats OnLestyleMore from Portadown TimesAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-bYSBpT sc-elJkPf kHpvMx\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisCoronavirusSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessFollow us    "},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1587656147249.jpg--marts_to_reopen_gradually.jpg?158765614700","title":"marts to reopen gradually ","story":"THE Department for Agriculture, Environment and Ruralaffairs has welcomed the decision by the Northern Ireland Livestock and Auctioneers’ Associationto open Livestock Marts on a gradual basis from Monday,  April.Livestock Marts closed voluntarily on  March - including Rathfriland Co-Op and Hilltown Saleyard - in response to Covid- health and safety concerns. Recently mart operators trialled a number of successful online sales to enable livestock trading to continue and are now gradually moving towards re-opening on a phased basis from next Monday, with some restrictions in place.In welcoming the decision, a spokesman said: “Farmers are key workers and are continuing to provide food for us all in very challenging circumstances. Part of that food supply chain is the ability to trade and sell animals.“Staff within the Department have maintained regular contact with Livestock Mart operators over recent weeks and have been reassured that robust operational protocols, developed by the Marts in conjunction with other stakeholders, will enable them to conduct business in a manner that is safe for staff, farmers and buyers and adheres to social distancing requirements.“DAERA therefore welcomes the decision to recommence sales of primestock, cull animals and store stock on a gradual basis from week commencing  April.  addthis, Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_dbcafeacacdf   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_ebbfeaddceccc   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]  []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"}]
