(Picture: Alexander Crawley)What I Rent is ’s weekly series that takes you inside people’s rentals in London.Because trying to find a place in London to rent can be hellish.It’s tricky to know how much is a ‘normal’ amount to be paying each month. Countless viewings make you start to genuinely consider living in a flat with a fold-out bed in the kitchen. Meanwhile, you see other people’s perfectly decorated homes on Instagram and wonder what on earth you’re doing wrong.There’s a lot of mystery and confusion when it comes to renting, which isn’t helped by estate agents’ very flattering photos of ‘cosy’ studio flats and the average renter’s reticence to openly chat about what they’re getting for how much they’re paying.**Either because they’re embarrassed by just how much they’re spending, or they don’t want to make us all feel bad because they have a bargain.To get rid of the mystery, we’re going inside different Londoners’ rented properties each week, for a look at all the bits landlords might not show you.This week we’re talking to Miranda and George, who live with their two cats, Chess and Cinder.They pay £1,283 per month, plus £170 in bills. (Picture: Alexander Crawley)How much are you paying?Miranda: We pay roughly £1,283, plus £170 a month in bills. We’ve been trying to a more eco-friendly electricity provider but they keep screwing up the account.Bizarrely, this was the cheapest flat we could find and it’s in the nicest area we looked. Some es in North London are charging over £1,300 a month for what looks like a slightly spruced up slum.And what are you getting for that price?Miranda: It’s got three rooms and a balcony – a bedroom, a bathroom, and an open plan livingcookingdining space.It’s in Highgate, just down from Boogaloo. We’re not talking Highgate Village here (the ultra expensive, lush bit), but we were drinking in the same local as Jude Law last weekend….How long have you lived there?The flat has a bedroom, a bathroom, and an open plan living roomdining roomkitchen. (Picture: Alexander Crawley)How did you find it?Miranda: We set off one day determined to not return to my parent’s house until we’d found a flat.We started in Camden and walked up here – stopping at every single estate agent. We were just about to give up and head back east when we spotted a tiny estate agent next to Highgate station, and this was the first property they showed us. We fell immediately in love.George: Through a lot of searching. For the price we’re paying and the areas we were looking at, it was quite a full on process and we missed out on a couple of places before finally finding this one. But I’d say this was the best of any we saw for the price.And do you like it?We’re perfectly positioned at the top of the hill between Archway, Muswell Hill, Crouch End and Highgate Village. It’s perfect for running (try running up the hill from Chalk Farm and you’ll soon get a sweat on), it’s leafy, it’s got great transport links and there are any number of bars and restaurants.Unfortunately, we moved here in November when it was dark and miserable and we were both on quite strict training regimes so we’re only just starting to get to know the area properly and take full advantage of all its features.It was the cheapest place the couple could find. (Picture: Alexander Crawley)I’m learning to play tennis in the most beautiful park five minutes from the flat and as soon as the weather comes back, we’re off to start swimming in Hampstead Ponds.Oh, and it’s super quick to get to the Emirates which is a blessing given the number of mid week 7.45 kick off games!George: Yes, I’m very much happy with where we live. It’s quiet enough to escape a lot of hustle and bustle from the centre of London but has easy and quick access to virtually wherever we’d want to go.We’re still exploring the area having moved in relatively recently but there’s certainly a bit more of a suburban feel, which suits me as I’m not originally from here.Do you have enough space for both of you and the cats?Miranda: Yes, but we have a lot of crap – we’re both hoarders. You can never have enough space.George: Absolutely. The balcony really adds an extra dimension in the summer and catches the sun from that side but even when not using that in the warm weather, I’ve not felt cramped at all.The balcony is a definite highlight. (Picture: Alexander Crawley)Are there any annoying bits about the place where you live?Miranda: At the start I couldn’t work out how to operate the heating and there’s a serious draft from the balcony (no double glazing). But now that it’s warmer, that draft is kind of a blessing.George: Not really. Again, not being from London, I’d say the price we’re paying is absolutely extortionate for what we’re getting (even though we do really like it) but that’s more of a general gripe with living in this ridiculously overpriced city, I guess…Any plans to move again?Miranda: Next year…but who’s to say what or where.George: I’d be happy to escape London ASAP but don’t have any immediate plans to go anywhere.Or who knows? I might even start saving some money elsewhere…And have you thought about buying a place?Miranda: I lived at home for so long with the express purpose of saving for my own place. I still haven’t given up hope although I’m starting to wonder if it wouldn’t be more expedient to just buy somewhere outside of London.My dad kept nagging me to buy somewhere in Barking a few years ago and I scoffed at him – why would I want a place even further out than my parents?Now, of course, they’re saying that Barking is THE place to invest and prices have already doubled. I’m a fool.Now, let’s have a nosy around Miranda and George’s place…What I Rent is \u0027s weekly series that takes you inside the places in London people are renting, to give us all a better sense of what\u0027s normal and how much we should be paying. If you fancy taking part, please email whatirent@metro. You\u0027ll need to have pictures taken of your kitchen, living room, bathroom, and bedroom, plus a few photos of you in your room. Make sure you get permission for your housemates!You\u0027ll also need to be okay with sharing how much you\u0027re paying for rent, as that\u0027s pretty important.

And as the financial details of the merger were revealed early yesterday, my phone rang off the hook.Sainsbury’s most senior executives were clearly fearful that regulators and politicians will be more concerned about potential harm to consumers and suppliers than with the positive impact for investors.I was assured by one of the architects of the deal that it must be a ‘win-win’ situation.Since 85 per cent of what the big grocers buy comes from 100 big suppliers, the deal would give the Sainsbury’s-Asda conglomerate added muscle in its dealings.Astonishing moment Sainsbury’s CEO sings ‘We’re in the...Competition watchdog will probe £12bn merger of Sainsbury\u0027s...Share this article    Sainsbury’s chief executive Mike Coupe (pictured) wants to win consumer support with the promise of ‘lower prices by 10 per cent on many of the products customers buy regularly’This is not quite true, however, because Walmart will be the biggest shareholder in the new Sainsbury’s-Asda set-up with 42 per cent of the shares and a third of the votes in the company. There is always excitement when a major merger is announced, but experience tells me that when the public-relations machine is running at full tilt, one should never allow spin to outweigh basic economics.Consumers shouldn’t kid themselves that Sainsbury’s boss Mike Coupe’s 10 per cent price reductions will necessarily mean an overall cut in the cost in a shopping basket across the huge range of branded, own label and fresh produce goods offered by the new group.Other concerns were aired in Parliament yesterday, where MPs expressed fears not only about job security, but also on whether supermarkets would close in their areas.Sainsbury’s says there are no plans to close stores, but the company will seek ‘operational efficiencies’ of £500million – which will surely result in job losses in the long run. The thinking is that, if there are only Sainsbury’s and Asda stores in a given area, they could effectively operate a monopoly and so one would have to be sold off to a rival supermarket chain.Analysis suggests that, as a result of such overlap, as many as 75 Asda stores will have to be disposed of if this merger is to have any chance of winning approval.Such a large estment could undermine the financial rationale for the deal, and could take years to complete at a time when the whole retail sector is under stress. It is suggested that the new merged company will seek to keep the Sainsbury and Asda brands separate, with the former maintaining its focus on quality, and Asda continuing to push cheaper own-brand products which will compete with the upstart discounters like Lidl and Aldi.But Sainsbury’s tried this with Dutch discounter Netto, and ended up losing £20million after having to close a series of stores where the brands had been sited together.    Sainsbury’s says there are no plans to close stores, but the company will seek ‘operational efficiencies’ of £500million – which will surely result in job losses in the long runLargely the brainchild of Mike Coupe at Sainsbury’s and his ex-colleague Dave Cheesewright at Asda, this merger has been two years in the making. Both firms have been trying to figure out how to deal with the huge global threat from Amazon, which arguably has the best logistics, warehousing and delivery technology, as well as almost unlimited financial resources.Amazon is challenging Asda owner Walmart in the US with the purchase of bricks-and-mortar retail firm Whole Foods Market, and starting to make incursions in the UK, too. Sainsbury’s argues it is in a strong position to integrate Asda because both companies have embraced the best of new technology.Be that as it may, we should heed the lessons of last week’s disastrous IT meltdown at the TSB – that technological change can be chaotic if companies get it wrong.Sainsbury’s is still digesting IT and distribution changes that came with the purchase of Argos owner Home Retail Group two years ago.The Sainsbury’s-Asda merger gives the impression of being a sensible deal designed to create a new leader in British shopping. But like many big mergers, it is a roll of the dice designed in part to cover-up grave shortcomings in the strategy of the managements concerned. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/01/01/4BB82F0900000578-5676427-image-a-7_1525134998370.jpg","title":"Instagram star living posting bikini selfies reveals dirty truth clean eating","story":"    Daniella poses on the beach drinking fresh coconut waterWhile sales of clean-eating cookbooks soar, dietitians and psychiatrists warn that this lifestyle can quickly tip into an all-consuming eating disorder. This is what happened to me.I can trace its beginnings to my older sister’s hen do, surrounded by her beautiful friends. They all had perfect jobs, perfect skin, perfect bodies. I’d just finished drama school, was in debt and living with my parents, and had no plan.Later, chatting to a friend, I said I wasn’t feeling good: bloated, foggy brain, generally ‘bleugh’. She recommended a ‘clean living’ book. ‘It will change your life,’ she said. ‘It teaches you how to be kind to your body, your skin, your weight, your mind, your energy levels, everything.’ An easy sell.I was a healthy size 8-10.  Daniella posted flattering photos on social media, despite suffering from an eating disorderI’d been diagnosed with coeliac disease (an auto-immune condition where the body reacts to gluten) a few years earlier, so I had already cut gluten out of my diet, but otherwise I enjoyed food and ate a varied diet.But the book insisted I cut out dairy, then sugar and then meat and grains.Then, it promised, I would be clean. I would feel better.Why getting a dog is so good for you: People raised in...Should you be worried about E. coli in your lunchtime salad?...Which tea to drink to make you healthier, happier and...A stick-on skin patch for hay fever that blocks the release...Share this articleI joined my local gym, too — and along with my new diet, it gave me a much sought-after routine. It was around this time I downloaded the social media app Instagram. I started posting about my progress online and got endless compliments. I finally felt I was in control.And I was supported by a whole community. Bloggers such as Deliciously Ella, Honestly Healthy, Clean Eating Alice — they were all there to inspire me. The weight dropped off. It became my religion.Then, a theatre show I’d created and acted in transferred to Australia. This is where my ‘clean’ lifestyle went up a gear. My days consisted of exercise first thing, brunch (so I didn’t have to eat breakfast and lunch) of avocado and eggs, and later a vegetable-filled dinner.  Daniella was inspired by bloggers such as Deliciously Ella (left) and Clean Eating Alice (right) When I came back to London, I couldn’t get off the wellness treadmill. I started ghost-writing for ‘clean living’ brands, developing recipes. I even launched a brand of granola.The job was the perfect way to retain total control: alcohol was banned from events, every menu was free from sugar and gluten, and detailed descriptions of exercise routines were accepted as dinner party conversation.After about six months of eating clean, my sister and mum voiced their concerns to me, but I ignored them.Even when a wellness expert I was writing for took me to one side and said my lifestyle was getting ‘excessive’ . . . I didn’t listen.It was only in November 2016 that I began to reassess. My sister announced she was pregnant — it was a sharp wake-up call reminding me that I hadn’t had a period in over two years.  Daniella moved to Australia where her eating disorder worsenedI went to the gynaecologist who said that although my weight was within the ‘normal’ range, my oestrogen level was non-existent. He explained that to conserve energy, my body had stopped releasing the hormone.I now know that I was in the grip of orthorexia an eating disorder characterised as an unhealthy obsession with healthy living. The doctor didn’t diagnose this specifically, because it is not yet officially recognised by medical bodies.But once I had explained my lifestyle to him, it was clear my disorder was far from rare. ‘If you were a plant,’ he said, ‘you’d be withered and on your way out. Your body hasn’t been nourished in a long time. You need to learn to love yourself again. What are you scared of?’I hated the question. I was scared of the thoughts in my head, scared of being a failure.I knew I had to change if I wanted to bring my periods back. I felt angry at the wellness world. I’d spent so much time, money and headspace obsessively following the rules, only for them to make me sick.          Daniella would eat just avocado and eggs for brunch and vegetables for dinnerThe gynaecologist suggested therapy, but I wasn’t ready for deep reflection (and the NHS waiting list was long), so I turned to a group I found on Facebook called ‘No period, now what?’ Here, I found hundreds of women like me. Many had fallen into orthorexic habits.Their advice was simple: ‘Let go’. No rules, no recipes, no detoxes, no cleanses, no selfies.I started with small, incremental steps. I’d miss one day of exercise, I’d have porridge for breakfast instead of a smoothie. Then, I’d let friends choose where we went for dinner. I ate carbs, real carbs.I hated seeing my body change. My hard-earned abs turned to soft rolls. I had bursts of rage and deep sadness. I felt like a failure, mentally and physically.Each month I went back to the fertility clinic for blood tests. I’d be surrounded by women who were hoping to get pregnant I was just hoping to feel like a woman again.It took six weeks before my oestrogen level rose. After four months my period came back, just in time for opening night of my new show, Hear Me Raw.I wanted the production to reveal the dirty truth behind the clean living movement.Because despite how it might have looked on Instagram, I had never felt less well. The so-called wellness industry isn’t really selling wellness, is it? It’s the diet industry dressed up in candy-coloured phrases of empowerment. And it’s making us sick."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/29/08/4BAB49F100000578-0-image-a-2_1524987300622.jpg","title":"London born scientist flies Swiss clinic end life regrets having lived 104","story":"    Australia\u0027s oldest scientist , Dr David Goodall (pictured), wants to fly to Switzerland to end his life          Dr Goodall (pictured middle) does not have a terminal illness but greatly regrets having lived to 104Dr Goodall was born in London in 1914, and is an eminent botanist and ecologist. He came to Australia to in 1948, taking up a lecturing position at the University of Melbourne.   Dr Goodall celebrated his 104th birthday in early April and has since decided it is time to access voluntarily euthanasia in Switzerland.\u0027People who are gravely ill should have their pain relieved,...Landmark euthanasia bill passes as Victoria becomes the...Share this articleWest Australia is still in the process of introducing voluntary euthanasia laws which would be restricted to people with a terminal illness. Premier Mark McGowan said the government would not assist Dr Goodall due to the fact he is not suffering from a terminal illness.

It wasn’t the right policy when Labour first proposed it, and that remains the case.’When Mrs May first entered the Home Office, she oversaw the destruction of Labour’s identity card database, scuppering a scheme which at that stage was voluntary.

better known as the former MP Douglas Hogg, infamous for expense claims to clean his moat - said voters could not have made a final decision on Brexit without knowing the terms of the deal          He has secured support for a major amendment to the flagship Brexit laws going through Parliament that would radically strengthen the so-called \u0027meaningful vote\u0027 on the final deal          Former Tory leader Lord Michael Howard told the Lords the rebel amendment demonstrated the \u0027appalling lengths\u0027 Remain backers would go to frustrate the referendum voteViscount Hailsham was joined in the lobby by 18 other Tory rebels including ex ministers Michael Heseltine, Ros Altmann and David Willetts.  Following last night\u0027s vote, Brexit Minister Lord Callanan said the Government was \u0027disappointed\u0027 and would now consider the implications of the vote.He said: \u0027What this amendment would do is weaken the UK\u0027s hand in our negotiations with the EU by giving Parliament unprecedented powers to instruct the Government to do anything with regard to the negotiations – including trying to keep the UK in the EU indefinitely.\u0027It is absolutely right that Parliament is able to scrutinise the final deal, and that is why we have already committed to giving both Houses a vote on the final deal.Shadow Brexit Secretary Sir Keir Starmer hailed the vote as a crucial moment in the wrestle for control over Brexit between Parliament and ministers.He said: \u0027Labour won the argument at the end of last year for Parliament to be given a meaningful vote on the terms of our withdrawal from the EU. And we are clear that it must be just that: a meaningful vote.\u0027If Parliament votes down the Article 50 deal, then Parliament must decide what happens next.\u0027Under no circumstances can the Prime Minister be given a blank cheque to crash the UK out of the EU without a deal.\u0027   Opening the debate, Lord Hailsham said: \u0027At the very best it was an interim decision.\u0027It was an instruction to the Government to negotiate withdrawal on the best terms that could be achieved.\u0027A final and conclusive decision can only be made when these options have crystallised.\u0027   Lib Dem Lord Roberts (left) compared the legislation to that empowering Hitler, remarks that prompted Brexiteer Tory Lord Fairfax to attack a \u0027cabal of Remainers\u0027 in the Lords Lord Roberts told peers: \u0027My mind went back to Berlin in March 1933, when the Enabling Bill was passed in the Reichstag.\u0027That Enabling Bill transferred democratic rights of the parliament into the hands of one man, that was the Chancellor. His name was Adolf Hitler.\u0027Perhaps I\u0027m seeing threats that do not exist, but they are there, they are possible. Who\u0027d have said before the 1930s that Germany, this cultured country, would involve itself in such a terrible war.\u0027 Lord Hailsham said Parliament - led by MPs - must be able to decide whether to accept no deal, send ministers back to renegotiate, order a new referendum or even stay in the EU on the current terms.Former Tory leader Lord Michael Howard told the Lords the rebel amendment demonstrated the \u0027appalling lengths\u0027 Remain backers would go to frustrate the referendum vote.  Conservative Lord Fairfax branded the Lords a \u0027cosy cabal of Remain\u0027 and attacker Remain supporters as \u0027fifth columnists\u0027 as he lashed the wrecking amendment.  Ahead of today\u0027s vote, Mrs May\u0027s spokesman said: \u0027Fundamentally, the British people voted to leave the EU and the Government is delivering on that.\u0027It is simply not right that Parliament could overturn this.\u0027It is absolutely right that Parliament is able to scrutinise the final deal, and that is why we have already committed to giving both houses a vote on the final deal.\u0027          Theresa May (pictured at a school near Manchester yesterday) lashed out at unelected peers who are trying to \u0027overturn\u0027 the will of the British people with a series of Brexit Bill wrecking amendmentsLater the Government suffered another defeat on the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill after peers backed plans to give Parliament a say on Britain\u0027s mandate for Brexit talks.An amendment led by Labour\u0027s Lord Monks and supported by a cross-party group of peers was supported by 270 votes to 233, majority 37.Brexit minister Lord Callanan said it was for the Government rather than Parliament to set the mandate for negotiations over the UK\u0027s future relationship with the EU.However, Labour indicated it was supporting the amendment, which would require parliamentary approval for this mandate. Responding to the Government\u0027s second defeat on Monday, on parliamentary approval for the UK\u0027s negotiating mandate, a spokesman for the Department for Exiting the European Union said: \u0027We are disappointed that the House of Lords has voted for this amendment in spite of the assurances we have provided.\u0027Parliament has been updated regularly throughout the negotiations and we have already committed to giving both the House of Commons and the House of Lords a vote on the withdrawal agreement and the terms of our future relationship with the EU.\u0027But it is for the Government, not Parliament, to set our goals for the negotiations on the UK\u0027s exit from the EU and to conduct them.\u0027We will now consider the implications of this decision.\u0027  "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/01/09/4BB5DC6F00000578-5677543-The_video_shows_him_singing_the_lyrics_we_re_in_the_money_the_sk-m-46_1525165079611.jpg","title":"Sainsburys boss caught singing money sang James Blunts Youre Beautiful prawn","story":"    Mike Coupe\u0027s impromptu performance of \u0027We\u0027re in the Money\u0027 is not his first forray into the world of music having once sang James Blunt\u0027s You\u0027re Beautiful to a giant prawn to get 5,000 staff to sell more seafood at Christmas  The video shows him singing the lyrics \u0027we\u0027re in the money, the sky is sunny, let\u0027s spend it, lend it, send it, rolling along\u0027 and as well as musicals he also like Mr Blunt\u0027s music          During the \u0027unguarded\u0027 moment the Sainsbury\u0027s boss also takes a sip of his coffee in an off-air PR disaster now dubbed \u0027doing a Coupe\u0027The two-year plot to create a £51bn supermarket titan:...\u0027At least 75 Asda stores would have to be sold off\u0027: Can...Why I still don\u0027t buy it: ALEX BRUMMER says the Sainsbury\u0027s...Competition watchdog will probe £12bn merger of Sainsbury\u0027s...CITY DIARY: Fred Astaire moment won\u0027t be the only surprise...Share this articleYesterday he was forced into a humbling apology for his \u0027unfortunate choice of song\u0027 and the hiccup has been branded one of the worst PR blunders in recent  history.Mr Coupe was recorded singing \u0027We\u0027re in the Money\u0027 from the musical 42nd Street in between TV interviews.

In his words, \u0027What this means is the deal was not constructed on a foundation of good faith or transparency. It was built on Iran\u0027s lies.\u0027 France said today that Netanyahu\u0027s claims reinforced the importance of the 2015 deal that imposes controls on the Islamic republic.\u0027The pertinence of the deal is reinforced by the details presented by Israel: all activity linked to the development of a nuclear weapon is permanently forbidden by the deal,\u0027 said a foreign ministry spokesperson. British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said Netanyahu\u0027s presentation \u0027underlines the importance\u0027 of the controls imposed on Tehran three years ago.  Tehran, which has denied ever seeking nuclear weapons, dismissed Netanyahu\u0027s move as a \u0027ridiculous\u0027 show but did not address the documents produced by Netanyahu.Israeli minister Yoav Galant told Israel\u0027s Army Radio he suspected Trump was leaning toward nixing the deal, which would likely lead to a growing confrontation between Israel and Iran.           Netanyahu\u0027s speech was delivered in English and relied on his trademark use of visual aids          Supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said on Monday that Iran is keen to develop ties with the rest of the world, which is \u0027not merely\u0027 the United States and European countriesBut he said Israel was prepared and doubted Iran would challenge Israel, given the humbling blow it was delivered.\u0027Anyone who saw the intelligence achievement can also understand what our military capabilities are,\u0027 he said. \u0027I assume that everyone around us will think long and hard before they try to harm Israel.\u0027Trump has signaled he will pull out of the agreement by May 12 unless it is revised, but he faces intense pressure from European allies not to do so. Israeli officials said the information it gathered had been shared in advance with the Americans, in an apparent hope of influencing Trump\u0027s decision.However, Netanyahu\u0027s presentation, delivered on live TV from Israeli military headquarters in Tel Aviv, did not appear to provide evidence that Iran has violated the 2015 deal, raising questions about whether it would sway international opinion ahead of Trump\u0027s decision.

Israel considers Iran to be its biggest threat, citing Tehran\u0027s hostile rhetoric, support for militants and growing influence in the region.Israel has said it will not allow Iran to establish a permanent military presence in neighboring Syria, where Iran supports President Bashar Assad. Just before midnight Sunday, a missile attack in northern Syria killed more than a dozen pro-government fighters, many of them Iranians, a war monitoring group and an Iranian news agency said.There was no official confirmation of the death toll or the target but Israel was widely suspected of being behind the attack.  "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/01/11/007B4EC400000258-0-image-a-11_1525170792224.jpg","title":"Eerie pictures abandoned set childrens favourite Tots TV filmed","story":"    Tots TV was a British children\u0027s television programme, produced by Ragdoll Productions and Central featuring three ragdoll friends \u0027We found that the famous red door at the front of the house had been removed and was nowhere to be found.\u0027This was quite sad to see as it was an iconic part of the house.\u0027          The programme featured three ragdoll friends: Tilly, a French girl, with red hair,  Tom, a blue-haired boy with glasses, and Tiny, the youngest Tot, with green hair Scroll down for video... Latino dance craze Scooby-Doo Papa hits America and promises...Costumes assemble!

Tots TV was filmed in such a way that the floor was rarely shown on camera.           The dilapidated shell of the TV set is very different to its glory days, during the 1990s, with is rotting roof, broken windows and missing floorboards.\u0027This allowed for hatches to be built into the floor so that the puppeteers could hide below.\u0027I mainly had a sense of nostalgia when I saw the set. \u0027I remember watching Tots TV on VHS tapes when I was younger and I would never have thought that I would visit the filming location one day.           The three little friends also had a donkey and a rat for company and had a magic sack \u0027It was also sad to see it in this state, I have had many people comment on my video that feel the same way and have even called for it to be restored and turned into some sort of attraction.\u0027Producers won a number of awards including two BAFTAs.           The TV house was a genuine, approximately 13 of the size, cottage purposely built for the show in the woods on a farm in Stratford Upon Avon Tots TV first aired on January 4 1993 and finished on 27 April 1998 after more than 15 years entertaining British children on ITV.Tots TV was first broadcast on CITV and then was picked up by Public Service Broadcasting in the United States where the French speaking puppet changed to a Spanish speaking one. Those who watched it will remember that the three puppets who lived there had a pet donkey who was creatively named Donkey.           There are electrical wires connected to a roof which is covered in holes The TV show was written by two of its puppeteers and was hugely successful and syndicated around the world. In 2000 Discovery Kids bought the series and put it on television screens in Central and South America, the Caribbean and the Falkland Islands.Producers made special episodes of the series were produced for both and VHS release.They were so popular that they included a series of episodes set in the USA.The show which was called a \u0027Big Treasure Adventure\u0027 featured the puppets adventures on a pirate ship.            The now dilapidated shell home is in a terrible condition and has smashed windows and the doors are missing A number of Christmas specials, including one filmed in Rovaniemi, Finland, were also released to audiences to acclaim.Each of those shows were designed as educational video specials and went on sale in 1997.  The show may have ended 20 years ago but it is still on British TV thanks to BBC children\u0027s channel Cebeebies which broadcasts episodes on its internet platform.  Children loved the theme tune which was sang in the UK in both French and English and taught youngsters how to count in the language.          The staircase is broken and the fireplace is no longer in use in the once pretty little cottage The little puppets relied upon a magic sac or bag to help them through the narrative of the episodes.Designed for pre-school children the show also introduced youngsters to nature and a plethora of animals and aquatic life.          The outside is covered in moss and the walls are cracked as discarded flowers lay abandoned While nowhere to be seen in this photos the puppets also had help around their property from Jack the gardener who offered them a helping hand.Other episodes encouraged children to be active and even to undertake tasks \u0027super quickly\u0027.Among the other shows the Tots dressed up as pirates and went to a treasure island.           Electrical wires can still be seen in the shell home which hasn\u0027t been used for two decadesWhile music was also part of the narrative with the female puppet Tilly having a magical flute which she played to the other characters.The Tots also took trips out of their Warwickshire cottage and visited the seaside and in another popular episode visited an airport.           The cottage is completely unrecognisable from its original state and is wrecked inside and outThe characters also had access to a boat and often found fun things to do including games and meeting animal friends including Brian the cat. Each episode lasted for 20 minutes and a number of exciting adventures ensued including a visit to Loch Ness in Scotland where the trio went on the hunt for the world famous monster who has also appeared in other cartoons like Scooby Doo.          The inside of the cottage is dark and wrecked and is nothing like the colourful cottage  A total of 276 episodes of the popular television show were made before the show was eventually taken off air for a final time in 1998.The programme was eventually replaced by another Ragdoll puppet production in the year 2000.

Malaysia Airlines flight 370  (pictured) vanished en route to Beijing from Kuala Lumpur on March 8 2014 with 239 people on board.          Debris from the missing flight have been found in a number of locations with currents carrying them to Africa and Madagascar\u0027Everyone at Ocean Infinity remains absolutely determined for the remainder of the search.\u0027MH370 disappeared on March 8, 2014 en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. There were 239 people aboard. No transmissions were received from the aircraft after its first 38 minutes of flight, but it is believed to have crashed in the far southern Indian Ocean based on the drift patterns of crash debris that washed ashore on distant beaches.The governments of Malaysia, China and Australia called off the nearly three-year official search in January 2017. The Australian Transport Safety Bureau\u0027s final report on the search conceded authorities were no closer to knowing the reasons for the plane\u0027s disappearance or its exact location.          An initial multinational search cost Australian, Malaysian and Chinese taxpayers $200million. This piece of aircraft debris was discovered on the island of Pemba, off the coast of TanzaniaIn January, the Malaysian government pledged to pay Texas-based Ocean Infinity up to $70million if it could find the wreckage or black boxes of the aircraft within 90 days. Ocean Infinity uses up to eight autonomous vehicles capable of operating in depths up to 6,000 meters - and Plunkett had launched the search saying his company had \u0027a realistic prospect\u0027 of finding the aircraft.He said Monday its technology had performed \u0027exceptionally well,\u0027 with \u0027significant amounts of high quality data\u0027 collected.The company\u0027s Seabed Constructor research vessel is stopping in the West Australian port of Fremantle, for resupply and crew rotation before returning to the search until it\u0027s forced to quit in the southern hemisphere\u0027s winter.Plunkett\u0027s statement indicated Ocean Infinity\u0027s search could be halted before mid-June, due to weather conditions at sea."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/01/09/4BB26C7C00000578-5677433-In_a_toe_curling_GMB_interview_shadow_home_secretary_Diane_Abbot-a-50_1525161787288.jpg","title":"Shadow cabinet minister defies Corbyn ID cards","story":"    Shadow international trade minister Barry Gardiner told the BBC\u0027s Newsnight that the government needed a better way to \u0027establish who is here legally\u0027          In a toe-curling GMB interview yesterday, shadow home secretary Diane Abbott dodged as she was pressed to spell out whether she would take action to expel illegal immigrantsIn a toe-curling interview with Piers Morgan on ITV\u0027s GMB programme, she said she did not want an amnesty – but also rejected kicking them all out. Mr Gardiner raised the idea of ID cards as he was pressed on how Labour would avoid a repeat of the Windrush fiasco.  “You need to try and have a system that can establish who is here legally,” he told BBC\u0027s Newsnight. Asked if he was supporting ID cards, Mr Gardiner said: “It was a policy the Labour Party had in 2009. Sajid Javid arrives for first Cabinet meeting since Rudd\u0027s...On his first day in a new job, Mr Javid was free of...Share this article\u0027Theresa May when she became home secretary actually abolished that policy. But it would have given the government a way of knowing through those biometric ID cards who was here legally and who wasn’t.” Pushed again on whether he supported ID cards, Mr Gardiner replied: “We need to have much better ways of tracking people through the system.”Former Foreign Secretary Lord Hague today added his voice to calls for ID cards. “It would be worth thinking again about bringing in universal identity cards,” Lord Hague wrote in his Telegraph column. “We Conservatives were against this a decade ago, but times have moved on.” Yesterday Alan Johnson, and Charles Clarke, who both ran the Home Office under Labour in the 2000s, argued that biometric ID cards were the ‘best way to prove and so protect a citizen’s identity’.          Jeremy Corbyn, pictured on the local election campaign trail yesterday, voted against ID cards during the 2000s Ken Clarke, who was Tory Home Secretary in the early 1990s, also said ID cards would help deal with illegal immigration from Africa and the Middle East.However, it is understood Theresa May has ruled out bringing in such a scheme, which critics say would breach civil liberties.A Whitehall source said: ‘This Government is not going to introduce mandatory ID cards. It wasn’t the right policy when Labour first proposed it, and that remains the case.’When Mrs May first entered the Home Office, she oversaw the destruction of Labour’s identity card database, scuppering a scheme which at that stage was voluntary. Only around 15,000 cards were ever distributed.A law abolishing ID cards and the national identity register was the first to come out of the Home Office during the coalition government.At the time Mrs May said it would ‘begin the process of reversing the erosion of civil liberties and restoring freedoms’. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/01/09/4BB9972C00000578-0-Liam_Fox_pictured_on_Sky_News_today_has_accused_unelected_peers_-m-2_1525163260701.jpg","title":"Liam Fox accuses unelected peers trying block democratic people","story":"    Theresa May (pictured in Ulverston yesterday) today told her Cabinet today the House of Lords must not try to tie her hands in Brexit talks as she vowed a \u0027robust\u0027 response to a crushing defeat          Liam Fox (pictured on Sky News today) has accused unelected peers of trying to \u0027block the democratic will of the people\u0027 after the latest huge vote against Government Brexit plans          EU negotiator Michel Barnier is in Derry today (pictured) as he continues a tour of the Irish border The International Trade Secretary told Sky News: \u0027Now we have the unelected house actually trying to block the democratic will of the British people.\u0027This is a question about whether the will of the British people will be respected or not, and it must be.\u0027Asked by the BBC if Theresa May was now \u0027horribly weakened\u0027 he said: \u0027We don\u0027t have a parliamentary majority, that\u0027s for sure.\u0027That makes life harder.\u0027 Reviving plans for ID cards would prevent repeat of Windrush...Jacob Rees-Mogg rubbishes May\u0027s plans for a customs...GUY ADAMS: How an immigrant bus driver\u0027s son who survived a...Share this articleLast night\u0027s major amendment to the flagship Brexit laws going through Parliament radically strengthens the so-called \u0027meaningful vote\u0027 on the final deal.Tabled by Viscount Hailsham - better known as the former MP Douglas Hogg, infamous for expense claims to clean his moat - it will remove the right of ministers to quit Brexit talks without a deal and hand the decision to Parliament instead.Later the Government suffered another defeat when peers voted 270 to 233 to back plans giving Parliament a say on Britain\u0027s mandate for Brexit talks.             Viscount Hailsham - better known as the former MP Douglas Hogg, infamous for expense claims to clean his moat - said voters could not have made a final decision on Brexit without knowing the terms of the deal          He has secured support for a major amendment to the flagship Brexit laws going through Parliament that would radically strengthen the so-called \u0027meaningful vote\u0027 on the final deal          Former Tory leader Lord Michael Howard told the Lords the rebel amendment demonstrated the \u0027appalling lengths\u0027 Remain backers would go to frustrate the referendum voteViscount Hailsham was joined in the lobby by 18 other Tory rebels including ex ministers Michael Heseltine, Ros Altmann and David Willetts.  Following last night\u0027s vote, Brexit Minister Lord Callanan said the Government was \u0027disappointed\u0027 and would now consider the implications of the vote.He said: \u0027What this amendment would do is weaken the UK\u0027s hand in our negotiations with the EU by giving Parliament unprecedented powers to instruct the Government to do anything with regard to the negotiations – including trying to keep the UK in the EU indefinitely.\u0027It is absolutely right that Parliament is able to scrutinise the final deal, and that is why we have already committed to giving both Houses a vote on the final deal.Shadow Brexit Secretary Sir Keir Starmer hailed the vote as a crucial moment in the wrestle for control over Brexit between Parliament and ministers.He said: \u0027Labour won the argument at the end of last year for Parliament to be given a meaningful vote on the terms of our withdrawal from the EU. And we are clear that it must be just that: a meaningful vote.\u0027If Parliament votes down the Article 50 deal, then Parliament must decide what happens next.\u0027Under no circumstances can the Prime Minister be given a blank cheque to crash the UK out of the EU without a deal.\u0027   Opening the debate, Lord Hailsham said: \u0027At the very best it was an interim decision.\u0027It was an instruction to the Government to negotiate withdrawal on the best terms that could be achieved.\u0027A final and conclusive decision can only be made when these options have crystallised.\u0027   Lib Dem Lord Roberts (left) compared the legislation to that empowering Hitler, remarks that prompted Brexiteer Tory Lord Fairfax to attack a \u0027cabal of Remainers\u0027 in the Lords Lord Roberts told peers: \u0027My mind went back to Berlin in March 1933, when the Enabling Bill was passed in the Reichstag.\u0027That Enabling Bill transferred democratic rights of the parliament into the hands of one man, that was the Chancellor. His name was Adolf Hitler.\u0027Perhaps I\u0027m seeing threats that do not exist, but they are there, they are possible. Who\u0027d have said before the 1930s that Germany, this cultured country, would involve itself in such a terrible war.\u0027 Lord Hailsham said Parliament - led by MPs - must be able to decide whether to accept no deal, send ministers back to renegotiate, order a new referendum or even stay in the EU on the current terms.Former Tory leader Lord Michael Howard told the Lords the rebel amendment demonstrated the \u0027appalling lengths\u0027 Remain backers would go to frustrate the referendum vote.  Conservative Lord Fairfax branded the Lords a \u0027cosy cabal of Remain\u0027 and attacker Remain supporters as \u0027fifth columnists\u0027 as he lashed the wrecking amendment.  Ahead of today\u0027s vote, Mrs May\u0027s spokesman said: \u0027Fundamentally, the British people voted to leave the EU and the Government is delivering on that.\u0027It is simply not right that Parliament could overturn this.\u0027It is absolutely right that Parliament is able to scrutinise the final deal, and that is why we have already committed to giving both houses a vote on the final deal.\u0027          Theresa May (pictured at a school near Manchester yesterday) lashed out at unelected peers who are trying to \u0027overturn\u0027 the will of the British people with a series of Brexit Bill wrecking amendmentsLater the Government suffered another defeat on the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill after peers backed plans to give Parliament a say on Britain\u0027s mandate for Brexit talks.An amendment led by Labour\u0027s Lord Monks and supported by a cross-party group of peers was supported by 270 votes to 233, majority 37.Brexit minister Lord Callanan said it was for the Government rather than Parliament to set the mandate for negotiations over the UK\u0027s future relationship with the EU.However, Labour indicated it was supporting the amendment, which would require parliamentary approval for this mandate. Responding to the Government\u0027s second defeat on Monday, on parliamentary approval for the UK\u0027s negotiating mandate, a spokesman for the Department for Exiting the European Union said: \u0027We are disappointed that the House of Lords has voted for this amendment in spite of the assurances we have provided.\u0027Parliament has been updated regularly throughout the negotiations and we have already committed to giving both the House of Commons and the House of Lords a vote on the withdrawal agreement and the terms of our future relationship with the EU.\u0027But it is for the Government, not Parliament, to set our goals for the negotiations on the UK\u0027s exit from the EU and to conduct them.\u0027We will now consider the implications of this decision.\u0027  "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/01/09/4BB5DC6F00000578-5677543-The_video_shows_him_singing_the_lyrics_we_re_in_the_money_the_sk-m-46_1525165079611.jpg","title":"Sainsburys boss caught singing money sang James Blunts Youre Beautiful prawn","story":"    Mike Coupe\u0027s impromptu performance of \u0027We\u0027re in the Money\u0027 is not his first forray into the world of music having once sang James Blunt\u0027s You\u0027re Beautiful to a giant prawn to get 5,000 staff to sell more seafood at Christmas  The video shows him singing the lyrics \u0027we\u0027re in the money, the sky is sunny, let\u0027s spend it, lend it, send it, rolling along\u0027 and as well as musicals he also like Mr Blunt\u0027s music          During the \u0027unguarded\u0027 moment the Sainsbury\u0027s boss also takes a sip of his coffee in an off-air PR disaster now dubbed \u0027doing a Coupe\u0027The two-year plot to create a £51bn supermarket titan:...\u0027At least 75 Asda stores would have to be sold off\u0027: Can...Why I still don\u0027t buy it: ALEX BRUMMER says the Sainsbury\u0027s...Competition watchdog will probe £12bn merger of Sainsbury\u0027s...CITY DIARY: Fred Astaire moment won\u0027t be the only surprise...Share this articleYesterday he was forced into a humbling apology for his \u0027unfortunate choice of song\u0027 and the hiccup has been branded one of the worst PR blunders in recent  history.Mr Coupe was recorded singing \u0027We\u0027re in the Money\u0027 from the musical 42nd Street in between TV interviews.

Tots TV was filmed in such a way that the floor was rarely shown on camera.           The dilapidated shell of the TV set is very different to its glory days, during the 1990s, with is rotting roof, broken windows and missing floorboards.\u0027This allowed for hatches to be built into the floor so that the puppeteers could hide below.\u0027I mainly had a sense of nostalgia when I saw the set. \u0027I remember watching Tots TV on VHS tapes when I was younger and I would never have thought that I would visit the filming location one day.           The three little friends also had a donkey and a rat for company and had a magic sack \u0027It was also sad to see it in this state, I have had many people comment on my video that feel the same way and have even called for it to be restored and turned into some sort of attraction.\u0027Producers won a number of awards including two BAFTAs.           The TV house was a genuine, approximately 13 of the size, cottage purposely built for the show in the woods on a farm in Stratford Upon Avon Tots TV first aired on January 4 1993 and finished on 27 April 1998 after more than 15 years entertaining British children on ITV.Tots TV was first broadcast on CITV and then was picked up by Public Service Broadcasting in the United States where the French speaking puppet changed to a Spanish speaking one. Those who watched it will remember that the three puppets who lived there had a pet donkey who was creatively named Donkey.           There are electrical wires connected to a roof which is covered in holes The TV show was written by two of its puppeteers and was hugely successful and syndicated around the world. In 2000 Discovery Kids bought the series and put it on television screens in Central and South America, the Caribbean and the Falkland Islands.Producers made special episodes of the series were produced for both and VHS release.They were so popular that they included a series of episodes set in the USA.The show which was called a \u0027Big Treasure Adventure\u0027 featured the puppets adventures on a pirate ship.            The now dilapidated shell home is in a terrible condition and has smashed windows and the doors are missing A number of Christmas specials, including one filmed in Rovaniemi, Finland, were also released to audiences to acclaim.Each of those shows were designed as educational video specials and went on sale in 1997.  The show may have ended 20 years ago but it is still on British TV thanks to BBC children\u0027s channel Cebeebies which broadcasts episodes on its internet platform.  Children loved the theme tune which was sang in the UK in both French and English and taught youngsters how to count in the language.          The staircase is broken and the fireplace is no longer in use in the once pretty little cottage The little puppets relied upon a magic sac or bag to help them through the narrative of the episodes.Designed for pre-school children the show also introduced youngsters to nature and a plethora of animals and aquatic life.          The outside is covered in moss and the walls are cracked as discarded flowers lay abandoned While nowhere to be seen in this photos the puppets also had help around their property from Jack the gardener who offered them a helping hand.Other episodes encouraged children to be active and even to undertake tasks \u0027super quickly\u0027.Among the other shows the Tots dressed up as pirates and went to a treasure island.           Electrical wires can still be seen in the shell home which hasn\u0027t been used for two decadesWhile music was also part of the narrative with the female puppet Tilly having a magical flute which she played to the other characters.The Tots also took trips out of their Warwickshire cottage and visited the seaside and in another popular episode visited an airport.           The cottage is completely unrecognisable from its original state and is wrecked inside and outThe characters also had access to a boat and often found fun things to do including games and meeting animal friends including Brian the cat. Each episode lasted for 20 minutes and a number of exciting adventures ensued including a visit to Loch Ness in Scotland where the trio went on the hunt for the world famous monster who has also appeared in other cartoons like Scooby Doo.          The inside of the cottage is dark and wrecked and is nothing like the colourful cottage  A total of 276 episodes of the popular television show were made before the show was eventually taken off air for a final time in 1998.The programme was eventually replaced by another Ragdoll puppet production in the year 2000. That show called Rosie and Jim featured little puppets who lived aboard a narrowboat. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/01/11/4BB9DD5E00000578-0-image-a-14_1525170132724.jpg","title":"Tory candidate suspended claims Islamophobia","story":"    Tory council candidate David Boston has been suspended just days before local elections after posting a picture of bacon hanging on a door handle as a way to \u0027protect your house from terrorism\u0027          In response, the Enfield Conservatives posted on Facebook on April 16 that the posts did not reflect the values of the party and had been removed In response, the Enfield Conservatives posted on Facebook on April 16: \u0027The posts by David Boston are unacceptable and have been removed.

The research, by sociologist Dana Beth Weinberg and mathematician Adam Kapelner of Queens College-CUNY, looked titles published in North America between 2002 and 2012. The authors analysed the gender of each author by matching names to lists of male and female names, and cross-referenced with information about price, genre and publication. Weinberg said the study was inspired by the VIDA counts of book reviews, which have shown the skew towards reviews of books by male authors, written by male reviewers. “Our study looked at all three types of discrimination – the gender segregation by book genre, the different value placed on these genres, and then finally the difference within the genres,” she said. “VIDA has been very good about calling attention to the first issue, namely the lack of representation of female authors in certain genres, and others have emphasised how books written predominantly by women and for women such as romance and women’s fiction do not receive the recognition they deserve.” It was little surprise to see evidence of segregation by genre and the differing values placed on each genre, Weinberg added, but the researchers were very surprised at how clear this discrimination was.Costa-winning novelist Francesca Segal said the study made her furious. “I had no idea, but how exhausting, enervating and entirely predictable. It is the old news framed in a new way – women paid less for the same work,” she said.Author Samantha Shannon said she was “disappointed by this statistic, but not surprised”.“There is still an assumption that fiction by men has universal appeal and fiction by women does not, and I imagine this plays into the pay gap. There’s also the fact that women are often socialised to be agreeable, and perhaps feel less confident asking their agents to push for more from their publishers. I suspect the only way to fight this in the long term is for women to keep owning our identities in the industry, and to resist the understandable instinct to mask ourselves with pseudonyms,” she said.Novelist Joanne Harris said she had not previously noticed the discrepancy in pricing, “but in an industry where women’s work is generally seen as of less value and relevance, for it to be literally priced lower seems to make a twisted kind of sense”.“It needs to be looked at in detail, as every case of this kind of thing adds subliminally to the general perception that books by women are disposable, forgettable and less worthy of attention,” she said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9b2daed52f1ba473d8843a4a7fac5580ae0b2613/0_361_7106_4265/master/7106.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aa6596357c91002f748a30c17f959573","title":"mcstrike mcdonalds workers walk out over zero hours contracts","story":"Staff from branches in England take action for minimum £10-an-hour living wageMcDonald’s workers in Britain are striking in a dispute over zero-hours contracts and working conditions that is being closely observed by the fast food industry and trade unions.Staff from branches in Manchester and Watford will join colleagues in Crayford and Cambridge as part of a “McStrike” as workers demand a minimum £10-an-hour living wage.Members of the Bakers Food and Allied Workers Union are also asking for a choice of fixed-hour contracts, the end of unequal pay for young workers, and union recognition.Employees at UK branches attracted worldwide attention in September by striking for the first time.

Tony Royle, a professor of employment relations at the University of York, said the dispute was symbolic of the growing income gap, an increase in precarious work and a decline in independent trade union representation.“McDonald’s is a multibillion-dollar corporation which continues to pay its senior executives sky-high salaries while paying low wages for the vast majority of its 2 million employees.“Young workers in particular have felt the brunt of the ‘flexible’ labour market and austerity government policies and are increasingly frustrated, angry and ready to fight for a more just workplace.A McDonald’s spokesman said on Tuesday afternoon that only one person had walked out across three strikes planned for the morning, while a maximum of of five people could walk out across the other two due to take place this afternoon.“The vast majority of our employees - across all stores, franchised and company-owned - received the annual pay rise in January, and the increase referred to within your piece started back in 2015.“Union recognition did not feature on the ballot paper, there is no suggestion this strike is calling for McDonald’s to recognise the union.Labour shadow chancellor John McDonnell has written to McDonald’s calling for a meeting to discuss the union’s demands.McDonald’s owns or franchises more than 37,000 restaurants in 120 countries."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/58ee09576ff976de254c6d5c79484e7bdeec8a47/0_0_5159_3095/master/5159.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=88c683a8188b0829700e6289c59be3b3","title":"rbs to close 162 branches with loss of 800 jobs","story":"New closures and job cuts in England and Wales follow decision to keep Williams \u0026amp Glyn bankRoyal Bank of Scotland is to close 162 branches in England and Wales this summer with the loss of nearly 800 jobs.RBS blamed the job losses on a deal made with the EU last year that meant the Edinburgh-based bank did not have to sell off 300 branches. The EU had demanded the sale, to increase competition, as a condition of the RBS taxpayer bailout in 2009. RBS resurrected the Williams \u0026amp Glyn name to hold the branches put up for sale – RBS outlets in England and Wales and NatWest branches in Scotland. However, it was unable to find a buyer.RBS said: “We are no longer launching Williams \u0026amp Glyn as a ‘challenger bank’, and we now have two branch networks operating in close proximity to each other NatWest and Royal Bank of Scotland, in England and Wales.“As a result we have had to review our overall branch footprint in England and Wales and we’ve made the difficult decision to close a number of Royal Bank of Scotland branches. Customers of Royal Bank of Scotland in England and Wales will be able to use NatWest branches instead for their everyday banking needs.” The bank said 792 staff at the 162 branches would be made redundant.The latest closures come after years of shutting branches, which have sparked political outcry and warnings about the end of high street banking.The Unite union called on RBS to halt its “disastrous plans”. It said its analysis found that in the case of 71 of the 162 branches slated for closure customers will be forced to make return journeys of about 25 miles.The Unite national officer, Rob MacGregor, said: “The TSB computer systems crash last week has demonstrated without question that the banking system needs its branch network more than it ever has. Unite is calling on the Royal Bank of Scotland management not to abandon their responsibilities to the communities across the country who depend on Williams \u0026amp Glynn banking facilities.”RBS had planned to launch Williams \u0026amp Glyn as a separate “challenger bank” but has decided not to go ahead with this.

Or rather, his care worker was. “You shouldn’t let him out if he can’t behave,” the man said. My brother’s carers insisted he had as much right to be there as the aggressive man did, and it was the latter who eventually left, to a round of applause from the rest of the audience. When my brother’s carer told me the anecdote, it made me smile. People are kind, I thought.Unfortunately, things don’t always happen this way for people with autism-spectrum disorders (ASD). On Sunday night, for instance, Tamsin Parker was thrown out of the British Film Institute (BFI) cinema in London for laughing “too loudly” during The Good, the Bad and the Ugly while she protested “I have Asperger’s.” Other audience members had called the 25-year-old a “bitch” and “retarded”. Witnesses described themselves as “shaking with anger” and feeling “sick to my stomach” at the scene. It was Tamsin’s birthday, and she loves the film, which she has seen eight times.“A couple of audience members were yelling, ‘Shut up, bitch!’ and ‘It’s not that funny!’” said Tamsin, an artist and animator. “The thing is, it was funny. It was Eli Wallach playing with parts of guns, clearly improvising. Wallach hated guns, and he had no use for them, so it seemed like he had no idea what he was doing … I was distraught that I wasn’t able to watch the film the whole way through. This was a film that was very personal to me, because I first saw the film during a rough time in my life and it made me feel better about myself.”The BFI has since apologised to Tamsin, and has offered her a private screening. The manager on duty, one witness told me, was “visibly upset” and said that had she known Tamsin had Asperger’s, she would never have let that happen.This sad incident should be an opportunity to learn, not hound someone out of their job. Clearly, much better training is needed here for staff. But Tamsin’s mother, Lydia, is rightly furious that she was humiliated in this way. “Even if she were not autistic, no one should be treated as she was. All audience members deserve respect,” she told me.Autism inclusivity in cinema and theatres has come on in leaps and bounds since my brother, who is also 25, and Tamsin, were small. Relaxed performances are now widespread, not only at the Globe and the National Theatre but in cinemas and theatres up and down the country, and are great for those who get sensory overload and as a result need sound and vision to just be a little bit less intrusive.But people with ASD should not feel limited to these, segregated from the rest of society. They have as much right to attend an ordinary performance as anybody else. I admit that I have felt on edge taking my brother to the cinema before. You steel yourself for people’s reactions. When we took him to see Shaun the Sheep, he announced loudly: “SHEEP, BAAAAAAA!” whenever Shaun came on screen. People were lovely, but it was mostly children and parents in the audience. Would you be so tolerant?It was the attitude of the audience members who abused Tamsin that really shocked me. The lack of humanity and compassion: the anger, where there is really so little to be angry about. Much has been made of the “hostile environment” Theresa May has tried to create for immigrants, but one wonders whether it exists for disabled people too. This is not a case of me being dramatic: the UK was last year criticised by the UN for failing to uphold disabled people’s rights. It pointed to the high levels of poverty for disabled people and their families as a result of benefit cuts. An earlier report by the same committee condemned “systemic violations” of people with disabilities. People who are ill and disabled are being sent to work, and some of them are dying.To what extent have some of these policies, and the media coverage around them, seeped into the national psyche? Reported hate crimes against disabled people are rising even faster where children are the victims, a BBC investigation found late last year, with children and their families verbally abused in the street. These acts do not occur in a vacuum.There is so much innovation occurring in film and theatre when it comes to disability. Madhouse re:exit, a performance by five artists with learning disabilities from the Access All Areas theatre company, recently took spectators at Shoreditch Town Hall on a fantastical tour through the history of the institutionalisation of disabled people. It’s currently in Manchester. Our Country’s Good, at Theatre Royal Stratford East, has a mixed cast of 17 disabled and able-bodied actors telling the story of their journey to a penal colony in Australia.Productions such as these do crucial work in shifting attitudes. But it is our government’s policies, not to mention our media coverage, in which we truly need a shift, or disabled people will continue to be abused for having the audacity to exist in public or, as in Tamsin’s case, for simply wanting to watch her favourite film, with her friends, on her birthday."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3c10f8ba64460ab6f7bd3de20e50bf38c7c34ee8/0_108_4476_2686/master/4476.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9b9e240587133591820ed25de67a3063","title":"sajid javid tory ministry racism windrush amber rudd compliant hostile","story":"Political crises often have short shelf lives as the floodwaters of one Boris Johnson gaffe ebb, so another tsunami of poor decision-making (usually, again by Johnson) comes crashing over the harbour. But the Windrush affair is no mere scandal. What we have witnessed are the consequences of a Home Office culture that is rotten to the core – and it will take more than a single resignation and a subtle tweak in rhetoric to fix it.It is only right that Amber Rudd was compelled to resign. It’s one thing to get caught out, quite another to get hung out to dry by your own correspondence. However, it is vital to note that her departure from the government’s front bench is due only to having “inadvertently” misled the home affairs select committee. The underlying causes behind the detention, exclusion from public life, and potential deportations of British citizens of colour went unremarked in Rudd’s resignation letter.I’m sure that Javid is perfectly sincere in his statement of affinity for the Windrush migrants. However, one is compelled to turn to his voting record in order to assess what this shift in tone might mean in policy terms.Furthermore, the phrase “compliant environment” is so far devoid of any meaningful content in policy terms, other than not involving the reinstatement of a clause protecting longstanding Commonwealth-origin residents in the UK, which was removed from the statute books by the Immigration Act 2014. The medical gatekeeping that saw Sylvester Marshall (previously referred to as Albert Thompson in the ) denied cancer treatment for six months might be here to stay – along with the ongoing planned deportation of Windrush generation migrants, and the continued detention of sexual assault and torture survivors.Perhaps the discovery of personal Commonwealth heritage is a relatively recent phenomenon for Javid. Or maybe, and stay with me here, the mere possession of melanin is not a cast-iron guarantee that a politician will err on the side of justice.But ultimately there’s only one person responsible for the Windrush affair, and the calamitous consequences of the hostile environment policy: Theresa May. Over the past eight years, hostile environment logic has been written through home office DNA.May’s tenure as home secretary was marked not only by her embrace of harsh rhetoric, but also structurally encoding an unforgiving, target-driven culture. A bonus of £5,000 to £10,000 was given to the head of immigration enforcement for delivering internal targets, including removals from the UK. Placed alongside May’s personal commitment to “deport first, hear appeals later”, this pay structure fundamentally undermines the integrity of our entire immigration system. How can anyone – whether a British citizen or a foreign national – have any faith that their case will be heard with respect for due process, when civil service oversight is corroded by the offer of a cash incentive?We have reached a point of mutually exclusive choosing in British immigration politics. We could continue with May as the guiding hand in home affairs, and make our peace with an unworkable, immoral and unjust policy immiserating the lives of migrants who have enriched this country. Or we could reject the Tory transformation of the Home Office into the Ministry of Institutional Racism – and commit to an immigration strategy that widens avenues towards citizenship recognises the immense contributions of Commonwealth migrants to British society and focuses its energies on regularising the tax arrangements of financial elites, rather than excluding working class people of colour from the NHS.A better and fairer policy is possible a transformed Home Office working culture is imperative. And it must begin with the end of May.• Ash Sarkar is a senior editor at Novara Media"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fb799afe5e97ea936f5efd21a3f244a69fda838c/0_33_2030_1218/master/2030.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f269d7c6e064a050eaf813e919c16290","title":"how we made outnumbered claire skinner interview","story":"‘Once the kids were done filming, Hugh Dennis and I would do all the reaction shots to broom handles with wigs on’There are many reasons why no TV series before Outnumbered had tried to capture the chaos of life with small kids. Restrictions on working hours aside, children hate things like learning lines, standing still, having strangers fiddling with their hair and being shouted at by men in puffa jackets yelling: “Action!”. Kids on telly always behaved wrongly, too. They tended to be standing in one place and looking directly at the person who was talking to them – whereas in real life, the adult who’s talking to them is the least interesting thing around. While we wanted to create something that was funny, we also wanted it to feel real, so we took the eye contact out and got rid of all things kids don’t like. There was no makeup, we ran the set in an informal way and we tried not to keep them hanging around. Before each scene, we would just give them an outline: “Your dad’s going to come in, he’s going to moan at you, you’re going to tell him to leave you alone.” And the kids would do it in their own words, in a completely authentic way.Getting it commissioned didn’t happen overnight. In the end, we made a 10-minute sample and, when we showed it to people, they finally got it. We recycled a chunk of this, the mother and daughter nit-combing scene, in the first episode. If you look closely, you’ll see that both Claire and Ramona suddenly have completely different hair. Nobody ever noticed.Some people thought we just turned up with cameras and let the kids make it up, but we had a complete, polished script that we worked hard on – we just didn’t show it to them. The improvised scenes were always with no pressure, and written so that if they didn’t work, they could just come straight out. As the years went by, we used improvisation less with the kids. As you grow older, you still have your imagination but you don’t have that same unselfconscious access to it. My own kids were mostly grown up but it didn’t matter. Parenting is fairly universal: my experiences turned out to be the same as Guy’s. And the dilemmas our fictional parents found themselves in were being played out in tens of thousands of homes up and down the country.When Andy and Guy approached me to play the mother, Sue, I was in the thick of parenting myself. My own kids were six and eight. I thought: “Yes, absolutely, I get this completely.”I liked the way both the mum and the dad, played by Hugh Dennis, were a bit slippery at times. There’s one episode that has Sue rifling through another child’s book-bag, trying to see what grades and feedback that kid has got to compare it to her own. Every parent wants to do that! We filmed in a house in Wandsworth, London, that belonged to a real family. Sometimes we’d arrive in the morning and find their kids still in bed. Our own three young stars would do their schoolwork in the house next door and we’d all eat our meals there too. When the team were ready to start filming the children, they would nip through a gap in the garden fence. Once the kids’ working hours were done, Hugh and I would do all the reverse shots to broom handles with wigs on, or Andy and Guy would stick gaffer tape across their chests and mark on a set of eyes where the kids’ eyelines would be. The kids were so young in the early series that they’re pretty much being themselves. Dan was perhaps furthest away from his character, Ben. He’s more thoughtful and very clever – although, like Ben, he was always trying to figure out how things worked. And then he’d break them. Will there be any more? Maybe a one-off or a Christmas special. It would be funny to see what the characters are all up to. It was such a great thing to be involved with and a very happy time. It was mad, scrappy, tiring and funny."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e8f10a3aba47667ab106c92ec2cb44161e655ed3/0_232_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2d78640d5bee43b2547fbbbba22a5232","title":"from backstreet eats to five star feasts abu dhabis diverse dining scene","story":"Whether you’re on a blow-out budget or hunting for a bargain, Abu Dhabi has it all.

Yours for just AED 6 (£1.16), one makes for a tasty lunch, two the perfect late night sustenance.liwanmansour.aeTandoori CornerIndian restaurants in Abu Dhabi fall into two categories: slick and pricey hotel-based operations, and backstreet curry houses where the bill can come in at a tenth of the price or less. Tandoori Corner (which isn’t, in fact, on a corner) is very much the latter, though the food is easily as good as its five-star competition. As with many Indian restaurants in the city, there’s a whole menu of Chinese dishes, too, making it perfect for any group at loggerheads over what they fancy for dinner.MeylasEmirati food is oddly difficult to come by in the United Arab Emirates.

That’s not to call Bord Eau stuffy – even traditional dishes such as boeuf bourguignon and confit duck surprise with canny twists and inventive presentation.

Here’s what not to miss in the capital of the UAE …Liwa OasisFamilies travelling with older children should check out the Liwa Oasis. It’s located south-west of Abu Dhabi (a few hour’s drive from the city) and covers over 62,000 miles of desert. The former home of over 50 Bedouin tribes is rich in history and also, more recently, extreme adventure sports. Take to one of the world’s largest sand dunes and try your hand at fat biking, or sandboarding, then spend the night camping under the stars.Ferrari World Abu DhabiA must-see over on Yas Island is the famous Ferrari World Abu Dhabi, which has something for everyone. Starting with the rides, there’s Formula Rossa – the world’s fastest roller-coaster – as well as Turbo Track, complete with a vertical climb and a zero-gravity fall. There’s a junior Grand Prix and the chance to tour the on-site Ferrari factory also. Adults itching to get behind the wheel can put the pedal to the metal with lessons from Ferrari’s expert instructors.Eastern Mangrove Lagoon national parkAbu Dhabi is not all dry heat, desert and cities – it’s also home to some lush wilderness, like the Eastern Mangrove Lagoon national park. Stretching for 12 miles along the coastline, it’s a nature lovers’ paradise, with over 50 species of birds, including pink flamingos. The best way to explore this verdant natural habitat is to hire some double kayaks for the family and navigate the calm waterways.Mushrif Central ParkMushrif Central Park sits quietly among the towering skyscrapers, one of the oldest and largest parks in the city. Its landscaped grounds are packed with things to do, with little ones sure to love the park train tour, the animal barn and petting zoo and the Great Lawn – a superb place to fly kites. Plus, there’s a botanic garden, a viewing platform and an amphitheatre, which hosts everything from cultural dances to music concerts and lighting displays.Wadi Adventure Al Ain, nicknamed “the Garden City”, was the perfect spot to develop the family-friendly Wadi Adventure. It’s a man-made kayaking, white-water rafting and surfing adventure park, complete with a two-storey aerial obstacle course, zip line and climbing wall. The kayaking channel is over a mile long and the man-made waves for surfing reach 3.3 metres (11ft) high. You can rent equipment for the day. Al Ain ZooAl Ain Zoo sits in the picturesque foothills of the Jebel Hafeet mountains and has over 4,000 animals to discover, from Arabian antelopes to white lions. The zoo is also home to the world’s largest man-made African safari, where you’ll be able spot lions and zebras up close. Conservation and education comes high on the agenda here, with a learning centre in the children’s garden and the Elezba petting zoo, where children will get the chance to feed a giraffe. Yas Waterworld Abu DhabiCovering an area that would fit 15 football pitches, Yas Waterworld is a place like no other. Kids will love ticking off its 43 attractions, from the hydro-magnetic-powered tornado waterslide (it’s the world’s longest and fastest) to Bubble’s Barrel, where you can surf 3-metre (10ft) high waves. Also, don’t miss all the pools to cool off in and the huge range of food options to tuck into.Bounce Abu DhabiFor a bit of indoor fun, Bounce Abu Dhabi will suit even the biggest kids (some nights it’s even open until midnight). Found on the ground floor of the Marina Mall, it has over 100 interconnected trampolines to jump about on. To up the thrill-seeking there’s a 40-metre-high (130ft) slide and an adrenalin-inducing zipline. Try the 5.5-metre (18ft) Infinity Wall or the Quickdrop freefall experience.Abu Dhabi Pearl JourneyDelve into Abu Dhabi’s rich pearl industry history on an Abu Dhabi Pearl Journey sailing trip aboard a traditional wooden Jalboot boat. Along the way, you’ll get to see a demonstration of how to pearl e and how to open an oyster shell to find the pearl. Locally brewed gahwa (Arabic coffee) is on hand for all the parents.Warner Bros World Abu DhabiTipped to be one of the hottest new destinations in Abu Dhabi, the brand-new Warner Bros World is set to open its doors this year on Yas Island. It’ll be split into six immersive, recognisable lands, from Gotham City to Looney Tunes, with animation, plus recreations of the Flintstones’ home and Superman’s polis. The 29 rides and attractions will cater for children of all ages, and there will be live entertainment aplenty.Experience the real Abu Dhabi.

Wander around its saline and freshwater lakes, sand dunes, scrubs and hillocks, and you’re almost guaranteed to see a flamingo – there were 4,000 of them at the last count. Egyptian spiny-tailed lizards, red foxes, greater spotted eagles and beautiful varieties of dragonflies and damselflies are among the reserve’s other draws. It’s open year-round and is free to enter (Thursdays to Saturdays, 8am to 4pm).ead.aeTake a desert safariFormed millions of years ago by a natural salt dome, Sir Bani Yas Island takes its name from the Bani Yas tribe, who chose to settle there. Today, this bioerse nature reserve is best explored on a 4x4 safari with a local wildlife expert. Two-hour family-friendly safari drives (best taken early in the morning when the animals hunt for breakfast) cost approximately £100 per person and offer the chance to spot some of the island’s 10,000 free-roaming animals, including giraffe, Sudan cheetahs, hyenas and a herd of Arabian oryx. There are also richly patterned axis deer stags, gazelles and blackbuck antelope. It’s not just land activities either – the island offers a range of scuba ing and snorkelling trips to delve further into Abu Dhabi’s abundant marine life.sirbaniyasislandGo dolphin spottingAbu Dhabi’s coastal waters are home to the largest population of Indian Ocean humpback dolphins and plenty of bottlenose dolphins. Get out on the waves to see them in their natural habitat on a three-hour Dolphin Bay eco boat tour with marine biologist Arabella Willing (Saturdays, £76 per person). As well as learning all about the local environment, you’ll sail out to the Dolphin Bay sandbank for swimming and snorkelling. Late March to July is the best time for dolphin spotting, especially in the early mornings and evenings.captaintonys.aeSeek out an urban oasisYou can even experience the UAE’s lush nature in the centre of the city of Al Ain. The Unesco world heritage visitor experience, Al Ain Oasis is an hour and a half from Abu Dhabi and its 100 different varieties of date palms provide plenty of shade from the urban heat. Covering a vast 1,214 hectares (3,000 acres), it features a series of oasis gardens, running from the orchard garden – which is filled with fragrant scents of fig, lemon, pomegranate and olive trees – to the symbolic garden, whose moringa and frankincense trees are known for their medicinal properties.visitabudhabi.aeFeed a falconThe sport of falconry is held in very high esteem in Emirati culture, with skills being passed down through the generations. The popular Abu Dhabi Falcon Hospital is the largest falcon hospital in the world, acting almost like a regular hospital, with birds being assessed on arrival. Each year, 11,200 falcons are received for examinations and treatment. The site opens its doors twice a day for the public to tour the hospital, where they can get an insight into the work that is done there. Visitors will even get a chance to feed the falcons, and there’s a museum on site. You can also learn about the sport of falconry in the hospital’s landscaped gardens. falconhospitalExperience the real Abu Dhabi.

Spacey’s scenes were reshot at great expense, with Christopher Plummer replacing him in the role of billionaire J Paul Getty.Yet, speaking at the world premiere of the restored version of his 1972 drama Last Tango in Paris at the Bari international film festival, Bertolucci was critical of the decision, according to the Italian newspaper il Giornale (via Deadline).“When I learned that Ridley Scott had agreed to eliminate the scenes of All the Money in the World in which Kevin Spacey was playing, I sent a message to editor Peter Scalia to tell Scott that he should be ashamed,” the Italian director said. “And then I immediately wanted to make a film with Spacey.”Berolucci’s comments were greeted with “much applause” from the audience, according to the Hollywood Reporter. The director later went on to add that he supported the #MeToo movement, and praised it for “bringing awareness to violence against women around the world”.Spacey is currently under investigation by prosecutors in Los Angeles and London over the allegations against him, which were instigated in October by actor Anthony Rapp, who claims that Spacey made sexual advances against him when he was 14. Spacey apologised to Rapp for any “inappropriate drunken behaviour” but said that he did not remember the encounter. Further allegations against the actor followed, with the Old Vic revealing that 20 people had alleged inappropriate behaviour by Spacey while he was the theatre’s artistic director. Aside from his response to Rapp, Spacey has declined to comment on the other allegations made against him.Bertolucci was himself the subject of widespread criticism in 2016 after revealing that the infamous rape scene in Last Tango in Paris was shot without the consent of actor Maria Schneider. Bertolucci claimed that he did not inform Schneider of the scene, in which Marlon Brando’s character uses a stick of butter as lubricant to rape her character, as he “wanted her reaction as a girl, not as an actress”. The director later claimed that the controversy had been based on a “ridiculous misunderstanding”.

Cinema has a proud history of credulity-challenging familiesMamma Mia 2: Here We Go Again, the forthcoming sequel movie, is bound to be a crime against nature for many reasons, but the main one is the inclusion of Cher. I have nothing against Cher – please, nobody send me a furious Twitter-stream of incomprehensible emojis – but her role in the movie does need to be carefully examined.In Mamma Mia 2, Cher will play Meryl Streep’s mother. Meryl Streep is 68 years old. Cher is 71. And this means that, in the Mamma Mia universe, Cher gave birth to Meryl Streep when she was three. This is horrific. It goes against everything we stand for as a species. Both morally and legally, it is a travesty. Although it does perhaps explain why Streep can endure Pierce Brosnan’s injured caterwauling so well her life has clearly been filled with so much incredible hurt that she cannot feel pain any longer.But, hey, this is Hollywood. By no means is this the first time there has been an unworkable age difference between parent and child in a movie. Cher, Meryl these are your filmic parent-child bedfellows now.Harrison Ford was 47 when Last Crusade was released. The film’s big gimmick was that this time we’d get to meet his father. However, the wizened old patriarch was played by Sean Connery, who was then 59. This meant that Jones Sr must have met and married a woman, found a well-paying job and had a baby at the first opportunity puberty allowed. Connery initially turned down the role because of this ridiculous age difference. He did, however, jump at the chance to sleep with a woman four decades younger than him in Entrapment. Biopic The Fighter presented Melissa Leo with the role of a lifetime a hard-bitten mother of nine scratching her way through life in working-class Massachusetts. The real-life character she plays gave birth to Mickey Ward when she was 34. However, Ward was played by Mark Wahlberg, who is only a decade younger than Leo. To further complicate matters, Christian Bale – who plays Wahlberg’s older brother – is two years younger than Wahlberg. Someone is getting it wrong here. It seems sensible to blame Wahlberg, for no other reason than because he’s made more Transformers films than the rest of the cast.Rachel McAdams is 39. Amy Poehler, who played McAdams’ mother in Mean Girls, is 46. To give Mean Girls its dues, this age difference does sort of work. Poehler’s character is supposed to have a creepy infatuation with youth, so it only makes sense to imagine that she was some sort of nightmarish child bride who has chosen to live vicariously through her daughter in a manic attempt to regain the childhood that was stolen from her at a tragically young age, right? Mean Girls is a comedy.When films take place over a number of years, you’ll often find they take liberties with ages. Sally Field had to loll around in full old-age makeup for much of Forrest Gump, even though she was only 10 years older than Tom Hanks. However, Brokeback Mountain – in which 22-year-old Kate Mara played the 19-year-old daughter of 26-year-old Heath Ledger – takes the biscuit. To see the pair of them sharing the screen, they look the exact same age. It’s hard to tell if she’s supposed to be his daughter or his girlfriend. Which is quite a common mix-up in Hollywood, admittedly.This one is bizarre. Angelina Jolie was born 362 days earlier than Colin Farrell, and still ended up playing his mother in Oliver Stone’s 2004 epic Alexander. Truly horrifying. Yet somehow – after the script, the acting, the runtime and the miserable inclusion of Val Kilmer and Jared Leto – it isn’t even close to being the worst thing about Alexander."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/340300e9ea4d554c811c6a834967ee5415c148f4/0_80_3882_2329/master/3882.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=887160a37e3000abce61a141615dc4e4","title":"chelsea interested in making move for manchester united anthony martial","story":"Chelsea have joined the list of clubs monitoring Anthony Martial’s situation at Manchester United and would move for the France international if the striker agitates for a transfer from Old Trafford this summer.Martial has endured a frustrating third campaign in English football, flitting from team to bench and limited to 17 Premier League starts, and suitors – who already included Juventus and Tottenham Hotspur – have been granted enough encouragement that he could seek a fresh start at the end of the season. The Frenchman is contracted to 2019 with an option for a further year, and would therefore command a considerable fee. Juve are understood to have indicated they would be prepared to pay around £45m for his services.Chelsea, braced for Real Madrid to firm up their long-standing interest in Eden Hazard, would consider the 22-year-old a player of considerable potential, but also one with the quality already to feature anywhere across their front line. United’s instinct will be to retain the forward, who they secured from Monaco for an initial £36m in 2015, but, if Martial pushes for a move, they may not be averse to selling, even to a isional rival. The clubs negotiated Nemanja Matic’s move to Old Trafford last summer, and José Mourinho retains an interest in the Chelsea forward, Willian.Roman Abramovich is still hopeful Hazard will sign a new contract but is eager to instigate other changes to the playing staff at Stamford Bridge this summer, when Antonio Conte is expected to depart. Despite the uncertainty over the identity of the Italian’s successor, the club’s recruitment department – still operating without a technical director – have already begun exploring the market for potential additions, though Chelsea would have to generate funds through sales.A failure to qualify for the Champions League – they are fifth, now five points behind Tottenham with three games to play – would result in a shortfall of up to £70m in revenues and, in order to satisfy Financial Fair Play rules, fringe players may be moved on. Borussia Dortmund may seek to make Michy Batshuayi’s loan move a permanent deal after the Belgian impressed in the Bundesliga with seven goals in nine starts prior to an ankle injury. Kurt Zouma and Kenedy, currently on loan at Stoke and Newcastle respectively, could also move on, while Tomas Kalas and Lucas Piazon could join Fulham permanently if Slavisa Jokanovic’s side are promoted to the top flight.The England internationals Ruben Loftus-Cheek, who is expected to be in Gareth Southgate’s squad for the summer’s World Cup finals, and Tammy Abraham will not be sold, but the likes of Marco van Ginkel and even Danny Drinkwater, who has endured a frustrating first season at the club since arriving from Leicester for £35m, could also depart. David Luiz, under-used all season, may consider the changes in the dugout before confronting his own future at the club.Chelsea boast a net outlay of around £119m since 2014 with their business model having shifted markedly from the lavish spending of the early Abramovich era. The oligarch remains as committed as ever, with the club committed to redeveloping Stamford Bridge, but will continue to comply with FFP, meaning they will not boast the leeway enjoyed by Manchester City and United in the market.Abramovich is to be honoured by the Federation of Jewish communities of Russia, whose board of trustees he chairs, for investing in excess of £360m into Jewish communities in Russia, Israel and other countries around the world. “Much of the work we do has been made possible thanks to Mr Abramovich, and we are deeply thankful for his continued support,” said the FJCR president, Rabbi Alexander Boroda.“We have more than 160 communities in all of Russia and Roman supports them all. He never talks about it, but I want to because people don’t understand who is the source of it is – and it is him.” Chelsea have run a prominent ‘Say No to Antisemitism’ campaign, personally initiated by the owner, since February."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/14dda307ff157cf51fe43056dce9f810d0e7132c/0_0_4960_2975/master/4960.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c85b11f261890810043076ddff0df989","title":"football programmes matchday league collection","story":"News that Football League clubs may no longer have to publish programmes has brought out our nostalgic side.

Perfectionist or traitor? The jury’s still out“He came. He saw. He went home.” So ran the tag-line of the Irish box office smash hit comedy I, Keano, an epic musical melodrama about a Roman legion preparing for war. It was inspired by a real-life melodrama of even more epic proportions: arguably the most fractious falling-out in the history of Irish sport, a gripping and often amusing controversy prompted by Roy Keane’s contentious departure from the Republic of Ireland World Cup squad in 2002.The captain’s headline-grabbing exit from the squad briefly transformed the tiny western Pacific island of Saipan into the most famous places on Earth. It made a cute and goofy Labrador puppy named Triggs into a household name. It was the source of more pompous pontification in the bars of the British Isles than any number of budgets, general elections and scandals. It practically sundered a nation, driving it to the brink of something approaching civil war and prompted the Taoiseach (prime minister) of the day to offer his services as a mediator. It became the subject of more hand-wringing sanctimony and general tomfoolery than almost any incident before or since in modern Irish life. It was all about standards. Roy’s standards. Depending on your point of view they were either too high or not high enough. Was Roy the perfectionist who wanted the best for his country or the traitor who abandoned it? In Ireland, 16 years on, the jury remains out.Everybody and nobody seems to know exactly what happened. The definitive version remains unconfirmed and even now, those who were privy to events as they unravelled remain understandably reluctant to talk about them in too much depth. Keane’s detractors claim he walked. His supporters insist he was sent home. The truth seems to lie somewhere in between: he made his position untenable and forced his manager’s hand.This much we know: Ireland’s captain, then a 30-year-old volatile driving force who had almost single-handedly dragged his country through qualification for Japan and South Korea 2002 out of a group containing Portugal and Holland, decided to leave the camp out of frustration at poor preparation but then changed his mind. However, a newspaper interview he’d given to the  rolled off the presses like a grenade and exploded, prompting the famous showdown at which Keane embarked on a character assassination of his manager, Mick McCarthy, that was so brutal, the object of his scorn felt compelled to say he could no longer work with his captain.In a chat with me for the Irish magazine Hot Press a few months after the event, the former Republic of Ireland international Niall Quinn insisted that “Roy walked out”. Later in the same interview he stressed that Keane had walked out “twice in three days”. He could not have been more clear: “You must remember that,” he said. “We’re not talking about a happy bunny here, who suddenly said the wrong things for a few seconds. I think it built up and up in him. While the rest of us were prepared to get on with things, knowing how ramshackle things are, he allowed it to get in the way of his World Cup.”Keane tells it differently, stating in his autobiography that having originally become so exasperated by a rock-hard training pitch, the FAI’s failure to get their squad’s training kit to Saipan and a row about five-a-side goalkeeping arrangements, he decided to throw his hat at the whole jamboree and go home. A short time later, having been given time to cool down and review his position, he subsequently changed his mind only to be, in his opinion, ambushed at a team meeting called by McCarthy, who accused him of having faked an injury to avoid having to play the second leg of Ireland’s successful qualifying play-off against Iran. That, according to Keane, was the straw that broke the camel’s back and the cue for his outburst, which Quinn described as “the most surgical slaughtering anyone has ever got”.“You’re a fucking wanker. I didn’t rate you as a player, I don’t rate you as a manager and I don’t rate you as a person. You’re a fucking wanker and you can stick your World Cup up your arse. I’ve got no respect for you. The only reason I have any dealings with you is that somehow you are the manager of my country! You can stick it up your bollocks.”“Humiliation in front of the whole party was the result he was seeking,” wrote Keane of McCarthy in his autobiography, stating that the meeting had been a set-up. Not too long after that, Keane received a phone call from his representative, the Irish solicitor Michael Kennedy. “You’ve been kicked out,” he was told. At 6pm the next day, with the rest of the Republic of Ireland squad en route to Japan, Keane was on the next plane home. How had it come to this?Since his days as a youth footballer making a name for himself in Cork, Keane had never had much time for the FAI, an organisation that favoured players from Dublin clubs to those from elsewhere in the country. Upon becoming a senior international, he was increasingly perplexed by its amateurish approach to match preparation and was not alone, as a cursory flick through the autobiographies of any Republic of Ireland international who played through the Jack Charlton and Mick McCarthy eras will prove.Things began to go pear-shaped at the airport on the way to Saipan. Already annoyed that he had been criticised in some newspapers for missing Quinn’s famously generous fundraising testimonial in Sunderland in favour of remaining in Manchester for treatment on a number of injuries that were threatening to rule him out of the World Cup, Keane was in understandably grumpy mood at Dublin airport and immediately buttonholed a couple of the journalists who had portrayed his non-attendance as a “snub”. The journey to Saipan had started badly and went quickly downhill. “The trip is a shambles from the beginning,” recalls Keane in his book. “Dublin airport is packed, you can’t move. We hump a month’s luggage through the main concourse. Check ourselves in. We’re travelling KLM, going the scenic route, via Amsterdam and Tokyo. Fans, journalists, players, officials all mingle together. The package tour image comes to mind again. Amid the chaos, the Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern, arrives to give us a send-off.”With Keane already seething, it was left to Hollywood actor Will Smith to make things worse. On the flight to Tokyo, Ireland’s captain killed time watching Smith’s portrayal of Muhammad Ali and was transfixed by the scene in which the boxer resists the urgings of his family, friends and advisers to accept the draft for the Vietnam war. “They’re all urging him to give in,” recalls Keane. “Take the draft. You won’t have to fight. Just go through the motions, play the game, screw the things you believe in. Ali resists them all. I’m doing what I think is right. It matters. You don’t compromise on your principles. Watching this is very moving. I hadn’t known this about Ali. Something in this scene strikes a chord with me. Don’t put up with shit. I’m not fighting a white man’s war. It’s an inspiring notion, a demonstration of conviction that I understand very clearly and I relate to my own life. Don’t compromise the things you believe in.”Emboldened by what he had seen on his flight to Tokyo, Keane was unimpressed when Ireland’s squad eventually arrived in Saipan for what was ostensibly a week of pre-World Cup relaxation with some light training, only to discover their hampers of training kit, footballs and medical supplies had not arrived on the island. It was his nightmare scenario: Ireland preparing for a tournament in what he described as “happy-camper mode with no real ambition, settling for second best”. Visiting McCarthy in his hotel room, he voiced his disquiet and told his manager the team’s gear should have arrived the previous week. The following morning, Monday, Ireland’s players arrived at their training ground for a run to discover the surface was too hard. “We could have watered it,” Fifa’s liaison officer told Keane. “If anyone had told us you were coming down.” Fail to prepare, prepare to fail.Things went from bad to worse. The missing equipment arrived that night and the following day the squad had a full training session on a pitch that was still too hard, apart from one section, which had been flooded by those responsible for watering the pitch. When the training session finished with a game, Keane was outraged to discover the squad’s goalkeepers were unwilling to play on the grounds that they were too tired, having begun training half an hour before everyone else. In front of a couple of journalists, he got in a heated argument with the reserve goalkeeper Alan Kelly, one of the players in the squad he rubbed along with better than most. With Lee Carsley and Steve Finnan having picked up injuries on the training pitch, Keane decided he’d had enough of Ireland’s “third world approach to the game” and upon returning to the team hotel, he took McCarthy to one side and announced he wanted to go home.The way Keane tells it, he subsequently apologised to Kelly for the row they’d had, went for a walk and was persuaded to stay on by team physio, concierge and agony uncle Mick Byrne. Upon being informed of the U-turn, McCarthy told Keane he’d already asked the Celtic midfielder Colin Healy to come out as his replacement. Feeling bad for Healy, Keane left it up to McCarthy to decide what should happen next. “I was indecisive,” recalls Keane. “I desperately wanted to play. Yet I couldn’t stand the fuck-ups. There is no hero here.” The indecision continued: Keane told Byrne he was definitely going, secretly hoping he’d be invited to stay. With the news of his imminent departure breaking in Ireland, he spoke on the phone to his adviser Kennedy, then Alex Ferguson. His Manchester United manager told him he had earned the right to change his mind and remain in Saipan. With mere minutes to go before the Republic of Ireland were due to fax their World Cup squad to Fifa, Keane decided to stay and a potential crisis appeared to have been nipped in the bud. Determined to keep his head down and his mouth shut until the squad moved to their proper training camp on the mainland, Keane did exactly that … apart from honouring promises to give a couple of interviews to favoured journalists, one of which appeared in the  the day before the Irish squad were due to leave the island. What could possibly go wrong?“It expressed exactly what I felt,” said Keane of the interview in his book. “I believed the people at home had a right to know the truth. The Irish fans are celebrated for the support they give the team. Thousands of them were flying out on expensive packages to support us in the World Cup. My own brothers and cousin were coming. It was the trip of a lifetime for them. Millions more would be watching the matches at home, as I’d done in 1988 and 1990. Were the people to be treated like mugs? They spent their hard-earned money, paid our wages and then we insult them with PR crap about all they’ve done for us. Maybe we should do something for them to repay the debt we owed them. Like get our act together. And tell them the score now and then.”The end was nigh. The interview caused a sensation in both Ireland and Saipan, prompting the team meeting which resulted in Keane’s exile from the squad. At a hastily convened press conference, McCarthy confirmed the news of Keane’s departure flanked by his new captain Steve Staunton, along with Kelly and Quinn in a show of solidarity. Upstairs in his room, Keane bade farewell to a procession of largely sympathetic team-mates at the door of his hotel room. His World Cup jig was very much up.Appearing at the press conference alongside McCarthy, Kelly and Staunton appears to have been Quinn’s biggest mistake, as Keane saw it as an outright act of betrayal. Wounded at having been accused of disloyalty by McCarthy for feigning injury, he was outraged that none of his team-mates, particularly the more senior ones for whom Japan and South Korea represented a last international hurrah, had not spoken out on his behalf when McCarthy rounded on him. Having made his own travel arrangements with help from staff at Manchester United, he went home to a house under siege from reporters. Several daily dog-walks with Triggs around Cheshire later, with Ireland’s World Cup opener against Cameroon looming, he granted an interview to RTE news reporter Tommie Gorman, who spoke of Keane’s role model status, all but berated him for his use of industrial language at a private team meeting attended by grown men, pleaded with him to think of Ireland’s children and urged him to reconsider his position. With the Irish football press pack listening in from Japan, courtesy of one of their relatives holding a phone up against a television in Dublin, the entire fiasco had officially entered the realms of high farce."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0452ebb2efa217f95475af6d8312dea1a64087e3/129_1128_923_554/master/923.jpg?w=1200\u0026amp;h=630\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;crop=faces%2Centropy\u0026amp;bm=normal\u0026amp;ba=bottom%2Cleft\u0026amp;blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly91cGxvYWRzLmd1aW0uY28udWsvMjAxOC8wMS8zMS9mYWNlYm9va19kZWZhdWx0LnBuZw\u0026amp;s=3e02254974b155b96c16522f1f6e13e4","title":"puerto rico after hurricane maria","story":"With electricity and water still scarce following Hurricane Maria, islanders are angry about perceived US indifferenceGloria Meléndez knew the women’s shelter had to close down. The building was so badly damaged after Hurricane Maria that the electricity didn’t work, and water no longer ran from the taps. With nowhere for the mothers and their children to go, she decided to wait until the new year before closing the door. Shortly before Christmas, local people donated one week’s worth of fuel for the generator.“Christmas is a big deal in Puerto Rico,” says Gloria, who works for the charity Casa de la Bondad. “And so the children decorated the tree, and put lights on it, and then for a few hours each night they lit them up using the generator.”Seven months after the hurricane, all that remains here is the Christmas tree and old boxes of dry food. The entrance is still blocked by piles of rubble, and the water and power are still down. Across Puerto Rico, at least 150,000 people are still without electricity. And a new hurricane season looms in just a few month.As a US territory, an estimated 135,000 people have left Puerto Rico for the mainland. The remaining island residents rely on community efforts and aid from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the US body responsible for disaster response, to try to rebuild. But Gloria faces a different problem. Although the shelter was forced to close down because of hurricane damage, Fema only offers loans to businesses and organisations for hurricane damage, not aid. This means women’s shelters and charitable organisations that cannot afford loans and repairs, and suffered damage when the hurricane struck, are at risk of closure if they cannot find donations. “That just wasn’t a realistic option for us,” Gloria says.Myra Lespier Cruz, a mother of two, is among those benefitting from the support of the few women’s services still operating on the island, such as mental health support and resources for survivors of sexual violence. She still suffers shock from the hurricane, and says it exacerbated her health issues. She believes she would have died without their help. “We were hungry, and they were the ones who gave me food. I went a month without medicine for my anxiety, but they were the ones who helped me,” she says.Myra recalls President Trump’s visit to Puerto Rico. At the time, he spoke of a death toll then estimated at 64. But subsequent media reports and estimations suggest the true number is probably more than 1,000, partly as a result of ongoing trauma caused by the hurricane, including a huge rise in suicide rates.“I remember him saying around 60 people were dead, and I thought, ‘Well, that’s not true.’ There are people I know still dying from having no electricity, people who need medical machines in hospitals.“I felt a lot of rage and frustration about that. We are American citizens too, but why don’t they help us? They’re killing us. They don’t care about our lives.”Gloria and other charities are fighting to have Fema protocols changed to help people like Myra. Earlier this year, they met with the agency to discuss putting arrangements in place to provide them with aid, not loans, if another hurricane hits. In the meantime, Gloria wants to reopen the shelter in the coming months, regardless of the lack of electricity, because of the urgent need for shelters for women who need to leave abusive partners. The Christmas tree that still stands in the shelter, she says, was one of the few reminders of normality the women and children once had. “I hope by the end of this year, we can light up the tree without needing to rely on a generator.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/30f4b9ec8f473c1c82d0e3effd7711d2870bc995/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1272a646421a9427484e68e5199538ed","title":"seven ways to support your immune system","story":"Your body works hard to fight off infections, but there are things you can do to give it a boostMost people know about the benefits of exercise for our hearts, waistlines, muscles and bones. Fewer are aware of how it supports our immune defences, especially as we age. Production of naive T cells, which raise the alarm when they detect infections the immune system has not encountered before, declines as we get older. Research published by Professor Janet Lord’s group at the University of Birmingham last month found that cyclists aged 55 to 79 were generating as many of these cells as young adults and had more B regulatory cells, which help to prevent autoimmune disease. Other studies show moderate to vigorous exercise reduces the risk of upper respiratory tract infections, including the common cold.Sleep is important to the functioning of the immune system. Research suggests that white blood cells in those aged 65 and over who sleep six hours or fewer a night may be less effective in dealing with invading pathogens than cells from those who sleep more. Sleep deprivation also makes people more susceptible to colds and flu.Our guts contain trillions of microbes that play key roles in the immune system. For example, they promote the production of T cells, which help to trigger immune responses and prevent autoimmune diseases. Having a low-fat, high-fibre diet with plenty of vegetables promotes a broad range of gut bugs and boost levels of beneficial bacteria. “Having a varied diet is likely to be better for your bacteria, which is, in turn, likely to be better for your immune function,” says Professor Sheena Cruickshank of the University of Manchester.Probiotics – live bacteria or yeasts added to yoghurts or taken as supplements – can reduce the risk of infectious diarrhoea linked to antibiotic use and help those with ulcerative colitis or pouchitis, a complication of surgery for ulcerative colitis. However, most of the claims made for probiotics are not supported by good-quality research evidence, despite a global market estimated to be worth about $40bn (£29bn). Prebiotics – non-digestible food ingredients that help existing gut probiotics grow – are also available. There are studies that suggest benefits, but most are small-scale and industry-funded. “It’s a huge business, but at this stage it’s not clear which bacteria we might want to nurture to promote health-giving effects, and most people could probably get the same effects with a healthy, balanced diet,” says Cruickshank.Drinking to excess can leave you with more than a hangover. A 2014 study found that drinking four to five shots of vodka reduced levels of white blood cells, which combat infections and cancer, for up to five hours after peak intoxication. Heavy drinking has also been found to undermine the ability of immune cells called macrophages to engulf bacteria.Smokers are more prone to inflammatory diseases and infections such as pneumonia and flu than non-smokers. Research suggests this may be partly down to nicotine undermining the ability of white blood cells called neutrophils to ingest and kill harmful microbes. Smokers also have fewer friendly bacteria and more pathogens in the nasopharynx, the upper part of the throat behind the nose, and higher levels of bacteria that cause skin infections and oral diseases.Our bodies create vitamin D when our skin is exposed to sunlight outdoors. Vitamin D helps to keep our finely tuned immune systems in balance by, for example, stimulating the development of cells that prevent the autoimmune responses seen in conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease, multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis. It is also used by macrophages to help kill harmful bacteria, and supports our defences against colds and flu."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ca3549b3318c46b99df64bf3b39da88226793a71/0_115_2048_1229/master/2048.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=848dd5a33abde27e787afa6fddbd99e4","title":"from glossies to gal dem the websites revolutionising womens media","story":"Frustrated about the narrow, stereotyped world of magazines supposedly aimed at them, a group of female journalists have moved online to tackle politics, social justice and identityOver the past decade, the women’s magazine has undergone a radical makeover. While 00s glossies consisted largely of insidious bodyshaming and bankrupting shoe recommendations, in recent years female-centric journalism has migrated online, simultaneously shifting its gaze to social justice, mental health and the hitherto hidden realities of womanhood. It has not always been a smooth transition: last week, the online women’s magazine the Debrief announced its closure, with its parent company, Bauer Media, deciding to refocus resources into its print product Grazia. Last year, Sarah Millican’s Standard Issue shut, while US website the Hairpin followed suit in January. Yet a host of other publications remain committed to doing things differently. Here, the women behind London-based site gal-dem and Mille World, an online magazine aimed at Arab readers, explain why they are determined to reimagine the women’s magazine as a force for positive change. RASofia Guellaty launched Mille World out of frustration that it did not already exist. She was looking for a publication that engaged with what it meant to be a young Arab woman. Versace, Dior, Calvin Klein and Chanel were sending hijabs down their runways, but who was catering to the savvy, cosmopolitan Arab women looking to reclaim the Arab narrative for an educated Arab audience? It turned out no one was, so Guellaty decided to.Educated in Paris, but born and now based in Tunis, the capital of Tunisia, 35-year-old Guellaty was at the helm of Condé Nast’s first Middle East launch, the now-closed StyleArabia, two years ago. “I kept hearing about things being ‘good enough’ for the Arab market. That really got to me, this ‘good enough’ attitude. Two things: one, it’s not good enough, what you’re doing is crap. Two, it’s racist,” Guellaty says. Two years ago, she quit Condé Nast last May she became pregnant with her first child. It was during her pregnancy that she developed the idea for Mille World. After giving birth, she recruited the first members of the board, which now includes Saudi princess Reema bint Bandar al-Saud and Saif Mahdhi, the president of Next Models. She recruited the company’s CEO, Nez Gebreel, from the Dubai Design and Fashion Council. It was crucial to Guellaty that her executive and editorial team were Arabs and leaders in their field.Mille World launched in January and already has 40,000 unique visitors a month. Its readers come from across the Arab world and diaspora, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Lebanon, Egypt, France, the UK and the US. Its 12-person editorial staff is equally international, based in Dubai, London, Paris and Tunis. The deputy editor, Samira Larouci, 28, has lived in Dalston, London, for years, but she was raised in “very, very white” Chichester by her Moroccan parents. She left i-D magazine in July, having helped set up its luxury lifestyle site, Amuse. She was put in touch with Guellaty by a mutual friend. Their first phone call lasted two and a half hours. “We were talking about Arab identity issues I’ve always been seeking a community of my own to connect with. We both agreed there was a voice missing that we wanted to hear. It was young, inclusive and not based around materialism,” Larouci says. “We wanted to address that need. It’s almost laughable no one’s done it before.”Larouci now commissions and edits the bulk of the site’s editorial content – 60 pieces a month, every one of which is translated into English, French and Arabic. She is interested particularly in Arab counterculture and championing Arab artists who do not have any other platform in their region. “The reader I want to reach is someone studying in Washington, raised in Saudi, who’s in a sort of cultural limbo. That’s where I come from. I want to find those people in LA who are interested in feminism in the Arab world,” Larouci says.Deep in the belly of a south London car park lie the offices of gal-dem, an online magazine produced exclusively by women and non-binary people of colour. It is not big – each of the work studios in Peckham Levels has been converted from a single parking space – but it is significant. By parsing culture and current affairs through a prism of intersectional feminism, covering topics from Grenfell to mooncups, gal-dem is one of the publications changing the face of female-focused media.As a concept, gal-dem is a world away from the blinkered women’s glossies available to the editorial team in their youth. While those magazines shared some women’s stories, the scope was narrow, and much of the content was designed to reaffirm strict beauty standards. gal-dem, meanwhile, has no such agenda, aiming to provide women with just one thing: a voice. In this sense, the site is part of a much broader cultural shift in women’s media – one that has seen print titles fail (recent casualties include Company, She, Glamour, Bliss and Sugar) and a new breed of online magazine take their place. Riding the fourth wave of feminism, publications such as The Pool and Refinery 29 are fuelled not by materialism, but by a rich seam of untapped subject matter: the experiences women have long been told to keep quiet.While the gal-dem team acknowledge their position in the wider landscape of newly feminist media, they are careful to distinguish themselves from their peers. “There is a tendency within feminism for its face to be quite white and middle-class,” says Little. “To see an editorial team comprising women of colour is a rarity I think that is clearly our point of difference.” From her desk in the gal-dem offices, the deputy editor – and  contributor – Charlie Brinkhurst-Cuff explains how the focus on issues that affect women of colour manifests itself in gal-dem’s attitude. “The tone in general is a bit more serious than the Refinerys and Bustles we don’t have that ‘you’re talking to your best friend’ thing going on,” she says. “The nature of the topics we’re talking about a lot of the time don’t really lend themselves to that and we don’t want to ever dilute that seriousness.”Slowly, gal-dem’s efforts to rectify a lack of representation are being echoed by the mainstream media – with decidedly mixed results. Since he took over six months ago, the Vogue editor Edward Enninful has managed to include five women of colour on his covers (February’s Vogue featured Little in a spread about “the new suffragettes”), yet glossies are still regularly derided for their treatment of black women. In November, the actor Lupita Nyong’o expressed her disappointment at Grazia’s decision to photoshop away her natural hair on its cover the previous month, the Evening Standard’s magazine caused much consternation by airbrushing Solange’s braids. And just because online magazines tend to avoid scandal, that does not mean they are necessarily much better, Brinkhurst-Cuff says. “It would be more hidden if there was an issue online, because you don’t have the physical print cover to see. We can say Alexandra Shulman only published 12 black women on the cover, whereas if an online publication is pretty much exclusively publishing white writers or using stock images of white women you’re arguably less likely to pick up on that.” That said, she sees the new online media “struggling towards intersectionality, for the right or wrong reasons. Diversity is in fashion right now, but we hope it’s not always about money.”Money, however, is something gal-dem is beginning to consider seriously. Until now, it has been a voluntary organisation. Nobody gets paid, apart from contributors on specific brand collaborations the annual print issue, the covers of which hang from the office’s chipboard walls, is more passion project than money-maker. But as the site has grown – gal-dem receives “anything from 4,000 to 20,000 unique visitors a day”, according to Little – the team believe it is turning into an economically viable enterprise. Little has just stopped working full-time and the team are developing a business plan.It is still early days for the new breed of women’s magazine and the economic forecast remains uncertain – but, in terms of broadening the scope for women’s media, the legacy of gal-dem and its peers already seems indelible.

He has also asked the Competition Markets Authority to report back on any wider competition issues the deal may raise by the end of the month.“I will then consider whether or not to refer the merger for a more detailed investigation, or whether to accept undertakings-in-lieu of such a reference,” Hancock added.

Here’s why that’s not very clever. By  David RuncimanDemocracy is tired, vindictive, self-deceiving, paranoid, clumsy and frequently ineffectual. Much of the time it is living on past glories. This sorry state of affairs reflects what we have become. But current democracy is not who we are. It is just a system of government, which we built, and which we could replace. So why don’t we replace it with something better?This line of argument has grown louder in recent years, as democratic politics has become more unpredictable and, to many, deeply alarming in its outcomes. First Brexit, then Donald Trump, plus the rise of populism and the spread of ision, has started a tentative search for plausible alternatives. But the rival systems we see around us have a very limited appeal. The unlovely forms of 21st-century authoritarianism can at best provide only a partial, pragmatic alternative to democracy. The world’s strongmen still pander to public opinion, and in the case of competitive authoritarian regimes such as the ones in Hungary and Turkey, they persist with the rigmarole of elections. From Trump to Recep Tayyip Erdoğan is not much of a leap into a brighter future.There is a far more dogmatic alternative, which has its roots in the 19th century. Why not ditch the charade of voting altogether? Stop pretending to respect the views of ordinary people – it’s not worth it, since the people keep getting it wrong. Respect the experts instead! This is the truly radical option. So should we try it?The name for this view of politics is epistocracy: the rule of the knowers. It is directly opposed to democracy, because it argues that the right to participate in political decision-making depends on whether or not you know what you are doing. The basic premise of democracy has always been that it doesn’t matter how much you know: you get a say because you have to live with the consequences of what you do. In ancient Athens, this principle was reflected in the practice of choosing office-holders by lottery. Anyone could do it because everyone – well, everyone who wasn’t a woman, a foreigner, a pauper, a slave or a child – counted as a member of the state. With the exception of jury service in some countries, we don’t choose people at random for important roles any more. But we do uphold the underlying idea by letting citizens vote without checking their suitability for the task.Critics of democracy – starting with Plato – have always argued that it means rule by the ignorant, or worse, rule by the charlatans that the ignorant people fall for. Living in Cambridge, a passionately pro-European town and home to an elite university, I heard echoes of that argument in the aftermath of the Brexit vote. It was usually uttered sotto voce – you have to be a brave person to come out as an epistocrat in a democratic society – but it was unquestionably there. Behind their hands, very intelligent people muttered to each other that this is what you get if you ask a question that ordinary people don’t understand. Dominic Cummings, the author of the “Take Back Control” slogan that helped win the referendum, found that his critics were not so shy about spelling it out to his face. Brexit happened, they told him, because the wicked people lied to the stupid people. So much for democracy.To say that democrats want to be ruled by the stupid and the ignorant is unfair. No defender of democracy has ever claimed that stupidity or ignorance are virtues in themselves. But it is true that democracy doesn’t discriminate on the grounds of a lack of knowledge. It considers the ability to think intelligently about difficult questions a secondary consideration. The primary consideration is whether an inidual is implicated in the outcome. Democracy asks only that the voters should be around long enough to suffer for their own mistakes.The question that epistocracy poses is: why don’t we discriminate on the basis of knowledge? What’s so special about letting everyone take part? Behind it lies the intuitively appealing thought that, instead of living with our mistakes, we should do everything in our power to prevent them in the first place – then it wouldn’t matter who has to take responsibility.This argument has been around for more than 2,000 years. For most of that time, it has been taken very seriously. The consensus until the end of the 19th century was that democracy is usually a bad idea: it is just too risky to put power in the hands of people who don’t know what they are doing. Of course, that was only the consensus among intellectuals. We have little way of knowing what ordinary people thought about the question. Nobody was asking them.Over the course of the 20th century, the intellectual consensus was turned around. Democracy established itself as the default condition of politics, its virtues far outweighing its weaknesses. Now the events of the 21st century have revived some of the original doubts. Democracies do seem to be doing some fairly stupid things at present. Perhaps no one will be able to live with their mistakes. In the age of Trump, climate change and nuclear weapons, epistocracy has teeth again.So why don’t we give more weight to the views of the people who are best qualified to evaluate what to do? Before answering that question, it is important to distinguish between epistocracy and something with which it is often confused: technocracy. They are different. Epistocracy means rule by the people who know best. Technocracy is rule by mechanics and engineers. A technocrat is someone who understands how the machinery works.In November 2011, Greek democracy was suspended and an elected government was replaced by a cabinet of experts, tasked with stabilising the collapsing Greek economy before new elections could be held. This was an experiment in technocracy, however, not epistocracy. The engineers in this case were economists. Even highly qualified economists often haven’t a clue what’s best to do. What they know is how to operate a complex system that they have been instrumental in building – so long as it behaves the way it is meant to. Technocrats are the people who understand what’s best for the machine. But keeping the machine running might be the worst thing we could do. Technocrats won’t help with that question.Both representative democracy and pragmatic authoritarianism have plenty of space for technocracy. Increasingly, each system has put decision-making capacity in the hands of specially trained experts, particularly when it comes to economic questions. Central bankers wield significant power in a wide variety of political systems around the world. For that reason, technocracy is not really an alternative to democracy. Like populism, it is more of an add-on. What makes epistocracy different is that it prioritises the “right” decision over the technically correct decision. It tries to work out where we should be going. A technocrat can only tell us how we should get there.How would epistocracy function in practice? The obvious difficulty is knowing who should count as the knowers. There is no formal qualification for being a general expert. It is much easier to identify a suitable technocrat. Technocracy is more like plumbing than philosophy. When Greece went looking for economic experts to sort out its financial mess, it headed to Goldman Sachs and the other big banks, since that is where the technicians were congregated. When a machine goes wrong, the people responsible for fixing it often have their fingerprints all over it already.Historically, some epistocrats have tackled the problem of identifying who knows best by advocating non-technical qualifications for politics. If there were such a thing as the university of life, that’s where these epistocrats would want political decision-makers to get their higher degrees. But since there is no such university, they often have to make do with cruder tests of competence. The 19th-century philosopher John Stuart Mill argued for a voting system that granted varying numbers of votes to different classes of people depending on what jobs they did. Professionals and other highly educated iniduals would get six or more votes each farmers and traders would get three or four skilled labourers would get two unskilled labourers would get one. Mill also pushed hard for women to get the vote, at a time when that was a deeply unfashionable view. He did not do this because he thought women were the equals of men. It was because he thought some women, especially the better educated, were superior to most men. Mill was a big fan of discrimination, so long as it was on the right grounds.To 21st-century eyes, Mill’s system looks grossly undemocratic. Why should a lawyer get more votes than a labourer? Mill’s answer would be to turn the question on its head: why should a labourer get the same number of votes as a lawyer? Mill was no simple democrat, but he was no technocrat either. Lawyers didn’t qualify for their extra votes because politics placed a special premium on legal expertise. No, lawyers got their extra votes because what’s needed are people who have shown an aptitude for thinking about questions with no easy answers. Mill was trying to stack the system to ensure as many different points of view as possible were represented. A government made up exclusively of economists or legal experts would have horrified him. The labourer still gets a vote. Skilled labourers get two. But even though a task like bricklaying is a skill, it is a narrow one. What was needed was breadth. Mill believed that some points of view carried more weight simply because they had been exposed to more complexity along the way.Jason Brennan, a very 21st-century philosopher, has tried to revive the epistocratic conception of politics, drawing on thinkers like Mill. In his 2016 book Against Democracy, Brennan insists that many political questions are simply too complex for most voters to comprehend. Worse, the voters are ignorant about how little they know: they lack the ability to judge complexity because they are so attached to simplistic solutions that feel right to them.Brennan writes: “Suppose the United States had a referendum on whether to allow significantly more immigrants into the country. Knowing whether this is a good idea requires tremendous social scientific knowledge. One needs to know how immigration tends to affect crime rates, domestic wages, immigrants’ welfare, economic growth, tax revenues, welfare expenditures and the like. Most Americans lack this knowledge in fact, our evidence is that they are systematically mistaken.”In other words, it’s not just that they don’t know it’s not even that they don’t know that they don’t know it’s that they are wrong in ways that reflect their unwavering belief that they are right.Brennan doesn’t have Mill’s faith that we can tell how well-equipped someone is to tackle a complex question by how difficult that person’s job is. There is too much chance and social conditioning involved. He would prefer an actual exam, to “screen out citizens who are badly misinformed or ignorant about the election, or who lack basic social scientific knowledge”. Of course, this just pushes the fundamental problem back a stage without resolving it: who gets to set the exam? Brennan teaches at a university, so he has little faith in the disinterested qualities of most social scientists, who have their own ideologies and incentives. He has also seen students cramming for exams, which can produce its own biases and blind spots. Still, he thinks Mill was right to suggest that the further one advances up the educational ladder, the more votes one should get: five extra votes for finishing high school, another five for a bachelor’s degree, and five more for a graduate degree.Brennan is under no illusions about how provocative this case is today, 150 years after Mill made it. In the middle of the 19th century, the idea that political status should track social and educational standing was barely contentious today, it is barely credible. Brennan also has to face the fact that contemporary social science provides plenty of evidence that the educated are just as subject to groupthink as other people, sometimes even more so. The political scientists Larry Bartels and Christopher Achen point this out in their 2016 book Democracy for Realists: “The historical record leaves little doubt that the educated, including the highly educated, have gone wrong in their moral and political thinking as often as everyone else.” Cognitive biases are no respecters of academic qualifications. How many social science graduates would judge the question about immigration according to the demanding tests that Brennan lays out, rather than according to what they would prefer to believe? The irony is that if Brennan’s voter exam were to ask whether the better-educated deserve more votes, the technically correct answer might be no. It would depend on who was marking it.However, in one respect Brennan insists that the case for epistocracy has grown far stronger since Mill made it. That is because Mill was writing at the dawn of democracy. Mill published his arguments in the run-up to what became the Second Reform Act of 1867, which doubled the size of the franchise in Britain to nearly 2.5 million voters (out of a general population of 30 million). Mill’s case for epistocracy was based on his conviction that over time it would merge into democracy. The labourer who gets one vote today would get more tomorrow, once he had learned how to use his vote wisely. Mill was a great believer in the educative power of democratic participation.Brennan thinks we now have 100-plus years of evidence that Mill was wrong. Voting is bad for us. It doesn’t make people better informed. If anything, it makes them stupider, because it dignifies their prejudices and ignorance in the name of democracy. “Political participation is not valuable for most people,” Brennan writes. “On the contrary, it does most of us little good and instead tends to stultify and corrupt us. It turns us into civic enemies who have grounds to hate one another.” The trouble with democracy is that it gives us no reason to become better informed. It tells us we are fine as we are. And we’re not.In the end, Brennan’s argument is more historical than philosophical. If we were unaware of how democracy would turn out, it might make sense to cross our fingers and assume the best of it. But he insists that we do know, and so we have no excuse to keep kidding ourselves. Brennan thinks that we should regard epistocrats like himself as being in the same position as democrats were in the mid-19th century. What he is championing is anathema to many people, as democracy was back then. Still, we took a chance on democracy, waiting to see how it would turn out. Why shouldn’t we take a chance on epistocracy, now we know how the other experiment went? Why do we assume that democracy is the only experiment we are ever allowed to run, even after it has run out of steam?It’s a serious question, and it gets to how the longevity of democracy has stifled our ability to think about the possibility of something different. What was once a seemingly reckless form of politics has become a byword for caution. And yet there are still good reasons to be cautious about ditching it. Epistocracy remains the reckless idea. There are two dangers in particular.The first is that we set the bar too high in politics by insisting on looking for the best thing to do. Sometimes it is more important to avoid the worst. Even if democracy is often bad at coming up with the right answers, it is good at unpicking the wrong ones. Moreover, it is good at exposing people who think they always know best. Democratic politics assumes there is no settled answer to any question and it ensures that is the case by allowing everyone a vote, including the ignorant. The randomness of democracy – which remains its essential quality – protects us against getting stuck with truly bad ideas. It means that nothing will last for long, because something else will come along to disrupt it.Epistocracy is flawed because of the second part of the word rather than the first – this is about power (kratos) as much as it is about knowledge (episteme). Fixing power to knowledge risks creating a monster that can’t be deflected from its course, even when it goes wrong – which it will, since no one and nothing is infallible. Not knowing the right answer is a great defence against people who believe that their knowledge makes them superior.Brennan’s response to this argument (a version of which is made by David Estlund in his 2007 book Democratic Authority) is to turn it on its head. Since democracy is a form of kratos, too, he says, why aren’t we concerned about protecting iniduals from the incompetence of the demos just as much as from the arrogance of the epistocrats? But these are not the same kinds of power. Ignorance and foolishness don’t oppress in the same way that knowledge and wisdom do, precisely because they are incompetent: the demos keeps changing its mind.The democratic case against epistocracy is a version of the democratic case against pragmatic authoritarianism. You have to ask yourself where you’d rather be when things go wrong. Maybe things will go wrong quicker and more often in a democracy, but that is a different issue. Rather than thinking of democracy as the least worst form of politics, we could think of it as the best when at its worst. It is the difference between Winston Churchill’s famous dictum and a similar one from Alexis de Tocqueville a hundred years earlier that is less well-known but more apposite. More fires get started in a democracy, de Tocqueville said, but more fires get put out, too.The recklessness of epistocracy is also a function of the historical record that Brennan uses to defend it. A century or more of democracy may have uncovered its failings, but they have also taught us that we can live with them. We are used to the mess and attached to the benefits. Being an epistocrat like Mill before democracy had got going is very different from being one now that democracy is well established. We now know what we know, not just about democracy’s failings, but about our tolerance for its incompetences.The great German sociologist Max Weber, writing at the turn of the 20th century, took it for granted that universal suffrage was a dangerous idea, because of the way that it empowered the mindless masses. But he argued that once it had been granted, no sane politician should ever think about taking it away: the backlash would be too terrible. The only thing worse than letting everyone vote is telling some people that they no longer qualify. Never mind who sets the exam, who is going to tell us that we’ve failed? Mill was right: democracy comes after epistocracy, not before. You can’t run the experiment in reverse.The cognitive biases that epistocracy is meant to rescue us from are what will ultimately scupper it. Loss aversion makes it more painful to be deprived of something we have that doesn’t always work than something we don’t have that might. It’s like the old joke. Q: “Do you know the way to Dublin?” A: “Well, I wouldn’t start from here.” How do we get to a better politics? Well, maybe we shouldn’t start from here. But here is where we are.Still, there must be other ways of trying to inject more wisdom into democratic politics than an exam. This is the 21st century: we have new tools to work with. If many of the problems with democracy derive from the business of politicians hawking for votes at election time, which feeds noise and bile into the decision-making process, perhaps we should try to simulate what people would choose under more sedate and reflective conditions. For instance, it may be possible to extrapolate from what is known about voters’ interests and preferences what they ought to want if they were better able to access the knowledge they needed. We could run mock elections that replicate the input from different points of view, as happens in real elections, but which strip out all the distractions and distortions of democracy in action.Brennan suggests the following: “We can administer surveys that track citizens’ political preferences and demographic characteristics, while testing their basic objective political knowledge. Once we have this information, we can simulate what would happen if the electorate’s demographics remained unchanged, but all citizens were able to get perfect scores on tests of objective political knowledge. We can determine, with a strong degree of confidence, what ‘We the People’ would want, if only ‘We the People’ understood what we were talking about.”Democratic dignity – the idea that all citizens should be allowed to express their views and have them taken seriously by politicians – goes out the window under such a system. We are each reduced to data points in a machine-learning exercise. But, according to Brennan, the outcomes should improve.In 2017, a US-based digital technology company called Kimera Systems announced that it was close to developing an AI named Nigel, whose job was to help voters know how they should vote in an election, based on what it already knew of their personal preferences. Its creator, Mounir Shita, declared: “Nigel tries to figure out your goals and what reality looks like to you and is constantly assimilating paths to the future to reach your goals. It’s constantly trying to push you in the right direction.”This is the more personalised version of what Brennan\u0026nbspis proposing, with some of the democratic dignity plugged back in. Nigel is not trying to work out what’s best for everyone, only what’s best for you. It accepts your version of reality. Yet Nigel understands that you are incapable of drawing the correct political inferences from your preferences. You need help, from a\u0026nbspmachine that has seen enough of your personal behaviour to understand what it is you are after. Siri recommends books you might like. Nigel recommends political parties and policy positions.Would this be so bad? To many people it instinctively sounds like a parody of democracy because it treats us like confused children. But to Shita it is an enhancement of democracy because it takes our desires seriously. Democratic politicians don’t much care what it is that\u0026nbspwe actually want. They care what it is they can persuade us we want, so they can better appeal to it. Nigel puts the voter first. At the same time, by protecting us from our own confusion and inattention, Nigel strives to improve our self-understanding. Brennan’s version effectively gives up on Mill’s original\u0026nbspidea that voting might be an educative experience. Shita hasn’t given up. Nigel is trying to nudge us along the path to self-knowledge. We\u0026nbspmight end up learning who we really are.The fatal flaw with this approach, however, is that we risk learning only who it is we think we are, or who it is we would like to be. Worse, it is who we would like to be now, not who or what we might become in the future. Like focus groups, Nigel provides a snapshot of a set of\u0026nbspattitudes at a moment in time. The danger of any system\u0026nbspof machine learning is that it produces feedback\u0026nbsploops. By restricting the dataset to our past behaviour, Nigel teaches us nothing about what other people think, or even about other ways of seeing the world. Nigel simply mines the archive of our attitudes for the most consistent expression of our identities. If we lean left, we will end up leaning further left. If we lean right, we will end up leaning further right. Social and political ision would widen. Nigel is designed to\u0026nbspclose the circle in our minds.There are technical fixes for feedback loops. Systems can be adjusted to inject alternative points of view, to notice when data is becoming self-reinforcing or simply to randomise the evidence. We can shake things up to lessen the risk that we get set in our ways. For instance, Nigel could make sure that we visit websites that challenge rather than reinforce our preferences. Alternatively, on Brennan’s model, the aggregation of\u0026nbspour preferences could seek to take account of the likelihood that Nigel had exaggerated rather than tempered who we really are. A Nigel of Nigels – a machine that helps other machines to better align their\u0026nbspown goals – could try to strip out the distortions from the artificial democracy we have built. After all, Nigel is our servant, not our master. We can always tell him what to do.But that is the other fundamental problem with 21st-century epistocracy: we won’t be the ones telling Nigel what to do. It will be the technicians who have built the system. They are the experts we rely on to rescue us from feedback loops. For this reason, it is hard\u0026nbspto see how 21st-century epistocracy can avoid collapsing back into technocracy. When things go wrong, the knowers will be powerless to correct for them. Only the engineers who built the machines have\u0026nbspthat capacity, which means that it will be the engineers who have the power.In recent weeks, we have been given a glimpse of\u0026nbspwhat rule by engineers might look like. It is not an authoritarian nightmare of oppression and violence. It is a picture of confusion and obfuscation. The power of engineers never fully comes out into the open, because most people don’t understand what it is they do. The sight of Mark Zuckerberg, perched on his cushion, batting off the ignorant questions of the people’s representatives in Congress is a glimpse of a technocratic future in which democracy meets its\u0026nbspmatch. But this is not a radical alternative to democratic politics. It is simply a distortion of it.Adapted from How Democracy Ends by David Runciman, which will be published by Profile on 10 May.

Thank you.It’s too early to say, of course, how the week’s big domestic news – the resignation of Amber Rudd over an uncontainable immigration scandal and her replacement as home secretary by Sajid Javid – will affect the ongoing Brexit talks.On paper at least, Theresa May has maintained the crucial balance on the cabinet’s key 11-member Brexit subcommittee: five pro, five anti, and the prime minister herself with the casting vote. But that may not be the whole story.Javid is a more reluctant remainer than Rudd, and does not wield the same clout. We do not know whether he will adopt a more pro-business immigration stance after Brexit, or – perhaps more significantly – whether Rudd, a committed pro-European, will join the ranks of Tory backbench rebels in upcoming Brexit votes.We may get an inkling of some of the above at a crucial subcommittee meeting this week to discuss the so-called “customs partnership” with the EU that May hopes will solve some of her Brexit problems – but that cabinet Brexiters detest.Government isions over the partnership plan were laid bare when David Davis reportedly threatened to resign unless May sidelined Olly Robbins, the top Brexit civil servant (whose idea it is). The Brexit secretary subsequently denied the story. Underlining the impression that crunch time is approaching on the customs union, the EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, warned that talks were at risk of collapse if the UK did not soften its red lines and deliver fresh thinking on the Irish border. And there was yet another heavy Lords defeat, on a potentially highly significant amendment to the EU withdrawal bill that could pave the way for parliament to send ministers back to Brussels to renegotiate if MPs vote down the withdrawal deal in the autumn.In The Observer, Andrew Rawnsley argues that the days when Theresa May could muddle through Brexit, keeping her party’s hard Brexiters and unreconciled remainers together, are fast running out:The hard Brexiters are clearly fearful that Britain will end up in a customs union, or something very similar by a slightly different name. So they are trying to put a gun to the prime minister’s head by predicting that it will trigger cabinet resignations, which I am pretty sure it would, and a full-scale Tory civil war, which would blow away her premiership. They menace her with a confidence vote in her leadership … which would not necessarily remove her as prime minister, but is not a prospect she wants to face, which is why they make the threat. May has not found an answer to this crunch other than to try to delay it. The government has stalled a chunk of the withdrawal legislation to try to swerve the moment of truth, but it won’t be able to duck a binding vote for ever. The great rupture of the Tory party over Brexit cannot be avoided indefinitely. What might look to some like cunning cleverness is, on closer inspection, really an exercise in trying to postpone the inevitable while desperately hoping that something will turn up. And in the , Marina Hyde says David Davis excels in a “government of all the talentless”, and even the Brexit secretary’s allies are worried – but he’s safe, because his colleagues are even worse:It’s long been traditional to describe a lazy performance by an actor as phoned in. In the case of DExEu’s David Davis, however, he doesn’t even text it in. The secretary of state’s performance in front of the Brexit select committee this week basically amounted to a series of emoticons. He can’t do you an explanation of how in the name of magical thinking the government can square its promises on the Irish border with promises on leaving the customs union – but he can do you the shrug. ¯\\_(ツ)_¯ Did you miss it? Don’t worry. Just ask him another question and he’ll do it again … The cabinet is now cobbled together from two sides of the referendum ide, each of whom accused the other of the most despicable lies during the campaign. Ever since, preposterously, they have expected the public to accept that they are telling the truth when they act together. How is this supposed to work? … What will eventually unite many leave and remain voters, one suspects, is the enraged conviction that the politicians should have known what they were doing with Brexit, and rather sooner than this.A warm European welcome for the new home secretary: "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/228680381c3818939c4023121b70a8ffa84c726d/0_104_6346_3808/master/6346.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=67b96095e186c0a8b4916e3017b698af","title":"could grenfell cost the tories control of kensington and chelsea","story":"Labour is knocking on doors it never has before amid fierce criticism of the council’s response to the tragedyIn a church hall on a pretty Chelsea side-street lined with stuccoed Victorian houses, the local great and good gathered for a hustings before this week’s council elections.There were grumbles about local planning and the proposed Crossrail station on Kings Road but, surprisingly for a borough which has been so traumatised by the tragedy, the Grenfell fire barely got a mention.“It does make me wonder whether they’re more concerned about hanging baskets than they are about what happened there,” said one attendee. “It felt like a different world.”A few days later, at the other end of the borough and just a couple of hundred metres from the burnt-out shell of the tower, Jeremy Corbyn addressed dozens of placard-waving activists.“We’re going to put the government on notice,” the Labour leader announced to cheers. “And the council!” remarked one supporter.While psephologists and political analysts have been predicting results across the country, nobody is very keen to call Kensington and Chelsea.Even one of the most senior officials at the town hall is reluctant to be drawn. “I wouldn’t put money on it either way,” he said.On paper it looks like an almost insurmountable challenge for Labour, which holds just 11 seats to the Tories’ 37, all clustered in the poorer northern wards while the wealthier south remains true blue. Labour would have to take 15 more seats – overturning huge majorities in some – to win control.But many believe that the tide is turning. Labour’s Emma Dent Coad sent shockwaves through the local Tory establishment when she won Kensington at the 2017 general election, primarily on the back of Brexit in one of the most remain-supporting constituencies in the country.Then came the horrors of the Grenfell fire, which killed 71 people, and the woefully inadequate response from the town hall which saw even national Tory politicians heaping on the criticism.Jackie Michael, 57, who has lived in the north of the borough for more than a decade, said: “It is inconceivable that the Tories hang on to the council after the disastrous way they responded to the fire. All you need to do is look up, and you see the tower. It’s a constant symbol of their ineptitude.”But Robert Atkinson, Labour group leader on the council, is cautious. “In the last 12 months we’ve made astonishing progress in all areas of K\u0026ampC and while we may not take the council this time, we’re certainly going to come close to it,” he told the . “But there will be future elections and we will then be starting from a much stronger position.”Party insiders believe the most likely outcome is that it piles on votes in wards it already holds, while picking up a few extra seats in those which are currently split between the two main parties, although not enough to take control. “But we’re fighting seriously in wards where we haven’t fought for years,” said one Labour candidate.They also play down the relevance of Dent Coad’s victory. “It’s not quite as revolutionary as people think,” said one, suggesting the outspoken MP fears she may not win a second time so is keeping her options open by standing again for the council.Momentum has been out in force and, although Corbyn was campaigning in Ladbroke Grove, so far he has stayed away from the south of the borough. “I don’t think it would help if he was seen down the Kings Road,” said one party insider.Back in Chelsea, however, Labour is knocking on some doors it never has before. Activists report that some lifelong Tory voters think the council’s handling of Grenfell has been a disgrace, but concede that the most they can hope for is that they stay at home on Thursday.The local Conservative party was condemned for its insensitivity in November for sending out a questionnaire in one of the richest parts of the borough asking people to rate the importance of Grenfell as an issue alongside rubbish collections and parking.But some voters think that enough is enough. “The council has spent a fortune on big new homes for Grenfell victims. Why are they still complaining? It’s about time the self-flagellation stopped,” said one.Labour is attempting to stir up anti-Brexit sentiment among the thousands of European citizens who live in the borough – many of them in Chelsea - and who make up almost a fifth of the electorate.“Don’t overlook the fury of the Europeans,” said one candidate. “Usually these people don’t think local government matters. So we hope some can be prodded into casting a protest vote.”The biggest issues that come up on the doorstep in this part of the borough, however, are planning and parking. John Miller, 72, a retired accountant, said: “While we all recognise how terrible Grenfell was, I think any council would have struggled to deal with it. I am more likely to judge them on how they look after our public realm and our streets.”Whatever the result, the incoming council is going to look very different to the old one, with 17 Tory councillors not standing for re-election. Some have retired, others have stepped down over the fire and its aftermath.The Tory leader, Elizabeth Campbell, who took over after the fire, has been campaigning “all over the borough”, perhaps mindful of the damage done when she admitted she had never been inside a tower block before Grenfell.She is reluctant to comment on whether the tragedy – or the fact that some victims are still waiting for new permanent homes – will affect her electoral chances. “I can’t predict things. I can only just work as hard as I can, so we will see. Ask me afterwards,” she said in one interview.Daniel Moylan, a former deputy leader of the council who is standing down as councillor this time, is also hedging his bets. “It will be tough for the Conservatives. We could lose some seats but it will be difficult for Labour to take control of the council,” he said. “It would be a political tsunami if we lost. Though, of course, tsunamis do happen.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9ccf23865a542882fa71cf4ef707cb7149ac7bd7/0_608_1819_1090/master/1819.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9698b2e86f7131bbc879490839483d0f","title":"liam fox accuses lords of trying to block brexit","story":"Senior Tories say amendments to EU withdrawal bill risk tying government’s hands in Brussels talksTheresa May and cabinet ministers have expressed “strong disappointment” at a string of fresh defeats in the House of Lords over the EU withdrawal bill, with Liam Fox accusing unelected peers of trying to block the UK from leaving the European Union.Ministers said they were concerned that the amendments risked tying the government’s hands behind its back in negotiations with Brussels at discussions during its weekly meeting, Downing Street said. The prime minister and the Brexit secretary, David Davis, told the cabinet the government would be “robust” when the bill returned to the House of Commons, her spokesman said, saying it was “vital to ensure that the legislation is able to deliver the smooth Brexit which is in the interests of everybody in the UK”.Speaking earlier on Tuesday, Fox said it would be rash for Labour MPs who represent leave-voting constituencies to back the Lords’ amendments to the EU withdrawal bill when it returns to the Commons.The government suffered three more Brexit defeats in the House of Lords overnight, taking the total to nine, and Fox’s appeal to Labour MPs suggests the government is banking on the support of opposition Brexiters to quash the changes.The key defeat was an amendment that would allow parliament to send ministers back to the negotiating table if MPs voted down Theresa May’s Brexit deal.Labour said the new clause to the EU withdrawal bill would in effect prevent Britain crashing out of the EU with no deal and would give Tory remainers the confidence to vote against a damaging deal. The cross-party amendment, supported by 19 Conservative rebels, succeeded with a majority of 91. Fox said on Tuesday: “I think there’s a very big debate now about whether the unelected house can actually thwart the view of the British electorate in a referendum and … legislation coming from the House of Commons.”He conceded the parliamentary arithmetic was difficult in a hung parliament. “We don’t have a parliamentary majority and that makes life harder, but there are of course quite a number of Labour MPs who represent seats where there is a very heavy vote in favour of leaving … who I think are rash, to say the least, if they try to confront the democratic view of the British people,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.Downing Street would not commit to saying the prime minister was confident she would overturn all of the defeats in the Lords. “We will look at the amendments, but the fundamental point is that the bill left the House of Commons in a way that could deliver a smooth Brexit and that is how we want the bill to complete its course,” the spokesman said. “What is important is that it keeps the government’s hands open on negotiations with Brussels.” The slew of Lords defeats, and the difficulties they will pose in the Commons, will cast a shadow over a crucial meeting of the Brexit cabinet subcommittee this week, where senior ministers are split over the customs union.Key Brexiters want to drop one of the two options put forward by the government. Fox and Boris Johnson have called on May to abandon her preferred option of a “customs partnership”, which relies on Britain collecting EU import tariffs on behalf of Brussels.The option would bring the UK closer to solving issues over the Northern Irish border but Brexiter critics have said it would be a customs union in all but name. Fox said on Tuesday: “I don’t think there is a customs union that could ever be acceptable. If we are in a customs union of any sort we will have less ability to shape Britain’s future than we have today. That is not what the public voted for.”Fox refused to deny he would resign if a customs partnership was agreed, and did not challenge the assertion by the Today presenter John Humphrys that May was a “horribly weakened prime minister”, replying that a hung parliament had made agreeing its Brexit legislation harder.Overnight, peers also voted for an amendment that would require parliamentary approval for the Brexit negotiating mandate in phase two of the talks – similar to the process where EU27 leaders approve the mandate of their chief negotiator, Michel Barnier. The third defeat was led by the Labour peer Alf Dubs, who won backing for his amendment that would ensure child asylum seekers would be allowed to join family members in the UK after Brexit.A Liberal Democrat attempt to amend the bill to give voters a referendum on the final deal did not pass, although one Labour frontbench peer, Philip Hunt, ignored party orders to abstain and voted in favour. Labour sources said he would be hauled before Labour’s leader in the Lords and chief whip, but the Conservatives called for him to be sacked."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/38c6a2598230a414b858f0366b349a2511499858/0_735_4900_2940/master/4900.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fa16ae1b1235e2369b46181fb989044f","title":"uk to introduce public ownership registers for overseas territories","story":"Government says it will support bill amendment designed to stem global flow of ‘dirty money’Britain’s overseas territories will have to introduce public ownership registers, after a minister announced the government would support a backbench amendment designed to stem the global flow of “dirty money”.Sir Alan Duncan, the foreign office minister, told the Commons that the Conservatives recognised “the majority view in this house” and that the government would not oppose an amendment to the sanctions and anti-money laundering bill put down by the Labour MP Margaret Hodge and the Conservative MP Andrew Mitchell.The retreat came minutes after the Speaker rejected a string of government compromise amendments, which would have watered down the disclosure commitment, because they were tabled so late.The HodgeMitchell amendment requires the 14 overseas territories, including the financial centres of the British Virgin Islands and the Cayman Islands, to introduce public ownership registers by the end of 2020 or face having them imposed by the UK government.The campaign group Global Witness estimates that £68bn flowed out of Russia via British overseas territories between 2007 and 2016. Around half the companies referred to in the Panama Papers were set up in the British Virgin Islands (BVI), according to Transparency International. Speaking minutes after Duncan, Hodge said the importance of the issue justified intervention in the affairs of the overseas territories. “The areas on which we have intervened … are moral issues. I can’t think of another issue which is more moral than trying to intervene to prevent the traffic in corrupt money and illicit finance across the world.”Mitchell told MPs that the justification for disclosure was made “elegantly but passively” by the leaking of the Panama and Paradise Papers, which revealed the true owners of thousands of offshore companies. “It is only by openness and scrutiny, by allowing charities, NGOs and the media to join up the dots, that we can expose this dirty money and those people standing behind it. Closed registers do not begin to allow us to do it.”Twenty Tory rebels had been lined up to support the amendment, which also had the support of Labour, the Scottish National party and the Liberal Democrats. Representatives of the territories had argued that the disclosure requirement would be expensive to implement at a time when countries in the Caribbean were recovering from the impact of Hurricane Irma.

It was left to the third MEP, Sinn Féin’s Martina Anderson, to greet Barnier when he arrived at the Guildhall on Tuesday. Anderson said: “I think it’s political bad manners that the MEPs – and I have to say the two council leads from the DUP and UUP – were both invited here this morning, and neither of them have turned up.” On Monday, the DUP leader, Arlene Foster, said Barnier did not understand or respect unionism and was more allied to the Sinn Féin position on Northern Ireland.The DUP is implacably opposed to regulatory alignment on the island of Ireland if it creates barriers between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK, while Sinn Féin has called for a special status for the region so it can remain allied to the customs union and single market. Inside the EU, both Ireland and Northern Ireland are part of the single market and customs union so share the same regulations and standards, allowing a soft or invisible border between the two.Britain’s exit from the EU – taking Northern Ireland with it – risks a return to a hard or policed border. The only way to avoid this post-Brexit is for regulations on both sides to remain more or less the same in key areas including food, animal welfare, medicines and product safety.Early drafts of the agreement Britain hoped to get signed off on Monday said there would be “no ergence” from EU rules that “support north-south cooperation”, later changed to “continued alignment” in a formulation that appeared to allow for subtle ergences.But it raised new questions about who would oversee it and how disputes might be resolved. It was also clearly still a step too far for the DUP.Anderson said: “All three of us should be maximising the opportunity when Michel Barnier is in our constituency.“On the one hand, while they say they don’t want a hard border in Ireland, I think what it does do is send a signal to the constituencies that are living adjacent to the border that maybe they don’t care too much.”Dodds said she had not snubbed Barnier but had committed to meetings in London and could not meet him. She told the BBC she had met him in Brussels “a few weeks ago” and insisted it was important to provide input at the Brexit discussions in London."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fdaa79e8cac26cff6e7106336e364a3f2b7ebbcf/0_186_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=825f51c0b0ba920b2a24adcd8389fac4","title":"brexit david davis lords liam fox tells may that compromising over customs union would be unacceptable politics live","story":"Rolling coverage of the day’s political developments as they happen, including David Davis giving evidence to the Lords EU committee on BrexitDamian Collins, the Conservative MP who chairs the Commons culture committee, has issued yet another request to the Facebook boss Mark Zuckerberg asking him to give evidence to the committee’s inquiry into “fake news”. But now he is threatening to issue a formal summons to Zuckerberg when he next steps foot on British soil.Collins has set out the demand in an open letter to Facebook’s head of policy in the UK. He says that Zuckerberg needs to appear because the evidence from Mike Schroepfer, the Facebook chief technical officer sent to address the committee in place of Zuckerberg last month, “lacked many of the important details” needed. Schroepfer failed to answer fully on almost 40 points, Collins says.He says Zuckerberg is giving evidence to the European parliament in May and he suggests Zuckerberg visits London to give evidence to the committee on 24 May. Collins goes on:It is worth noting that, while Mr Zuckerberg does not normally come under the jurisdiction of the UK parliament, he will do so the next time he enters the country. We hope that he will respond positively to our request, but if not the committee will resolve to issue a formal summons for him to appear when he is next in the UK.The power of select committees to summon witnesses is limited. In extremis they can issue a formal summons and this involves the serjeant at arms, or a proxy, being despatched to deliver a legalistic letter. (It’s a bit like serving a writ.) It happened to the Murdochs seven years ago and Collins is Zuckerberg could get the same treatment when he next comes to London - or, conceivably, the moment he gets off a plane at Heathrow.The days when parliament could use force to bring someone to the Commons are long gone. Anyone who receives a summons can ignore it. But the Commons would in those circumstances pass a resolution censuring them for contempt of parliament, and normally the reputation threat that involves is enough persuade people to turn up (as happened with the Murdochs).Transparency International UK, another group campaigning against corruption, has also welcomed the government’s concession. This is from its director of policy, Duncan Hames (a former Lib Dem MP).This is very welcome news that the UK will finally be able to open up the financial centres in the British Overseas Territories. These jurisdictions have long been the Achilles Heel of our defences against dirty money. Agreement on this represents a hugely significant moment in the fight against corruption, not just in the UK but around the world.This afternoon, corrupt iniduals everywhere will be deeply concerned that they are about to lose the secrecy afforded by the British Overseas Territories that has until now given them an easy route to launder their ill-gotten gains.We hope that those territories will now use the opportunity they have over the next 18 months to implement these registers and shut the door to dirty money.Andrew Mitchell, the Conservative former international development secretary and a co-signatory of NC6, is speaking now. He says this is the fourth time the Commons has addressed this issue and it is now time to act. Referring to the government’s decision to back down, he says that illustrates how in a hung parliament power shifts from the cabinet room to the floor of the House of Commons.Global Witness, which campaigns against corruption globally, has put out this statement about the government’s concession. It is from the Global Witness campaigner Naomi Hirst.Today’s announcement is a huge win in the fight against the corruption, tax dodging and money laundering.The UK’s tax havens have featured in countless corruption and money laundering cases – ending their corporate secrecy will throw a huge ner in the works of corrupt dictators, tax evaders and organised criminals.This is the result of years of dogged campaigning by MPs, investigative journalists and a coalition of anti-corruption and anti-poverty campaigners from around the world.This now raises the stakes for the remaining jurisdictions which are happy to sell secrecy – it is now only a matter of time until anonymous companies are a thing of the past.Here is my colleague Patrick Wintour, the ’s diplomatic editor, on the significance of the government’s concession.Dame Margaret Hodge is speaking now. She welcomes the government’s decision to accept her amendment. And she pays tribute to Andrew Mitchell, the Conservative former international development secretary who co-signed the amendment for all he has done to help her with her campaign.She says her amendment does no more and no less than fulfil the commitment David Cameron made when he was prime minister five years ago.She says that without public registers, the overseas territories are a haven for “crooks, kleptocrats and corrupt iniduals who engage in financial skulduggery”.She says it would be better if the overseas territories willingly enacted public registers. But they have had five years to do that, and have not acted yet, she says.She says her amendment will give them a further three years.She says the UK should be showing leadership on this.Labour’s Chris Bryant says the amendment refers to beneficial ownership of companies. Doesn’t Hodge agree that there should be legislation for beneficial ownership of trusts too?Hodge says she does agree. That is a subject for another campaign, she says.John Penrose, the Conservative MP and a government anti-corruption champion, also intervenes. He agrees with the need for beneficial ownership registers to go further. They should cover property and other assets too. He says, without wider application, he is concerned that this measure might not have quite the impact some people expect.Helen Goodman, a shadow Foreign Office minister, is speaking in the debate now. She welcomes the government’s acceptance of NC6. (See 2.22pm.) But she says if public registers of beneficial ownership are right for the overseas territories, they should be right for the crown dependencies (Jersey, Guernsey and the Isle of Man) too. In his speech Sir Alan Duncan also said the government would offer the overseas territories “the fullest possible legal and logistical support” to help them establish public registers of beneficial ownership. He said: Her Majesty’s government is acutely conscious of the sensitivities about this in the overseas territories and the response it may provoke. I therefore today give the overseas territories the fullest possible assurance that we will work very closely with them in shaping and implementing the order of council that this act of parliament might require. To that end, we will offer them the fullest possible legal and logistical support that they might ask of us. We retain our fullest respect for the overseas territories and their constitutional rights and we will work with them to protect their interests.Here is the key passage in the amendment, new clause 6 (NC6).(1) For the purposes of the detection, investigation or prevention of money laundering, the secretary of state must provide all reasonable assistance to the governments of the British Overseas Territories to enable each of those governments to establish a publicly accessible register of the beneficial ownership of companies registered in each government’s jurisdiction.(2) The secretary of state must, no later than 31 December 2020, prepare a draft order in council requiring the government of any British Overseas Territory that has not introduced a publicly accessible register of the beneficial ownership of companies within its jurisdiction to do so.The full text of NC6 is here (pdf).This is how Sir Alan Duncan, the Foreign Office minister, announced the register of beneficial ownership U-turn. (See 2.05pm.) Here is some reaction to the government U-turn from Labour MPs.Sir Alan Duncan now turns to beneficial ownership in his speech.He says he tried to address this by tabling his own amendment. This would have taken measures to get crown dependencies to establish public registers of beneficial ownership, short of legislation.He says he thinks there would have been a majority for his amendment. But it was not selected, he says.He says the government proposal would have avoided the prospect of there being a constitutional clash between London and the overseas territories.Turning to the Hodge amendment, he says the concern is that it would compel the UK to legislate if the overseas territories act by the end of 2020.He says these territories have registers that are available to the law enforcement agencies.The arguments are finally balanced, he says. The government recognises the need to tackle fraud.But the economic impact on the overseas territories will be signficant. They have their own legislatures. They are not represented in this parliament. Legislating on their behalf would disenfranchise them, he says.He says the UK does not want to legislate directly for them. But the government has listend to the views of MPs. It is the majority view in this HOuse that the overseas territories should have public registers of beneficial ownership.So the government will not vote against the Hodge amendment, he says.The People’s Vote campaign, which is campaigning for a referendum on the final Brexit deal, has issued this statement on our poll findings (see 12.21pm) from the Labour MP Paul Williams.Confidence in the government’s ability to deliver a good Brexit deal is collapsing, and understandably so: the Brexit that was promised to people is simply not deliverable.The talks are bogged down in quicksand over the complex issue of the Northern Ireland border, and the government’s pledge to deliver ‘the exact same benefits’ as we have now has been revealed as a fantasy.With the public’s confidence in a positive Brexit outcome fast disappearing, this just reinforces the need for a People’s Vote on the terms of the final Brexit deal.Labour has criticised Theresa May following the reports that she refused to relax visa rules to allow the NHS to recruit more doctors. Commenting on the Evening Standard splash (see 12.53pm), Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow health secretary, said:It makes no sense whatsoever that the government is turning away trained doctors who want to come and work here in the UK. Theresa May’s hostile environment policy is now directly damaging NHS patient care.The NHS is facing a massive workforce crisis. More than 100,000 NHS posts are now unfilled and vacancy rates for nurses and doctors are rising year on year, yet the government is refusing visas for trained staff from overseas because of the rules drawn up during Theresa May’s time as home secretary.The visa rules clearly aren’t working in the best interests of NHS patients. Ministers ought to be doing more to keep patients safe and their priority should be making sure hospitals can get the right numbers of staff in place.This is from the Labour MP Margaret Hodge.The government tabled amendments very late which were intended to stop the Hodge amendment on beneficial ownership being put to a vote.But at the start of the proceedings the speaker, John Bercow, said that because they were tabled so late, he would not select them for a ision. That means the Hodge vote is going ahead. This is from Labour Whips.Sir Alan Duncan, the Foreign Office minister, is opening the debate on behalf of the government.He says this afternoon’s report stage debate will cover three issues: sanctions for gross human rights abuses, including a Magnitsky amendment Scottish limited partnerships and beneficial ownership.On Magnitsky and Scottish limited partnerships, he says the government is responding to concerns.MPs will soon start debating the sanctions and anti-money laundering bill.As my colleague Dan Sabbagh reports, the government is at risk of being defeated when MPs vote on amendment tabled by the Labour MP Margaret Hodge saying overseas territories to introduce public ownership registers.Here is an extract from his story.The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, said the government needed to show it was “serious about clamping down on tax avoidance and taking on the vested interests of the super rich” by supporting the backbench amendment to the sanctions and anti-money laundering bill.Its proponents, Conservative MP Andrew Mitchell and Labour MP Margaret Hodge, argue that if the British Virgin Islands and Cayman Islands are forced to introduce public ownership registers it will stem the flow of “dirty money” around the world and into the UK.They say that “transparency is vital in the fight against money laundering and tax avoidance by crooks, kleptocrats and terrorist gangs” in a joint article for the Evening Standard. Campaign group Global Witness estimates that £68bn flowed out of Russia via the UK overseas territories between 2007 and 2016.David Cameron and George Osborne promised to introduce public ownership registers in the overseas territories in 2013 but the measure was dropped when May took over as prime minister. The amendment, which has the support of Ken Clarke, Nicky Morgan and Anna Soubry, as well as the SNP Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, and the Lib Dem leader, Vince Cable, asks the 14 territories to comply by the end of 2020.This is what the prime minister’s spokesman said at the lobby briefing when asked about the claims in the Evening Standard splash. (See 12.53pm.)It remains essential we have control of the immigration system and it works in the national interest, we are monitoring the situation in relation to visa application for doctors including the monthly limits through the Tier 2 visa route. Around a third of all tier 2 visas go to the NHS and investing in our workforce will continue to be a top priority.Asked if the PM had personally vetoed the attempts to relax the visa rules, the spokesman said: “As for formulation of government policy, that’s not something I’d discuss.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2fd1c3033c7e5edfdedfcbed8b7481ccb2987c9b/0_53_4199_2519/master/4199.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6ccabfdb22d5c7503df467405f2dcf74","title":"wealthy professionals most likely to drink alcohol regularly figures show","story":"British manual workers drink the least and middle-aged have most harmful habits, reports sayHigh earners in professional jobs, such as doctors, lawyers and teachers, are much more likely to be regular alcohol drinkers than those on average incomes, according to the latest official figures.Drinking rises steadily with socioeconomic status: people whose work is classified as routine and manual, including labourers, receptionists and care workers, were the least likely to have had alcohol in the week before they were asked.The reports come from NHS Digital (England only) and the Office for National Statistics. The ONS Opinions and Lifestyle Survey shows that in Great Britain in 2017, an estimated 29.2 million adults said they had drunk alcohol in the week before they were asked.How much people drink varies with age. A fifth of people said they did not drink at all. They were most likely to be between 25 and 64. Those most likely to drink were over 65.When the young drink, they are the most likely to binge on Friday and Saturday nights and then not drink for the rest of the week. Data from previous years in the Health Survey for England showed the most harmful drinking was among middle-aged people, who were more likely to drink every day.“Middle-class drinkers are unlikely to pay attention to government health warnings as they may be less likely to get excessively drunk, and can withstand increases in prices,” said Steve Clarke, an alcohol addiction therapy services manager with the Priory Group. The data was published on Tuesday, the day Scotland introduces minimum unit pricing after a long fight with the alcohol industry, which challenged its legality in the courts. The ONS findings support other evidence that price is a big factor in people’s drinking habits. Campaigners and experts hope minimum unit pricing will lead people, especially the most vulnerable, to forgo the strongest drinks because they will become more expensive. They are lobbying for England to follow Scotland’s example.“The Westminster government should now follow Scotland’s lead, and introduce MUP in England,” said Sir Ian Gilmore, chair of the Alcohol Health Alliance, a coalition of more than 50 expert organisations.“Cheap alcohol is wrecking lives and livelihoods in England as well as Scotland. There are more than 23,000 deaths a year in England linked to alcohol, and many of these come from the poorest and most vulnerable sections of society.“Minimum unit pricing will save lives, cut crime and benefit the public finances. At the same time, pub prices will be left untouched, and moderate drinkers will barely notice the difference under MUP.“Any delay in implementing MUP in England will only cost lives and lead to unnecessary alcohol-related harm. We urge the Westminster government to act now,” said Gilmore.Minimum unit pricing sets the lowest price at which a unit of alcohol can be sold, which in Scotland is now 50p. A pint of beer containing two units will now have to cost at least £1, and a bottle of wine containing nine units will have to cost at least £4.50. But the biggest impact will be on the very strong ciders and other strong alcoholic drinks that have been very cheap and are often bought by alcoholics."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/275279b40c6f99022aca0bd92ea870b017f5a84d/0_116_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=09994bfa2adc56e28421a0e83e78b267","title":"100 ball game golden days t20","story":"T20 was a radical and successful departure but the ECB’s further reduced format is complicated and not so freshThe times they are a-changing. It may now be possible to write a nostalgic piece about T20 cricket. Perhaps we should alert Radio 4’s Sue MacGregor to the notion of reliving the creation of T20 back at the start of the century on The Reunion.On the evening of Friday 13 June, 2003, the competition was launched around the counties. I was at Taunton along with more than five thousand others to watch Somerset play Warwickshire (cue soundtrack of Mary Hopkin in full flow remembering how we laughed away the hours and dreamed of all the great things we would do).When Somerset were batting, chasing 189 for victory, I went down to the Warwickshire dugout to chat to their coach, John Inverarity. He is the Australian who padded up to the last ball of the 1968 Oval Test match at about the same time as Mary Hopkin was adorning Top of the Pops. Inverarity was, and still is, one of the great thinkers about the game, the nearest equivalent to Mike Brearley among Australian cricketers, and I was intrigued to discover what he thought about this new format.Of course I never found out there and then. There was no time for such discussion. Inverarity is the most civilised of men, a former head teacher and stimulating company, but he had other things on his mind. There was a game of cricket to be won and that was what he was concentrating on. He winced he even swore when a catch went down or a misfield was committed and this most decorous of Aussies may even have punched the air when a wicket fell. This was not “hit and giggle” which was how David Lloyd always used to describe T20. It was a proper contest, albeit an unusually short one.This was when it became apparent to me that this brash new format might work. Even more important than the coaches desperately wanting to win was the fact the players did as well. They did not want to be ridiculed by all those packed into the stands and they understandably relished playing in front of a proper crowd. It was not the face painting or the DJs that made T20 work it was the cricket and the contest.On that evening in Taunton Warwickshire, shrewdly led by Nick Knight, won by 19 runs with Collins Obuya from Kenya taking three for 16, an early sign that wrist-spinners, against all expectation, might actually prosper in this format. Inverarity was delighted.Back in 2002 there had, of course, been much debate about the wisdom of this new-fangled competition. The counties voted – and on this occasion it was a “free” vote since I have no recall of a guaranteed £1.3m per annum for those ready to agree with the ECB – and the margin in favour of T20 was slim, 11-7 with Middlesex, Sussex, Yorkshire, Warwickshire, Somerset, Glamorgan and Northamptonshire voting against.No expense had been spared and very few details overlooked by the England and Wales Cricket Board in their efforts to sell this new idea. The press were taken off to Spain for a two-day seminar about several aspects of the game but the crunch for the ECB was selling T20. This was all superbly organised and minutely planned.There was even an opportunity to play golf at Valderrama, of which Lord MacLaurin, then chairman of the board, was a member. That beautiful course had never before witnessed so many ugly hacks (I refer solely to the golf shots attempted) in a single afternoon.All of which was quite a contrast to the announcement of the latest format of the game to be hatched by the ECB, which was delivered almost a fortnight ago via a surprise media release followed by a hastily arranged conference call.We knew what the plans were back in 2002. This time we know that the scoreboard is going to be simplified, apparently so that women and children can understand what is going on, but we have no idea how the tournament will be accommodated into the fixture list. What will happen to the unfortunates who are not required by the eight new teams? They could be playing 50-over cricket, T20 among the counties, Championship cricket in two isions or in a conference system. A working party under Wasim Khan has just been set up to ponder all this. All we know is that the new tournament must happen because the ECB has sold those rights to the broadcasters.In response to all the ridicule of the new format the ECB has reeled out some of its senior employees from Joe Root and Eoin Morgan downwards and there is the tacit suggestion that any opposition to the scheme stems from the sort of stick-in-the-mud attitude that was prevalent back in 2002, even though the majority of today’s players (but not the ones employed centrally) have their doubts. “What are they doing at the ECB? It’s actually embarrassing” was the unprovoked response of one senior county cricketer and he is not alone.The parallel with 2002 does not work, by the way. Whether you liked it or not, the idea of T20 cricket in 2002 was a genuinely radical change to the game, which was to have global consequences. By contrast the changes that have been outlined this April are mostly cosmetic, designed to keep the counties and the broadcasters happier: a reduction of 20 balls, a gimmicky 10-ball over: a new scoreboard.There is also the suggestion of getting rid of lbws, which would actually make a huge difference to the way players bat and which would become another blow to bowlers – but the lbw dismissal is apparently too complicated and all we want is more sixes. How about getting rid of the stumps as well?Call me an old traditionalist but I prefer the good old T20 that works so well all around the world, as we kept hearing from Morgan and co – until last week. I actually prefer just one of those tournaments in a domestic summer, as is also the case everywhere else. But I may have mentioned that before.• This is an extract taken from the Spin, the ’s weekly cricket email.

When it comes to Caster Semenya and the IAAF, here’s a seventh. Be wary of anyone who says it’s all straightforward. The Semenya case isn’t just about sport, or sex, or gender, but ethics, politics, culture, race, and science. Expert opinion is split. Which is why the arguments have been going back and forth for the best part of a decade, and the case now seems bound to return to the court of arbitration for sport, where they will try to find the black and the white in all the shades of grey.Semenya keeps her counsel, her only public comments her pointed tweets. There’s a wildfire burning around her. The IAAF has been accused of discrimination, of racism, of propagating heteronormative standards of femininity, of trying to dictate what is and isn’t normal. Their policy has been compared to those used in apartheid South Africa, and said, by a member of the IAAF’s own disciplinary tribunal, to be “based on the same kind of ideology that has led to some of the worst injustices and atrocities in the history of our planet.”The language is fierce. There are athletes and coaches who disagree, but few will speak publicly.Athletes with Differences of Sexual Development, like Semenya, have significantly higher testosterone levels than the women they’re competing against. According to the IAAF, the typical female range of circulating testosterone in serum is 0.12 to 1.79 nmolL, while the typical male range is 7.7 to 29.4nmolL. Females with DSD often have testosterone levels in the male range. And since the IAAF’s position is that testosterone is the key distinguishing factor between male and female performance, they believe athletes with DSD have an unfair advantage.“Unfair” is the key word. Because on the one side, there’s an argument that high testosterone is just another natural advantage, like a basketballer’s reach or a swimmer’s large feet. And on the other, that basketball doesn’t ide players by height, and swimming doesn’t seek to protect swimmers with smaller feet. But because it has male and female categories, athletics does split competition between those with high and low testosterone, to protect the female athletes.Here, then, testosterone has been conflated with sex, as if it were the only measure of difference between men and women. It’s not, of course, it’s just the one the IAAF has settled on, because other methods it could use, such as chromosome testing, are flawed. But so is this. Because while it might seem intuitively true that testosterone provides a performance advantage, the IAAF needs to prove it, too. And it has to show that the advantage is so great that it can justify a set of regulations many think are discriminatory. Which is where its case failed the last time it came before the Cas in 2015, and, it seems, where it will likely fail again if it comes back there now.In 2015, Cas suspended the old set of regulations while the IAAF went away to gather new evidence. Instead the IAAF produced new regulations. The new set only apply to distances between 400m and one mile, where, the IAAF says, testosterone advantage is most pronounced. This is the very same range of events Semenya runs. Which means that, even though none of the IAAF literature mentions Semenya, the rules seem, in the words of the South African minister of sport, Tokozile Xasa, like “Caster Semenya Regulations”.Before we begin to address the critiques of their motives, to wrangle with the complicated questions about the ethics of fairness, the IAAF has to prove the science supports its case this time. And, judging by what is publicly available, it can’t.Last year the IAAF released a key study, which found that female athletes with higher levels of testosterone had an advantage in five events, the 400m, 400m hurdles, 800m, hammer throw, and pole vault. And that study, which underpins these new regulations, now looks deeply flawed. Andrew Gelman, Higgins professor of statistics at Columbia University, described the analysis as “such a mess that I can’t really figure out what data they are working with, what exactly they are doing, or the connection between some of their analyses and their scientific goals.”Gelman is a rare voice in all this, one without any emotional investment, or even an in interest the sport. His only concern is the work. And he found it lacking. The IAAF says that this was only one paper, and that its case is bolstered by a body of confidential data. But still, after 15 years of study, its very best public evidence was debunked within weeks of its release. If after a decade of trying the IAAF still can’t prove it is right that DSD athletes shouldn’t be allowed to compete unless they lower their testosterone, then all these hard questions fade in to one easy, unavoidable, answer. The IAAF has got it wrong."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/80d43f1bd1b6dce4c00af5bcdef2d4cc2fa15d37/189_0_4854_2913/master/4854.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8e2ac0be3059f9bb5009f6a0216cfd52","title":"facing up to retirement ocallaghan habana croft brits","story":"The problems with ending a career are in focus as the game prepares to say goodbye to O’Callaghan, Habana, Croft and BritsEvery year around this time the list of players retiring from the game makes bittersweet reading. The names, whether famous or not, are a reminder that nothing lasts forever, that even the fiercest warriors have a finite shelf life. In the case of the Premiership, according to Damian Hopley of the Rugby Players’ Association, the average life- is seven to eight years. Those who last more than a decade can count themselves lucky.This year’s crop of retirees in Europe has stirred some particularly strong emotions and rightly so. Worcester’s Donncha O’Callaghan was one of the few left with experience of club rugby in the 20th century. Bryan Habana, Juan Martín Hernández, Juan Martín Fernández Lobbe, Jamie Heaslip, Schalk Brits, Tom Croft, John Muldoon … in their differing ways all of them were inspirational figures who will be hugely missed.All one can do is cling to the memories. In the mind’s eye a youthful Croft is sprinting unstoppably away at Twickenham to announce himself for Leicester in the 2007 Anglo‑Welsh final and showing world-class gas in an England jersey to carve up France in Paris in 2012. At his best he had everything: pace, athleticism, bravery and modesty. When the good guys also happen to be great players it is a special combination.The same can be said of Brits, who has single-handedly redefined what a hooker should be capable of. The South African won 10 Springbok caps but will be remembered primarily for the infectious joie de vivre he brought to the game. These things are not always measurable but would Saracens have been so successful for so long without such characters making the working lives of others so enjoyable?Into this feelgood category also comes the 39-year-old O’Callaghan, not least on the famous occasion when he enticed 12 ducks into the Munster team-room with a trail of cornflakes. Beneath the surface, though, lurked an athlete constantly seeking to make the best of himself. “Talk to anyone at Worcester and they’ll tell you about the positive influence he has had and the hole he will leave behind, as a person as much as a rugby player,” Hopley says.O’Callaghan, though, is one of the fortunate few, able to depart on his own terms, comforted by the heart-warming photo of his children in the jerseys he himself has worn down the years. Many do not enjoy that luxury, a subject Hopley found himself discussing with James Haskell last week. “We were talking about how few athletes there are who, to use James’s wonderful expression, get carried out of the ground on their shields when it’s all over,” Hopley says.“Psychologically, that sets you up very differently for retirement from the guy who goes out the back door with half his leg hanging off, battling for his medical costs and insurance. It has an impact on your self-esteem which is probably the hardest thing to come to terms with when you hang up your boots and hand back the car keys.”Those in the latter category such as Wasps’ Sam Jones, injured during a judo grappling session on England duty, also find themselves wrenched away from the people who understand them best. “When they asked Donncha at the weekend what he’d miss most he said the boys and the environment,” adds Hopley. “I think that’s the thing people struggle to understand. You belong and then suddenly you don’t belong. You know that day is coming but you want to keep it at arm’s length for as long as possible. We can’t all be Simon Shaw who played for 20 years.”Everything is strictly relative, of course. Whatever the trials and tribulations of the retiring player they are as nothing compared with the numbness still afflicting the family of Ian Williams, the 27-year-old Doncaster prop who collapsed in training in February and tragically could not be resuscitated. It is also true, however, that the pro game grows ever more intense and the worrying injury stats recently revealed for the 2016-17 season have caused significant disquiet among players, not least the reported higher injury rates associated with artificial pitches.Increasingly it is not so much the pitch itself as the transition – soft to hard, hard to soft – between different surfaces which is being blamed for certain injuries. “Talking to a number of England players they’re very anti artificial pitches, particularly around transition,” Hopley says. “You get a feeling we should probably be looking at one agreed surface for everyone to play on. All home teams aspire to a competitive advantage but maybe that should be about the crowd and the atmosphere, not the surface.”Excessive contact during training sessions is the other key area being monitored. “Going round the clubs, particularly in a post-Lions season, it is clear the game’s demands are increasing,” says Hopley. “We just want to educate the players on the fragility of their careers and their expected . We all recognise rugby is a very physical game but it’s a matter of how we can fine-tune it. I feel a bit like Alan Turing wrestling with the Enigma Code.” For the sake of future generations, let us pray someone cracks it soon.As we wait to see who Harlequins will choose as their next director of rugby it will be fascinating to see if the club’s board look overseas or opt for an up-and-coming English coach. As Exeter and Newcastle are proving, it is entirely possible for Premiership clubs to thrive with English coaches at the helm, rather than simply dialling the mobile number of the next New Zealand coach off the rank. Someone such as Ben Ryan, a gold medal-winning Olympic sevens coach with Fiji, could be an excellent choice if Quins want an intelligent, ambitious coach bursting with good ideas and an instinctive grasp of what needs to be done. No disrespect to the Crusaders’ enthusiastic Scott Robertson but if the Premiership simply becomes a finishing school for Super Rugby graduates where is the next generation of homegrown national coaches going to come from?Sale v Leicester. After 13 successive years of top-four qualification the Tigers have finished outside the play-off positions and, depending on results on the final weekend, could yet miss out on European qualification entirely. Sale, conversely, need to win to put themselves in contention for Champions Cup rugby next season. It has been a long winter but no one in Salford this Saturday will be coasting half-heartedly towards the finish line."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/67cbe5b961bd99029c1bd343bd04dfea3073aa44/383_677_4142_2485/master/4142.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=33694c28f8ff8205598f0f5e2fd522a9","title":"porn tackroom theatre why is the sky blue","story":"Drama created after Tackroom Theatre teamed up with Barnardo’s to conduct the largest piece of research ever done into the subjectThere’s no holding back in the rehearsal room, with talk of sex, incest porn and bondage. One musical number has a chorus about masturbating. It is funny, revealing and deeply troubling. The play, Why Is the Sky Blue? (Or How to Make Slime), is based on interviews with 10,000 people aged between six and 22, about the effects of pornography on their lives. Its title comes from the children’s search-engine questions, which included “Am I gay?” and “How big is my penis?”Tackroom Theatre worked with schools, theatres and the charity Barnardo’s to conduct the largest piece of research ever undertaken on the subject. As well as the play, which runs for three weeks at London’s Southwark Playhouse in London, there will be a website and educational material.“It’s been a really long-held ambition of mine to do this,” says the director, Abbey Wright. “We wanted to attempt to track the influence of porn from when people first see it, sometimes around six or seven, to when they’re first entering into adult relationships.” The main challenges of working with performers who are so young have been regarding what is age-appropriate. “It gets to three o’clock and you really ought to rehearse an explicit song but there’s a seven-year-old who hasn’t been picked up yet,” Wright says. The younger children wear noise-cancelling headphones during the more explicit content.In rehearsals, two actors are having a conversation about what sort of porn they watch one of them smiles and looks embarrassed. These aren’t scripted, and come from the actors’ own experiences. “We are put in quite a vulnerable position but I think the way we feel comfortable with it is we still have our own boundaries,” says one of the actors, 20-year-old Zachary Hing. “We know what we’re comfortable saying on that night. If there are circumstances or if one night someone is in the audience that we don’t want to share things with, we have that freedom to go: ‘I’m not going to reveal these things.’ When I’m talking about racism or transphobia, it doesn’t necessarily feel like I’m sharing something personal but it feels like I’m talking about a wider social issue.”Eleven years ago, Wright was working with young offenders. “I observed the extent to which pornography was shaping the way they thought about themselves and relationships,” she says. “I saw kids who were quite disturbed and confused by it and then I saw kids who completely accepted it, but in a way that I felt made them quite disconnected from themselves. I found it quite sad.” She wanted to create a project “which would have a genuine impact nationally. We started talking to children and asking about their experience, and realised children’s voices had to be the centre of the piece.”Wright also says there are the “ambiguous aspects” to porn. “I meet a lot of young queer people who talk about how queer porn isn’t necessarily a great representation of queer identity, but at least it’s something,” she says. When LGBT sexuality is rarely discussed sex education classes, porn becomes educational for many young people. “I’ve met young people who talk about that wonderful moment of liberation when they stop trying to force themselves to watch straight porn.”What is most shocking to Wright is “the lack of conversation and education on the subject”. She isn’t claiming to have come up a solution to the problem of pornography, but advocates much greater education as well as providing parents and teachers with the tools to have difficult conversations. One 14-year-old girl told her: “If you put a phone in a child’s hand, you are putting porn in their hand. Don’t put a phone in a child’s hand unless you are happy to talk to them about porn.”Wright hopes to tour a smaller version of the show and plans to do workshops with 25 theatres around the country. “There are always dangers in the world for children,” says Wright, “but somehow empowering them and giving them the tools to navigate those dangers in a very positive way seems like quite a hopeful thing.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3479492.1525112611!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"barnier tries to calm politics around unresolved border issue","story":"Speaking in Dundalk during a two-day visit to Ireland and Northern Ireland, EU chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier has urged rapid agreement by June on the scope of any British alignment with the single market.

Photograph: Charles McQuillanGetty ImagesThe European Union’s chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, came to the Border again and crossed it but first had to deny that the “backstop” option for the post-Brexit frontier was an EU land grab for Northern Ireland.The suggestion, in a question from a journalist with the pro-Brexit Daily , shows the extent to which the political noise in London around the negotiations on Britain’s departure is making Barnier’s job so difficult.“We have no intention of questioning the UK’s constitutional order,” Barnier told the All-Island Civic Forum on Brexit in Dundalk. “This is none of our business.”Almost two years since the UK voted to leave the EU and less than a year until its departure, nobody is any clearer about what Brexit means for the Border – and the temperature around Brexit is still too high to figure it out.Barnier, on his second visit to the Border since Brexit, said this was exactly why he had come to visit both sides of the Border: to find “technical and practical solutions to assure safety controls” that protect the EU’s single market and, he suggested, the UK’s internal market too.“We have to de-dramatise this point to avoid any kind of ideology,” he said.“There is absolutely no question of Ireland or the European Union being interested in a land grab,” stressed Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, sharing a stage with Barnier and Tánaiste Simon Coveney.The clock is ticking down to the next critical deadline in the Brexit negotiations, the European Council summit of EU leaders at the end of June, and the issue of how to maintain an invisible border remains unresolved.So far, the only solution on the negotiating table is the backstop, the default position that will effectively keep Northern Ireland in the customs union and parts of the single market.It is an option the UK has agreed to and conceded should be covered by a legal text in the Brexit treaty, but it does not want it and has so far failed to agree to the legal text or proposed an alternative acceptable to the EU.In an attempt to keep the pressure on the British to come up with other concrete proposals, Barnier, Varadkar and Coveney displayed a unified line of offence here near the Border. The three were “absolutely united,” the Taoiseach said, in seeking “meaningful progress” by the June summit.Barnier suggested June was a “stepping stone” to October’s deadline for a final Brexit treaty but warned that until there was agreement on an operational backstop, there was “a risk” of a disorderly Brexit.He inadvertently had a dig at Davis when he took a question from a Northern Irish journalist about Davis believing the backstop wasn’t necessary.“Who?” he asked, not quite catching the Northern accent. The backstop was there not to change the UK’s red lines (leaving the EU single market and customs union), he replied, but “because of the UK’s red lines”.The heaviest punches were thrown by Opposition politicians during the forum’s plenary session.Labour leader Brendan Howlin referred to the “civil war” that had erupted in the UK Tory party over Brexit. Independent Alliance Minister Shane Ross suggested that England’s difficulty should be Ireland’s opportunity.“If they insist on imposing this self-inflicted wound, it is probably something that we can take advantage of,” he said, pointing to the opportunities for financial services and tourism.While Barnier wants no drama, no visit to the Border area by anyone so connected with Brexit could avoid it.Hours before his visit, DUP leader Arlene Foster questioned Barnier’s honesty as a broker. He was “not ready to engage in polemics,” Barnier replied, calmly.For some hard Brexiteers, they do not seem ready to move beyond them.Negotiations move to phase II after agreement reached on protecting the rights of citizens in both UK \u0026amp EU, Northern Ireland and the financial settlement of the orce"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3480186.1525176711!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"harris to come under pressure over briefing note on phelan case","story":"Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has said that he is \u0027full of sorrow\u0027 and \u0027very angry on behalf of the 160 or so women who were not told of the results of the audit\u0027 when answering questions on the cervical cancer scandal in the Dáil.

It is understood that if Ms Phelan gives the go-ahead, the document would be published in a redacted form as it contains details of her medical condition.Labour health spokesman Alan Kelly said Mr Harris needed to clarify who wrote the briefing note for him and whether that person was aware of the broader context and the potential implications of the case at the time.Ms Phelan is the mother of two from Co Limerick who was given incorrect cancer test results in 2011 and is now terminally ill.

When asked to explain the term “typical Indian”, Lord Kilclooney wrote it was “typical of this particular half Indian”.He continued: “No Irish PM has previously ignored the normal courtesies of visiting the UK.The 80-year-old peer defended his use of the term Indian, saying Mr Varadkar was “racially a half Indian and proud of it” and that there was “nothing racist about it - simply factual”.He tweeted: “It is not racially abusive as he himself has confirmed he is half Indian. That is great and not to be dismissed as Indians are a great race. However he has damaged NorthSouth relations by being continually offensive and provocative to the Unionist majority in NIreland.”Alliance Party leader Naomi Long tweeted that Lord Kilclooney’s language was “a racial slur, insulting of not only the Taoiseach and the Irish people, but of Indian people too. There is no explaining this one away like last time.”Ms Long called for the House of Lords to address Lord Kilclooney’s behaviour on social media. “It is deliberate, calculated disrespect,” she wrote.Former UUP leader Mike Nesbitt also accused Lord Kilclooney of racist language, using the #NotInMyName in a tweet. Sinn Féin Senator Niall Ó Donnghaile tweeted that he was planning to ask the Seanad Cathaoirleach to contact the Speaker of the House of Lords “urging him to take appropriate action regarding yet another offensive tweet from a member of the House of Lords regarding An Taoiseach Leo Varadkar”.DUP member Christopher Stalford tweeted: “I don’t know what John Taylor thinks he’s playing at but he doesn’t speak for me. Absolutely ridiculous behaviour.”Alliance Party councillor Emmet McDonough Brown tweeted that “reducing someone to their race denies their humanity \u0026amp agency and lays prejudice bare.

If a complaint is raised, the House of Lords Commissioner for Standards would undertake an independent investigation of the alleged breaches, he said. The House of Lords code of conduct states that members must always act “on their personal honour”. It notes that “members cannot rely simply on their own personal sense of what is honourable.

And we need to assess whether it was a wrong decision and it may not turn out to be.”Ms McDonald said women “were kept in the dark because of a toxic culture of concealment and refusal to take responsibility in the HSE, a culture in which women are literally allowed to die before responsibility is taken”.Ms McDonald also said there were warning that the testing should not be outsourced and members of the quality assurance committee resigned after highlighting the dangers of outsourcing the screening but “their words fell on deaf ears”.They fell on the deaf ear of Mr O’Brien, formerly of CervicalCheck and now the head of the HSE.“He knew this information but he did nothing.”Mr O’Brien indicated in March he intended to step down from his position when his contract expired in August.The Taoiseach said “there are different views as to whether that was the right decision”, to outsource the testing.He said that half of smears were read in Ireland and half in the US. Three labs are used, two in the US and one in Ireland in the Coombe hospital.Mr Varadkar said legislation would be brought forward for mandatory disclosure in health issues.

Photograph: Patrick KovarikAFPGettyPresident Emmanuel Macron likes to convince people. In manner and method, he is unlike his predecessors. Nicolas Sarkozy cajoled and bullied. François Hollande just gave up. Macron fixes interlocutors with his intense blue stare and builds a Cartesian argument. If that doesn’t work, he starts over, patiently, but with determination.The past week has tested the young president’s powers of persuasion. Early in the hours of April 14th, Macron used his constitutional power as commander in chief for the first time, joining the US and Britain in launching cruise missiles against three chemical weapons installations in Syria. The goal, Macron said later, was to convince Bashar al Assad and Vladimir Putin that the international community was more than a “nice” and “weak” body they could push around.In a further exercise in persuasion, Macron volunteered for a combative, 2½ hour live television interview on Sunday night, during which he made the surprising claim that, “Ten days ago, President Trump said the US would pull out of Syria. We convinced him it was necessary to stay for the duration.”The White House later issued a statement saying Trump’s view had not changed, and the French president made an embarrassing climbdown on Monday, claiming he “never said” the US or France would remain militarily engaged in Syria for the long term.Perhaps Macron, whose nickname is “Jupiter”, is threatened by hubris, the sin of pride that afflicted Greek gods.The rest of the week was one long attempt to convince Europeans and the French of the rightness of his positions. Macron – who has become the de facto leader of Europe – received the heads of the three Baltic states who have teamed up with five other northern EU countries, including the Netherlands and Ireland, to thwart his efforts to further integrate the euro zone.Then, before a more sympathetic audience at the EU parliament in Strasbourg, Macron pleaded with proponents of liberal democracy to wake up and oppose the populist authoritarians who deny European values. Macron then travelled to Berlin in yet another effort to enlist German chancellor Angela Merkel’s support for his European reform agenda.On Monday, Macron will go to Washington for a three-day state visit, the first of Trump’s presidential term. Although the two men have clashed on climate change, the Iran nuclear accord, trade protectionism and the rise of Eurosceptical populism, Trump appears to have been charmed by the young president, who says Franco-American co-operation is crucial in the fight against terrorism.As the first anniversary of Macron’s election approaches on May 7th, and a half century after the May 1968 revolution, a different kind of spring is flowering in France. For the first time in decades, the country is reversing its post second World War decline, and the persuasive Macron is turning France into the world’s greatest soft power.There is, of course, discontent. It wouldn’t be France if there wasn’t. This week Macron also confronted striking railway workers in the Vosges, telling them to “stop taking people hostage.” The country is struggling through a rolling strike over the reform of the SNCF railway company.And despite Macron’s best efforts to reassure them, many in France suspect their young president is out to destroy the familiar but dysfunctional “French social model”. In their eyes, Macron is pushing France into the chasm of savage, race-to-the bottom capitalism.So what do they make of him in his home town? The  travelled there to find out.Macron was born in Amiens, the capital of Picardy, 40 years ago and lived here until just before his 17th birthday. From age 11 to 16, he studied at the Jesuit school La Providence.Built in the graceless concrete style of the 1950s, “La Pro” is an elementary, secondary and technical school for 2,000 pupils, spread over several acres. Aside from occasional crucifixes, calendars of Pope Francis and portraits of St Ignatius of Loyola, the religious footprint is light. The teachers are lay people. The priest visits only once a week now.Not a single plaque or photograph records that the president and first lady of France passed through these corridors. Yet this is where Macron asked to be baptised at the age of 12, and where, at 15, he fell in love with his future wife, a French and drama teacher called Brigitte Trogneux Auzière.Macron has always been drawn to older people. His maternal grandmother, Germaine “Manette” Nogues, died in his arms five years ago, at the age of 97. The Protestant humanist philosopher Paul Ricoeur was a spiritual father to him the progressive socialist millionaire Henry Hermand his political mentor. “He’s attracted by knowledge, by people who have experience,” his neurologist father, Jean-Michel (67), says over lunch in Amiens.At La Pro and subsequently at Henri IV, France’s leading lycée and prep school in Paris, Macron often stayed after class to talk to teachers.Marc Defernand (78) taught Macron history and geography here, and was principal of Macron’s section. “He was more mature than other students,” says Defernand. “He always asked a lot of questions. Sometimes he would pick up a conversation we’d started eight days earlier, exactly where we’d left off.”In the autumn of 2016, Defernand queued in a local bookshop to ask Macron to sign his autobiographical manifesto, Révolution. The retired educator is moved, recalling what happened. “He grabbed me by the hand and said, ‘Monsieur Defernand! It’s so good to see you!’” Macron inscribed the book: “To Marc, this ‘Revolution’, which owes more to him than he knows. In friendship, Emmanuel.”We visit the 700-seat theatre where Emmanuel Macron and Brigitte Trogneux Auzière adapted a play by Eduardo De Filippo together.“He was dynamite,” Defernand says. “I told him that if he continued, he would be the Gérard Philippe of the 21st century. It was difficult for others to act in the same play with him. In the same way, it’s difficult for his cabinet ministers now.”Defernand wasn’t aware of the relationship at the time, though he knew Macron went often to Auzière’s house. “I assumed there was a flirt between him and her daughter Laurence,” he says.The scandal of a married teacher with three children having an affair with a student nearly 25 years her junior has been transformed into romantic legend. Everyone would rather forget the trauma.“Jesuits never pried into people’s private lives. There was no morality investigation,” Defernand says. “There were unmarried teachers living together at the time. I was more worried about students taking drugs.”The fact that Brigitte continued to teach at La Pro for years after her lover’s departure, and then transferred to Lycée St Louis de Gonzague when they began to live together later in Paris, is further evidence of tolerance, Defernand says.A tragic love story, known to most French people, occurred a quarter-century earlier and helped pave the way for Macron and Auzière.Schoolteacher Gabrielle Russier (32) had an affair with a lycée student half her age, Christian Rossi, in Marseille. The youth’s parents filed a complaint against the teacher and had their son placed in a mental hospital. Russier was given a suspended prison sentence and took her own life. The story became the subject of books, films and songs. Asked about it at a press conference, former president Georges Pompidou famously quoted a poem by Paul Eluard that was sympathetic to women accused of having slept with German soldiers during the war.The historian Jean-François Sirinelli\u0026nbspcompares the Russier and Macron stories in his book Les Révolutions françaises, to show how much France evolved in a single generation. “Gabrielle Russier takes her own life in 1969. Emmanuel Macron and his teacher start an affair in the 1990s, and in May 2017, Brigitte Macron becomes first lady of France.”Macron’s parents learned of the affair by chance. “My wife was much more upset than I was,” Prof Macron says. “It may sound macho, but I thought he’d get over it. He didn’t . . . I thought it was a little early. It wasn’t the way I envisioned life, but it wasn’t my life. I raised my children to be free and independent.”The Macrons didn’t consider filing charges against Brigitte Auzière, but they asked to meet her. “I was requisitioned to impose authority,” Prof Macron laughs. “I told her, ‘He’s a minor. I want him to complete his studies. After that, he’s free to do what he wants.’”The president’s parents have been hurt by press reports that they sent their son to Paris to get him away from Auzière. “He was going to go to Henri IV anyway. It was planned,” Prof Macron says, nonetheless admitting that perhaps Emmanuel “went a little early”.At La Pro, I ask a class of 14-15 year-olds, Macron’s age when he met Brigitte, if they could fall in love with a teacher. The teenagers laugh and say yes. “If it happened to someone our age, it would shock me,” says a student called Grégoire. “But now that he’s an adult, it doesn’t bother me.”The students say it’s “cool” that Macron is president. “He was elected because there was Marine Le Pen,” pipes in Ayoub, of north African origin. Perhaps parroting their parents’ opinions, the youths object to rising taxes and praise the appointment of cabinet ministers who are not professional politicians. For the future, they predict flying cars and tell me France will never know full employment.On a scale of one to 10, they give the young president an approval rating of seven. “He has to prove himself,” one explains. Like France, Macron’s successors at La Pro are waiting to see.The Amienois may seem blasé about their president, but his father attributes this attitude to the “taciturn, reserved” character of Picard people. The region particularly suffered in both world wars, has a miserable climate and has been decimated by de-industralisation.His son is an atypical Picard, “an extrovert” infused with the sun of the southwest on the side of his mother, Françoise Nogues-Macron.History and bloodlines led me to Macron père, to find out more about the family’s English ancestry. In February, Macron spent an evening with the Presidential Press Association. As the representative for foreign journalists, I was part of the welcoming party. I gave him a sepia postcard of English soldiers in Amiens in 1918. \u0026nbspMacron studied the photograph closely. “You know, they found me an English great grandfather,” he said with a laugh, staring at the postcard. “He was called George Robertson.” The president scrutinised the English faces for a long moment. He was looking for a face that resembled his own.Towards the end of last year’s presidential campaign, Brigitte Macron mentioned to British journalists that her husband had a great grandfather called “Mr Robertson from Bristol”. The London Times, Mirror and Daily Mail researched the story and told the Macrons more than they had ever known about “Mr Robertson”.George William Robertson was born in Bristol in December 1887, and is believed to have fought in the Battle of the Somme. Distant relatives in England have preserved his war medals.Robertson married Macron’s great grandmother, Suzanne Leblond, in the town of Abbeville, 40km from Amiens, in 1919. They had three daughters. The middle daughter, Jacqueline, born in 1922, was Emmanuel Macron’s paternal grandmother.“He disappeared from one day to the next,” Prof Macron told me. “No one in the family ever heard from him. Suzanne raised three daughters alone. She kept a very modest grocery shop in Abbeville. My parents sent me to live with her and my aunts for two years as a child.”The failed marriage to an Englishman “was never, never talked about. The family kept no trace of him. I never saw a picture,” Prof Macron continues. George Robertson married again, settled in east London and kept a grocery shop, like his ex-wife, Suzanne. A step-daughter told the Mirror that he liked to sing Roses of Picardy, which he had learned in the trenches.Had a butcher from Bristol not fought in the Somme, married a Frenchwoman and fathered her children, Emmanuel Macron would not exist, would not be president of France today.Macron’s intellectual precociousness and his relationship with Brigitte meant he “skipped his adolescence”, his father says. In the autumn of 1993, three months short of his 17th birthday, the future president moved to a garret near the Lycée Henri IV in Paris. \u0026nbspHe continued his relationship with Brigitte. “When I went to see him in his chambre de bonne, sometimes he called through the door for me to come back later,” Prof Macron laughs. “I knew she was there with him.”Christian Monjou taught Macron American and British civilisation for three years at Henri IV. Though he did not know about the romance, Monjou noticed that Macron raced off to Amiens the moment classes ended on Saturday. “It was a case of\u0026nbsp ‘the ided self’,” Monjou says in an interview in his book-lined study.Macron obtained his baccalauréat with honours, but twice failed the entrance exam for the École Normale Supérieure, which trains French academics. It was the only failure of his life. Had it not been for the distraction of romance with Brigitte, Monjou says, Macron would have succeeded in the exam and become an academic.Against all odds, Brigitte Macron eventually orced and moved to Paris to live with Emmanuel. They married in 2007. “Without her, I would not be me,” Macron said during the campaign.Macron went on to earn a doctorate in philosophy, then reoriented his life towards politics with degrees from Sciences Po and the École Nationale d’Administration (ENA). “He used failure as a launching pad,” says Monjou. “That is typical of a leader.”“Have you brought your helmet and bulletproof vest?” the taxi driver who takes me to the Whirlpool clothes dryer factory in north Amiens asks. It’s a joke, of course, but the “Whirlpools” are notoriously hostile. A year ago, Marine Le Pen promised their factory would not close if she became president. Macron ignored advice and plunged into the crowd of angry strikers, saying, “If you listen to the security guys, you’re dead.”The factory will move to Poland at the end of May. Most of the 290 workers have been promised retraining or jobs building “intelligent” refrigerators by the factory’s new owner. But they’re still angry. On the day I visit, management proposed a clothes dryer in lieu of a severance bonus.“Macron, Macron. He’s not a god. We’re losing jobs. We don’t give a damn about Macron,” François Gorlia, the in-house union leader, tells me on the phone when he refuses to come to the gate to talk to me.“He’s a right-wing guy. Everything for the rich. Nothing for the poor,” Sibylle (39), an assembly line worker says as she arrives for the 1pm shift. She’ll benefit from Macron’s investment in training for the jobless, but she isn’t convinced. “Training is fine and dandy, but there are no jobs.”After lunch in a simple bistro, Macron’s father Jean-Michel guides me through a maze of streets under construction, to the music conservatory where his son studied piano for nine years. When he failed the conservatory exam after his first year, Macron’s mother told his biographer Anne Fulda, the boy insisted on having the same examiner the second year, an early sign of his determination to convince. He played well, Prof Macron recalls, mastering Bach’s devilishly difficult Goldberg Variations.Prof Macron gives me the address of the modest, two-storey brick bungalow where Emmanuel and his two siblings grew up, and where the neurologist still lives with his second wife. “It’s not Neuilly,” Macron père says laughing, referring to the Beverly Hills-like Paris suburb where Nicolas Sarkozy came from. Though they are both doctors, Macron’s parents earned low, public sector salaries. “They weren’t neurosurgeons with private jets,” comments a presidential adviser.The Trogneux chocolate shop, near the cathedral in central Amiens, is where Brigitte Macron’s family have made chocolates and macaroons for five generations. They also own the local Renault dealership.Black-and-white photographs of successive generations of the Trogneux chocolate dynasty hang inside the shop. There is no photograph or mention of Brigitte Trogneux Auzière Macron. Jean-Alexandre Trogneux (57), the first lady’s nephew and godson, agrees to be photographed, but refuses to talk about the presidential couple. “We’ve made it a golden rule,” he says. “We don’t talk about them and they don’t talk about us.”Fabien Dorémus (32) heads the political book section of a shop in central Amiens. Macron’s Révolution sold more than 400 copies there, an “enormous” number, Dorémus says. He had no desire to read it, and dismisses the book – and Macron – as “all slogans and clichés”. A former journalist whose local online newspaper failed for lack of funding, Dorémus is close to the far left party France Unbowed.\u0026nbspSince Macron’s election, Dorémus says, “I’m not optimistic for workers, pensioners and people who need public services. I am very optimistic for the rich.”The bookseller mentions various left-wing grievances against Macron, arising from a handful of disparaging remarks since 2014: Macron referred to slaughterhouse workers who were losing their jobs as “illiterate” Macron told a heckler wearing an anti-Macron T-shirt, “The best way to buy a suit is to get a job” Macron called protesters against his labour reforms “slackers” and accused strikers of wanting to foutre le bordel, or wreak havoc.It’s hardly “let them eat cake”. But the president has been hanged and burned in effigy by protesters. “You have to put yourself in the place of the people who get told they are slackers and freeloaders,” Dorémus says. “He’s contemptuous of the lower classes. People started hating him because they feel disrespected.”Another criticism, made by Macron’s former teachers, is that his speeches are often so long and intellectual that they can be difficult to follow.And attempts to control the president’s image can be counterproductive. The novelist Emmanuel Carrère was given exclusive access to the president and first lady. In two interviews with Macron, there was “one really strong, beautiful sentence”, Carrère wrote in the . “And this really strong, really beautiful sentence was off the record. In its place I was given permission to use a perfectly dull, perfectly formatted variant.”In the course of a day in President Macron’s home town, there is not a single photograph of him to be seen.Brigitte Fouré, the city’s mayor, tells me the poverty rate is two percentage points higher than the national average, and 80 per cent of inhabitants qualify for social housing. Amiens is ided between disadvantaged north and middle-class south. It was ruled by a communist mayor for 18 years in the 1970s and 1980s.Macron spent less than 17 years in Amiens, Fouré notes. He “went up” to Paris nearly a quarter of a century ago. “People here don’t know him. A lot of people are proud that the president is from Amiens, but that’s it. There has never been a real relationship between him and the city. There is no emotional tie.”On a beautiful spring day, the Élysée Palace feels light years away from dreary Picardy. The top-floor office of a close presidential adviser has a view over the gardens and the Eiffel Tower in the distance.Macron’s entourage is comprised mostly of fervently devoted young men with backgrounds similar to his own. No one at the Élysée, other than the president, can be quoted by name. “Our rule is that no one gets inidual credit for anything,” the adviser explains.The adviser reportedly thought up the slogan used by Macron when Trump pulled out of the Paris accord on climate change, “Make our planet great again!” But he refuses to confirm this. “We work collectively. Everything we do belongs to the president.”The adviser counts a resurgence of French pride as Macron’s greatest achievement so far. “It’s been a long time since the French have been proud to be French, in the eyes of the world,” he says. Though it contradicts my experience in Amiens, the statement rings true. Most people in the professional milieus of Paris adore Macron and are proud of his presidency.A few doors from the president’s office, the adviser lists Macron’s “important victories”: the revision of the labour code and the taxation of capital investments the overhaul of the country’s education system changes to the EU’s posted workers directive ending the giant squat at Notre-Dames-des-Landes and dismantling the nuclear reactor at Fessenheim. The last two issues had festered for decades. “They seemed impossible for any preceding majority,” the adviser says.Macron is doing as much for the disadvantaged as for the rich, the adviser insists. “We have increased basic payments to the poor, the disabled and the elderly. We’re decreasing social charges on lower salaries. The pendulum has swung much more towards the least advantaged than the most privileged.”So why isn’t that message getting through? Why do polls indicate that a majority consider Macron the “president of the rich”?For one reason, the adviser says. “He was an investment banker. What’s more, at Rothschild the most symbolic bank in the world. For many people, that proves his competence. The thing that makes him hated by some is the reason why he is respected by others.”Because Macron worked for four years as an investment banker, “everything he does that is perceived as right-wing or for the rich is blown out of proportion”, the adviser says.“And everything he does for the underprivileged, that would be seen as left-wing, is discounted. It’s a problem of perception.”Opinion polls can be read two ways. An Ifop-Fiducial poll published on April 10th gave Macron a 55 per cent approval rating, high for France, 11 months into a presidency. But a BFM poll published four days later showed that 44 per cent of voters are “disappointed”.Nine years of piano and the rigour of France’s best schools have honed Macron’s powers of concentration. On April 17th, he took questions from MEPs in Strasbourg for three hours, without notes, without so much as jotting down a question – a regular performance for Macron.“He is someone with a great capacity of attention and concentration,” says Monjou. “People who’ve met him often tell me they were struck by the intensity with which he looks at them, as if, for the time they are with him, they are all that matters.”“When you talk to him, it is as if he is downloading your brain,” says a former cabinet minister who sometimes advises Macron.Geraldine Byrne-Nason, now Ireland’s Ambassador to the United Nations, is doubtless the Irish official who knows Macron best. She became friends with the future president when both were “sherpas”, responsible for briefing and accompanying Irish and French leaders to EU summits, between 2012 until 2014. Byrne-Nason represented the taoiseach’s office, Macron the Élysée Palace.“We spent hours and hours in corridors through the night while the heads of state and government were locked in meetings,” Byrne-Nason recalls. “Emmanuel would be one of my first points of repair. If you’re going to be there for seven hours, you want someone interesting to talk to.”Byrne-Nason calls Macron “an insider-outsider” who has mastered the system but is able to regard it with detachment. “He has a healthy disrespect for bureaucracy, and Brussels is the home of process and procedure,” she says. “In that regard, we were kindred spirits. There was a slight impatience with the weight of slow-turning wheels.”Macron was particularly understanding of Irish difficulties during the bailout, Byrne-Nason says. She believes he was responsible for support offered by then president François Hollande.Byrne-Nason sent glowing reports about Macron’s potential to Dublin, long before he became a presidential candidate. Last September, she listened to what she calls his “extraordinary speech in favour of international co-operation and law” at the UN General Assembly. “It was poetic. It was powerful. It lit up the place.” Ireland could have signed off on every word, Byrne-Nason says, calling Macron “a superstar president who generates both respect and influence here amongst the 193 countries of the UN”.If Macron were Irish, he might be a hybrid of President Michael D Higgins and Taoiseach Leo Varadkar: part poetic intellectual, rooted in left-wing Christianity and fascinated by ideas part dynamic young liberal, determined to make the economy flourish.When Christian Monjou was Macron’s teacher at Henri IV, he says Macron talked a lot about the Fabians, the centre-left British intellectuals who founded the London School of Economics. The Fabians believed in “the inevitability of gradualness, the idea that everything that is gradual you won’t be able to go back on,” Monjou says. “It is totally anti-French, with our tradition of revolution, not evolution.“French political life is saturated in ideology,” Monjou continues. “With Macron, there is something you might call empirical or pragmatic. It’s familiar to an Anglo-Saxon, but it stands out in France. I suspect this slightly Anglo-Saxon approach may come from listening to me for three years.”Macron’s adviser stresses he is more than a mere pragmatist who would be content to solve one problem after another. “The two legs of Emmanuel Macron are action and reflection,” he says. “He always does both.”Macron’s en même temps mantra seeks to reconcile irreconcilabables, such as liberalism and social protection. The challenge is most obvious in his self-described “humane but realistic” immigration policy. Measures such as the Collomb circular, which authorises police to search emergency shelters for illegal migrants, have alienated some of Macron’s closest allies.In 1997, Macron’s spiritual father Paul Ricoeur delivered a lecture titled Foreigner Myself. Ricoeur cited Leviticus, about “the stranger that dwelleth with you”, and the Gospel of Matthew, which says: “I was a stranger and you took me in.” Opponents of Macron’s tough immigration policy say he has betrayed Ricoeur’s ideals. The criticism must sting, but Macron believes that unless he calms fears of unlimited migration, extreme right-wing populists will continue to gain ground, in France and across Europe.The necessity of ending the “society of status” in which family background, education and profession determine all aspects of one’s life, “gives coherence to everything we are doing”, says the presidential adviser.Philippe Aghion, who teaches economics at Harvard, the London School of Economics and the Collège de France, has greatly influenced the president’s economic thinking.Contrary to Thomas Piketty, the French author of the best-selling Capital in the 21st Century, Aghion and Macron believe that increasing social mobility, not high taxation, is the most effective way of reducing income inequality.Aghion wants to wean France off its post-second World War reliance on the Keynesian welfare state, in which government spending stimulates demand. He is inspired by John Maynard Keynes’s exact contemporary, the Austrian-born economist and Harvard professor Joseph Schumpeter, who believed that innovation and technical progress are the basis of a prosperous economy.Aghion’s theories underlie Macron’s reform of the French labour code last year, and the ongoing reform of professional training. It is, Aghion admitted in an interview, a liberal economic policy. But, he insists, it is also a social policy.Schumpeter believed in creative destruction, “which means you constantly have new jobs replacing old jobs, new firms replacing old firms”, Aghion says. It’s a hard sell to a French public that craves security and is adverse to change.Aghion advocates Danish-style “flexicurity” that combines labour market flexibility with unemployment benefits and retraining for laid-off workers. “In a nutshell: innovation, social protection and social mobility. That’s the triangle you want to achieve,” he says. Listening to him is like hearing Macron speak.Macron’s parents were left-leaning agnostics who did not baptise their children. At the age of 12, probably under the influence of his surroundings at La Pro, Macron asked to make his First Communion. A black-and-white photograph provided by one of his teachers, Gérard Banc, shows the future president making his profession of faith.Macron’s intellectual affiliation has been with the Christian left, with Ricoeur and Esprit magazine, for which he wrote a half-dozen articles, and whose board he sat on. French media interpreted gestures at Macron’s campaign rallies as signs of mysticism, for example when he asked his followers to “show benevolence”, or ended rallies Christ-like, with outstretched arms. On the night of his election, he concluded his speech in front of IM Pei’s glass pyramid at the Louvre with the words, “I will serve you with love”.During his evening with the Presidential Press Association, I asked Macron if, 28 years after his baptism, he still has faith. Personal belief is a taboo subject in secular France. Embarrassed laughter rippled across the room, but he addressed my question.“I believe in something we don’t see, yes,” Macron said. “I have faith in the generic sense of the term. If one doesn’t believe in one’s lucky star, in good fortune, in one’s country, one doesn’t do what I’m doing. I believe in a form of transcendency.”Following Macron’s April 9th speech to French bishops, leftists and Freemasons accused him of attacking la laicité, which has been France’s official policy of state-enforced secularism since 1905.“We share the confused feeling that the link between church and state has been damaged, and that it is as important to you as it is to me to repair it,” Macron said.\u0026nbsp The purpose of laicité was “certainly not to deny spirituality” he argued. \u0026nbsp“For biographical, personal and intellectual reasons, I have the highest opinion of Catholics.”There is something Jesuitical, indeed monklike, about Macron. Unlike his predecessors, he shows no need to eat, sleep or chase women. Asked what has been the “greatest trial” of being in office, the French president said he has “measured the weight and the solitude and the end of innocence” that come with power.“I do not think it is a trial,” Macron continued. “The French have authorised me to do what I committed to do. One thing is certain. There is no respite, which may explain why I sometimes look pale. I do not feel authorised to enjoy any form of leisure. I take time to reflect. I read and write. But in the times we live in, there is no room for respite. That may be the trial of power, though I don’t live it as such. There is undeniably a form of asceticism.”Macron sees his rise to power as the result of a troubled epoch. “I don’t forget where I come from and why I am here today,” he said. “I am the fruit of a form of brutality in history, of a break-in, because France was unhappy and uneasy. If I forget that for one moment, it will be the beginning of the trial.”"},{"url":null,"title":"us uk and france launch strikes on syria","story":"  April 14, 2018US ambassador to UN says US \u0026lsquolocked and loaded\u0026rsquo if Syrians further use chemical weapons   April 16, 2018Luxembourg meeting condemns \u0026lsquorepeated use\u0026rsquo of chemical weapons by Syrian regime "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3479500.1525112908!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"with no sense of direction theresa may is the plaything of events","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBritish prime minister Theresa May arrives for a visit to Brooklands Primary School in Sale, near Manchester, on Monday as part of the Conservative Party’s local election campaign. Photograph: Oli ScarffPA WireFive years after her arrival in parliament, Amber Rudd was given the UK energy department to run. Her credentials for such a strategic role in a $2.9 trillion economy were her sound intellect and common sense. An unquantifiable hunch that she was doing well spurred her promotion to the Home Office a year later, where she had to master another wad of detail from scratch. On Sunday, she resigned over the mistreatment of the Windrush migrants, or rather a false statement about the policy behind it.The light-speed rise and fall, the intellectual generalism tested to destruction, the almost holy significance put on matters of communication: Rudd’s was the echt career in British politics. It could only be more typical of our public life if she returns to cabinet before long with another portfolio to wing her way through. Her replacement, Sajid Javid, who is running his fourth department in as many years, should be on his fifth by then.The British state is set up for low-key shambles. What permanence there is resides in a civil service that has interests, if not beliefs, of its own. Indeed, Conservatives wonder about the source of the leak that did for Rudd.A good prime minister can withstand these administrative fumbles and 10-a-penny resignations by espousing a central mission. Margaret Thatcher weathered crises as serious as the Westland affair because her quest for economic reform put them in perspective as transient news stories. Theresa May has no quest beyond Brexit and her own survival. There is little in the way of a domestic policy programme. Parliament is scrutinising such momentous legislation as the Civil Liability Bill, with its new measures against vexatious motor insurance claims. In the air is the kind of listlessness that attends the ninth year of a premiership. It is the second year of May’s.Having promised to stand for more than Brexit, the prime minister has managed to stand for less (given her constructive ambiguity on even that question). Her circumstances provide her with good excuses. Without a majority in either house of parliament, she cannot venture any contentious bills. Without the political capital to fire senior ministers, she cannot impose herself on government. While talks with the EU proceed, she cannot devote herself to anything else. Nor does her legislative inhibition have to be a problem for the nation. There are worse things than an inactive government, such as an active government. Savour this break from do-somethingism, the most righteous religion of our time, while it lasts.The problem is for May herself. With no sense of direction, she is the plaything of events. Each resignation – there have been five in six months – matters more than it should. Losses in the local elections this week would be no trouble to brush off for a prime minister with projects of their own to pursue. In May’s case, losses will renew gossip about her position.The Windrush scandal is traceable to decisions taken before Rudd’s time. Critics say that May’s own tenure at the Home Office is returning to dog her. They cannot know how right they are.The Home Office is a (necessarily) negative department. Its job is to stop bad things from happening, of which crime, terror and illegal immigration are the most serious. In her six years in that confoundingly avant garde building, May never had to create, only enforce. It is life-and-death work but inadequate preparation for Downing Street, to which parliament and the executive look for drive.There have been prime ministers of her reticent type before but they tend to be paired with a more dynamic chancellor of the exchequer. May has Philip Hammond, who compounds her own caution. The result is a government that avoids outright crisis in favour of ennui and drift. A very small mercy, that. May’s admirers still talk about her debut speech as prime minister as though Cicero is up there kicking himself for having been beaten to it. Even at the time, though, it was colour-by-numbers flannel about “burning injustice”, influenced by advisers who are no longer with her. She was never a seer. She was a conscientious, civic-minded politician who needs instructions to be getting on with.That was what Britain required in the summer of 2016, when zanier Tories were vying for power after the Brexit vote. But there are diminishing returns to mere diligence. Rudd’s departure would be a non-event for a busier prime minister. It matters to this one, but then so does every glancing blow. Britain can live without a governing vision. Whether May can is less clear. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2018"},{"url":null,"title":"telegraph launches next phase words chosen brand campaign","story":"The  has launched the second phase of the Words Chosen Well brand campaign which aims to showcase its award-winning quality journalism and raise brand awareness.The campaign started with a new television advert debuted during the commercial break of Channel 4’s Gogglebox on Friday 20th April. Created by adam\u0026ampeveDDB  in collaboration with The ’s in-house marketing and creative teams, it builds on the success of last year’s campaign with a bigger and bolder creative that utilises important cultural references and leans on some of the most emotive and impactful events of our times, highlighting iconic moments when words have been considered and chosen well.The ’s new campaign seeks to demonstrate the influence and importance of the spoken and written word, and the role that quality journalism plays in providing news, insight and analysis.

The plant, known for its sweet scent and delicate clusters of pink flowers, is thought to be the first East Asian rose to reach Europe some time in the 18th century.The scientists, led by Mohammed Bendahmane, from the University of Lyon in France, made comparisons with the genomes of other plants including strawberry, apricot and peach, to explore rose ancestry and evolution.They uncovered more than 36,000 protein-coding genes, and a biochemical pathway that co-ordinated the regulation of scent and colour.A number of candidate genes for flowering were identified which could in future be targeted to produce genetically improved rose cultivars.“If you go to the market and look at the cut roses, they won’t smell like anything. They smell like plastic,” Dr Bendahmane told The Times.A rose on display at the 2016 Hampton Court Flower show“I hope we will be able to change how these flowers look in the future and make them last longer with more of a scent, which is lost the longer roses stay in a vase.“They could also be made more brightly-coloured.”The research, published in the journal Nature Genetics, is expected to help researchers and breeders to manipulate rose flowering and colour, strengthen scent, or increase vase life.Writing in the journal, the scientists said: Reconstructing regulatory and secondary metabolism pathways allowed us to propose a model of interconnected regulation of scent and flower colour.This genome provides a foundation for understanding the mechanisms governing rose traits and should accelerate improvement in roses.A team from the University of Lyon identified the enzyme that helps produce roses\u0027 intoxicating aroma three years ago.They said the key lay in encouraging the roses to produce greater levels of an organic compound called geraniol, which is produced in petals.Arthur Bouquet, an American horticulturalist, claimed that just 50 per cent of today\u0027s roses have a noticeable scent, compared with 75 per cent in the 19th century.Fortnite: Battle Royale season 4 skins and Battle Passes - all you need to know about the latest game update96-year-old Tory council candidate could become oldest councillor in the UK Britain\u0026#39s most senior Catholic at odds with the Pope over Alfie Evans treatmentNUS in row after women\u0026#39s toilets abolished at trans conferenceLocal elections 2018 polls: Latest predictions on what will happen and key seats to watchBritish ambassador to Israel filmed by Islamic terrorist group during secret visit to Gaza borderHow bad could the local elections be for the Conservatives in London?LIVE: Jamie Oliver discusses child obesity at select committee Four children murdered amid feud between their brother and arsonist who torched house, court hearsSpanking barrister takes firm to court after being sacked over BDSM session with colleague in a partner\u0026#39s office High earners most likely to hit the boozeWant to learn a foreign language fluently?

Rational action, spared of emotion, can be an expression of love and I’m sure Alfie received this kind of care.It’s very hard to act in a child’s best interest when this isn’t always as the parents would wish – and this is why a court must decide what’s best, not for the parents, but for the child.Last month Pope Francis said he hoped Katie and Tom Evans\u0027 desire to seek new forms of treatment may be granted. Via his Twitter account, he also said: It is my sincere hope that everything necessary may be done in order to continue compassionately accompanying little Alfie Evans, and that the deep suffering of his parents may be heard.In a joint statement released on April 18, the Catholic Bishops of England and Wales praised the “professionalism and care for severely ill children” at the Liverpool hospital, and added: We know that recently reported public criticism of their work is unfounded as our chaplaincy care for the staff, and indeed offered to the family, has been consistently provided.Fortnite: Battle Royale season 4 skins and Battle Passes - all you need to know about the latest game update96-year-old Tory council candidate could become oldest councillor in the UK NUS in row after women\u0026#39s toilets abolished at trans conferenceLocal elections 2018 polls: Latest predictions on what will happen and key seats to watchBritish ambassador to Israel filmed by Islamic terrorist group during secret visit to Gaza borderHow bad could the local elections be for the Conservatives in London?LIVE: Jamie Oliver discusses child obesity at select committee Four children murdered amid feud between their brother and arsonist who torched house, court hearsSpanking barrister takes firm to court after being sacked over BDSM session with colleague in a partner\u0026#39s office High earners most likely to hit the boozeWant to learn a foreign language fluently?

Many administrative functions will be duplicated meaning some jobs are highly likely to go.Sainsbury’s says Asda merger a win for all. Can customers believe it?Conservative MP Mark Menzies, who worked at Asda’s head office for 11 years, told the House of Commons that he did not believe the site would survive a few years after the merger.He added that distribution centres “will be absolutely hammered a year or two years down the line if this merger goes ahead”.For shop-floor staff which make up the majority of Sainsbury’s and Asda’s 350,000 employees the competition watchdog’s investigation will cause concern.In a similar probe when Morrisons bought Safeway in a far smaller deal in 2003, the regulator forced the supermarkets to offload 53 stores.So a Sainsbury’s-Asda probe would surely require the sale of stores in locations where the combined company would limit choice for shoppers. Coupe admitted as much on Friday morning but said he would miraculously not cut jobs as a result. How?“Even if we have to est stores they will be sold as trading entities,” he said. In other words, a rival will buy them and they will stay open.But just who would snap them up? Only Tesco and Morrisons would remain as potential purchasers out of a new “big three” of supermarkets.It’s far from certain they would look to acquire large numbers of stores.The space race that saw supermarkets aggressively add new shops throughout the 2000s, particularly large out-of-town locations, is well and truly over. What the Sainsbury’s-Asda merger says about Brexit Sainsbury’s says Asda merger a win for all. Can customers believe it?Sainsbury’s merger with Asda likely to face competition watchdog probeSainsbury’s grows sales but warns bank profits will take a hit in 2018Sainsbury’s share price soars as it unveils details of Asda mergerCustomers habits have changed. Fewer consumers do one big weekly shop, instead preferring regular trips to convenience stores or shopping online.Aldi and Lidl are adding stores at a rapid rate but much of Asda and Sainsbury’s portfolio is likely to be a bad fit for the discounters, both of which favour smaller, more centrally located shops. Some commentators have touted bargain retailers such as B\u0026ampM as potential purchasers.Richard Lim, chief executive of consultancy Retail Economics, says it is “inevitable” that the merged company will sell branches and he sees Morrison’s as the prime beneficiary.But it will only buy the profitable stores in good locations that become available. It is too early to say which Sainsbury’s or Asdas will disappear, or even how many, but we can make some guesses. Analysis by Patrick O’Brien, research director at Global Data Retail, found 197 Asda stores that had a Sainsbury’s in the same postcode area (eg PL1). He broke this down further to reveal 75 areas where they are in the same postcode sector (eg: PL1 5). These could be the first for the chop.No plans to close any stores, but with 75 Asda stores in the same postcode district as a Sainsbury’s store (excluding Sainsbury’s Locals) we expect the CMA will demand disposals pic.twitterW2oYyPbr2nOn job cuts, Lim says the merger will speed up a process that has been underway for a decade.“The number of people employed in retail has been shrinking by 1 per cent per year since 2008. The industry doesn’t require as much space and the role of employees is changing.” he said.“If the merger does result in redundancies through being forced to sell stores or through cutting back office teams, ultimately this is about making a company that is fit for purpose in the future with a business model that works.”Andy Brian, head of retail at Gordons law firm, said that despite what has been stated officially, “stores would have to close”.“That’s not necessarily a bad thing for the brands, although it would, of course, be a bad thing for those store employees.”During a debate on the takeover on Monday, Conservative MP Stephen Kerr said the concentration of supermarket power could have a “potentially devastating effect” on suppliers.The two largest players would control 60 per cent of the market, allowing them to dictate terms to an even greater degree than at present.For Sainsbury’s and Asda executives, the logic behind a £10bn supermarket mega-merger is clear – for shoppers, suppliers and workers the positives are less obvious.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Photos of the happy couple are strewn around the walls: Jane and Serge kissing in the back seat of a car on a rainy day in Paris Jane and Serge beaming into the camera on a lazy summer’s day, after a long, languid lunch. Jane looks beautiful, an English rose, the epitome of a carefree era when anything seemed possible. Serge looks incroyable, like a gargoyle or a goblin. No wonder the French press called him l’homme à tête de chou (the man with the head of a cabbage).From 1968 to 1980, Birkin and Gainsbourg were Europe’s most glamorous creative couple. They could scarcely have been less alike. She was young and lovely, health and innocence personified. He was seedy and dishevelled, yet he oozed Gallic élan. They appeared together in movies and fashion shoots, but the thing that made them famous was the song they sang together, “Je T’Aime… Moi Non Plus” (I love you… neither do I).Gasinbourg wrote “Je T’Aime” for Brigitte Bardot, with whom he had a brief romance in 1967. In 1969, he released the song with his new love, Jane Birkin. It was a Succès de Scandale, on account of Birkin’s contribution, in which she simulated the sounds of female arousal (20 years before When Harry Met Sally – quelle horreur!). If you’ve never heard it, it sounds awful – but, remarkably, it was a masterpiece. A conversation between two passionate, nihilistic lovers, it contained poetic pearls like “You are the wave – I am the island”, and Birkin’s heavy breathing, of course.Driving through Oxfordshire, on the road to Blenheim Palace in 1969“Je T’Aime” was condemned by the Vatican and banned from the radio in Britain and several Continental countries. France was a bit more enlightened. The song was played on the radio, but only after 11pm, and you had to be over 21 to buy the record. Even then, it was sold in a plain wrapper, like a porn mag or a blue movie. Naturally, this furore was wonderful exposure. A broadcast ban is fantastic for sales, giving a hit single a rebellious cachet that no amount of advertising can achieve. All these years later, “Je T’Aime” still stands proud in the pantheon of brilliant records banned by the BBC, from “God Save the Queen” by the Sex Pistols to “Relax” by Frankie Goes to Hollywood.  The record reached number one in Britain, and all across the Continent. Serge told Jane that the Pope was their greatest PR man. “He loved it!” she says, remembering Gainsbourg’s reaction to the controversy. He had a terrific appetite for mischief, and he knew no publicity was bad publicity.Jane \u0026amp Serge: Family album by Andrew BirkinJane \u0026amp Serge: Family album by Andrew BirkinJane and Serge kissing in the back seat of a car on a rainy day in Paris 1969 - Andrew Birkin: Serge seemed to know the hidden underside of the photo shoot and, clearly better than me, the readers of Jours de France: nothing too subtle. We looked for the Oxford bus depot, which was deserted at the weekend, and bribed the caretaker to close his eyes while Serge sat in the driver\u0027s seat in the bright red double-decker bus, Jane at his side. Buying him a hot dog was the not-too-subtle but sufficient reward, before setting off for Oxford, a true place of learning.\u0026#131974 - Andrew Birkin: Serge received some good news from his agent... and bad news in a Sunday rag, which quoted him as saying: You\u0027re not my wife, darling... I love my freedom too much! . Black had always been my favourite colour: when I was at school, I had painted my bedroom walls black and I thought about doing the same in this hideous house I had bought in London. Serge stole a march on me by covering his recently purchased house in the Rue de Verneuil in black from floor to ceiling. \u0026#13On the road to Blenheim PalaceSerge entertaining Jane and Régine during a lunch party in 1969Photography by Andrew BirkinJane in 19691977 - Andrew Birkin: Jane had bought an old presbytery in Normandy, somewhere she could impose her own taste rather than always approving Serge\u0027s style. Serge\u0027s love for the countryside was short-lived and after just a few days, he was itching with the idea of returning to Paris... Or at least the idea of reviving himself with a “Marcel Proust” cocktail at the bar in the Grand Hôtel in Cabourg. \u0026#13Serge and Nana in 1977That was nearly 50 years ago, but the memories of that hedonistic era still burn bright, and now Birkin is revisiting that heady époque in a new show called Jane \u0026amp Serge here in Calais. It’s an exhibition of photos of the couple by her brother, Andrew Birkin, taken from the late Sixties to the late Seventies. Andrew is an eminent filmmaker (his biggest hit was his haunting film of Ian McEwan’s novel, The Cement Garden) and he has a director’s eye for drama. Andrew has always been close to Jane and he became close to Gainsbourg too. Consequently, these photos are incredibly intimate. Each frame preserves a particular mood, a unique atmosphere. They not only capture the essence of their relationship but the spirit of their age.Andrew is here too, for the opening of the exhibition, and he takes time out to show me and a few other hacks around. “He was a provocateur,” he says, of Serge. “He was always on.” This isn’t a criticism, merely a statement of fact. Twenty-seven years since Gainsbourg died, of a heart attack, aged just 62, Andrew’s deep affection for the legendary chanteur endures. “That streak of melancholy was one of his most attractive facets.”Half a century later, Jane Birkin is still striking – the same fine features half hidden beneath a cascade of tousled brown hair. The laugh lines around her almond eyes merely add to her allure, and her rich voice is full of joie de vivre. Although she left Gainsbourg in 1980, on account of his escalating alcoholism, they remained friends thereafter, united by the child they had together, the actress and singer Charlotte Gainsbourg, and she speaks of him with fondness, and admiration.Jane in the grounds of Blenheim Palace in 1969 – the archetypal English rose“Andrew was around on all our holidays – and all the rather bad films I did!” she recalls, looking at the photos of her younger self that surround her, reducing her to a pale replica of the image on the wall. “It’s a bit weird. You feel as if you’re dead.” Everyone laughs, but it’s not so funny. Her youthful fame has eclipsed her, leaving her public persona stranded in a time that’s long since passed.She still spends most of her time in France, and today she seems more French than English. Watching her being interviewed by French reporters, speaking fluent French, she seems more natural, more at ease. It looks like an admirable life, from a distance, but she’s had her share of sadness. Kate Barry, her eldest daughter, from her first marriage to the composer John Barry, died in Paris in 2013 after falling from a fourth-floor apartment.Jane left Serge for the French director Jacques Doillon, with whom she had another daughter, the actress and singer-songwriter Lou Doillon. She still sings, and last year she released an album of songs written for her by Serge – he wrote some of his finest songs about her after they’d parted. “Which, for me, are the most beautiful,” she says. “Everything on Baby Alone in Babylone, which was perhaps the best record I ever made.”That was two years after they’d split, and she’d already given birth to Lou, but the aura of their romance lived on in Serge’s songs. “I liked the ones after I left more, perhaps, because they were really about what he was feeling, and I felt it was deeper.” It felt emotional, singing them in front of him after a parting which caused them both such pain.What made him so significant as an artiste, I ask her. “He really rediscovered the French language,” she tells me. “That’s why I think every writer these days is bound to mention his name.” She likens him to Picasso, passing through so many styles. “He never repeated himself.”Jane and Serge in 1977, in the old presbytery that she bought in NormandyLike a true poet, he loved ambiguity. “There were always two meanings, and sometimes a third.” Yet he far preferred to simply call himself a songwriter. “He didn’t want to say he was a poet. He thought that was for Baudelaire and Apollinaire. The people he really appreciated were classical musicians.” He said that songwriting was a minor occupation. She found such modesty refreshing.Time’s up. Jane has another appointment. A French TV crew are waiting. I return to Andrew and his photos. “The problem with photography is that it starts to overwrite your memories of what you didn’t photograph,” he says. I think I know what he means. The more you look at these photos of his sister, the more unreal the real person becomes.Jane Birkin asks Hermès fashion house to rename luxury Birkin bagsSimon Price on Jane Birkin: Jane reignites her flame for SergeJane Birkin: \u0027I was no Lolita,\u0027 says Britain\u0027s BardotHowever Andrew has a very clear memory of his final meeting with Serge Gainsbourg, about six months before he died. “I bought him a 1910 bottle of Absinthe from Sotheby’s.” Andrew went to see him in his home in Paris, and they watched a film together. “He was asleep within five minutes of putting on the video, so I got up, crept out of the black house and into the black street and that was the last time I saw him.”In the end, it was the same old, sad old story. “The main problem with Serge is just that he became an alcoholic, and had no particular interest in stopping himself.” So what was the connection between his sister and the chanteur? I ask him. “Sex,” he says, and everyone laughs, but he then stops and thinks about it. “It was the attraction of opposites, in a way.”Jane \u0026amp Serge is at the Musée des Beaux Arts in Calais (calais.fr) until 4 Novemberor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Possibly complicating matters was the fact that Denzel Washington was sitting next to him at the table.“When someone says you’re like your idol,” Jordan said, “It’s like: ‘Really? You see that in me?’ I’d only done that one movie. But then I started using it as motivation,” he said. “I wanted to pop up on Denzel’s radar. He’s the OG. If I could get recognition from him, I know I’m going down the right path, you know?”Denzel: We’re only getting further apart in this technological ageFinally, Washington broke in with a booming laugh: “And here we are, Mike! Looks like it’s working out already,” he said.In truth, it would be hard for an actor to choose a better role model than Washington. In a career ning more than 40 years and 50 films – and kicked off by the hit TV drama St Elsewhere – Washington, 63, has been nominated for nine Academy Awards. He won twice: for best actor as a terrifying rogue cop in Training Day and for best supporting actor as a Union soldier in an African-American army unit in Glory. And he was nominated for best actor Oscars in both of the past two years.Jordan (left, with Kevin Durand) in the 2013’s ‘Fruitvale Station’ (Weinstein Company)In the past decade, Washington has ruled the stage, too. He won a Tony Award for best actor in the revival of August Wilson’s Fences in 2010, later directing and starring in an Oscar-nominated film version. He led the acclaimed revival of A Raisin in the Sun in 2014. And today (26 April), he will open again on Broadway in a revival of Eugene O’Neill’s play The Iceman Cometh, a searing and (at four hours long) monumental drama about the lies we tell ourselves to get through life.Like Washington, Jordan, 31, got his big break on television: on HBO’s The Wire, when he was just 15. After his heartbreaking performance in Fruitvale Station, about the last day in the life of a transit-police shooting victim, he starred in the popular Rocky reboot Creed. And this year, he played the villain, Erik Killmonger, in the Marvel juggernaut Black Panther, winning perhaps the best reviews of anyone in the extremely well-reviewed cast.Next month, he stars in Fahrenheit 451 on HBO, a dystopian film based on the novel by Ray Bradbury. Jordan plays a “fireman,” part of a state-sanctioned brigade that hunts down readers and burns books. His company, Outlier Society Productions, is one of the film’s producers and also among the first to adopt inclusion riders, requiring ersity among cast and crew, as called for by Frances McDormand from the stage of this year’s Academy Awards.Over a cocktail hour at the Lambs Club in Manhattan (a Diet Coke for Washington, a sauvignon blanc for Jordan), the actors traded notes about creating characters and the socially minded work that really matters to them. These are excerpts from the conversation.Galanes: If Mike reminds people of a young Denzel, who did young Denzel remind people of?Washington: I never saw it that way. I never even thought about movie stars. My goal was to be on Broadway, to earn $650 a week. My hero was James Earl Jones. And I came to acting green. I was taking pre-law courses, then journalism courses. Then I took an acting class and got bit by the bug. So I came down to Lincoln Centre and saw plays and stage actors.Galanes: But all those things you did – law, journalism, acting – they’re all about getting to the bottom of a story, right?Washington: I like that part: building a character. You start with the material that gives you clues. If you’re playing a boxer, you want to throw out punches. If you’re playing a conductor, you want to get on a train.Galanes: And the script?Washington: Sure, but you don’t know who the character is just by reading the script. I don’t read a script and go, “Now, I get it!” That’s just the beginning. The first thread you pull.Jordan: The script tells you what’s going up on screen. But the biggest part, the fun part, is figuring out what happened to that character before page one of the script. What kind of food does he like? Did he get into fights going to school? That back story determines the choices you make within the confines of the script. And going through that process with the director is a big part of the collaboration. Now I’ve got notebooks and notebooks of back stories. Some directors may want you to add something or change your version. That’s when you try to find common ground.Washington won an Oscar for his role as rogue cop Alonzo in 2001’s ‘Training Day’ (Warner Bros)Galanes: Is that why you’ve both worked with directors repeatedly? Mike with Ryan Coogler Denzel with Spike Lee and Antoine Fuqua. Your common ground?Washington (laughing): Maybe they’re the ones who called. What you’re saying is part of it, but I don’t think it’s just one way.Jordan: Those are the roles I was lucky enough to get. Ryan and I have worked together three times, and I have a really close relationship with him. But I said no to lots of other things with other people in between. They weren’t right. Personally, I think you’re defined by what you say no to.Washington: I say yes to everything!Galanes: Why do I doubt that? Managing a career as big as yours must take a lot of work.Washington: Not now. Maybe early on. Now, I just do what I want to do. And you don’t want to walk down the same road twice. I’m sure after doing Iceman Cometh, I won’t be looking to do another play.Washington: Yeah, not for a while.Galanes: You’re too young to remember this, Mike. But early in his career, Denzel was so beloved for playing good guys – in Glory and Cry Freedom – that we all freaked out when he started playing villains: in Training Day, American Gangster. And he was even better at bad guys! Was that about walking down different roads?Playing Killmonger (right) in ‘Black Panther’ brought rave reviews for Jordan (MarvelDisney)Jordan: So much trickles down from the director. That’s why I try to choose the ones who make the best environments to work in, so we can maybe make something as good as Training Day. You don’t want to go into a project with somebody who won’t be helpful to your process – or vice versa.Galanes: I read this funny thing about you, Mike: you started choosing projects where you wouldn’t die in the end?Jordan: It started with my mom, who’s super emotional. When I shot my death scene in The Wire, she was on set. And the PAs kept coming to me and saying: ‘You may want to check on your mom.’ I go see her, and she’s sitting there bawling. I’m just a kid. I’m going, ‘Come on, Ma. You’re embarrassing me.’ And after Fruitvale Station, I was like, ‘Man, this is really affecting her.’ But there was another thing, too. Look at Denzel’s career. I want people to see me win. I want audiences to see me ending up on top – not dying. I want to be the leading man.Washington: Man, I got underwear older than that.Jordan: That was the real thought process: How do I become a leading man? I know phenomenal actors who can’t open movies overseas. How do you become the guy who can carry a film?Washington: So, you study the game?Galanes Is that why you went down the superhero route?Galanes You probably made up for it with Black Panther. Why no superheroes for you, Denzel?Galanes: Superheroes have changed. When Denzel might have played one, they were dull. The villains were interesting: Jack Nicholson and Heath Ledger. Like you in Black Panther, Mike.Washington: When I was a teenager, Shaft and Super Fly, those were our superheroes. I remember watching Super Fly with my boy Carl, and when we got back to the projects, he carved the character’s name – Priest – on the elevator door. And Richard Roundtree in those long leather coats in Shaft.Galanes: Both of your new projects are dark. Iceman Cometh is brutal. And in Fahrenheit 451, competing ideas are so scary that people decide to burn all the books and kill the readers. Why choose them now?27 films to look out for in the first half of 2018 27 films to look out for in the first half of 2018 Galanes: It’s powerful to watch a black man in your role.Jordan: But it wasn’t all there on the page. I needed to make sure that he was willing to collaborate, to change some things to help me, as a black man, feel more comfortable in that role. And my company’s co-producing it alongside HBO was important to me too. This is my first time working with the director and the network, giving my opinion and hoping that it’s taken seriously.Washington (laughing): Getting your big boy voice.Galanes Like coming back to the stage, Denzel?Washington: Yeah. Then we boiled it down to Iceman and King Lear. And he said: ‘Let’s do Lear five years from now.’ I said: “OK, we’ll do that next – God willing.”Washington: Eugene O’Neill. That simple. The chance to interpret his brilliant material. You know, my first role on stage, when I was a student at Fordham, was in The Emperor Jones. I’ve always loved O’Neill. And here I am, 40 years later, coming back to him in Iceman.Galanes: Your character, Hickey, seems like the life of the party at first, but what a tortured soul he turns out to be. What drew you to him?Washington: His desire to see people happy. Even when he knows he can’t make that happen, that desire is still there in him.Galanes: It’s a mountain of a play – four hours long. Is it hard to maintain that intensity every night?‘Fahrenheit 451’ sees Jordan plays a ‘fireman’, part of a state-sanctioned brigade that hunts down readers and burns books (HBO)Washington: Listen, this is what I love: acting on stage. And I don’t have to do anything else. Just be in this play. So, don’t feel sorry for me compared to most workers in America.Galanes: Is theatre on your radar, Mike?Jordan: Down the line. But right now, I want to take care of my family financially and grow my production company. That’s the big thing I want to do: set my family up.Jordan: As a kid, you don’t see your circumstances. I didn’t. It’s not until you look back and think, ‘Man, we were poor!’ My parents really hid that from me. They kept me safe.Washington: It wasn’t that tough. I was having a good time. A lot of my boys went to prison.Jordan: That’s why I want to take care of my family now. Then let me go and work on my craft, do something to fulfil me on the inside. That’s what I think theatre is going to be for me – when I’m older. What do you love about it, Denzel?Washington: The energy from the audience is immediate. And you get to develop a full life. See, in film, you might shoot the end first, then the middle. But on stage, it’s the full score of the character’s life. And you always get another night.Washington: In film, you don’t get another night to shoot a scene. You can try to fix it in other scenes. But film is a director’s medium. Theatre is for actors. We’re directed, but once the curtain goes up, it belongs to us. And every night’s as different as the audience. Some nights, they cheer the whole way through others, they don’t cheer at all.Galanes: Let me shift gears. We’re living through a time right now where men in power who’ve done ugly things –Washington: No. We’re not ‘living through a time right now’. It’s always been this way, from the beginning of time. Pick one: from Caesar to Caligula. Now, it’s just on the news cycle every 15 seconds.Jordan: And opinion is now fact – because anyone with a Twitter handle can say it.Washington: It doesn’t even have to be true it just has to be first.Galanes: Hang on, I’m asking something different: Based on your years as a powerful figure, why do you think some guys turn to ugly behaviour, and others don’t?Washington: Nobody’s perfect, man. Don’t put me on a pedestal, if that’s what you’re trying to do. I’m just a human being. I made mistakes I’ll make some more. Hopefully, you learn from them. My mother always said, ‘Keep it simple.’ The older I get, the more I understand her: cut away the fat. When you’re younger, you want to see, taste, touch.Washington (laughing): There you have it. But when you get to be my age, you learn you don’t have to. I have a beautiful wife, beautiful children, a great job. What more do I need?Jordan: And people like us, actors of colour, we don’t get a lot of second chances. It’s a different type of scrutiny. Knowing it’s not all fair and equal, you’ve got to make smart decisions in the moment.Washington: I remember going home one time and saying to my mother, ‘Hey, Ma, did you ever think that I...’ And she said: ‘Stop right there! Do you know all the people who’ve been praying for your raggedy butt?’ You don’t get there by yourself.Jordan: That’s crazy! I was just thinking: I’m going to church in the morning – because I know the people there have always prayed for me. Their blessings have protected me from terrible situations. That’s how I think about keeping it simple: remembering where it started – that village, that tribe that kept you safe.Galanes: And it was 38 years between Sidney Poitier’s Oscar for best actor and yours.Galanes: How about opportunities for people of colour?Washington: That’s why I’m here! That’s why I’m still in the race. And I’m passing the baton. What a lot of people don’t know is: when you pass the baton, you keep running behind the other runner, you don’t just stop. I’m like, ‘Make the turn, bring it home!’ I like helping people. I want to see them do well.Black Panther star reveals Denzel Washington paid for his acting classDenzel schools journalist with response to \u0027fake news\u0027 questionHow to stop Denzel Washington stealing your sceneJordan: That’s why I want to produce so much. I like creating opportunities for people.Galanes: You were right out of the gate on inclusion riders, Mike. The first to say, ‘My company guarantees that casts and crews will be erse.’Jordan: That’s super important to me. No matter what community we’re talking about. Everybody should be in a position where they can win.Washington: I’m just wired that way.Jordan: My path is my path. I can’t take nothing away from nobody, and nobody can take nothing away from me. I’m running my race. But we can still encourage each other.Washington: What’s the harm in that? You’ll never see a U-Haul behind a hearse.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

It also helps both humans and animals to navigate, and protects our telecommunication and satellite systems.Substance that gives birds power to see Earth’s magnetic field foundIf the two magnetic poles were to switch places, something that has happened periodically over the course of Earth’s history, all of this would be compromised.Since 1840, the year scientists began to measure such things, the global strength of the Earth’s magnetic field has been declining at a rate of around 5 per cent per century.This weakening, combined with the expansion of a particularly weak area in the planet’s magnetic field called the South Atlantic Anomaly, led to speculation that Earth’s magnetic fields were about to\u0026nbspreverse.The last time such a “geomagnetic reversal” or “excursion” happened was 780,000 years ago, but coverage of this phenomenon has suggested such an\u0026nbspevent is right around the corner.\u0026nbspAn extract from a book by journalist Alanna Mitchell was published on the science website Undark.The book was titled The Spinning Magnet: The Electromagnetic Force That Created the Modern World — and Could Destroy It, and the extract included a warning that it was “time to wake up to the dangers and start preparing” for a magnetic pole reversal.This warning was picked up with gusto and soon many other articles were popping up warning of the dangers of an imminent pole reversal.However, the new study suggests the worst of these fears may have been unwarranted.Based on the Earth’s history of flipping its magnetic field, something which can be calculated based on magnetics minerals in rocks, they think such an event is unlikely to happen any time soon.“There has been speculation that we are about to experience a magnetic polar reversal or excursion,” said Professor Richard Holme, a geomagnetism expert at the University of Liverpool.Why the Earth’s magnetic poles could be about to swap places – and how“However, by studying the two most recent excursion events, we show that neither bear resemblance to current changes in the geomagnetic field and therefore it is probably unlikely that such an event is about to happen.Our research suggests instead that the current weakened field will recover without such an extreme event, and therefore is unlikely to reverse.Instead, the scientists predict it may take thousands of years before Earth’s magnetic field reverses again.Scientists are certainly aware of the possibility that the Earth’s magnetic field will flip its polarity at some point in the future. As Nasa states in a post on its website from 2011: “Reversals are the rule, not the exception”.In the Undark extract, Ms Mitchell quotes physicist Dr Daniel Baker of the University of Colorado, Boulder saying he fears parts of the planet will become uninhabitable during such a reversal.However, the consensus still seems to be that even if such an event did take place, its outcomes would not be as serious as some commentators have made out:“Many doomsday theorists have tried to take this natural geological occurrence and suggest it could lead to Earth\u0027s destruction,” Nasa continued in their post.“But would there be any dramatic effects? The answer, from the geologic and fossil records we have from hundreds of past magnetic polarity reversals, seems to be \u0027no.\u0027”Code of ConductInstall our AppsWe use cookies to enhance your visit to our site and to bring you advertisements that might interest you.

Others were able to log in but, when they did, some or all of their account details had disappeared.Customers have also reported that they could access other people’s accounts, including account numbers, sort codes and transaction histories.TSB apology after customers complain of online banking ‘data breach’​TSB could not say how many people were still locked out of the service or when the problems would be fully resolved.The ongoing IT disaster began with botched upgrade work on Friday, but has developed into one of the worst technology failures to hit a UK retail bank and has left many of TSB’s 1.9 million customers furious.Some said they were falling behind with bill payments.Others said they were worried their money had simply disappeared.Many customers expressed frustration that the bank was not being clear about what had happened.That came after Paul Pester, CEO of TSB, tweeted on Wednesday morning: “Our mobile banking app and online banking are now up and running. Thank you for your patience and for bearing with us.”Our mobile banking app and online banking are now up and running. Thank you for your patience and for bearing with us.MPs demanded answers from TSB on Tuesday. Nicky Morgan, chair of the Treasury Committee, said: “The reports of unauthorised transactions, access to other customers’ accounts and failures of in-branch services have all the hallmarks of an IT meltdown.“This is yet another addition to the litany of failures of banking IT systems. Potentially, millions of customers could be affected by uncertainty and disruption.“It simply isn’t good enough to expose customers to IT failures, including delays in paying bills and an inability to access their own money.”A spokesperson for the Financial Conduct Authority said on Tuesday that the watchdog was “aware of the issue and liaising with the firm”. A spokesperson for the Information Commissioner’s Office said: “We are aware of a potential data breach in relation to the TSB and are making enquiries.”Mr Pester said on Tuesday that he was “truly sorry” about the problems caused. “We’re still seeing issues with access to our digital services,” he added. “One of the steps we need to take to resolve this is to take our mobile app and online banking down for a few hours.“We did this at around 10.30 this morning and we hope to be back up later this afternoon.”The problems stemmed from a switch to a new online banking system. TSB had rented the technology behind its app and online banking from Lloyds Banking Group since the two companies split. Over the weekend, TSB moved customers to a new platform which experienced some teething problems.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

I think that when we have taken a decision, we follow it through,” he said.Dr Fox insisted crashing out of the EU with no agreement – a threat repeatedly made by the prime minister – was still on the table, but downgraded it to a “possibility”.He also tried to rule out compromise on the policy of staying out of a customs union with the EU, saying: “We would be in a worse position than we are today.“We would have to accept what the EU negotiated in terms of market access to the UK, without the UK having a voice.”Lords votes to kill off any prospect of a \u0027no deal\u0027 BrexitBrussels warns Sajid Javid of \u0027concerns\u0027 with EU citizens registerEU gives Britain June deadline on Northern Ireland border issueUK set to offer EU Brexit migration deal \u0027similar\u0027 to free movement\u0027Biggest ever pro-EU march\u0027 promised for referendum on Brexit dealHe added: “A customs union is what Turkey has – it would still leave us accepting rules made by Brussels with no say in how they are made.”Dr Fox hinted strongly that he would resign if the prime minister does give way, refusing to answer the question directly, but adding: “Getting no answer you can draw your own inferences.”When, on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, it was put to him that Ms May was a “horribly weakened” prime minister, he replied: “We don\u0027t have a parliamentary majority, that\u0027s for sure. That makes life harder.”The interview came one day before a potentially decisive meeting of the Brexit sub-committee, which will see an attempt by Brexiteers to kill off Ms May’s preferred plan for post-Brexit customs.They fear the “partnership” plan – which would see the UK collecting tariffs on the EU’s behalf – is unworkable and could be used by Brussels as a device to soften Brexit.The alternative “maximum facilitation” option is based on technological solutions to the customs issue but the EU is sceptical that it would ever work.However, Dr Fox acknowledged that neither of the UK proposals would “solve all the problems” of cross-border trade, avoiding a hard Irish border and giving the UK an independent trade policy.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Cambridge Analytica insisted the Facebook data it received was obtained legally and that it was not used in the Brexit referendum.Mr Banks and Eldon Insurance have denied that the company shared any data with either Leave.EU or with Cambridge Analytica – and insisted the data consultancy did no work for its campaign.AIQ, meanwhile, says it has never been a part of either Cambridge Analytica or SCL, its parent firm, nor entered into a contract with Cambridge Analytica.However, the information commissioner, Elizabeth Denham, is investigating both Leave.EU and Mr Banks over possible breaches of the Data Protection Act, issuing “information notices” requiring specified cooperation.Her office also raided Cambridge Analytica’s offices, as part of Operation Cederburg – the commissioner’s year-long investigation into the use of data in the EU referendum.A few days ago, Ms Denham publicly accused AIQ of failing to co-operate with her inquiry, saying: “We are considering the legal steps available to obtain the information.”Of the 87 Facebook users whose personal data was shared with Cambridge Analytica, more than one million live in the UK, the company has acknowledged.“One million people was the margin of the win in the Brexit referendum,” Ms Sandbach pointed out.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

He added: “Without him it would have been a much longer, tougher, process!”China is North Korea’s sole major ally, but trade has declined by about 90 per cent after Beijing implemented economic sanctions due to Pyongyang’s nuclear and missile tests.In March Mr Kim visited China by train, meeting Mr Xi and the pair – according to the state-run China Daily – agreed a plan to develop relations between the two countries, and to address the North’s nuclear programme.The 36-year-old dictator is anticipated to meet Mr Trump at some point in May or early June, though no date has been announced for the encounter the Republican accepted on the spur of the moment earlier this year.On Twitter Mr Trump suggested he was considering the Peace House, on the border between North and South Korea, as the intended location. It is where last week’s summit between Mr Moon and Mr Kim was held.He tweeted: “Numerous countries are being considered for the MEETING, but would Peace HouseFreedom House, on the Border of North \u0026amp South Korea, be a more Representative, Important and Lasting site than a third party country?

Seoul began blaring anti-Pyongyang broadcasts and K-Pop songs via border loudspeakers, and Pyongyang quickly matched the South’s action with its own border broadcasts and launches of balloons carrying anti-South leaflets. Seoul’s announcement came a day after it said Mr Kim had told Mr Moon during the summit that he would shut down his country’s only known nuclear testing site and allow outside experts and journalists to watch the process.Additional reporting by agenciesor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The verification provisions in the Iran nuclear deal would make it harder for Iran to restart any such research. That is another good reason for keeping the deal while building on it in order to take account of the legitimate concerns of the US and our other allies.”Under the 2015 nuclear deal struck by Iran and six major powers – Britain, the United States, France, Germany, Russia and China – Tehran agreed to limit its nuclear programme in return for relief from crippling sanctions.Donald Trump has signalled he will pull out of the agreement, which he has called “the worst deal ever”, but he faces intense pressure from his European allies to stick with it.The US president gave Britain, France and Germany a deadline to fix what he views as the deal’s flaws – its failure to address Iran’s ballistic missile programme, the terms by which inspectors visit suspect Iranian sites, and “sunset” clauses under which some of its terms expire – by 12 May, or he will reimpose US sanctions.Netanyahu says he believes Trump will make the correct decision about the Iran nuclear deal (Getty)On Monday, Mr Netanyahu stood in front of stacks of files representing what he said was a “half ton” of Iranian nuclear documents collected by Israeli intelligence.“Iran lied about never having a nuclear weapons programme,” he said. “One hundred thousand secret files prove it did. Second, even after the deal, Iran continued to preserve and expand its nuclear weapons knowledge for future use.”The White House said in a statement: “This information provides new and compelling details about Iran’s efforts to develop missile-deliverable nuclear weapons.“These facts are consistent with what the United States has long known: Iran had a robust, clandestine nuclear weapons programme that it has tried and failed to hide from the world and from its own people.”An earlier statement by the White House made the extraordinary claim Iran “has” a clandestine nuclear weapons programme, before it was corrected due to what it said was a clerical error.Iran has denied ever seeking nuclear weapons and accuses Israel of stirring up world suspicions against it. A spokesman for the country’s foreign ministry called Mr Netanyahu’s performance a “threadbare charlatanism” show.The state-run IRNA news agency quoted the spokesman, Bahram Ghasemi, as saying Mr Netanyahu’s speech was part of “fruitless efforts of a bankrupt and scandalous liar”.France and Germany also confirmed they will continue to back the nuclear agreement. or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Because expectations are so low for the Tories, they are almost bound to surpass them.Mrs May’s own position is also stronger than it was in January thanks to her handling of the Salisbury attack.At the start of the local election campaign, the talk was of how the Tories were facing a wipe-out in London, how they would do well to end up holding on to even one council.But senior figures involved in the campaign now admit they should do much better than that.Conservative Campaign Headquarters’ biggest worry in London is simply being outgunned on the day.They fear Labour’s return to being a mass membership party under Jeremy Corbyn will enable them to get nearly all their voters out, while the Tories will struggle to get more than 40 per cent of their supporters to the polls.There is, though, still cautious optimism that the Tories will hold at least one of their two flagship London boroughs, Wandsworth and Westminster.Then they could claim the results were respectable for a government in mid-term.This is especially true as results outside London are expected to be quite good for the party.One former Cabinet minister loyal to Theresa May tells me: “Things outside London really aren’t bad.”The Tories are particularly hopeful of making gains in the West Midlands.It will be tempting for the Tories to declare the local elections are further proof the capital and the rest of country are diverging politically, and so their decline in London doesn’t matter much as it will be made up for elsewhere.But this would be a catastrophic mistake.Labour’s rise in London is quite remarkable.They have gone from 37 per cent of the vote in 2010 to 55 per cent in 2017.There are several reasons why the capital is turning red but one of the biggest is the decline in home ownership.Home ownership in London peaked in the 1990s and has been falling since.Homeowners became a minority in London in 2011, the first time that has been the case since Margaret Thatcher’s Right To Buy revolution in the early 1980s.On current trends, 60 per cent of Londoners will be renters in seven years’ time.It is no coincidence that this rise in renting has coincided with Labour’s surge in the capital.For one of the things that makes you most likely to vote Tory is owning your own home.Labour’s surprise success at the last election was largely down to a big increase in turnout among renters who swung heavily to Labour.Labour London offers a preview of what happens to the Tories when homeowners become a minority.If the Tories want to win elections they need to get more homes built — and fast.CABINET Brexiteers are getting increasingly frustrated.They feel that key decisions are not being taken in Cabinet, or even the Cabinet Committee tasked with managing the negotiation, but elsewhere.One senior Brexiteer complains to me that Olly Robbins, the Prime Minister’s chief Europe adviser, is, “Running around telling everyone we have to back down on pretty much everything”.This grumpiness has been exacerbated by this week’s meeting of the Brexit inner Cabinet not discussing the big issue of the moment, customs.One member of it tells me: “When people left, they all felt a greater level of frustration.”There is a sense No10 is not respecting the political process.This all ups the ante ahead of the Brexit inner Cabinet’s meeting next week.This will discuss Theresa May’s plan for a hybrid customs model which would see the UK leave the customs union but collect tariffs on the EU’s behalf.Brexiteer ministers regard this as complicated and as having no chance of being accepted by Brussels. They think persisting with it just wastes valuable time.One tells me Mrs May has been told this hybrid plan is unworkable on eight occasions but doesn’t show any signs of abandoning the idea.Part of the problem is that Mrs May remains deeply worried about whether she has the votes in the Commons to leave the customs union.No10 is extremely concerned about the customs union amendment to the trade bill, which is expected to come to a vote in June.Its hope is the hybrid model is close enough to a customs union to see off a rebellion on this issue but if the model is unworkable, as pretty much everyone thinks, it doesn’t solve anything.Mrs May would be better off making the argument that Brexit won’t mean Brexit if Britain doesn’t regain the ability to run its own trade policy and that she couldn’t continue as Prime Minister in these circumstances.CHRIS GRAYLING wants to make it a criminal offence to cheat on auto emissions tests.This law change, which will be part of Grayling’s road to zero plan to cut exhaust emissions and improve air quality, will enable the Government to prosecute car manufacturers who try to diddle the system.The law won’t apply retrospectively.But the Department for Transport hope it will help prevent a repeat of the Volkswagen scandal.OUR political class needs to remember we are NOT Americans.The question about Donald Trump isn’t whether we would have voted for him or if we think he is the right person to be President of the United States.But how we should deal with the country he leads – which is our most important security ally.No country expelled more Russian diplomats following the Salisbury attack than the United States.Mrs May should make clear that she is delighted, not embarrassed, to welcome Donald Trump to Britain on his “working visit”.Why, because a strong relationship with the United States is in this country’s national interest.French President Emmanuel Macron, on his state visit to Washington this week, didn’t hold back in either cosying up to the president, quite literally at times, or in making clear where he disagreed with him.This is a far more sensible approach than acting all embarrassed about observing the necessary diplomatic niceties.Without Trump, yesterday’s moment of history would not have happened. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It’s patronising rubbish.It’s no surprise that this latest rebellion is being led by the Lib Dems, a party whose anti-Brexit platform was so popular at the last election that they managed to win 12 seats — just under 2 per cent of the Commons.Hardly shocking then that they’re no fans of democracy.What they’re doing is downright dangerous, and not just because a trolling guide produced by one Remoaning pressure group ominously promises “direct action”.The risk is that they put up enough barriers to our departure that the Government ends up compromising on membership of the customs union.That would be a knife in the heart of Global Britain and mean that Brussels bureaucrats would still be setting the rules.That simply cannot happen.The Prime Minister must stand firm.THE tragic death of Alfie Evans has touched the nation.There are real questions to be asked about who has the final say on treatment for terminally-ill children.But for now those debates should be put to one side.Our hearts go out to his parents who have fought so hard to give their son a chance.We also want to offer a tribute to the NHS staff who did all they could for him.And who will do the same, again and again, for hundreds of kids in the future.MO Salah is one of those sportsmen that you just want to succeed.But he’s proved himself much more than just a footballer.He’s broken down walls between different communities and has given back to those in his home town who weren’t blessed with such a cultured left foot.

She was reported to be building a war chest in the event of the PM being ousted. For Ms Rudd this humiliation is a nightmare.But the simple truth is that she has been toppled because she was simply not up to the job.Misleading parliament over routine targets for deporting illegal immigrants is the least of it.Ms Rudd was already marked with the Black Spot.Her real blunders were the failure to act far quicker on both the Windrush victims and the knife massacre in London.The Home Office is the infamous “political graveyard” which chews ministers up and spits them out.Theresa May is the rarity who not only survived but used it as a springboard.Now the famously cautious PM needs to carry out emergency repairs with flair and imagination. She needs a new Home Secretary today.The right man for the job is Environment supremo Michael Gove.He has rebuilt his reputation, almost destroyed by his assassination of leadership rival Boris Johnson.He is the most articulate heavyweight minister in Cabinet and has proved that he can handle big responsibilities with both flair and courage.But Amber Rudd’s department has smashed the delicate Cabinet balance between Brexiteers and Remainers.It exposes deep divisions within Tory ranks over the roubled negotiations currently under way with Brussels.A handful of Remainers are threatening to defy the government in a critical vote over remaining in the EU customs union.Meanwhile Brexiteers who have remained silent are plotting a leadership coup if Mrs May gives in.The departure of Ms Rudd could explode all of this into open warfare.Will Mrs May risk putting potential rival Michael Gove in one of the really Great Offices of State?Jezza’s empty promise to crack down on anti-Semitism followed Commons applause for tearful Labour MPs as they read out vicious Jew-phobic abuse from JC4PM supporters.The answer to Mrs Merton is that Labour, with a 22 per cent poll lead, expects big things in London on Thursday, perhaps including scalps in Tory crown jewel boroughs Westminster and Wandsworth.JC doesn’t want a row over Jew-baiting to spoil a good night for Labour.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

My ministers have made over 30 appearances to answer questions and debate the issues. And we will be giving Parliament a vote on the final deal when we have concluded our negotiations with the EU.When all is said and done, I’m a Parliamentarian before a Minister, and a democrat before a Conservative.But there is a clear distinction between the important work of revising legislation and attempting to overturn the referendum result to keep the UK inside the European Union, in direct opposition to the British people.The amendment Labour have proposed today in the House of Lords is at risk of doing just that.There are three crucial reasons why the Government could never accept it.Firstly, the amendment tries to secure a vote for Parliament before the negotiations have concluded. This is, quite frankly, nonsensical — because nothing in this negotiation is agreed until everything is agreed.Second, it demands specific votes by artificial deadlines which, if not met, would give Parliament the power to micromanage the Government on how to carry out these negotiations.This would give the EU Commission a clear incentive to delay the negotiations or present unacceptable propositions until the deadline has passed and the Government is stripped of its ability to negotiate freely.This fundamental change to the balance of our constitution would be both unprecedented and unworkable.And in our negotiations with the EU to date, the progress we have made has in part been down to the flexibility that both sides have shown.Imagine if every quick decision, proposal or response the Prime Minister and I have to take instead had to be timetabled, debated and voted on by over a thousand MPs and peers?Finally, the amendment proposes giving Parliament the power to direct the Government on anything relating to the negotiations – including extending the negotiation process and keeping the UK in the EU indefinitely.Sure, the peers proposing it may claim it is about keeping power in Parliament or ensuring their votes are ‘meaningful’.But those who want to overturn the result of the Referendum have been calling for a ‘no Brexit option’ for months, and this amendment would grant it to them.This is not what the British people want, and it is not something that we can accept. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

If you let your child be their own person then she probably wouldn’t make the same decisions I did.More poignant, however, is the revelation that Jade was sexually assaulted when she was 16 – at a time when she had never even kissed a boy.Understandably the traumatic experience had a profound effect on her.Anything that happens to someone at a young age when boys cross the line it is going to affect you, she says now.Afterwards I was having sex a fair amount and I thought that was all I was worth.Getting into the porn industry allowed me to mature, to grow into myself, she says.When I got into this, there were people telling me I was beautiful and it brought me out of my shell, it made me believe in myself more than I ever did before.It’s given me independence and self-esteem.On some level I’m the last person you would think works in the adult industry – but often it’s the girls you never would have expected having sex for a living, like the quiet ones you used to see sat in the library with a book.Jade wasn’t quite that girl, although she describes herself as a naïve teenager. She won’t discuss her family, although she describes her upbringing as perfect.By the age of 13 however, she was already watching porn online.Boys in the playground at school were using all these sexual terms. I didn’t have a clue what those words meant so I started looking things up on the internet, she says.It was curiosity really. We’re the generation that’s grown up with the internet, with online pornography, it’s more normalised for our age group.Initially a more traditional career path beckoned though: Jade was accepted on a fashion degree course in Manchester and embarked on student life in the city.But as her student loan started to run out she took an unorthodox route to topping up her funds.I tried everything I could to get a traditional job to get some extra cash but every job in retail I applied for there were to 200 applicants for, she insists.Then a guy I’d met online suggested I sell some pornographic pictures and videos.I already had some on my phone from previous boyfriends so it wasn’t a big leap.Suddenly I had £100 in my bank account every few weeks and I could go shopping and it made me happy.Then, aged 19, she received an email from a website asking if she’d like to make a pornographic film. I said yes, that I would absolutely love to, she says.The basic shoot involved a very simple boy meets girl scene. I had no idea what to expect but I wasn’t nervous, she insists.I knew nothing though - I turned up with just the clothes on my back. I remember them asking me where my underwear and outfit options were. But I enjoyed it.Quickly, it seems, Jade found that performing porn gave her a sense of self-worth that had been missing from her life: she describes her student days as lonely and depressed and says that her newfound porn career gave her confidence.Nonetheless, it’s clear she has gone through experiences which made her unhappy, some of which unfold in the documentary.In one scene, in which her male co-star is struggling to perform Jade can be seen having a panic attack as she worries about filming with him again.In another more shocking incident, she confides that she has been bleeding after suffering a tear in her vagina after a vigorous sex session – yet feels she has no choice but to have sex with the same man on camera again. It’s my job, she says to camera.Today she does not want to dwell on these incidents, saying they are in the past. It was the start of what would become, post graduation, a full-time porn career, travelling to shoots all over Europe – among them Prague, Budapest, Spain, Austria.For two years I didn’t see my bed for more than about three days in a row. she says. But I found it very fulfilling. It gave me independence in a way that getting coffees as an intern in the fashion industry could never do.And while the pay wasn’t huge – some shoots pay £500 a day, some much less, with an hourly rate of around £12 - it was enough for her, by the age of 21, to rent her own city centre flat.She was also able to fund a boob job, something she calls her 21st birthday present to myself.I didn’t do it for men, she insists. I wanted to balance my body out. I went from a small B to a DD. I wanted that perfect rounded shape.She insists that she’s never had a bad experience or felt vulnerable. When I first started out I did some things I’m not proud of - someone was a bit rough with me, she says.But it was because I was bottom of the ladder. Now in terms of what I do on set everything is agreed on before I arrive.If I think a guy is going too hard I will just tell him to stop and they always respect it.Like all sex workers, she has regular sexual health checks as 90 percent of sex takes place without protection. So far, she has emerged unscathed.Years later, she now says that it is her work in porn, not real relationships, that give her a sense of self-worth.In my professional life men treat me with nothing but admiration and respect. But I find in real life that’s not the case, she says.It’s one reason she has decided to remain single for the foreseeable future, describing herself as asexual.It’s just easier this way, she says. One ex-boyfriend was fine with it at first but then got jealous.It’s just easier to have either porn or a boyfriend, you can’t really have both at the same time.Her friends, meanwhile, are aware of what she does but are unfazed.They’ve known me a long time and they know I enjoy being outlandish.

She doesn’t have a monopoly on anger”.In a declaration that will sound alarm in Downing Street, Mr Javid was also swift to rubbish the ‘hostile environment’ mantra, a phrase used by Theresa May herself just last week.Instead, he would refer to policies to make it harder for illegal immigrants to prosper here as “compliant environment”, telling MPs: “I don’t like the phrase hostile. It’s not a phrase I’m going to use. It doesn’t represent the values of our country”.And hinting he is ready to make major changes to introduce a more liberal immigration policy, Mr Javid added: “It’s not just about a personnel change. It’s about action, and that’s why she’ll be seeing from my department”.But he said he is yet to decide on whether to continue with deportation targets, the controversial issue that Ms Rudd had to resign over after inadvertently misleading the Commons when she said last week they didn’t exist.Mr Javid immediately won the praise of his predecessor Ms Rudd, who tweeted: Outstanding debut by fantastic Sajid Javid in House of Commons today.But he risked angering his ageing mother by admitting he was yet to call her, but pledged: “I will do later”.Mr Javid’s elevation now makes him the boss of his younger brother Bas, who is a Chief Superintendent with West Midlands Police.Mr Javid has already ran for the Tory leadership once, on a joint ticket with Stephen Crabb against Theresa May in 2016. But they were eliminated in the first round of voting.Ms Rudd’s Cabinet exit has slashed the number of women around Theresa May’s top table down to just 22% in a blow for one of her own personal goals.Just five out of the Cabinets 23 full members are now women, after the PM failed to replace the outgoing Home Secretary with another woman.A further four female ministers are allowed to attend Cabinet.Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt took over Rudd’s Women and Equalities brief yesterday in addition to her aid responsibilities. Despite it being just day one on the job, Mr Javid was bombarded with calls from many quarters to reform the government’s creaking immigration policy.He also inherits a huge in tray, from also drawing up tough new terrorism laws to conquering rising gun and knife crime, and devising a new post-Brexit immigration system for EU citizens. Yesterday MEPs gave the new Home Secretary one of his first headaches in office as they voiced concerns over the registration process for EU citizens.In a letter to Mr Javid, the EU parliament’s Brexit negotiator Guy Verhofstadt laid out a series of demands for the settled status scheme.MEPs also want applications to be cleared within 48 hours, with those who don’t receive a response within that time presumed to have been successful.Finally, in a sign of how low trust in the Home Office has sunk, the Parliament demanded to see evidence of how it will finance the scheme.The letter follows a presentation by Home Office officials in Brussels last week at which it emerged their flagship registration app doesn’t work properly on iPhones.Through hard graft and natural wit, he has gone from growing up on Britain’s most crime ridden street to the Home Office’s HQ on Marsham Street.On Bristol’s notorious Stapleton Road, he shared a cramped two bedroom flat with his parents and FOUR brothers until the age of 12.It was opposite a brothel, and a prostitute used to stand outside.“I didn’t know what a prostitute was at the time,” Sajid told me during the 2015 general election campaign. “For me, it was home”.Both parents were first generation Brits, immigrating from the Punjab in Pakistan – his father with just £1 in his pocket when he arrived.Dad Abdul eventually escaped the Rochdale cotton mill to realise his ambition of becoming a bus driver, before achieving his next one of owning his own clothes shop with a family move down south to Bristol.A childhood highlight for Sajid came twice a year when, as a special treat, the boys’ father would rent a VHS player for a weekend and leave them to binge on all the latest movies, until it went back to the shop on Monday.From being able to speak only Punjabi when he first went to nursery aged three, Sajid won a place at Exeter University.From there, he went into the City and made millions, becoming the youngest ever vice-president of Chase Manhattan Bank aged just 25.All his success he attributes to his mum and dad.The MP for Bromsgrove still lives by his father’s favourite mantra.“You get back what you put in, my dad would often say,” he also told me.It was the Falklands War two years on that “awoke my patriotism”, he said.“I wouldn’t miss a single night of the TV news and I bought all the newspapers, I had to follow every turn.”Sajid’s proud father saw his son elected to Parliament in 2010, but died of cancer a year later, and didn’t witness his elevation to the government as a junior Treasury minister in 2012, having caught the keen eye of then Chancellor George Osborne.He entered the Cabinet as Culture Secretary in 2014, going on to serve as Business Secretary in 2015, and Housing Secretary in 2016.A father of three himself now, the 48-year-old appears far from finished yet.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

If this means London swings to Labour, then it’s also likely to mean much of the rest of England will swing to Conservative.”He added: “Don’t be surprised if projected national vote share (based on Thursday’s results) has Tories ahead even those they have lost more seats in London.”The Strathcylde University Professor – Britain’s most famous so-called psephologist – received a knighthood in the Queen’s 2018 New Year’s honours list.He has accurately predicted the last four general elections, including last June’s surprise results where he correctly said the Conservatives would lose their majority.The forecast came as separate research claimed voters were “anxious” about the state of the country – led by fury over the housing crisis.Deborah Mattinson at Britain Thinks added that young 18-30 voters were “more gloomy than older voters” and felt a “strong sense of injustice”.She said: “Seven out of ten no longer think it pays to work hard.”Some 4,410 seats are being contested on Thursday across 150 councils. Just over 40 per cent are in London.Sir John said: “Because London accounts for 42 per cent of seats, there is a risk that the headline tally of seats won or lost will be misleading.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He is taking Lexlaw to a tribunal alleging constructive dismissal, but is said to be “entirely sanguine” about airing details of his kinky activities.Sources close to Mr Jones insist the spanking was consensual and the couple did not have sex.But he is said to be keen to protect the “very junior employee” involved in a tryst that sent rumbles through London’s stuffy Inns of Court.Mr Jones told legal blog RollOnFriday that he was suspended last June just a day after he rejected a request from Lexlaw’s managing director to reconsider his resignation amid a salary dispute.The lawyer said the spanking session had happened long before he quit and claimed it was only raised so Lexlaw would not have to pay him for his notice period.Mr Jones studied at Cambridge from 1996 to 2000, gaining a first-class degree in mathematics and a special prize in astrophysics before studying law. He joined Lexlaw in October 2012 and specialised in corporate finance, before leaving last year to become a freelance barrister.On the row, Mr Jones said: “I had a consensual BDSM relationship with another employee, which included one brief incident in private on work premises several months before the disciplinary proceedings.“I was appalled to find out that my employer was monitoring my personal communications over a period of at least several months.”He claims the disciplinary action was in “retaliation” for him handing in his notice and “not a result of the much earlier incident”.A spokesman for Lexlaw confirmed “inappropriate workplace activities” had taken place last year involving a senior barrister.They declined to comment further other than to say: “The activities that took place are as unacceptable in our workplace as they would no doubt be in any workplace.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It stated: “This is very effective.

But then I couldn’t have imagined the abuse the elephants suffer.“Now I know, and I think everyone else needs to see this and know too.”Arthur is one of 50 elephants kept in pain and terror at an “elephant temple” in Guruvayur, in Kerala, South India.It is a popular destination for thousands of the more than 850,000 Brits who visit India each year.Evanna, who is also an avid animal rights campaigner, continued: “I have been so shocked. We saw one elephant chained up — it couldn’t move at all.“It had a stick resting on its head so if it moved the stick would fall. If it did the trainer would give it a beating.“I asked the man standing there how long the elephant might have been there, and he told me probably his whole life. That is unfathomable.”India’s elephants are snatched from their mothers in the wild when they are babies and taken to secret “training camps”. Here they are beaten, starved and tortured into complete submission in a process called “pajan”.The first step is for the beasts to be forced into a kraal or “crushing cage”.This is a wooden structure designed to keep the elephant so tightly caged it cannot move — not even to turn around, nod its head or sit down.Trainers then starve the animal and keep it awake for days on end.Exhausted and on the brink of death, the elephants are then beaten with wooden weapons, specially designed to inflict as much pain as possible.This happens every day for at least six months, but can go on for years.When finally their spirit is so broken that they let their trainers ride them, they are deemed safe enough to be rented out or sold to tourist attractions and temples across India.Nearly half of the elephants die from this abuse, and of those who survive to be sold, another ten per cent die within a year due to stress. But their suffering is a tourism goldmine.Elephants can be rented out for rides, festivals or to temples for anything from £34 to £1,600 a day — in a country where the average labourer only makes £10 a day.While much of the most violent training takes place out of sight of tourists, the brutal reality of elephants’ lives is far from hidden.When we arrive at Kerala’s Kochi airport a giant elephant statue welcomes us, complete with chains around its feet.Within half an hour of being on the road we are overtaken on a motorway by a rusty truck carrying an elephant tied down by chains, wires and rope. Seconds later another passes.They are being transported from camps across the country to one of India’s famous elephant festivals, Thrissur Pooram, in Thrissur, Kerala.We are on our way to the same event, where we find more than 90 elephants have been shipped in. They are dressed up and forced to stand in front of huge crowds while cannons fire and drums are banged for hours.With the help of our guide we gain access to a backstage holding pen for the animals, out of sight of visitors.In this dark, corrugated-iron structure the animals are heavily chained, unable to move or access water. Each has at least one trainer guarding it with sticks, and every animal looks terrified.Many have gaping wounds on their feet and backs — not a problem for the trainers who simply paint the wounds grey to cover up the injuries from the tourists.In order to discover more about what these beasts have been through, Evanna and I travel two hours north into deep forest to the village of Kodanad, where our guide tells us there is a training camp. After some careful negotiations with guards we manage to enter, posing as tourists who “just want to see the elephants”. Inside we see the terrible, stark reality of their lives.Chained to tree stumps, they are in appalling condition.Autoor is 16 years old and we find her swaying her head from side to side, over and over again — a sign of huge distress.It is impossible not to want to comfort her, but before we get too close a trainer approaches and whacks her with a stick, she immediately stops swaying, instead standing completely still.We quickly move on until we find a clearing in the forest. It is here we find the saddest of sights — a lone elephant locked in a crushing cage.The wooden cell stands so tall at first it is almost impossible to make out the elephant stuck inside.Then the trainers arrive and begin hitting and stabbing the elephant through the cage with large sticks.It is too much to bear and, with our guide getting increasingly anxious about our pictures being discovered, we quickly leave.I ask our guide, is this how all elephants are trained, or are some tamed more humanely?His response is chilling: “This is every single tourist elephant’s fate. The only reason they obey is with fear. They have been broken.”Duncan McNair, founder of charity Save The Asian Elephants (STAE), who was on the undercover trip to India, is campaigning for a law banning UK holiday firms and tour companies advertising trips for these sorts of encounters with animals.He says: “Elephants are some of the most intelligent, emotional creatures in the world and the abuse they suffer is unimaginable.“Those horrors ensure the rest of their life is lived in fear.“I’m confident that if any tourist ever saw this, or even a small aspect of it, they would be appalled.”With tears in her eyes, Evanna said: “When people who have ridden elephants in the past or visited these places see this article, I don’t want them to feel guilty — they were misled by the irresponsible tourist industry.“What we need to do is to put that guilt into action and not visit these places in future.“I’d read a lot about the abuse elephants suffer but seeing it up close has given me the ability to speak from my heart and tell others that we can make a change by not spending our money and posting these tourist images.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He added: “This my Lords is a wrecker’s amendment.

But yesterday he ascended to one of the great offices of state.What makes Javid’s appointment so remarkable is that Theresa May cares about the Home Office — which she was in charge of for six years — more than any other department and she and Javid have not seen eye to eye over the years.If the Prime Minister was at the peak of her powers, he would not be the new Home Secretary.When Theresa May made Amber Rudd Home Secretary, it was on the implicit understanding that she would continue her legacy at the Home Office.Rudd accepted this trade — and swallowed her own doubts about several of Mrs May’s policies.This approach was, ultimately, what did for her. Javid, a far more independent-minded politician, will not repeat that mistake.Indeed, no senior member of the Cabinet offered the job would now be prepared to make the trade that Rudd did back in 2016.Mrs May simply isn’t powerful enough to demand that kind of loyalty any more. Rudd’s departure exposes Mrs May in two ways.First, the firebreak between her and the Windrush scandal has been removed. Any further revelations about what has gone wrong will end up on the Prime Minister’s doorstep.Second, it has shown how Mrs May now has to reach out in even her most senior Cabinet appointments, promoting those who have clashed with her in the past.When the political Cabinet met for the first time after Mrs May’s Election disaster last year, Javid was ABSOLUTELY BRUTAL in setting out what was wrong with the way she and her team had run Downing Street.The Prime Minister was left in no doubt as to Javid’s frustration with how her team had undermined him.But the reason why he was briefed against is fascinating, given his new job.Javid’s offence was not to kowtow to Mrs May.At the height of the May ascendancy, when she was the most popular Prime Minister since polling records began, most ministers went along with whatever she wanted, whether they agreed with it or not. Javid did not.He argued ferociously against what he saw as her anti-business proposals.He fought particularly hard against her desire for tests for foreign takeovers of British companies.In meetings he sided with Chancellor Philip Hammond in arguing that Britain shouldn’t become like France, a country where the government stopped foreigners buying a yoghurt-making company on national interest grounds.Mrs May now finds herself presiding over a Cabinet where ministers know they can push their own positions with little consequence.So Jeremy Hunt and Gavin Williamson have both campaigned publicly for more money for health and defence respectively.Meanwhile, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson has openly set out the kind of Brexit he wants, unafraid to get ahead of the Prime Minister’s position.David Davis, the Brexit Secretary, is now letting it be known what the differences are between his approach and that of the Prime Minister’s chief adviser on the negotiations, Olly Robbins.If Javid was prepared to stand up to Mrs May at the height of her powers, what will he do now?He certainly won’t be her patsy at the Home Office. He’ll be determined to put his own stamp on the department.A more ruthless politician than Amber Rudd, he won’t feel any compunction about breaking from the Prime Minister’s Home Office legacy where necessary.Why, then, has Mrs May appointed him?Well, I understand her initial instinct was to consider Karen Bradley, the Northern Ireland Secretary, for the job.Bradley is a May loyalist: She was one of her junior ministers at the Home Office, an enthusiastic backer of her leadership bid and is her most reliable ally in the Brexit inner Cabinet.However, senior figures at No10 persuaded the Prime Minister that appointing Bradley would look like she was circling the wagons — that it would project an image of weakness, not strength.With a growing feeling among the Cabinet that Mrs May has retreated into the Downing Street bunker, listening more and more to officials such as Olly Robbins and less and less to ministers, appointing a cipher to be Home Secretary would have caused dangerous levels of anger and resentment. Mrs May, to her credit, listened and the decision to appoint Javid was made.His instincts on immigration are different from Mrs May’s.He doesn’t regard it as a numbers game and is one of the Cabinet ministers most privately sceptical of the PM’s aim to reduce immigration to the tens of thousands.If Mrs May was in a stronger position, she would have appointed someone more prepared to defer to her views on this subject than him.Javid will be his own man as Home Secretary, not the Prime Minister’s. Mrs May, who knows the Home Office so well, will find that hard to take at times.But his appointment is a recognition that she isn’t any more in a position to dictate to her senior ministers.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I want to die. It’s not sad particularly. What is sad is if one is prevented.“If one chooses to kill oneself, then that should be fair enough. I don’t think anyone else should interfere.”Dr Goodall told Seven News: My feeling is that an old person like myself should have full citizenship rights including the right of assisted suicide.Controversial euthanasia campaigner Philip Nitschke said his organisation, Exit International, was assisting Professor Goodall to travel business class to the clinic.Dr Goodall has been a member of the group for almost 20 years and will fly out of Perth on Wednesday.One of the organisations nurses, Carol O’Neil, will accompany him to the Life Circle in Basel, Switzerland, which has been able to fast track him.Exit International started a GoFundMe campaign, which had raised more than $18,5000 by Tuesday.Dr Nitschke, who burnt his practising certificate in 2015 to protest against Medical Board conditions on his registration, said it was a shame Dr Goodall had to undertake an arduous trip to have a peaceful death at the time of his choosing.The centenarian made international headlines in 2016 when his university reversed a decision to kick him out of his office on campus amid concerns his long public transport commute was a health risk.Considered a leading botanist and ecologist, Prof Goodall was born in Edmonton, London, in 1914.He received his PhD from the Imperial College of Science and Technology in the capital in 1941 before emigrating to Australia in 1948, where took up a post at the University of Melbourne.David was awarded a Doctor of Science from Melbourne University as well as an honorary doctorate from the Università degli Studí di Trieste  in Italy.

Heres everything you need to know about him.Cardinal George Pell was born in Ballarat, Australia, on June 8, 1941, to George Arthur and Margaret Lillian Pell and his mother was a devout catholic.In his early life he was a keen American Football player, including being signed to Richmond Football Club - however, he says he realised he had an unavoidable calling to become a priest.In 1960 he started his studies to become a Catholic priest at Corpus Christi College in Werribee and in 1963 he was assigned to continue his studies at the Pontifical Urban University in Rome.He was ordained on August 15, 1966, and went on to continue his studies at Pontificia Universtia Urbaniana and later at the University of Oxford.In 1971 he returned to his native Australia where he started as an assistant priest in Swan Hill before rising to be an auxiliary bishop of Melbourne in March 1987, Archbishop of Melbourn in 1996 and then Archbishop of Sydney in 2002.He was one of the electors for Pope Benedict XVI in 2005 and for Pope Francis in 2013 and was appointed to be one of the eight members who advise the Pope on how to reform the Catholic church.In February 2014 he rose to become the first holder of the newly created Secretariat for the Economy - this role made him responsible for the annual budget of the Holy See and the Vatican.He issued his first handbook on financial management policies in November 2014 which came into effect the following January.However, in 2015 Cardinal Francesco Coccoalmerio questioned the scope of authority granted to Pell through his new position.Later the same year Cardinal Pells health was poor enough that he was deemed unfit for air travel, meaning he had to give evidence at the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse and he testified in 2016 via a video link.Cardinal Pell is the most senior member of Australian clergy and is often regarded as the third-ranked official in the catholic church.In 2017 Cardinal Pell was accused of historic child sexual abuse and was charged in June for multiple complaints against him.He is now taking a year-long leave of absence to fight the charges against him in his own country.Cardinal Pell, 76, was accused in 2017 of historic child sexual abuse and over 30 people testified in a preliminary court hearing.In an opening hearing the court heard that one alleged incident took place at Melbourne Cathedral in the 1990s, when the cleric was Archbishop of Melbourne.Another allegation heard in court related to a local swimming pool in Ballarat during the 1970s when Cardinal Pell was a junior priest.All other sexual assault allegations ran from the 1970s to the 1980s.However, due to the way sexual assault cases are handled in Victoria, Australia, many of the court sessions were closed to the public.Cardinal Pell has continually denied all the charges against him, and said last year: I am innocent of these charges, they are false. The whole idea of sexual abuse is abhorrent to me.His lawyer, Robert Richer QC, told a previous hearing that the allegations were impossible and described the complainants as unreliable and argued that Cardinal Pell was being targeted because of his role as Australias most senior catholic figure.On May 1 it was deemed that half the charges against the Cardinal had sufficient evidence to be put to trial against the priest.Cardinal Pell will attend a hearing at county court for the first time on May 2 for a directions hearing on the remaining charges.At the moment the details of the charges against him are not known, but he is believed to be facing at least one charge after 15 others against him were dismissed.The cleric will face trial before a jury - however, a date for the full trial has not been set yet but it is expected to be in several months at the County Court of Victoria.If Cardinal Pell is found guilty of child abuse he may face a prison sentence of up to 25 years  in Australia, depending on the nature of the charges.The Vatican may choose to defrock Cardinal Pell if the allegations he is charged with are serious - which is considered to be the harshest penalty the Catholic Church can issue.Defrocking means a cardinal is not allowed to carry out any clerical duties, even in private.However the church may decided to sanction him if he is found guilty with a lesser punishment.These sanctions include a lifetime of prayer or prohibiting priests from celebrating mass in public.The accusations against Cardinal Pell are the latest in a string of child sexual abuse scandals to rock the catholic church in recent years.Since the 2002 investigation by the Boston Globe there has been widespread media coverage of priests across the globe being accused of molesting children as young as 3 years old.Between 2001 and 2010 the Holy See - the governing body of the catholic church - considered sexual abuse allegations involving around 3,000 priests which dated as far back as 50 years.The scandal exposed the church as having long-term issues with worldwide patterns of systematic abuse.Australia was rocked by the abuse revealed within the Catholic Church in the country and were the first to publicly address the mismanagement of child abuse in 1996.In 2013 the government established a Royal Commission into the Institutionalised Response to Child Sexual Abuse to investigate the abuse in Australia which found offending priests were regularly moved from parish to parish.An investigation found that 7 per cent of Australian priests were accused of abusing children between 1950 and 2015.By 2014 the Vatican had defrocked 848 priests who had raped or molested children and had sanctioned another 2,572 with lesser penalties worldwide.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

That included:Ministers only lost one vote on the EU withdrawal Bill in the Commons - when 11 Tory rebels voted in favour of a change which would only allow ministers to use powerful statutory instruments to change law if Parliament voted in favour of the withdrawal deal first.Many of these amendments are tricky for the Government because it means handing over more powers to MPs and Lords to dictate our EU exit and what it will look like.Last nights changes - if they are accepted by MPs - would give MPs the power to stop the UK from leaving without a deal, and could keep us in altogether.It would mean that Parliament has the power to decide what happens if MPs turn down the final arrangement that David Davis and Michel Barnier strike.Critics say this is ignoring the will of the 17 million Brits who voted for Brexit.Ministers said it could even risk weakening the UKs hand in negotiations - because the EU know that they will have to get MPs to pass it at the end of the day. Lords have another day to debate amendments to the EU Withdrawal Bill tomorrow, on May 2.Then it will return to the Commons for MPs to consider the changes.But the Government are sure to try and overturn them, and it could result in a game of ping pong between the two Houses as t hey fight over the wording.When it has been agreed by both the Commons and the Lords, its ready for Royal Assent and will officially become law when we quit the EU.But if they dont agree on it, the Bill could fail totally.In that case, the Commons could use an Act of Parliament to pass the Bill without the consent of the Lords.Only seven have become law under this procedure - and a further three were set to do so but the Lords eventually caved in.Ministers could also try invoke the Salisbury Convention - which ensures that Government Bills can get through the Lords when they have no majority there - because it was a promise mentioned in an election manifesto. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Ms Judd held firm, saying, No, when I win. And then she fled the scene.Judd said the first time she became aware of why Sir Peter failed to cast her was when he spoke about the decision last year as dozens of women publicly accused Weinstein of sexual harassment and assault.Weinstein, 66, is being investigated by police in London, New York and Los Angeles. He has apologised for his past behaviour but denies all allegations of non-consensual sex.A spokeswoman for Weinstein refuted the claims of Judd and Sir Peter and said the shamed producer would launch a vigorous defence.The most basic investigation of the facts will reveal that Mr Weinstein neither defamed Ms Judd nor ever interfered with Ms Judds career, and instead not only championed her work but also repeatedly approved her casting for two of his movies over the next decade, she said.After the lawsuit was filed in Los Angeles on Monday, Judd said she would donate any damages won to the Times Up initiative and its legal defence fund to help women fight sexual harassment.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

My skin peels off and, at times, there is bleeding.“All I can do is watch children my age play and enjoy their life.”Vedika, from Indore in India, spends her time alone studying, painting and watching TV as she doesn’t have any friends.Her family have taken her to several doctors but none have been able to provide her with a cure.She has to cover herself in moisturiser several times a day to stop her skin from cracking, flaking and bleeding.Vedika’s older sister Sunidhi, 20, also suffers from the condition and is so self-conscious about her looks she doesn’t go outside.Their aunts also suffer from the genetic condition.“My elder daughter who also has the same skin disorder keeps herself confined in her room,” said mum Madhuri Gupta.“She is now a grown woman conscious about her looks and appearance. Hence, she avoids socialising, interacting with people or even coming in front of the camera.”Desperate for a cure the sisters turned to alternative treatments, which only made their skin worse.Then they heard about the plight of Shalini Yadav, an Indian teenager whose lamellar ichthyosis was cured by treatment in Spain.They are now crowdfunding for the same medication, which doctors say will be available in India.“All I want is that my daughters dont suffer the same way like me in the future, giving birth to babies with similar disorders, there should be a treatment,” Madhuri said.“At home, I keep my daughters in comfort, but outside the struggle that they face, I cannot do anything about it.”Vedika hopes the new treatment will change her life.“Everyone has treated me equally, but yes when I speak to some stranger then I feel a little uncomfortable,” she said.“If I get help like Shalini got, I can also lead a life of dignity.“If there is any treatment that helps improve my skin condition by 50 per cent, it will give my confidence a boost.”You can donate to their cause at their fundraising page here.The skin cells are produced at a normal rate, but they do not separate normally at the surface of the outermost layer of skin and are not shed as quickly as they should be.The result of this retention is the formation of scales.Symptoms:Signs of the condition will be present at birth.Babies are often covered with a clean membrane and have dark red, tight skin.Often the eyelids and lips are forced open by the tightness.Babies also can experience problems with temperature regulation, water loss and secondary infections.People with lamellar ichthyosis often have trouble closing their eyes completely because of the tightness of the skin around the eyes and eyelids.In some cases, the skin around the eyes pulls so tightly it causes they eyelids to turn outward exposing the inner red lid and causing continuous irritation.The dry skin builds up so much that suffers shed skin on a daily basis.Treatment:Lamellar ichthyosis is treated topically with skin barrier repair formulas containing ceramides or cholesterol, moisturizers with petrolatum or lanolin.Severe lamellar ichthyosis can be treated systemically with oral synthetic retinoids.Retinoids are only used in severe cases of lamellar ichthyosis due to their known bone toxicity and other complications.There is no known cure, but several clinical studies are active around the world."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/nintchdbpict0004025960991.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"tory power pose stance sajid javid theresa may george osborne","story":"New home secretary Sajid Javid is the latest to be mocked for striking the Tory power pose. Heres what you need to know.The power stance is a pose adopted by the Tories standing with legs apart and arms at their side.A number of senior Conservative politicians have chosen this particularly bizarre way to stand.The strange cowboy pose has also been dubbed the Beyoncé after the Single Ladies singers famous dance moves.The origin of the stance in politics is thought to be a scientific study in 2010 that claimed those standing like that were projecting power.But lead author Professor Dana Carney of California University has since admitted it does not work.She said the “evidence has been mounting” suggesting there is unlikely to be an effect “on internal or psychological outcomes”Adding: “As such, I do not believe ‘power pose’ effects are real.” George Osborne was first to adpot the pose at the Tory party conference in Manchester in 2015 when he appeared on stage with his legs wide apart.Body language experts said the then Chancellor could have been trying to take up space to appear strong.But his advisers must have forgotten to tell him not to turn his feet inwards, so he ended up looking like a child on a skiiing lesson.Despite widespread ridicule of Mr Osbornes stance, Theresa May - then Home Secretary - copied the pose at the same conference.And the following year PM David Cameron was pictured with legs spread like John Wayne during a Sky News debate on Brexit. The much-mocked Tory power stance was thought to have been put to bed after it had not been seen for nearly two years.But Mr Javid resurrected it when he posed for the press on his first day in charge at the Home Office.The new Home Secretary spread his legs way too far apart with his arms straight by his sides - apparently trying to look powerful.But everyone else thought he looked silly and the inevitable Twitter jokes rolled in.Mr Javid was compared to Cristiano Ronaldo lining up to take a free kick, and to Hugh Lauries foppish Prince Regent performing the “heroic stance” in BBC sitcom Blackadder.Others said he looked like guitar-thrashing rockers Status Quo, while one meme placed him in the line-up of newly reformed Abba.And over a montage of four Tories adopting the pose, Twitter user Dean Burnett joked: Want to feel old? This is what the Power Rangers look like now.Mr Javid, 48, the first non-white home secretary, was appointed after Amber Rudd quit over the Windrush scandal.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Do you worry about the future? You wouldnt want to go through this.Charlies mum Connie replied: Were not really thinking about having a child right now.All of this is really important to us - we cant bring Charlie back, but we can try to help people in the future, or other people here now, thats our focus right now.Well think about it a bit further down the line - we cant wait til I get too old obviously.Partner Chris added: We havent had time to think about it.The couple, who are also trying to change the way hospitals and families interact when making decisions about the future of children, said they were focusing on Charlies Law.Charlies parents say the proposed law would address problems around the “best interests” test used by courts to decide what is best for the child rather than the parents.It would also increase transparency so that cases can be dealt with before they reach the courts.Speaking this morning, Chris Gard said his heart went out to the family of Alfie Evans, saying: No one will be in more pain than they are in now.From a personal experience, obviously I do this day, nine months later, I can get very angry at the world and at life.I can get extremely upset - but my overwhelming feeling, and I imagine Tom feels it as well, is pride.Charlie was our little boy.He touched the hearts of people around the world, and so did Alfie.Alfies parents are also campaigning to have a change made to the law after losing their little boy.Alfies Law would give parents more power over choosing care for their sick children.Currently, if a public body considers that a parents choices risk harming a child, it can challenge them in court.Doctors and social workers can ask a judge for an order to override the legal state of parental responsibility."},{"url":null,"title":"mcdonalds monopoly man jumps over counter","story":"In the footage, the man can be seen grabbing the roll of vouchers before bolting from the London branch.The annual competition run by the fast food chain from March 21 to May 1 allows customers to receive a Double or Triple Game Piece which consists of two or three stickers, some of which are an online game sticker while others are an instant win like free food or a drink.Big prizes from the game also include £100K in cash, a Mini Cooper, a trip to Universal Florida, an XBox One games console amongst other items.While its unclear when it was filmed, the shameless thief jumps the counter with his hood pulled up and grabs the roll -
