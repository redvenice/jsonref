Trump has been highly critical of Bezos and the Post\u0027s coverage of the White House. The Bezos affair became public when the Enquirer published a January 9 story about his relationship with Sanchez, a former TV anchor who is also married. Bezos then hired a team of private investigators to find out how the tabloid got the texts and photos the two exchanged.Several days ago, someone at AMI told Bezos\u0027 team that the company\u0027s CEO David Pecker was \u0027apoplectic\u0027 about the investigation, Bezos said.

The subject of books, documentaries and endless tributes, he is almost bigger in death than he was in life.As GQ Editor Dylan Jones, the author of one of these books, says, Bowie is a ‘continually expanding balloon that refuses to burst’.All of which makes the recollection of Bowie as a middle-aged seducer of teenage groupies, shared via a podcast by comedian David Baddiel, feel wildly jarring.Baddiel said last weekend that he was told the story by one of his female friends about a ‘romance’ with Bowie while the singer and Mick Jagger were holidaying in Mustique. He said: ‘This woman was 16 at the time and Bowie would have been in his 40s.She and her best friend had one of many drinking nights with Bowie and ended up back at their shack with David.‘David was clearly keen on a threesome and had put some work in to create it. The way he did this, according to her, was to take all his clothes off and put Let’s Dance on cassette and dance naked.‘It worked for David as both the girls got naked. There were sexual goings-on but she didn’t sleep with David. I said: “Why on earth would you not want to lose your virginity to David Bowie?” She replied: “It wouldn’t mean anything to him. I didn’t want to do that for him, just one night.”          Bowie was said to have slept with a 16-year-old girl while on holiday in the Caribbean island of Mustique‘Instead she went outside. David did s*** the friend, then came out and tried to make it all right with her because she was a bit p***** off.’Bowie fans already knew about the wild times in the early Seventies — to be clear, it’s not illegal to sleep with a 16-year-old — but was he really in the habit of seducing teenagers when he was middle aged?It appears so. Put simply, Bowie was described by his friends as a ‘sex addict’ with a catalogue of lovers old and young, male and female, and a tremendous appetite for all.This week, the Mail has spoken to two women who were under the age of consent when they slept with Bowie. Lori Mattix, who had a liaison with him aged 15, explained: ‘I never thought of David Bowie as a paedophile. He would f**k anything. If he liked it he would f**k it.’          Lori Mattix, who had a liaison with him aged 15Early girlfriend Dana Gillespie concurred, telling me: ‘As far as sex went, if it moved, he was there. Man, woman, old or young. Times have changed and it doesn’t always look so good in black and white now, but in those days we were just having fun there were no rules.’It’s a matter of record that he dallied with famous women including Charlie Chaplin’s widow Oona, 22 years older, and actress Bette Midler, plus Bianca Jagger, Susan Sarandon and Lulu.There were always rumours of some kind of liaison with his friend and friendly rival Mick Jagger, and he also had affairs with male mime artist Lindsay Kemp and Natasha Korniloff, Kemp’s costume designer — at the same time. Finding out he was two-timing them, both attempted suicide.Sometimes, having sex was a way of gain an advantage. Former wife Angie said: ‘Using sex was what David did. He used sex to endear himself to people, so they loved him and did things for him and worked hard to promote him. It was the pure selfishness of wanting to succeed.’But at other times, his promiscuity seemed more simply a habit which he enjoyed too much to consider amending.As he said in a 1997 radio interview: ‘I was hitting on everybody. I had a wonderfully irresponsible promiscuous time.’The sexual free-for-all characterised his open marriage to Angie, whom he wed in 1970. She wrote in her autobiography: ‘David made a virtual religion of slipping the lance of love into almost everyone around him.’ Some lovers they shared, others they did not. By his 1972 tour of America he was with Cyrinda Foxe, a 19-year-old model. She recalled that he sent for her while he was having sex with a groupie because he needed someone to talk to. Former assistant Tony Zanetta said David had sex with Puerto Rican transsexuals while in New York.          Bowie was described by his friends as a ‘sex addict’ with a catalogue of lovers old and youngFrom Abba to Zappa: Music legends such as Bjorn Ulvaeus,...EXCLUSIVE: Rock stars at home: Inside peek at Bob Dylan\u0027s...\u0027I could feel its muscles pulsating\u0027: Teen anglers wrangle a...Share this articleBack in his home in Chelsea, the focal point was a 4ft deep bed known as the Pit, where he and Angie would host orgies.Dana Gillespie was a friend of both David and Angie at this time.She had met David after watching him perform at the Marquee in Soho in 1964.He came onstage in thigh-length, fringed suede boots, with long hair. After the set he came up behind her and brushed her hair, and then asked if he could come home with her (she later worked out that this was because he was going to miss the last train back to Bromley.)They made love. She was 14, and he was 17.Dana told me: ‘I have never thought of David as someone who liked young girls in particular. He liked bright women.‘It has been suggested to me that him sleeping with me when I was 14 was “statutory rape” but I have said to writers, look, you can’t put that in because, yes, I was young but we were just having fun.‘He would play my guitar and listen to my songs, and play me his. I remember he once phoned me up to tell me that he had just written Space Oddity. He wrote the song Andy Warhol for me.‘We were friends for the first ten years of his career, I didn’t see him really after 1975. I wouldn’t call myself a girlfriend, we did all of that and got it out of our system.‘It was not the kind of relationship where I would ever have wanted to be Mrs Bowie.‘When I was 15 or 16 I would hear from him every three or four months. He would come round and I would cook him brown rice and vegetables because he wasn’t eating properly. I remember once he came round and said that his heart was a bit broken because he had trouble with Hermione (Farthingale, his ballet dancer girlfriend.)‘He did not talk about the emotional stuff, I guess you could say that he was a rather cold character because everything came second to ambition.’As David became more famous, he caught the attention of the notorious ‘baby groupies’ who were on the scene in Los Angeles at the time.Led by Californian wild child Sable Starr, who had a romance with Iggy Pop when she was 13, the girls competed to bed visiting British stars.One of their number was Lori Maddox, also known as Lori Mattix. She was 14 when she first met Bowie at the E Club on Sunset Strip and was working as a model. He was on his Spiders From Mars tour of 1972.She turned him down that night, but five months later Bowie returned to LA and she was called by his bodyguard, Stuey.She and friend Sable Starr went for dinner with Bowie at the Rainbow Bar \u0026amp Grill, and then back to his suite at the Beverly Hilton. Lori recalls that Bowie walked her through to the bathroom, stripped off his kimono and climbed into the tub with her. Then she says, he took her virginity. Later she had her first threesome, with Bowie and Sable (who died aged only 51). Lori was 15.Now she reflects on the episode with satisfaction. She said this week: ‘I don’t even think he thought about my age, he was so anti-social and breaking boundaries everywhere.‘I don’t think it was a thought for him and I don’t think he was hanging out with a lot of underage people. We were young then and he was 25, that is still young as well.‘The rockers must have known we were underage girls, maybe that was part of it for them, the innocence, I don’t know.    David Bowie married supermodel Iman in a private ceremony in Switzerland back in 1992‘David was so gentle and kind with me when we were together. It could have been some creepy guy who threw me on the bed and like raped me. It was a different thing, he took me by the hand and was a gentleman. He was a fascinating creature. Was I supposed to do it with some Algebra teacher in the back of his van? I was the last of the virgins at my school, too.‘Do I regret it? No, life goes on. I am 60 years old and it was 45 years ago. People should get over it. You go through a journey in life, I don’t believe in mistakes, I believe there is a destiny for everybody.‘David was not a star yet so he did not take advantage of any celebrity with me. I remained friends with him throughout his rise to fame and he would always check in with me to see how I was doing in my life. We were friends.‘I was a teen model. David was very androgynous and he liked to be around cool and interesting looking people. It was all pure fun. It was a different time in rock ’n’ roll. We did not have internet or cell phones or anything like that.‘He was attracted to that glam rock scene out here where we were all cheating and being unacceptable. It was all good, pure fun. I do not feel like I was taken advantage of, not at all. We were all just hanging out.’ She added: ‘He was fascinating for anybody. David was an anomaly, he was just not normal. He had carrot red hair, no eyebrows, he was magnificently beautiful, the skin, the cheekbones, those two different coloured eyes.

In some cases, former staff who signed NDAs after making allegations were paid more than £1 million.The tycoon faced claims yesterday that he groped women, put one senior executive in a headlock and told a black man that he was \u0027still throwing spears in the jungle\u0027.

She is ultra cautious, is well aware that the world has their eyes on her and that is just how she likes it. \u0027This is not a spontaneous or intellectually creative woman but a consummate performer and strategist.\u0027There is a strong right slant and her letters have often been retraced. There is enormous emotion as well as energy but she is both self aware and self orientated. \u0027However she suffers from anxiety and in this instance her usual regularity and over control of pen strokes does show some wavering and a slight uneven baseline - she is showing some wavering of self control.

It was too dangerous after my heart attacks’          Mr Markle says he only asked for help to move house and that any ‘modest’ financial gifts from Meghan were ‘greatly appreciated’          Her father says: ‘I didn’t stop answering my phone. I was in hospital with a heart attack! Meg and Harry knew what was going on’          Mr Markle comments: ‘I have no idea what this means. This is pure Harry. Americans don’t use the “rabbit hole” expression’          Meghan complains Thomas sided with her half-sister Samantha in criticising her, but he insists: ‘I never wanted Meg to suffer.’Trussell also highlighted the embellishments in Meghan\u0027s handwriting, including the strokes that sweep across the tops of words. She said: \u0027They look like little protective umbrellas, giving further credence to her deep feelings on the matter. \u0027They also reveal her vulnerability - the chink in her armour. Surely this is enough proof how much Meghan cares? It must be exhausting for her!\u0027In the letter Meghan admonishes her father, in anguished tones, for siding with her half-sister Samantha – who has attacked her in the press – while she ‘silently suffered at the hand of her vicious lies’.She goes on to complain that Mr Markle has made no attempt to contact her – and chastises him for falsely telling journalists he is the one who has been shunned – a criticism her father vehemently refutes.She also accuses her father of snubbing her and Prince Harry’s offers to help when he pulled out of attending their wedding following two heart attacks and accuses him of being ungrateful for money she has given him.The former award-winning Hollywood lighting director, who now lives in Mexico, said that he never intended to make the handwritten missive public ‘out of respect for Meghan’ – but says he has been forced to do so now because its contents have been falsely portrayed.Contrary to claims made by the Duchess’s friends, he said the letter made no attempt to heal their bitter rift. ‘I thought it would be an olive branch. Instead, it was a dagger to the heart,’ Mr Markle, 74, said last night.He dismissed suggestions he has made no attempt to patch things up since her wedding. He showed this newspaper texts which he says prove he reached out multiple times to his daughter and the son-in-law he has never met.The US magazine People claimed to ‘put the record straight’ over the Duchess’s relationship with her father and criticism of her style as a Royal.It was based on interviews with five friends – at least one of whom is thought to be one of the Duchess’s co-stars in Suits, the legal drama in which she starred for six years.The Duchess came under fire over her apparent decision to allow her confidantes to defend her in the extraordinary interview, without, it is understood, involving Kensington Palace.The palace has refused to comment on whether the magazine’s anonymous sources had co-operated at the direct request of the Duchess or with her tacit approval.          Thomas Markle says: ‘I’ve never attacked Harry. I asked him to man up’          He insists the Duchess is mistaken: ‘I have only ever spoken out in response to fake narratives and lies’          The Duchess refers to the MoS paparazzi photos story, right, but he insists he continued to reach out          In her letter to her father, the Duchess begged him to stop attacker \u0027patient, kind and understanding\u0027 Prince HarryFormer Buckingham Palace press secretary Dickie Arbiter, who worked for both Prince Charles and the late Diana, Princess of Wales, feared the decision would only exacerbate issues.He said: ‘Assuming – and as these sources are anonymous we don’t know for sure – that this was done with her agreement, it has opened a Pandora’s box. The issue with her father is an open wound and I’m not entirely sure it is the best idea to aggravate that.’Last night, Mr Markle said it was unfair for his daughter’s friends to use the media to ‘spin a line’ while he was being criticised for ‘giving a handful’ of interviews to the press. In the article last Wednesday, the Duchess’s friends said that she was devastated by his response to the letter, in which he suggested father and daughter pose for press pictures.One friend said: ‘She feels like “that’s the opposite of what I’m saying. I’m telling you that I don’t want to communicate through the media, and you’re asking me to… Did you hear anything I said?” ’Mr Markle said he had suggested the photo op as a way of showing the world they could be friends again, describing the Duchess’s reading of it as ‘tragic misunderstanding’ he wishes he could put straight. The rift between the Duchess and her father began after The Mail on Sunday revealed, just days before her wedding in May last year, that he had colluded with the paparazzi to stage a series of lucrative photo opportunities.Such was his humiliation that he offered to pull out of attending the Royal Wedding and was later prevented from going after suffering two heart attacks.Since then, he has given a series of damaging interviews in which he has spoken of his dismay at being cast adrift by his daughter and the Royal Family.Emma Bache\u0027s first book, Reading Between The Lines, is published by Quercus on the 30th of August 2018.             Thomas\u0027s Anguished Reply           The Duchess insisted she phoned him, but he had no missed calls          Mr Markle says he never attacked Harry, but feels he should have met him before the wedding          Mr Markle insists his bid to reduce press intrusion was ‘completely misinterpreted’      "},{"url":null,"title":"British spies MI6 smuggled defecting Iranian nuclear scientist UK dinghy","story":"    The nuclear scientist was originally smuggled out of Iran by Mossad before making the lengthy trip across Europe and into the UK The Iranian scientist, who has information about Iran\u0027s nuclear programme and reportedly helped plan the 2012 assassination of Tehran\u0027s top nuclear expert Mostafa Ahmadi Roshan, arrived in Lydd, Kent, with 12 other migrants  on New Year\u0027s Eve.  It is thought that MI6, which was involved in a joint operation with Mossad and America\u0027s CIA, decided on the unusual method of \u0027extraction\u0027 because they did not want Tehran to find out about British involvement because Britain is still a signatory to a nuclear deal with Iran.The plot, which was hatched in October, was complicated by President Donald Trump  ending US support for the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, which is aimed at preventing Iran from building nuclear weapons via an inspection regime and suspension of sanctions.   A source told the Sunday Express: \u0027This wasn\u0027t without its challenges.\u0027His absence was noted quickly and we were informed that a special unit of Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps had been dispatched.           A dinghy was recovered in Lydd, Kent, on New Year\u0027s Eve, with a number of suspected migrants on boardPrayers for missing Libby: Emotional moment Libby Squire\u0027s...Secrets of Meghan’s letter revealed: Note to her father...Share this article\u0027Once in France the question of how to get him into Britain remained.\u0027We couldn\u0027t simply fly him in.\u0027Though unusual, it was determined infiltrating him into a group of fellow migrants preparing to cross the Channel by boat offered one solution.\u0027MI6 interviewed the nuclear technician on Iran\u0027s nuclear plans before he was flown to America.For decades Western nations have been concerned about Iran\u0027s nuclear programme, accusing Tehran of seeking atomic weapons. Iran long has said its program is for peaceful purposes, but it faced years of crippling sanctions.The 2015 nuclear deal Iran struck with world powers, including the U.S. under President Barack Obama, was aimed at relieving those fears.Trump, who campaigned on a promise to tear up the nuclear deal, said he ultimately pulled America out of the accord over Iran\u0027s ballistic missile programme and its malign influence on the wider Middle East.Latest UK and World News, Sport and Comment | Express.co.uk"},{"url":null,"title":"Apprentice star Karren Brady refuses condemn Sir Philip Green","story":"    Baroness Brady has refused to condemn Sir Philip Green (who she is seen with) despite criticising other rich men facing similar claimsBaroness Brady has refused to condemn Sir Philip Green despite criticising other rich men facing similar allegations. The Apprentice star said she would not be resigning as chairman of Taveta Investments -

Trump has been highly critical of Bezos and the Post\u0027s coverage of the White House. The Bezos affair became public when the Enquirer published a January 9 story about his relationship with Sanchez, a former TV anchor who is also married. Bezos then hired a team of private investigators to find out how the tabloid got the texts and photos the two exchanged.Several days ago, someone at AMI told Bezos\u0027 team that the company\u0027s CEO David Pecker was \u0027apoplectic\u0027 about the investigation, Bezos said. AMI later approached Bezos\u0027 representatives with an offer.

Laura Garwood from Sheffield, a part-time university receptionist with her Eskipoo, AlfieYou can get the Irish wolfdoodle (Irish wolfhound-poodle), boodle (an English bulldog crossed with a poodle), and dalmadoodle (Dalmatian-poodle), all striking in appearance.\u0027It seems that anything goes,\u0027 says Barb Turnbull of the Doodle Trust rescue charity. \u0027People are crossing anything and everything with a poodle to create cute pups.\u0027Experts agree that if a poodle cross mates with another identical cross, or one of its parent breeds, the offspring will be the same breed as the cross.But, if a cross mates with a different purebreed — or another type of hybrid dog — then three or even four-way mixes are possible: such as the cavapoochon, a Cavalier King Charles iel-poodle-bichon frise cross.Wally\u0027s wonder-dogBreeder Wally Conron started the craze for poodle crosses in 1988 while working at the Royal Guide Dog Association Of Australia.Asked to come up with a suitable dog for a short-sighted wife and a husband allergic to animal hair, he bred a Labrador (a reliable guide dog) with a poodle (which doesn\u0027t shed its hair) and called the offspring a \u0027labradoodle\u0027.

At the top end is the whoodle, a wheaten terrier-poodle cross, which can cost £5,000, then the pugapoo, a pug-poodle cross, which can set you back as much as £4,000.A \u0027poo or \u0027doodle can cost between £15 and £45 a month to insure (a Yorkshire terrier costs around £10 a month), totalling up to £540 a year.One of the familyPoodle crosses are often marketed at families. \u0027They\u0027re intelligent, boisterous and tend to have good temperaments, making them easy to train,\u0027 explains Marc Abraham of charity Pup Aid, which aims to combat puppy farming.Poodles are said to be the second-most intelligent dog, after border collies, while the typical mix breeds are affectionate (Maltese), sociable (Labradors) and playful (Schnauzers).The belief that they\u0027re non-shedding is a myth. \u0027A 100 per cent poodle will not shed as much as many other breeds, but as soon as you cross it with another breed you lose that advantage — possibly totally,\u0027 explains Beverley Cuddy, editor of Dogs Today magazine.          Jane Blake, 56, a retired teacher from Surrey with her dog Daisy. The pooch is a cross between a toy poodle and a goldendoodleGenetic timebombMany believe crossbreeding eliminates genetic defects, but experts are doubtful. \u0027Take a Labrador with hip problems and cross it with a poodle with bad eyesight, and you\u0027ll end up with a labradoodle that can\u0027t walk properly and can\u0027t see,\u0027 says Marc Abraham, who regularly sees poodle crosses at his Brighton surgery.Barb Turnbull of the Doodle Trust says another problem occurs when breeders mate miniature or toy poodles with larger breeds. \u0027There is no shortcut to miniaturising a breed,\u0027 she adds. \u0027Crossing a large breed with a small breed creates skeletal problems and the resulting puppies will probably end up crippled.\u0027Other issues include dogs with brains too big for their skulls, and large puppies which have to be born by Caesarean.

Then a trainee art dealer, he liked to wander around the city on foot there are stories, possibly apocryphal, of him walking as far as Brighton and Ramsgate. When photographer Niall McDiarmid found himself in south London last month, he started to wonder what Van Gogh’s life in the area might have been like and set about retracing the artist’s footsteps for a photographic series, In Search of Van Gogh. It led him to various locations around Stockwell, Brixton and Lambeth: pubs, shops, a school called Van Gogh Primary.One afternoon, the project took McDiarmid to a quiet cafe he was struck by the scene’s clashing walls, the mismatched chairs. “I’m very influenced by colour, shape and pattern,” he says. “I’m drawn to places that hark back to an earlier time, which are maybe a bit run-down.”McDiarmid’s series was inspired by the forthcoming Tate Britain show, Van Gogh and Britain, which opens on 27 March, two days before Britain is due to leave the EU. The project assumes added significance when viewed as a way of exploring being an outsider in London. “It reminded me of coming to London for the first time, from a very small village in Scotland, when I was about the same age as him,” says McDiarmid. “From what I read it was a happy time for him he probably wasn’t burdened by the things that later in life broke him a little bit.”“Maybe,” says McDiarmid in the Instagram caption for this image, “if Vincent had his time again, he would have stayed in Stockwell, opened a little greasy spoon and called it Cafe Van Gogh.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/29b0c31b01d11a6de77e971d48d4c9e9a26951b2/0_0_5600_3368/master/5600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b5275f48cade177de2c7e4510dfd8dd0","title":"sydney opera house the designs that didnt make it in pictures","story":"In 1956, the New South Wales premier Joseph Cahill announced a competition – open to anyone – to design a national opera house at Bennelong Point in Sydney.

The deadline for first-round bids was 1 February, a week before Ashley entered the fray.Administrators at KPMG, which is running the company, has closed 71 of Patisserie Valerie’s nearly 200 stores and concessions, as it seeks a buyer for the company. Dozens of bids were received, either for the whole company or some of its stores. Around 900 jobs have been lost, with another 2,800 at risk if a buyer can’t be found.Several parties are understood to be carrying out due diligence before submitting final-round bids to KPMG, but it is not clear when the bidding process will be concluded.Coffee chain Costa, which is now owned by Coca-Cola, and a number of other parties are thought to have tabled offers for a parcel of stores but it is not clear if any parties want Patisserie Valerie as a going concern.Patisserie Valerie blamed its financial plight on “very significant manipulation” of its balance sheet and “extensive” misstatement of its accounts. It suspended finance chief Chris Marsh, who subsequently resigned after being arrested and bailed by police.The company was valued at £450m before the black hole was discovered. Its collapse into administration has wiped out shareholders, including chairman Luke Johnson."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2ead1d6402c2c9a2f09172b58fdcb7e44dce780a/0_291_4368_2621/master/4368.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2310d79c97a4ee229f98f394324b22bd","title":"did you work for a uk high street chain that has closed","story":"For an upcoming project, we would like to hear from former workers of chain shops that shut about how it affected their livesWith thousands of high street shops closing over the last decade, communities have been rightly concerned about the decline and what the future holds.If you worked for a high street chain that shut down, we’d like to hear from you.

But a shortage of English teachers has gone under the radar. Although last year’s target for new trainees was met, in the two previous years it was missed. English used to be among the most popular subjects, both to teach and to learn. Lessons had a reputation for being creative, thought-provoking – and even fun. Philip Pullman, David Almond and Joanne Harris were all teachers before they became authors. But dramatic reductions in the number of A-level entries and applications to study English at university suggest that some of the enthusiasm long associated with English has drained away.As someone who took only humanities subjects from age 16 and sometimes regrets this, I am sympathetic to the idea that students, especially girls, should be encouraged to stick with what does not necessarily come as naturally as studying one’s native language. I think a broader curriculum for 16 to 18 year olds would be beneficial, as would a stronger commitment to foreign languages.That said, I think the decline of English – which I take to encompass all literature (Irish, Nigerian, American as well as British) written in it – is a cause for concern, and not just because it threatens the supply of school teachers. I chose English because the way literary forms could be used to convey ideas and feelings interested me more than anything else. The things I read at school – Wilfred Owen’s shattering war poems, DH Lawrence’s imagistic stories, Shakespeare’s king of self-pity, Richard II – made deep impressions on me. So did my later encounters with modernism: James Joyce, Virginia Woolf, the facsimile edition of TS Eliot’s manuscript for The Waste Land, with all its crossings-out and scribbled amendments, in the university library.It’s true that the route through such activities to the workplace is not obvious. But Alex Thomson of the University English association believes student debt and “propaganda about Stem being the route to a high-wage job” have obscured more complicated truths about the world of work. He fears that the uneven impact of such messages will result in a social narrowing, and the increased concentration of people from well-off backgrounds in humanities-linked careers in media and arts, which they already dominate.But there is another factor that he and others believe has played a bigger part in putting students off English. And that’s what is happening to the subject in schools, where spelling, punctuation and grammar (referred to by the acronym SPaG) have, under the core knowledge curriculum championed by schools minister Nick Gibb, come to dominate. Education consultant Myra Barrs is among the critics of what she calls a “new formalism”, in which content and meaning are sacrificed to a recipe-type approach (take an adverb and some wow words, add a pinch of unusual punctuation …) You don’t have to be against the traditional staples of grammar or Shakespeare to see the pitfalls of this, or the constricting effect of the enormous importance placed on GCSE grades.There is a pragmatic argument to be made, in English’s defence, about the creative industries’ contribution to the UK economy, and a case to be made for the subject as a forge for tools of critical inquiry. Despite belonging to a generation taught by literary theory to be suspicious of universalism, I also believe too in the humanistic role of literature in advancing a more expansive and democratic version of Englishness than the nativist one: a culture that is curious about different meanings, new forms and other voices as well as taking pride in its own traditions.This approach recognises in poetry, prose and drama from all times and places a means for people to communicate with each other. Right now, as we teeter on the brink of an uncertain future, there is an unanswerable case for English as one of the UK’s most valuable resources. It should be open to all young people growing up here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ac38737bfe0f23c9101769abcafc2b2d85d5d617/0_0_3400_2040/master/3400.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3ad7d16be3dd4a65a4a9cb8e87058a64","title":"the guardian view on the science of hangovers no more research needed","story":"As a recent scientific paper points out, “acute alcohol-induced hangover constitutes a significant, yet understudied, global hazard and a large burden to society”. There can be few readers wholly unaware of this, yet the authors go on to point out that acute hangover-associated symptoms give rise to “reduced productivity, impaired professional performance (eg falling asleep at work), workplace absenteeism, and academic underperformance”. Never on Mondays, of course.All these disagreeabilities are distinct from the symptoms of drunkenness, and only appear after the body’s blood alcohol concentration has dropped to zero. Even mice were found by Swiss researchers to suffer hangovers that lasted as long as 20 hours, as measured by their their decreased muscular strength and coordination while attempting to navigate a maze.The most recent research, reported in this paper, was designed to discover whether the tradition preserved in several European folkways that a hangover could be averted by drinking beer before starting in on the wine, rather than going at the evening the other way round. Healthy, enthusiastic volunteers were given lager and white wine in different order with their meals until they were thoroughly affected (participants were allowed to drop out if they felt uncomfortably drunk, or indeed if they threw up, as about one in 10 did). They drank water before sleeping and, when they woke, scored the resulting hangover. It turns out that there was no difference in the severity of suffering, whatever the order they drank the wine and beer, although the control groups who drank only wine or beer unmixed were sick at a slightly lower rate. For once, no more research is needed."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a4907fc262b4abb502ea905f0142c4bc93c065df/0_0_3035_1819/master/3035.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5202900dd48f061d49bd74a6c048ae47 700w","title":"david tennant terry pratchett podcast doctor who pc backlash interview","story":"The actor on becoming a podcaster, the ‘too PC’ Doctor Who backlash and stealing Neil Tennant’s surnameDavid Tennant, 47, was born David McDonald in West Lothian. Aged three, he told his parents he wanted to become an actor because of Doctor Who. He studied at the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama before a series of stage roles with the Royal Shakespeare Company. In 2005, he fulfilled his childhood dream when he was cast as the 10th Doctor, a role he played for five years. Subsequent screen credits have included Broadchurch, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire and Marvel’s Jessica Jones. He’s married to actor Georgia Moffett and they have four children. He has just launched a new interview podcast series, David Tennant Does a Podcast With…, featuring indepth conversations with cultural figures such as Olivia Colman and Whoopi Goldberg.You’ve described your new podcast as “slightly inexplicable”. How did it come about? It happened accidentally, starting with a conversation with my agent about my predilection for podcasts. Before I knew what was happening, I was in a production meeting, postulating who might take part. The people I asked were keen, so suddenly I had to do it. It’s been interesting to have this other life. A side-hustle. You’ve joked that maybe it’s a midlife crisis. Is it?If it is, it’s less destructive than running off with a go-go dancer or buying a sports car. I’m 50 in a handful of years, which feels like a preposterous thing to say. In my head, I’m 30 at most.Was there a particular podcast that inspired yours?Alec Baldwin’s Here’s the Thing. It’s not his day job either, yet he does it incredibly well, probably because he’s so cool and fearless. I’m neither of those things, but I liked the way he sat down, often with people he knows or has a connection to, for a rambling, freeform interview that is often very revealing.What other podcasts do you listen to?The ’s Politics Weekly is a favourite. So is Pod Save America. As the world descends into chaos, I find it useful to have some analysis. Also true crime ones such as Serial and The RFK Tapes. The great thing about podcasts is that you can curate your own radio station.Gordon Brown is your guest on an forthcoming episode. How come?I’m a lifelong Labour supporter and have known Gordon through that for years. I ran into him again at Kirkcaldy festival, asked him and I suspect he felt he couldn’t say no. I love talking to actors, but wanted other voices. This is someone who ran a country – experience doesn’t come more fascinating than that.None of it makes sense, but that seems to be the political situation across the world right now. One only hopes it is a pendulum swing that’s about to correct itself.Is it true the only advice you gave Jodie Whittaker about playing the Doctor was about the attention it brings?To certain people, you’ll always be the Doctor, which is a wonderful, humbling thing but it does mean accepting an adjustment to your life. You have to be ready for that. It’s a unique experience and there’s a very small support group who know how that feels. One would never give advice about how to play a part. The acting bit is what you go to drama school for. All you can help with is the other stuff. Jodie was such an exciting choice. I’m hugely proud of how successful she’s been.What did you think of the backlash against the last series being too PC?Is it possible to be too politically correct? What does that even mean? Inclusivity has always been one of Doctor Who’s strengths.You’re currently in HBO’s US remake of Julia Davis comedy Camping. Were you a fan of the original?I wasn’t, shamefully, but when I was offered the part, I devoured it all in one sitting and loved it. This is Lena Dunham and Jenni Konner’s take on it. I was a huge fan of theirs from Girls, so to work with them, with a flavour of Julia Davis, was fantastic.Have you ever met Neil Tennant, whose surname you borrowed for your Equity card?Never. I’ve always been a huge Pet Shop Boys fan, so I’d love to. Although I might also be embarrassed about how my 16-year-old self stole his name. Hopefully, he wouldn’t charge me some sort of back rent on it. You had to put a little list of options down on the Equity form and my first choice was actually David Brandon, after Kirk Brandon from Spear of Destiny, which would have been much better for alphabetical cast lists.Next up is Good Omens, an Amazon series based on the novel by Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman. Was that a hoot to make?Absurdly good fun. It’s totally bonkers. Because Neil Gaiman adapted it and is showrunner, the oddness isn’t diluted at all. Terry charged Neil with getting it made, almost as his deathbed wish, so it’s a real labour of love. The whole thing is dedicated to Terry’s memory. His hat was at the script read-through.You play Crowley, a demon with ginger hair and snake eyes. Was that a good look for you?I quite liked the hair. I’ve got a bit of that colouring in me, so it strangely suited me. Michael Sheen plays the angel Aziraphale, the yin to my yang. We’ve agreed that in our dotage, when we do the Good Omens theatre tour, we’ll alternate parts each night."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b666c821d9b3e1085a2e07daeeb17fdeb82a077e/0_16_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=49055b1d25590099e5a23fd7d662496f","title":"pupil strike climate change puts schools on spot","story":"Headteachers across the country will this week be faced with a tricky dilemma: should they allow their pupils to go on strike?Thousands of schoolchildren are expected to absent themselves from school on Friday to take part in a series of coordinated protests drawing attention to climate change.At a time when politicians fret that young people are failing to engage with the political process, a headteacher’s decision to take a hard line against the strikers could be counter-productive. But equally granting permission for a day off could set a dangerous precedent and lead to safeguarding issues, it is feared. Parents could be fined for taking a child out of school.One would-be striker, Anna Taylor, 17, from north London, said her school had given her “mixed messages”.“I chucked up a notice – ‘school strike in a few weeks’ – on the noticeboard in the common room and they wiped it off, said ‘you can’t actively publicise it in schools’ and ‘we’ll give you an unauthorised absence and detention if you strike’, but then they said ‘you can spread it by word of mouth and we do support your cause’.”A Department for Education spokeswoman said the decision was a matter for inidual schools. “However, we are clear that pupils can only take term-time leave in exceptional circumstances, and where this leave has been authorised by the headteacher.”Supporters of the UK Student Climate Network, which so far has pupils in about 30 towns and cities signed up to the day of action, argue that the “exceptional circumstances” excuse is applicable when it comes to Friday’s day of action.It continues: “I support her to attend the youth strike as part of active civic engagement, which is a core part of the curriculum. People under 18 years can’t vote, but with more of their life in the future, rather than the past, it’s they who are most affected by climate breakdown.”The letter is part of a cache of documents being shared with potential protesters ahead of Friday’s strike as the pupil-led grassroots movement gains momentum.Similar protests have been held in inidual UK cities and other countries, including Australia, Belgium and the Netherlands, where tens of thousands of children refused to attend school so that they could take part in rallies to raise awareness about threats to the environment from global warming. But Friday will be the first nationwide day of action.Organisers were inspired by Greta Thunberg, the 16-year-old Swedish activist who last August refused to attend school so that she could protest outside the Swedish parliament building, an action that shot her to global prominence.However, not everyone has been enthusiastic about the burgeoning movement. “The best thing you learn about going to a protest is how to join the dole queue,” Australia’s resources minister, Matt Canavan, told a radio station last November.Belgium’s environment minister, Joke Schauvliege, was recently forced to resign her position after suggesting that the strikes were being coordinated by unknown groups and were “more than spontaneous actions of solidarity”.In the UK, Greenpeace is providing help with the construction of banners, while the UK Youth Climate Coalition, a 10-year-old campaign group, is helping coordinate media coverage and offering advice behind the scenes.But both organisations were keen to stress the movement was organic and led by young people. Formed in the UK only three months ago, it has grown rapidly as its message has been shared on social media. Its website was created by two 15-year-old supporters in under a week.“The wave of student strikes demanding action on climate change has been an inspiration for us all,” said Greenpeace UK’s executive director, John Sauven. “Theresa May promised our children that they’ll inherit a healthier environment than the one we found. Those children are now taking to the streets to remind her that unless we get serious about tackling the climate emergency, her promise will be broken. At the moment she is clearly failing.”How many children will take to the streets on Friday is open to debate. More than 10,000 students skipped school to protest in Belgium. A similar number went on strike in the Netherlands.Supporters suggested they expected a turnout in the low thousands for this Friday’s protest in the UK but believed a second day of strike action – on 15 March and in coordination with similar protests in other countries – would be considerably larger as the movement took hold.“I have faith it will continue to grow throughout the year,” Taylor said. “Hopefully the government will eventually listen to us because we have the greatest stake in our future and we’re doing this because we feel let down by them and we want to make a difference before it’s too late.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b323d06c6a886808582f35dde8e029ed749bd2b7/0_0_2502_3500/master/2502.jpg?width=660\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=aa4222d7448af87131000147f332505f 1320w","title":"barry jenkins when you climb the ladder you send it back down","story":"It’s a thrilling time to be in movies, says the Oscar-winning director of If Beale Street Could Talk. He talks to playwright  Roy Williams about his sky-high hopes for the next generation“So, you saw the film?” Barry Jenkins is eager to ask the minute we are introduced. He gives good eye contact through those stylish thick-rimmed glasses – not the big-time, Oscar-winning writer-director speaking, but a nervous artist, anxious about the new work he is starting to screen. I love it, I tell him. If Beale Street Could Talk may be only Jenkins’ third feature-length film, but it has already been nominated for three Oscars (best adapted screenplay, best supporting actress, best score), just two years after his Moonlight walked away with the Academy Award for best film. A passionate film about race and love, it’s an added pleasure to see black characters of such complexity on the big screen. British film industry, kindly take note.Adapted from James Baldwin’s 1974 novel, Beale Street tells the story of a young black couple in 1970s Harlem. When Tish (KiKi Layne) becomes pregnant, they plan to marry – until her fiance Fonny (Stephan James) is set up by a racist police officer for a rape he did not commit. The film explores the different reactions of their siblings and parents, led by Regina King in a standout performance as Tish’s mother, as they fight for Fonny’s freedom.Baldwin has been dead for 30 years, but his depiction of the fight against a country’s powerful prejudice is a sad reminder that not enough has changed, that Black Lives Still Matter. Yet Jenkins turns a bleak story into a compelling romance, as the young lovers strive to be regarded as human beings. With its lingering, saturated-colour photography – the director has cited Wong Kar-Wai’s In The Mood For Love as an influence – Beale Street is one of the most visually arresting films I’ve seen.“That was kind of our intention,” says Jenkins, who also wrote the screenplay. “We thought, ‘How cool would it be, to have this absolutely ravishingly gorgeous depiction of black romance, just pure and lush and vibrant – but then really lean into the systemic injustice issues that Baldwin’s talking about – with a very angry, almost bitter voice?’”Beale Street was filmed on location in New York and the Dominican Republic – filling in for Puerto Rico, still devastated by 2017’s Hurricane Maria. It was shot on an Arri Alexa 65 camera, Jenkins tells me (he’s a little bit geeky like this: taking joy in the details of the craft), because “it is the best digital camera for portraiture”. Throughout the film, as he did in Moonlight, the director lingers over often wordless scenes between his characters, presenting them as a series of moving photographs.I tell him that if Moonlight didn’t finally kill off the ugly argument (and I have heard it, from producers and directors alike) that you can’t film black people because they’re just too dark, then Beale Street surely will. “My cinematographer is a white guy, actually,” Jenkins points out, referring to James Laxton, who also worked with him on Moonlight. “We both prioritise exactly what you’re talking about. Every day we’re on set and we’re in colour correction. And it’s always, ‘But how was the skin? What are we doing to protect the skin?’ Not even protect: ‘What are we doing to properly calibrate what we’re doing for the skin?’”While Jenkins’ film largely honours Baldwin’s novel, the director has added a new ending that follows the original – giving the audience just a glimpse of hope. Even so, he is convinced he has remained faithful to the book’s central message. Which is? “I think it would be: ‘We are not broken. You cannot break us.’ I wanted to show that, even in the most devastating circumstance, the family unit had not been broken.”He wrote the script almost simultaneously with that for Moonlight, on a trip to Europe in the summer of 2013. Jenkins bought a return ticket to Brussels, booked into an Airbnb for two weeks, and first – because adapting Baldwin looked too daunting to kick off with – started on Moonlight. “I thought, ‘I’ll just get my legs’, because I hadn’t written anything in a while. And then I’ll switch to Beale Street.” When the Moonlight script came together in 10 days, he travelled to Berlin for fresh inspiration, writing Beale Street over the next four weeks – an intensely productive period.“I’ve never had that happen again in my life. I’ve tried to replicate it, and I think the reason it worked was because, as a human being, I ceased to exist. I didn’t have any friends, I didn’t have a cell phone, I didn’t know anyone, I had no family. It was just the bartenders who were helping me, giving me caffeine or alcohol.”Jenkins came to Baldwin as an adult. “I didn’t grow up as a voracious reader. James Baldwin was recommended to me by a girlfriend, who was a little older than me, more mature, worldlier, smarter, more attractive,” he says, with a laugh. “And she, in breaking up with me, recommended – so I could grow up – that I read James Baldwin: ‘I’m done with you, but I’m going to give you a hint. You need to read James Baldwin.’ She recommended Giovanni’s Room and The Fire Next Time. That was how my love affair began.”Jenkins is currently working on another adaptation, of the Pulitzer prize-winning novel The Underground Railroad, by Colson Whitehead. It is the story of two slaves who escape southern plantations through a network of safe houses and secret tunnels to reach the northern states, where they will be free. Working with a team of screenwriters, Jenkins will direct a 10-hour TV series for Amazon.Moonlight was based on McCraney’s semi-autobiographical play In Moonlight Black Boys Look Blue, about a tough childhood with a drug-addicted mother, and a painful coming out. Both McCraney and Jenkins grew up in the predominantly black, working-class Miami neighbourhood of Liberty City, attending the same high school (Jenkins is a year older). “We never knew each other,” the director says. “This is sad to say, but I might not have been brave enough to have been Tarell’s friend when we were kids. I feel like Tarell was always proud to be who he was, and was likely ostracised for it. I was more a follower than a leader, you know, when I was that age.”Like McCraney, Jenkins’ mother was an addict, and he was raised by a family friend, his father having died when he was 12. Two years ago, the director told the : “There were seven or eight of us in a two-bed apartment. There was usually food, but sometimes not.”Which films inspired him, growing up? “I wasn’t really inspired by film,” he says, “but I admired Spike Lee’s movies because they just felt very, very, very black. I remember watching School Daze and thinking, ‘What the hell is this?’ There were colleges for black people that just black people go to? And those colleges had all this shit going on? This is so energising!“Otherwise, it was the really big Hollywood stuff – The Color Purple, Aliens, Die Hard, Coming To America. I would catch the bus to go to the AMC theatre downtown. But I never thought, ‘Hey, maybe one day I might like to do that.’ It just didn’t seem possible.”Winning an Academy Award for best picture must have felt even more farfetched. He grins when I bring up one of the most rollercoaster nights in Oscar history. How did he feel when Damien Chazelle’s widely tipped La La Land was announced the winner of the best picture Oscar in 2017, before the error was corrected?Given the #OscarsSoWhite furore of the previous year (when there was not a single actor or director of colour among 25 nominees), there must have been air punches around the globe when Moonlight belatedly scooped the prize. “I have no doubt that the OscarsSoWhite thing played a role in Moonlight’s success,” Jenkins says. “But when it becomes, ‘Oh, Moonlight only won because of OscarsSoWhite,’ I’m like, ‘Well, say a film won the top award from this critics’ body, then that same film was the highest-rated film on this website, then it goes on to have one of the 10 highest ratings on Metacritic in the history of the website – if I told you that same film won best picture, you wouldn’t question it. But if I told you a black film about a gay black boy whose mom is addicted to crack-cocaine won best picture, then you go, “Oh, it only won because of ersity,’” he laughs.A new renaissance in black film-making is declared every few years, but this time it feels there’s some truth and momentum to it. As well as Jenkins, in the US there is Ryan Coogler, who directed Black Panther and is working on a sequel Spike Lee (nominated for his first Oscar last month, for BlacKkKlansman) Training Day director Antoine Fuqua Ava DuVernay (Selma, A Wrinkle In Time) and Jordan Peele (Get Out and the upcoming Us).“I think there’s something about the present moment that is collectively inspiring,” Jenkins says. “I don’t think any one of us sees the success of another and feels anything but joy and pride. And I can see that the generation behind us, they see that, and they feed off it.He points to technology as another democratising force. “You see more people from backgrounds that are way outside the core centre, which has always been hetero white American men in the Hollywood system. You can go to any film festival in the world right now, and there are so many people just – not waiting, because waiting’s the wrong word, but who are going to get put on one way or the other. And your ass is going to get left behind if you’re not hiring these people.” Dear British film industry, again, please take note.I tell Jenkins I look forward to the day when the list of British black film-makers who have been entrusted to make hits is as long as the American one. But the director says he has always admired the European system of financing films. “Here are the funds: you don’t have to really worry about the commercial prospects because it’s not private money, it’s public money, and so it’s just about the art. Stateside, it’s almost impossible to raise the funds to make a movie like Steve McQueen’s Hunger, and to make it in that style.”Even so, I say, the US seems more awake to the talents of a generation of British actors and film-makers: Daniel Kaluuya, Letitia Wright, Amma Asante, John Boyega, Aml Ameen, Naomie Harris – all of whom have followed the likes of Idris Elba to work Stateside, and who can blame them? How many more times can they play a stabbing victim on Casualty? But Jenkins doesn’t want to overstate the opportunities the US has to offer, especially now. “We were moving in this direction where we were trying to eradicate borders, and now we’re trying to build them again,” he says. “I have to think about how we went from the election of Barack Obama to the election of a reality TV star with a heinous past. There were many millions of people who voted for this guy, and I’m trying to understand why that is. What was it about the present moment that made them feel, ‘This is a direction I don’t want the country to go in? This is the direction I want the country to go in.’ Borders and lies and fake this and xenophobic that.” He sighs.Instead, Jenkins thinks there are reasons to be positive about black British culture right now – and that a change is coming soon. He gives an example. Just over a year ago, he was in London and looking for a quiet place to write. He went to Soho House and, spotting Daniel Kaluuya in a corner, went over to say hello before starting work. “I was there writing for four or five hours, and there were all these young black men who just kept coming in and sitting down with Daniel. I recognised one of them, Kibwe Tavares, who directed Jonah, which Daniel starred in. This was at the height of Get Out and Daniel was having all these meetings with young black UK directors. And just from watching the demeanour of it, I could tell he was like, ‘What are you working on? What’s going on? How can we build?’ And so, this shit’s going to happen. It’s going to happen.”• If Beale Street Could Talk is out now.

So what were the trends? Black and floor-length, primarily. Two of the five nominees for best leading actress – Glenn Close and Melissa McCarthy – went head to toe, while Olivia Colman and Viola Davis wore black and white monochrome (Emilia Wickstead and Armani Privé, respectively). The other nominee, Lady Gaga, was absent but one likes to think she too would have got the memo. Cate Blanchett went one step further, matching her newly dyed dark hair to her Christopher Kane dress. Also in black.White was also a theme. Rising star winner, Letitia Wright, talked about “breaking barriers” in a white tuxedo by Stella McCartney. Mary J Blige wore white trousers, designed by Ralph \u0026amp Russo, while the duchess arrived late, but well put together, in an asymmetric bespoke white gown. Most prominent of all was host Joanna Lumley who also wore a white suit, echoing the uniform of “suffragette white” adopted by Democratic women in the US.Flourishes came via addendums, such as giant bows (Amy Adams’s were used to keep her burgundy Prada dress hoiked up) and a smattering of cream tulle for Rachel Weisz, and black for Margot Robbie in Chanel Couture. Some of the best dresses were strapless – see Claire Foy, Roma’s Yalitza Aparicio and Thandie Newton – proof that the most effective gowns can be the simplest ones, well executed.As for the men, they largely balanced polite traditionalism with silliness. Timothée Chalamet, an early adopter of the luxury harness, wore a silk damask jacket by Haider Ackermann, while Luke Evans went for a velvet tuxedo in green.There were moments of personal expression. Spike Lee clashed reliably with the status quo and red carpet in a purple tux and beret, while Octavia Spencer matched it in a red sequinned gown. Zawe Ashton and Regina King both wore cerise, and Ashton wore flats. Although when one of the most famous lingerie models – in this instance, Irina Shayk – wears a plain black suit, you know change is afoot.Any political discourse moved back to the films, though. In timely fashion, The Wife, a favourite to win Close the best actress award, is focused on gender imbalance. Speaking on the red carpet before the event, Close said it added to that dialogue.It’s worth remembering the red carpet is not an easy place for ongoing activism. The dress code from last year might have been the movement’s most striking example, but even by the time the Oscars had rolled around, a few weeks later, activism was absent. It’s no surprise that a year later, the sole act of dissent were the words “speak on it” written on Spike Lee’s trainers. After Liam Neeson’s comments this week, Lee said he wouldn’t cast him in a film.And then there was the weather. Compared to its west coast cousins, the Baftas are the chilliest of the season. Salma Hayek, resplendent though she was in black slender column and mesh headband, spoke for everyone when she told the assembled fans who wanted a photo: “It’s too cold!”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4e96170b1d13ac420b6640b5ff9337adf9ea246c/0_263_3123_1874/master/3123.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2d8883ce43b839df164406f2a8db8f82","title":"baftas 2019 the favourite reigns almost supreme as roma takes best picture","story":"Olivia Colman’s win for best actress is among seven gongs for the period romp, but Alfonso Cuarón is set fair for Oscars glory as Roma takes best picture, best director, and two moreOlivia Colman’s performance as the unstable, self-pitying and hilariously bad-mannered Queen Anne won her Bafta award success on Sunday evening – one of seven awards for the 18th-century comedy The Favourite.The film was easily the biggest winner at the glitzy Royal Albert Hall ceremony, picking up prizes including including best British film, best production design, best supporting actress, best original screenplay and best costume design.Colman followed up her success at the Golden Globes and the Critics Choice awards by being named best actress – a category pundits predicted would feature a close race between her and Glenn Close, nominated for The Wife.“We are having an amazing night aren’t we?” said Colman in her speech, which met with a standing ovation. “We are going to get so pissed later.”It caps a stratospheric rise for the actor who early in her career struggled for parts and was best known for comedy, becoming a regular in Mitchell and Webb television and radio sketches and Peep Show. Later came career-changing dramas such as Broadchurch and The Night Manager – up next: the middle-aged Elizabeth in Netflix’s The Crown.Playing a queen of England does not guarantee Bafta success, but it unquestionably helps. Colman follows in the footsteps of Katharine Hepburn (Eleanor of Aquitaine), Judi Dench (Elizabeth I and Victoria), Cate Blanchett (Elizabeth I) and Helen Mirren (Elizabeth II) in winning for a royal turn.Both her co-stars, Emma Stone and Rachel Weisz, were nominated for best supporting actress, with Weisz winning out. Weisz paid tribute to her co-stars, saying: “I salute you! Didn’t we have an extraordinary time. Hats off, ladies.”It was a terrific night for The Favourite but it lost out to the widely lauded tear-jerker Roma in the best film category. Roma’s director Alfonso Cuarón was named best director, beating Yorgos Lanthimos, Spike Lee, Bradley Cooper and Paweł Pawlikowski. It also won best cinematography (by Cuarón himself) and best film not in the English language.Cuarón thanked Netflix for having the “faith and courage to get behind a black-and-white film about a domestic worker, subtitled from Spanish, and bring it to audiences around the world.“To see a film about an indigenous domestic worker embraced this way in an age when fear and anger propose to ide us means the world to me.“Reverting back to a world of separation and isolation is not a solution to anything. It is simply an excuse to hide our fear within our basest instincts.”If there was an underlying theme of the evening – apart from the odd jibe about Brexit – then it was ersity in the industry. Or the lack of such.One of the biggest cheers went to The Favourite’s production designers Fiona Crombie and Alice Felton when they dedicated their win to “every woman and working mother who keeps it together and makes it happen”. And screenwriter Deborah Davis said: “Thank you for celebrating our female-dominated movie about women in power.”The Favourite’s costume designer, Sandy Powell, described it as a dream “to design for three powerful female protagonists played by three powerful female actresses”.Earlier in the evening, the film-maker Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi, accepting the best documentary award for Free Solo, which follows rock climber Alex Honnold on a remarkable, heart-stopping free solo climb, thanked National Geographic for “hiring women and people of colour … because we do make the films better.”Bohemian Rhapsody won two awards, including best actor for Rami Malek’s remarkable portrayal of Freddie Mercury. “This is totally extraordinary,” he said. “Thank you for this generous gift.”The film’s success is striking on several levels, considering some fans were unhappy at what they perceived as liberties taken by the plot, as well as the mixed reception it got from critics, and the unceremonious firing of director Bryan Singer before the film was finished. Last week, Singer’s name was removed from the nominations list because of sexual misconduct allegations against him. Malek did not mention Singer in his speech.Can You Ever Forgive Me? star Richard E Grant continued to enjoy his award-season party, grinning constantly and posing for photographs, but he failed to win best supporting actor, losing to Mahershala Ali for Green Book.It was a brilliant night for The Favourite, but the Bafta record of nine awards – set in 1971 by Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid – remains intact.Other awards included best original music for A Star Is Born, and outstanding British debut for the film makers of Beast.This year’s awards were the first to take place since Bafta introduced new rules to increase ersity in the films it honours. But although change is happening, it is too slow for many observers, who point to the all-male shortlist for the best director category. The only woman to ever win is Kathryn Bigelow for The Hurt Locker in 2009.For the second year running, Joanna Lumley presented the awards – probably down to her not being on Twitter, she joked. In truth that was one of her better lines, as many of her scripted gags were met with groans or, worse, polite chuckles.The ceremony’s in memorium section paid tribute to figures such as Albert Finney and Nicolas Roeg, accompanied by the young saxophonist Jess Gillam playing the title track from Love Story.The only award voted for by the public, the rising star award, went to Letitia Wright, the Guyanese-born British star of Black Panther, who revealed from the stage that she was deeply depressed a few years ago and was considering giving up acting. Her faith in God and Bafta got her back on track, she said.The evening’s highest honour, the Bafta fellowship, was given to film editor Thelma Schoonmaker, a three-time Oscar winner and one of Martin Scorsese’s closest collaborators, who has worked on 22 of his features.Ahead of the award, Schoonmaker revealed to the Observer her plans to publish the diaries of her late husband, the director Michael Powell.Another of Bafta’s special awards, for outstanding British contribution to cinema, was presented by Bill Nighy to husband-and-wife producers Stephen Woolley and Elizabeth Karlsen, whose films over four decades, from The Crying Game to Carol, have been nominated for a total of 52 Baftas."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e05efe26bf76883dc5582c912fb489c80fd3d7d4/28_539_2739_1644/master/2739.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d0bc2382685e6cb12d4c65c0058ae044","title":"baftas 2019 winners full list","story":"The Favourite won the most Baftas, but Roma carried off the big prizes, including best film and best director•The Favourite reigns - almost - supreme as Roma takes best picture•  Baftas red carpet, the ceremony and the winners – live!• Red carpet fashion – in picturesIncredibles 2Isle of DogsWINNER: Spider-Man: Into the Spider-VerseFantastic Beasts: The Crimes of GrindelwaldWINNER: The FavouriteFirst Man Mary Poppins ReturnsRomaBohemian RhapsodyWINNER: The FavouriteMary Queen of Scots Stan \u0026amp OllieViceNumber 9 Films (Elizabeth Karlsen and Stephen Woolley)Amy Adams – ViceClaire Foy – First ManEmma Stone – The FavouriteMargot Robbie – Mary Queen of ScotsWINNER: Rachel Weisz – The FavouriteBlacKkKlansmanIf Beale Street Could Talk Isle of Dogs Mary Poppins Returns WINNER: A Star Is BornAvengers: Infinity WarWINNER: Black Panther Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of GrindelwaldFirst ManReady Player OneThe Ballad of Buster ScruggsBohemian RhapsodyWINNER: The FavouriteMary Poppins ReturnsMary Queen of Scots"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dd677ffbc1baa93cbe249633a0c0189dc187fdbf/205_85_5292_3175/master/5292.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c95cca742cd3a6a0bb77d35a216f3576","title":"european film festivals six of the best","story":"Exclusive, elite and hierarchical, Cannes doesn’t make it easy for its attendees. Tickets for the red-carpet premieres are like gold dust – some hopeful punters stand for hours in full evening dress holding placards begging for a seat – and once secured, they still have to pass muster with the infamous red carpet fashion police. No flip flops! Quelle horreur! But the smart cineaste looks away from the scrum of the main competition and towards the sidebars. The consistently excellent Director’s Fortnight is the only section open to the public. It’s also where you’ll find the edgier, newer voices.The autumn slot of this glamorous but eye-wateringly expensive event has seen it increasingly co-opted as a launchpad for the awards season big hitters. At times it seems as though Hollywood A-listers are only outnumbered by the mosquitos. Tickets are massively over-subscribed, but in theory the public can purchase seats for pretty much everything, even the gala films. The prices, however, can be prohibitive – the most expensive tickets were €45 in 2018, although cheaper options are available.A genteel resort town an hour or so from Bilbao, San Sebastián is a mecca for innovative Basque cuisine, as well as the location for Spain’s most important film festival. As it’s an event aimed as much at the public as at industry visitors, tickets are easily available, although they frequently sell out. The canny festival-goer will look to the thorough and well-researched retrospective programmes: a deep e into the work of Preston Sturges remains one of my most cherished San Sebastián memories.Once a year, the animation industry congregates in this picturesque French lakeside town, near the border with Switzerland – and the animation industry likes to party. Annecy is not only the place to go to experience the very best in the medium, it’s a festival with a unique atmosphere, full of endearingly geeky traditions. Before each screening, the audience pelts the screen (and each other) with paper aeroplanes any appearance of a rabbit in a film will be greeted with a rousing shout of “Lapin!”.The youthful energy of the Karlovy Vary is in marked contrast to its location, the slightly chintzy Czech spa town where 19th-century tourists flocked to bathe in the hot springs. Hardy film fans bunk in dormitories and tents, and lounge around the parks between movies. The atmosphere is more Glasto than Cannes, and the egalitarian approach means that even those on a tight budget can see plenty of films in this well-curated programme.Of the main European documentary festivals, Copenhagen’s CPH:DOX might just have the edge on Amsterdam’s IDFA and Sheffield’s DocFest. Its timing means it can provide a European platform for the best of the Sundance premieres, and Copenhagen makes for a lovely backdrop. It is well attended by the documentary community, so aspiring film-makers can make connections in the ticket queue."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/708d56d01b735e8265ebcde16017f38c234f030b/0_242_3267_1960/master/3267.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6f01edcc82d93584a85b35dc71d344a5","title":"european film must see 25 movies","story":"The must-see movies that have defined a century of European cinema, as chosen by the Observer’s film writersBack in 2017, I was asked to contribute a short piece about British cinema to a book entitled Goodbye Europe. The book was a collection of essays, inspired by the recent referendum, offering a series of different perspectives on the thorny subject of the UK’s relationship to Europe, and “what the idea of Europe means to Britons and others living here”. In my essay I argued that, to all intents and purposes, there was no such thing as a “British film” per se – in an age of increasingly international co-production, national boundaries are no longer a defining feature of cinema. Moreover, if you read any interview with a film-maker at the cutting edge of UK cinema, the chances are they will refer to themselves and their work as “European”.I loved that phrase – “weird European” – and it came back to haunt me as the Observer set about compiling this collection of 25 films that are essential viewing in these tumultuous times. In the era of Brexit, it seems more important than ever to engage with, and feel part of, the rich heritage of European cinema, in all its strange and wonderful manifestations. Whatever the ramifications of current political and social upheavals, it’s clear that film-makers (and film fans) in the UK are part of a wider tradition of borderless cinema that needs to be celebrated and explored, now more than ever.It’s worth stating at the outset that this isn’t intended as some form of competitive countdown. We are not claiming our selection to be a list of the “best” European films ever made. Nor is it an attempt to create a critical canon that singles out the finest achievements in Euro-cinema. On the contrary, this is a personal selection made by five Observer film writers (Simran Hans, Wendy Ide, Guy Lodge, Jonathan Romney and myself) highlighting movies that we consider to be important, or affecting, or innovative – films that have struck a chord. Together, they give a flavour of the dazzling breadth of European cinema, offering a tiny snapshot of a vast cinematic landscape.We’ve tried to make the list as erse as possible, both in terms of where and when they were made, and in the stories that they tell. These titles cover a century of cinema, with the earliest dating back to 1922, while our most recent choice comes from 2017. Some hail from countries, such as Russia and Turkey, that are only partially in Europe, yet all represent a facet of what we consider to be European cinema – whatever that may be.Although historians are ided on the exact birthplace of moving pictures (Leeds, Paris and New York variously feature in differing accounts), Europe has always been a vital force in the evolution of cinema – artistically influential, even when economically overshadowed by larger industries. Just as European émigrés shaped the face of Hollywood, so stylistic movements from German expressionism to Italian neo-realism and the French New Wave continue to reverberate throughout popular global cinema. Glancing through this collection of extraordinary, challenging, world-changing films, it’s easy to see why.This 1922 chiller is a milestone of German expressionist cinema. Subtitled Eine Symphonie des Grauens (a symphony of horror), FW Murnau’s film stars Max Schreck as Count Orlok, whose vampiric presence put the fear of god into film fans in the age before sound. Images of Orlok’s undead shadow ascending a staircase and clawing at his victim’s heart rank among the most haunting (and most parodied) moments in cinema. Despite its classic status, Nosferatu had a rocky start: British censors initially refused it a certificate after legal complaints by Bram Stoker’s estate, claiming it to be an uncredited and unauthorised adaptation of Dracula – which, of course, it was. Many copies were destroyed, though Nosferatu – like its anti-hero – survived. MKIt is the face that everyone remembers: that unstinting close-up of the tear-riven visage of French actress Maria Falconetti, maintaining agonised composure as her Joan of Arc is consumed by flames before a braying mob. Aped and echoed countless times on camera – not least in Sinéad O’Connor’s video for Nothing Compares 2 U – it is a scene that rewrote how faces could be explored and exploited on screen. The last silent film by Danish master Carl Theodor Dreyer, it largely eschewed traditional master shots for a dazzling range of expressive, character-probing close-ups: no historical biopic has ever felt quite so unnervingly intimate. GLJean Vigo, who died aged 29, only made four films, but his tiny oeuvre remains an inspiring landmark in European cinema. His only full-length feature is an entrancing essay in modernist romanticism, rooted equally in realism and the language of dreams. L’Atalante is a canal barge, captained by naive Jean (Jean Dasté), newly married to Juliette (Dita Parlo). The course of true love doesn’t run smooth, on water or on land, not least thanks to an unruly contingent of cats and to the disruptive presence of crewman Le Père Jules – played by Michel Simon, one of the most irreducibly raw, joyous and anarchic presences in screen history. JRFellini’s wilder visionary flights are not to every taste, but one of his most enduring works is this early rites-of-passage story. The “big calves” of the title are a group of young men in a seaside town, finding it harder to grow up than they expected. Among them are feckless romancer Fausto, joker Alberto (played by Alberto Sordi, soon to be a huge comedy star) and thoughtful Moraldo, the director’s autobiographical stand-in. At once tender and pitiless towards the contradictions of traditional Italian masculinity, I Vitelloni was a major influence on the young Martin Scorsese. The “leaving home” sequence at the end is one of the most poetic moments in Fellini’s work. JRA cautionary tale about the unhealthy relationship between voyeurism and violence, Michael Powell’s psycho-thriller (from a script by Leo Marks) is a dangerous film about the dangers of watching films. Carl Boehm is the shy young man whose camera has become a deadly weapon, capturing the faces of his victims on film at the moment of their death. Critics loathed Peeping Tom on its first release, branding it “appallingly masochistic and depraved” and calling upon distributors to “flush it swiftly down the nearest sewer”. In the wake of such outrage, the film dropped out of circulation until Martin Scorsese championed its restoration and re-release. With its lurid Eastmancolor hues and daringly confrontational POV camera work, this remains a startlingly uncomfortable experience. MKItalian film-maker Luchino Visconti is best known for sweeping melodramas that focus on the upper echelons of society. A member of the Italian communist party, but born into a noble Milanese family himself, his preoccupation with class makes perfect sense. Still, I find the operatic Rocco and His Brothers his most bluntly moving work. A meddling mother and her five sons swap Italy’s rural south for industrial Milan in a bid for a better life. An upsetting love triangle emerges between brothers Simone (Renato Salvatori) and Rocco (Alain Delon, never more gorgeous), and a clever, fiery call girl named Nadia (the fabulous Annie Girardot) its denouement always makes me cry. SHPersona is often described as stern Swedish moodmeister Ingmar Bergman’s definitive film – topping his other works in Sight \u0026amp Sound magazine’s most recent greatest films poll. But that’s not to say it is his most typical: his fluidly amorphous dual character study was a radical departure from his previous work, literalising its Jungian psychology by splintering and merging its two female characters – a frail, suddenly mute stage a and her young carer – to inextricable, disorienting effect. Today, it feels as bracingly experimental as then, awash with disruptive, disconnected imagery that calls the camera’s own perspective into question: half a century later, it remains an object of fascination and dissent among theorists. GLVěra Chytilová’s merrily anarchic Czech New Wave wonder is both a “screw you!” to the joyless efficiency of collectivisation and an impish dismantling of the patriarchy. Set in Prague, it sees two decadent pranksters in matching polka dot outfits engage in so-called bad behaviour (the world has gone bad, so they might as well). Marie I and Marie II are masters of the dine and dash, seducing sleazy older men before leaving them with the bill. They slice up phallic objects for fun, and orchestrate a libertine food fight, trampling trifle intended for politicians. Frankly, it’s inspirational. SHA prolific and unflinching film-maker who was most at home on the fringes of 1970s West German society, Rainer Werner Fassbinder paid tribute to Douglas Sirk with this portrait of love against the odds. The result is a glorious hybrid: a story of a romance between a widowed cleaner (Brigitte Mira) and a Moroccan man 20 years her junior (Fassbinder’s then partner El Hedi ben Salem), it has the director’s trademark sharp edges, its characters marinated in disappointment and bigotry. But there is also tenderness to this Munich-based melodrama, a belief that love really can heal the scars of the past. WIThe often unsung experimenter of the French New Wave, Rivette wrote this delirium of a film in collaboration with his cast, notably leads Juliet Berto and Dominique Labourier. They play two women – a magician and a librarian – who meet one balmy Paris summer and throw themselves into a joyfully free-associative adventure, trying to save the young prisoner of a haunted house. Very loosely inspired by two Henry James stories, it is a delirious mix of hippy-era feminism, goofy mysticism, slapstick comedy and Borgesian time-twisting, as well as a serious contemplation of the mysteries of cinema, and a love letter to the “phantom ladies” of silent-era serials. JRHerzog connects with the spirit of German romanticism as he explores the cause célèbre of a young man apparently raised in captivity, emerging into the daylight in 1828 a stranger to both language and the outside world. As a professor attempts to educate him, society finds its own attitudes judged by this seeming exemplar of that 19th-century archetype, the “noble savage”. Beautifully shot by Jörg Schmidt-Reitwein, this is one of Herzog’s most atmospheric works, but its claim to immortality is the inspired casting of an unknown as Kaspar – street musician Bruno S, whose singular vocal rhythms and body language make for a performance like no other. JRRarely has a great film been as unjustly tarnished by a remake as Italian writer-director Lina Wertmüller’s lavishly sun-varnished, idea-spilling social satire. In 2002 it was infamously and abysmally rehashed by Madonna and Guy Ritchie, with its sly political commentary and poetry (beginning with its full title, Swept Away... By an Unusual Destiny in the Blue Sea of August) gutted. It is time its reputation was reclaimed, not least since much of the rhetoric in its love-hate war of ideologies, between a haughty capitalist lady of leisure and a spiky communist deckhand on her yacht, sounds as applicable to 2019 as it did to 1974. GLThe late, great Chantal Akerman broke new ground with her hypnotic three-and-a-half hour response to the suffocating drudgery of domestic life. Using long takes and symmetrical, straight-on medium shots, Akerman pays close attention to the gestures of Jeanne’s routine over the course of three minutely observed days. She cooks and cleans, takes a bath, brushes her hair, welcomes men into her bedroom in the afternoons. The cycle continues, until it doesn’t. When I first watched the film, endurance gave way to anger and, later, awe – the duration forces the viewer to recalibrate the way they anticipate drama. The effect is one of ever-present foreboding that builds in the chest and begins to clog the throat it’s the feminine condition as cinema. SHBoth in its running time – three and three-quarter hours – and the scope of its sociopolitical themes, this is a substantial work. A ragtag bunch of itinerant actors tour Greece, scraping together a subsistence living. The languorous camera captures a crumbling provincial Greece between 1939 and 1952. The second world war and its aftermath loom large in a sprawling story, which also weaves in references to mythology. Audacious in its approach, and in the demands it makes on the audience, The Travelling Players is one of the most important works of Greek cinema. WI film critic Derek Malcolm opined in 1999 that “no other Italian film-maker of world stature has been as neglected as Ermanno Olmi”. This Palme d’Or-winning epic about hard lives in late 19th-century Lombardy uses non-professional actors speaking in the distinctive Bergamasque dialect, drawing us into a tough and unforgiving world of births, weddings and deaths of religion and feudalism of support and slaughter. It is a profoundly humanist work, but one which is not afraid to get its hands dirty in depicting the unsentimental realities of rural life. As Mike Leigh observed: “Directly, objectively, yet compassionately, it puts on the screen the great, hard, real adventure of living and surviving from day to day, and from year to year, the experience of ordinary people everywhere.” MKIn 2017’s stylish comic-book fightfest Atomic Blonde, one of many lavishly choreographed shootouts takes place in a modernist East Berlin cinema playing Stalker, Andrei Tarkovsky’s terrifying, spiritually tortured sci-fi nightmare: as real-life violence throws the screening into chaos, you wonder if the disruption might have come as light relief to the audience. The heady Russian formalist’s most narratively straightforward film, it also might be his most philosophically and atmospherically dense. Following a misfit writer and a professor as they are led through a hostile no man’s land in pursuit of a mysterious, wish-granting room, it plays like The Wizard of Oz set to a death march gallows humour occasionally bleeding through its ominous musings on society and human nature. GLA Lonely Woman is not Agnieszka Holland’s most famous film. However, shot in 1981, just before martial law was imposed in Poland and the film-maker fled her own country for France, it is one of her most enduringly political (so much so that it was banned in Poland). An unblinking, hard-edged portrait of austerity and survival under communism, it centres on single mother and social outcast Irena (Maria Chwalibóg). A disabled man named Jacek (Bogusław Linda) offers her the erotic taste of freedom, but its cost requires a brutal compromise. SHVery loosely based on Billy Budd, the Herman Melville novella, Beau Travail is a masterpiece that showcases Claire Denis’s gift for visual storytelling. The backdrop, a remote French foreign legion outpost on the Horn of Africa, serves as a stage for a stylised ballet of masculinity in crisis. The abrasive Sergeant Galoup (Denis Lavant), a legionnaire of antisocial nature, takes against the easy charm of new recruit Gilles Sentain (Grégoire Colin). Training exercises, viewed through the reminiscence of Galoup, take on a loaded, almost homoerotic tone. A hymn in praise of male beauty, it explores the conflict in this austere military environment between comradeship and a deeper form of attraction. WIThis glumly hilarious collection of surreal vignettes could only be the work of Sweden’s Roy Andersson. His unique vision focuses on the moment at which the banal tips over into the bizarre. Locked long shots emphasise the meticulous composition of the frame, and the colour palette runs the gamut from cold porridge to wet concrete. There is very little dialogue, and yet each scene, from the horribly botched magician’s trick to the man who refuses to be fired from his job, speaks volumes. Delicate threads hold the seemingly disparate episodes together to build a portrait of a crumbling society that has resorted to superstition and ritual. WIWhen I think of Fat Girl, I think of a little girl in a lime green swimming costume applying sunscreen to her pudgy arms and legs. Catherine Breillat’s film is about the bond between sisters – two warring sides of the same soul (eat your heart out, Elena Ferrante). There are consequences when 12-year-old Anaïs sees her 15-year-old sister lose her innocence (we watch this through Anaïs’s eyes, in excruciating real time). “My first time should be with nobody,” she declares in retaliation it is a cruel irony that Breillat grants her wish. The film remains heart-bendingly shocking, violent, disturbing and audacious – a provocation, determined to challenge mythologies about virginity and romance spread by the history of cinema. SHThere is little consensus on the question of Pedro Almodovár’s greatest film – some plump for the all-out heart assault of All About My Mother, others prefer the early, rowdy ones – but his 2003 Oscar winner is, for this critic’s money, his most complete work. Bridging his affinities for open-hearted melodrama, wittily queer experimentation and ravishing art within art, this intricately structured tale of two men bonding over the comatose women under their care is emotionally complex and morally conflicted in its delicate handling of thorny gender constructs and bodily boundaries. Viewed in a post-#MeToo environment, it only feels more audacious and essential. GLTurkish writer-director Ceylan has become more expansively novelistic in recent films such as Winter Sleep and The Wild Pear Tree, but his breakthrough feature is all about caustic concision. Uzak – meaning distant – is an odd-couple drama about a jaded intellectual photographer who finds himself playing host to an unemployed cousin. Melancholic and philosophical, but also acidly comic, it is a subtle, compassionate dissection of male malaise and class tensions, as well as a bitter-sweet love letter to Istanbul, photographed magnificently by Ceylan himself. And it contains a delicious poker-faced gag about using Tarkovsky films as a cover for watching porn. JRPretty much the archetypal film from the Romanian New Wave, this Palme d’Or-winning drama is austere, naturalistic and, despite the unpromising subject matter, as gripping as any thriller. The setting is the end of Ceaușescu-era Romania, a labyrinthine maze of red tape and corruption. Two female students, room-mates at university, must negotiate this nightmarish world in order to procure an illegal abortion for one of them. Mungiu’s deliberate pacing exerts a sense of mounting dread the fiercely unsentimental approach makes for a bruising, yet utterly compelling viewing experience. WIFollowing 2007’s Water Lilies and 2011’s Tomboy, Céline Sciamma’s brilliant tale of young girls living the Paris banlieue life (originally entitled Bande de filles) forms the third chapter of an accidental “trilogy of youth”. Karidja Touré is marvellous as Marieme, perfectly embodying the awkward tensions of someone torn between childhood and adulthood, driven to the margins by her age, her gender, her race. With its street-smart casting (Sciamma auditioned non-professionals recruited from malls and train stations), Girlhood speaks the language of its characters with wit, fluency and insight. A sequence during which the gang dance in stolen dresses to Rihanna’s Diamonds is utterly sublime. Throughout, it is Sciamma’s affection for these characters that shines through, a bitter-sweet admiration of their strengths and complexities. MKHungarian director Ildikó Enyedi won the top prize at the Berlin film festival for this eerie, disorientating love story about two withdrawn outsiders who find themselves inexplicably sharing the same woodland dreams. The story is set against the brutal backdrop of an abattoir, where the star-crossed couple meet. Endre (Géza Morcsányi) is the slaughterhouse manager who keeps his emotions close to his chest Mária (Alexandra Borbély) is the quality controller, newly arrived at the plant, who seems to fear physical contact. Despite the harshness of their environment, the pair develop an unexpected relationship that scratches at the edge of transcendence. Scenes of beauty and horror, joy and sadness, life and death are juxtaposed with a poetic dexterity that is wholly disarming and quite mesmerising.

In the Oscar-winning Moonlight, he conjured a portrait of a young man from a hardscrabble, drug-riddled Miami neighbourhood finding harsh beauty in the precise minutiae of his protagonist’s life. Like all great coming-of-age movies, Moonlight struck a chord as timeless as that evoked by Truffaut’s Les Quatre Cents Coups, George Lucas’s American Graffiti or Lynne Ramsay’s Ratcatcher. Now, Jenkins’s adaptation of James Baldwin’s 1970s novel becomes a heart-stopping cinematic love story, told with a tough but tender truthfulness that left me weeping and swooning. It’s a terrific film, as sinewy as it is sensuous, interweaving stark social-realist themes of prejudice, oppression and imprisonment with a poetic evocation of love, loss and, ultimately, transcendence.“Every black person born in America was born on Beale Street,” states the opening quotation from Baldwin, citing “the impossibility and the possibility, the absolute necessity, to give expression to this legacy”. From such boldly declarative beginnings, Jenkins moves to a gently swirling overhead shot of two seemingly shy young lovers walking together, the sound of sustained elegiac strings accompanying their footsteps. “You ready for this?” asks 19-year-old Tish (KiKi Layne), to which Fonny (Stephan James) replies: “I’ve never been more ready for anything in my whole life...”It’s a scene trembling with promise and expectation, full of cinema’s dreamy ability to capture the elusive quintessence of love. But that ethereal sense of promise comes crashing down to earth on the next beat as we hear Tish’s voice telling us she hopes that “nobody has ever had to look at anybody they love through glass…”Like so many young African American men, Fonny (aka Alonzo) has been arrested and jailed on a trumped-up charge, following a run-in with a grudge-bearing white cop (Ed Skrein, oozing menace). Tish is pregnant and promises Fonny he’ll be out and back in Harlem before their baby is born. But while Tish’s family, led by protective matriarch Sharon (Oscar-favourite Regina King) and down-to-earth Joseph (Colman Domingo), are accepting and proud, Fonny’s God-bothering mother (a fearsome Aunjanue Ellis) responds with hostility and spite, blaming Tish for her son’s supposed fall from grace. Can the warring clans put aside their differences for the sake of the next generation?Jenkins cites the phrase “Love brought you here” as his favourite line from Baldwin’s novel, and those words resonate throughout this rich and vibrantly melancholic film. While the bond between Tish and Fonny is spine-tingling (a discreetly framed love scene rivals the intimacy of the love scene in Nic Roeg’s Don’t Look Now), the strength of their connection is echoed in the dynamics of their extended families. Layne and James are perfectly cast as the young couple, but the power of their performances is matched by supporting players such as Teyonah Parris, in firecracker form as Tish’s older sister Ernestine, and Brian Tyree Henry (so brilliant in Widows) as close friend Daniel Carty, who has similarly suffered injustice.As for Regina King, her brilliantly modulated performance is a masterclass in physical understatement. One moment stands out – as Tish sits in the kitchen, preparing to tell her mother that she is pregnant, James Laxton’s camera adopts Tish’s point of view, watching Sharon from behind. “Mamma… ,” says Tish, tentatively, and even before she turns to face us, an almost imperceptible movement of King’s neck and shoulders tells us that Sharon knows exactly what her daughter is about to say.As before, Jenkins invites the audience to look directly into his characters’ eyes, highlighting the sense of connection by stretching and slowing time, taking his lead from the “chopped-and-screwed” beats that have long fascinated this most musical film-maker. Just as the narrative shuffles past and present like cards in a dexterously dealt hand, so Jenkins invites us to focus on the moment, turning seconds into minutes with sensual slow-mo.Meanwhile, Nicholas Britell’s subtly counterintuitive score brushes up against classic vinyl cuts (the ritual of putting on a record is evoked more than once), creating a musical mosaic that both anchors the drama in the here and now while expanding it beyond the specifics of time and place. The result is another mesmerising and wholly immersive experience from a film-maker whose love of the medium of cinema – and fierce compassion for Baldwin’s finely drawn characters – shines through every frame."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/031079c32ab0548656496a7cb65037c19723ab28/502_108_3158_1896/master/3158.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=349101966560281ca2411ef639af24d2","title":"black sheep guardian film nominated for best short documentary oscar","story":"Ed Perkins’ film about a young black boy’s response to a racist gang after he moves out of London is up for an Academy awardBlack Sheep, a film commissioned by the , has been nominated for best short documentary at the 2019 Oscars.Directed by Ed Perkins, Black Sheep tells the story of Cornelius Walker, a black 11-year-old from London who moves with his family to a housing estate in Essex after the murder of schoolboy Damilola Taylor in 2000.

One by one they have been ticked off: first Arsenal, then Everton and finally a Chelsea side that looked in need of smelling salts before the midway stage of the first half. Three games, 11 goals, nine points, and more fool anyone who thought this might be the most difficult assignment of the lot.What actually happened was a peacock-like spreading of City’s feathers, featuring a four-goal blitz inside the opening 25 minutes, another hat-trick for Sergio Agüero and the feeling, once again, that, if Liverpool can beat this team to the Premier League title, it will rank as the most exceptional performance of any of the championship-winning sides from Anfield through the years.If anything it was just a surprise City did not add even more sheen to the margin of victory bearing in mind there was never a single part of the match when they looked bored by their own brilliance. City, to put it into context, have now scored twice or more in every Premier League home match this season, a feat no top-ision team has managed in 15 successive games since Tottenham Hotspur from March to December 1965, with Bill Nicholson in the dugout and Jimmy Greaves terrorising opposition defences. Including the cup competitions the reigning champions have accumulated 33 goals from their last six home games. It feels like a statistic from another time, a sepia-tinted era of baggy shorts and boggy pitches.For Agüero it was his 15th hat-trick in City’s colours and perhaps it would be impertinent to dwell too long on the moment, at 1-0, when he also produced possibly the worst miss of all his years in English football. Two yards out, Agüero might argue one would have to go back in time even further to find similar. No matter: his first goal came five minutes later and perhaps there was a measure of anger contained in his firecracker of a shot, 25 yards out, into the top corner of Kepa Arrizabalaga’s net. Missing a sitter, scoring a screamer – who cares if it was unorthodox when Agüero has 25 goals in his last 16 starts for City at this ground?By the time Pep Guardiola’s team were done they had moved back above Liverpool to the top of the table, albeit having played a game more, and it did not seem unreasonable to wonder whether this result might seriously endanger Maurizio’s Sarri’s position as Chelsea manager. Put it this way: Roman Abramovich has sacked good men for considerably less.This was their fourth successive away defeat in all competitions and everyone connected with Chelsea, not just Abramovich, must be alarmed by their deterioration, particularly having just been whacked 4-0 at Bournemouth. The final goal means Chelsea drop below Arsenal to sixth place on goals scored. Yes, there is the Carabao Cup final to come on 24 February and a chance to decorate an increasingly problematic season with some silverware. Just do not bet your mortgage on it: the opposition at Wembley will be … Manchester City. Maybe Guardiola will start David Silva next time, too.Chelsea have not managed an away goal since 30 December but their problems here owed more to chaotic defending and a collective meltdown after it all began, four minutes in, with Kevin De Bruyne slipping a free-kick behind the opposition defence to find Bernardo Silva completely free. Silva jinked into the penalty area and his low cross flicked off David Luiz to roll invitingly into Raheem Sterling’s path. Sterling found a gap between Arrizabalaga and the goalkeeper’s right-hand post and, after that, it was startling to see Chelsea’s capitulation.If nothing else, at least there were some encouraging signs for Sarri that Gonzalo Higuaín can flourish as the new arrowhead to Chelsea’s attack. No team, however, can expect to get away with defending as abjectly as Chelsea did during the period in the first half when most of the damage was inflicted. Chelsea conceded a goal on average every five minutes and, though an argument could be made that City pressured them into mistakes, that was not always the case.Agüero’s second goal was a case in point, originating from Ross Barkley trying to head the ball to his goalkeeper from the edge of the penalty area. It is an old Paul Gascoigne trick and, if it comes off, with so many opponents in close proximity, it looks good. If it does not, it can make the player who tried it look foolish in the extreme. Barkley got it horribly wrong and Agüero pounced to get in front of Arrizabalaga and score with a swivelling left-footed shot.If Chelsea had been fully prepared, they should not have been taken aback by the early onslaught. City have now scored 15 times in the opening 15-minute periods of their league matches this season and the next most impressive figure belongs to Arsenal, with seven. It was 3-0 after 19 minutes and Ilkay Gündogan, a player who deserves far more acclaim than he actually receives, swiftly made it four, catching out Arrizabalaga with a 20-yard effort into the bottom corner.Agüero completed his hat-trick from the penalty spot 11 minutes into the second half, after César Azpilicueta’s foul on the elusive and merciless Sterling, and City’s record scorer also headed one of De Bruyne’s beautifully delivered crosses against the crossbar before making way for Gabriel Jesus.Oleksandr Zinchenko, drafted into City’s defence and outstanding throughout, supplied the cross for Sterling to finish the scoring. It was the heaviest defeat Chelsea have suffered in the Abramovich era – the heaviest, indeed, since losing 7-0 at Nottingham Forest in 1991, back in the days of Gordon Durie, Kerry Dixon and Tony Dorigo – and, when Sarri went straight down the tunnel at the end without shaking Guardiola’s hand, perhaps, to give him the benefit of the doubt, it was not a deliberate snub on the part of Chelsea’s manager. His mind might have been filled by thoughts of what this defeat means for his job prospects."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a702f7a26fcbbf5215eb369d56fd66cd99037fee/0_43_2440_1464/master/2440.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1fcb35d9095850f1eea118b5672e3f8d","title":"tottenham leicester premier league match report","story":"To say the scene was set for Jamie Vardy was one of the understatements of the season. Dropped to the Leicester bench by Claude Puel despite his fine scoring record against big-six opposition, the striker was introduced in the 59th minute with his team trailing to Dávinson Sánchez’s first-half header but having just been awarded the softest of penalties.Surely Vardy would not run straight on to take the kick? He did and the Wembley crowd held its breath. In 51 previous Premier League appearances against the big six Vardy had scored 28 goals. Thirteen of them had come since the beginning of last season but, on this occasion, his sights were awry. Hugo Lloris, the game’s outstanding performer, went the right way to save and that seemed even more important moments later when Christian Eriksen scored at the other end for 2-0.Vardy would get his goal on 76 minutes, a brave close-range finish, and Leicester pushed hard for the equaliser. It would have been the least they deserved on the balance of play and chances created. But it did not come and, when Son Heung-min sprinted clear in stoppage time to beat Kasper Schmeichel for his 15th goal of the season, it added up to relief for Spurs and frustration for the visitors.It was Spurs’ fourth league win on the spin and another occasion when, in the absence of the injured Harry Kane and Dele Alli, they were not at their fluent best. Yet they found a way to get the result and it kept them within striking distance of Manchester City and Liverpool at the top of the table. Next up for them is the Champions League last-16 tie against Borussia Dortmund at Wembley on Wednesday.In the absence of Vardy at the outset Puel experimented with the winger Demarai Gray at the tip of his 4-1-4-1 formation. Gray was pacy and willing but he lacked end product. Not that he was alone. Leicester, in general, were easy on the eye with their passing and build-up play but wasteful when it mattered most – with the 21-year-old Harvey Barnes the biggest culprit. As such they flattered to deceive and have now taken only one point from an available 15.“We finish with big regrets,” Puel said. “It was not a fair result but it was our fault. We have to find a clinical edge.”It was open and entertaining from the first whistle and Leicester were aggrieved to trail at half-time. Harry Maguire worked Lloris with an early header while Barnes dragged shots wide of the far and near posts when well placed. Puel gave the loan signing, Youri Tielemans, his debut in midfield and the Belgian impressed with his technique and vision.The first flashpoint came on 15 minutes when Maguire lunged in on Son inside the area. There was contact, though possibly not enough to send the forward tumbling to the ground. Michael Oliver did not give the penalty and he booked Son for ing.Pochettino later described the decision as unbelievable, when he also mentioned Oliver had denied Son a last-gasp penalty against Liverpool in September when Spurs were 2-1 down. “It was so clear,” Pochettino said. “Do you think we are a team trying to cheat the referee? Come on! We are such nice people.”The excellent Danny Rose had been denied by a smart Schmeichel block in the 18th minute and Sánchez’s goal – his first for Spurs – came when Kieran Trippier pulled a corner back to Eriksen on the edge of the area and he whipped in a cross. With Maguire not tight enough, Sánchez headed home.Leicester continued to push after the interval and Gray spurned a gilt-edged chance when he headed weakly at Lloris from Ricardo Pereira’s cross. Then came the turning point.Vardy was stripped and ready to replace Gray when Leicester worked the ball into the area. A couple of blue shirts had a nibble at it before it broke for Maddison, who crumpled to the ground under Jan Vertonghen’s challenge. The penalty award was awfully generous.Puel told Vardy he could take it – mindful, perhaps, that Maddison had missed twice from the spot. Lloris, though, read Vardy’s intentions and Spurs extended their lead shortly afterwards.Oliver Skipp charged down Pereira’s clearance – possibly with the help of his hand – and when the otherwise ineffective Fernando Llorente played the ball to Eriksen, he fizzed a shotinto the corner from the edge of the area.Leicester refused to accept their fate and Barnes’s third and final chance was the clearest, a one-on-one with Lloris following Vardy’s pass. With so much time and space he simply had to score but the finish betrayed his anxiety and Lloris blocked.Vardy did score after Pereira had swapped passes with Tielemans and crossed low and Leicester strained again for the equaliser. Vardy was off target with a half-volley and the substitute Kelechi Iheanacho shot into the side-netting before Son’s breakaway salted Leicester’s wounds."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dc925b996f455271083beb5f5cdcba62b2834da5/178_0_2759_1723/master/2759.jpg?width=660\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=455bc175cf2202e9f2be1c8eded88882 660w","title":"bristol students betrayed labour corbyn brexit","story":"Students in the Bristol seat that returned the referendum’s second largest remain vote speak of their sense being betrayed by the Labour partyAt the grand entrance of the Wills Memorial Building, crafted from Bath stone around a century ago and dominated by a 60-metre neo-Gothic tower, George Smith pulls out his earbuds and says: “Funny you should ask, I was just thinking about Brexit.”Although the 18-year-old Bristol university student was too young to vote in the 2016 referendum, he is a firm Remain supporter.

Wyle was at Glastonbury in June 2017 when Corbyn told hundreds of thousands of people chanting his name that “another world was possible” and that people had been “brought back into politics because they believed there was something on offer for them”.In an election today, Wyle says, he’d be tempted to vote Green. “Corbyn has lost his momentum. He’s still a good guy, but he could have been so much better. He’s always said he hates politicians who don’t talk straight and say what they believe – but he’s turned out to be one of those people.”Many young people are disillusioned by Labour’s refusal to take a strong stand against Brexit, according to Sam Hickmott, 20, who chairs Bristol for Europe. The group, which claims 8,000 to 10,000 supporters, runs street stalls, holds speaker events and encourages the public to write to MPs about Brexit. “I’m not a Labour member, but I liked Corbyn. But I wouldn’t vote for him now,” says Hickmott, a self-employed gardener.“He’s still got diehard fans, but a lot of people have gone off him. I thought his election meant a move away from the status quo and Labour would be a leftwing party again. But it turns out he’s a Brexiter although he dares not say that. And he used to say he would always listen to party members – but they’ve been ignored on this,” he says.“Brexit is the defining issue of our generation. And it’s going to go on for years, sucking the energy out of issues like climate change and poverty.”In an election, Hickmott says he would vote for Debbonaire, “despite Corbyn, not because of him”.Others say simply they are sick of Brexit and politicians. “I just tune out now. I don’t understand why they can’t sort it out,” says Ellie Fairweather. “I have no idea what’s going to happen I just know it’s going to be bad.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b760588bbc909bf1095331e35e10cf6846a2fa90/0_1830_5504_3302/master/5504.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=452a0e9d24b7f7678a0d0c0835b4e541","title":"jorja smith ive always been independent drake grammy kendrick","story":"At 21, Jorja Smith has already worked with everyone from Drake to Kendrick Lamar. Now, up for a Grammy and three Brit Awards, she’s on the cusp of superstardomA lot of musicians will fib and say they don’t pay attention to industry awards, such as the Grammys and the Brits. And that’s exactly what Jorja Smith does. Except the 21-year-old soul singer from Walsall might actually be telling the truth. Tonight the Grammys will be presented in Los Angeles Alicia Keys is the host, Dolly Parton the guest of honour. Smith was so oblivious to this fact that she booked a show, halfway round the world, in Western Australia for the same day. Then it was announced in December that she was up for Best New Artist.So how did Smith celebrate? She looks a bit confused, like it’s a trick question. “Hugged my boyfriend,” she replies. “And that was it.”Our conversation is taking place in a cab on the way to Heathrow. Smith is heading out to New Zealand. She’ll honour the first few days of her tour but then – sorry Fremantle – duck out early to zip across to the Grammys. She’s a long shot to win the award: her debut album, Lost \u0026amp Found, which was released last summer, didn’t crack the top 40 in the US, and she’s up against established names such as Dua Lipa and the R\u0026ampB star HER. But, again, if Smith is remotely stressed about the company she’s keeping, she’s not showing it.“It’s great being… I wouldn’t say up against, it’s just great being recognised among these talented people,” she says. “People like HER… Who else is in there? I knew when I looked, but now I’ve forgotten. Sorry.”To be fair to Smith, it can’t be easy keeping track of all the awards she’s up for. Since winning the Critics’ Choice at the 2018 Brits – which, from Adele to Sam Smith to Rag’n’Bone Man, has a near-unerring hit-rate for predicting future success – she’s been shortlisted for the Mercury Prize and she returns to the Brits later this month with three more nominations: best British female solo, British album and British breakthrough act.If Smith isn’t on your radar right now, you might want to rectify that. And it won’t take long to realise what the fuss is about. Smith is often name-checked with Sade, Alicia Keys and Adele and it’s true that her vocals, smoky yet somehow soothing, have a richness and complexity that comes along rarely. Introducing her at a show in Toronto in 2017, the Canadian rapper Drake described her as: “One of the most incredible voices, incredible talents and incredible humans I’ve ever met.”Such attention could, and should, be head-spinning. There is a moment, when we are bombing down the A4, where she pops a brace into her mouth and it’s genuinely shocking to realise – to be reminded really – that’s she’s only 21. Three years ago she was sitting her A-levels. When Drake was heaping praise on her, she’d not long given up a job as a barista in Starbucks. She starts our conversation warily, but quickly warms up. There’s a preternatural assurance here, one that explains how a young woman from the West Midlands, growing up with no connections in the industry, finds herself in LA tonight waiting to find out if she’s won another life-changing award.Smith’s mother, Jolene, a jewellery designer, was the first to notice that she might have a special voice. “When I was eight I sang at church in front of everyone,” Smith recalls. “My mum used to make me sing, tell people I could sing and I hated that. I was so embarrassed!” She played piano and wrote her first song, aged 11, titled Life is a Path Worth Taking, but she concedes that life at home with her younger brother and parents – dad, Peter, was a benefits officer who played in a neo-soul band named 2nd Naicha – didn’t give her very much material.“When I was younger I wasn’t really going through anything traumatic or bad,” says Smith. “I have my parents and I went to school, didn’t really get in trouble. I was naughty at home yeah, still am. But I liked making stories up and turning them into songs.”Her teenage years brought insecurity, about her looks and, at times, about being mixed race. “All my friends were white, they were all slim and had long hair,” says Smith. “I didn’t want to have big lips or a bum. In school you’re so confined to a small space and the boys like the blonde girls and they didn’t like me. But it’s all right, I got over it.”Music became more serious when, at the age of 15, she was bought a MacBook. On the program GarageBand, Smith would record covers and upload videos to YouTube one of these, her take on Alex Clare’s Too Close, found her a manager. After school, she left Walsall for south London, where she lived with relatives and took a job in Starbucks. All the while, Smith was writing, putting out tracks on Soundcloud, and it was one of these – Where Did I Go? – that found its way to Drake. He made contact on Instagram, said the song had kept him sane on a long flight, and asked her to do a duet on a song called Get It Together. Smith, scarcely believably, said no, because in her words: “I didn’t write it, I didn’t know what I was talking about.” But she changed her mind a year later and the track appeared on his ubiquitous 2017 mixtape More Life.Before the release of Lost \u0026amp Found, Smith was mainly known for such collaborations: with Drake, and on the Kali Uchis track Tyrant, and on Kendrick Lamar’s soundtrack for the Black Panther movie she also shared vocals with Stormzy on a song of her own, Let Me Down. These were positive experiences, she says, but it’s a relief now that she doesn’t always get asked about, say, what Drake smells like. Or have to deny that they are dating: a rumour that blossomed in early 2017 after the pair was seen late-night shopping at the Co-op in Walsall after a gig in Birmingham. Smith clarified that he had tagged along when she was buying wine gums and tampons, and that was that.“It was never part of my plan to work with Kendrick or Drake or Kali, but they just added to everything,” says Smith now. “Because then I got opened up to a whole new Drake world, a whole new Kendrick world and a Kali world. So I got new fans from it and maybe they were waiting for me to put a project out and then they liked that, hopefully.”Smith’s success is all the more astonishing for the detail that she isn’t backed by a major label. There’s a simple reason for that: she doesn’t much like being told what to do. That clear-headedness could be seen at the Observer’s photo shoot. “If I don’t like something, I won’t wear it,” says Smith, who has now changed into her travelling outfit of a Mondrian-ish Nike tracksuit, with her hair scraped back into a tight bun. She giggles: “I have a lot of control, yeah.“I’ve just always done it this way,” she continues. “I did a distribution deal for my album, but I’ve always been independent without a major-label record deal. And I’m fine. I just feel the same as I was when I moved to London. My team has got bigger, but it’s still really small. How can you have problems when you’re doing what you want and no one’s actually telling you no? Not that no one’s telling me no. But no one’s telling me, ‘You must do this!’ or, ‘You can’t do this!’”It’s tempting to offer Smith patronising advice, and she gets that a lot. People she meets – journalists, industry execs – do it all the time. Why doesn’t she write more fast songs? That’s the main one. “People mention how my songs are quite slow,” says Smith. “Well, cool. If you don’t want to listen to slow songs, don’t listen to me. I’ve been asked, ‘If you hear music in the charts, it’s upbeat, why don’t you want to write music like that?’ But I write something that I think’s good. With this album I wanted to make something classic. Something that doesn’t just get played once and then left in your music library.”This is the point: Smith is doing all right on her own. Her dad keeps an eye on the charts – Lost \u0026amp Found reached number three in the UK – but again, she feigns complete indifference.“No, I don’t look at sales,” she says. “As long as no one tells me I’m in red, no one tells me I’m in debt, and I can still pay my rent and feed my dog, then I’m fine. And feed myself, of course. I’m good with my money so I’m not really worried about that.”We’re now idling in the drop-off parking spots at Heathrow. This is Smith’s life now. So busy, so in demand that work expands into almost every small fissure of the day. Her only downtime is when she’s sleeping or running 5k at the gym: “I only need to think about not falling off the treadmill rather than thinking about this email I know needs an answer.”That’s fame, I suggest. “Don’t want to be famous,” Smith shoots back. “I’m not famous. People” – she pauses, picks her words – “know about me. No, do you know what? I don’t have goals or bucket lists because I don’t like being disappointed. But famous? Famous is like Rihanna. I’m not Rihanna. I’ve got a lot of work to do. I’d like to be successful. That’s what I’d like. And happy.”As for what’s next, Smith just wants to get back to writing. “Or else I’ll never put out another album. And this year I will write more stuff.”And oh, horse riding. For her next video, which Smith plans to direct herself, of course, she wants to gallop on a horse, bareback. There are only two problems here: one, that is really difficult and two, Smith has next to no experience on horses. But, as ever, she is unfazed. “I’ve only told you that,” she says, opening the car door, “so let’s see if it happens.”Jorja Smith’s latest single, Don’t Watch Me Cry, is out nowFashion credits: editor Jo Jones production and styling assisted by Bemi Shaw makeup by Carol Lopez at Carol Hayes Management using Marc Jacobs Beauty hair by Zateesha Barbous using Angel En Province manicure by Pria Bharma using The Gel Bottle pedicure by Izabelle Bellamy using Nails Inc fashion assistant Penny Chan photographer’s assistants Joe Murphy and Louie Mire"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3df17cb36edb935775e28ea8b9a185aee9f93cae/0_273_1365_818/master/1365.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9927cc8f897bd4a1a33e09eed91950fa","title":"tales of unravelling minds a neuropsychologists darkest days ak benjamin","story":"AK Benjamin has written a funny, truthful and shocking book about his own struggles with drink and drugs as he tried to help his mentally disordered patientsMeeting the author and neuropsychologist AK Benjamin is bit like an encounter with a spy or someone in witness protection. First of all, AK Benjamin is not his real name. He doesn’t want to say what that is. Or where he lives. “Asia” is as specific as he gets about his current address. He won’t say where in England he was originally from – his accent suggests it wasn’t too far from Manchester – or which university he went to, or where he has worked. But there are some details he is prepared to ulge. There are hints at his age – mid-to-late 40s. Aside from being a trained neuropsychologist – that is, a psychologist who works with people with neurological conditions or injuries – he has been a scriptwriter in the British film industry, he set up a charity, was a monk in California, has worked with gang members in US prisons and South American sex workers, is a father of two daughters, and for a decade was a self-destructive alcoholic and drug addict.It sounds like five different lives crashed into one, which is, curiously, very much the impression Benjamin gives in the flesh. Not through anything he says, but just the way he looks, with an aura of intensity that seems to hover over him like an electrical storm.Despite his close-cropped head, he doesn’t look like a monk. And nowadays he’s not, but he doesn’t look like someone who was ever a monk or, come to that, a neuropsychologist. He bears a passing resemblance to Kiefer Sutherland in his Jack Bauer days – wiry but muscular and tightly wound. He looks, as they say, as if he could look after himself, although looking after himself has in many respects been a struggle for Benjamin, even as he was looking after others. This struggle and the plight of those in his care are the subject of his first book, Let Me Not Be Mad.It starts out as a series of case studies in which a neuropsychologist holds clinics with various patients. There is, for example, a woman, known only as “You”, who, slipping into premature dementia, pierces the professional’s heart. There’s “Michael”, an all-action businessman who suffers a brain injury while base-jumping that transforms his personality – or does it enable emergence of the one he’d been repressing? There are also other patients who may or may not be versions of the narrator – ie the neuropsychologist – undergoing psychological assessment.On the surface the stories are told with that precise clinical detachment – jargon and protocols explained – familiar from many medical memoirs. But the style is almost ironic because beneath it there is a great swell of compassion, black comedy and astute personal observation constantly threatening to break through. Slowly we begin to see that the clinician is also suffering. As the encounters grow more uncertain and even surreal, it becomes evident that during episodes of paranoia, insomnia, aggression and delusion, the person most in danger of losing his mind is, in fact, the narrator. So why the pseudonym and surrounding mystery?“Because I want to protect people who know me, the people I’ve treated and who I will treat in the future,” he tells me in a café in King’s Cross. He’s worried patients might project things from the book on to themselves, or that some might be disturbed, as he puts it, “to see an incarnation of me debasing myself”.Debasing? It’s certainly a strange and powerful work of… well, what exactly? You can’t call it a memoir as although drawn from his life, it’s written through a fictionalised filter that, at times, is dark and distorting. But then nor is it a novel. If anything, it occupies that increasingly disputed borderland between fiction and nonfiction, where many of today’s most intriguing writers gather. Benjamin mentions Ben Lerner and Emmanuel Carrère, both of whom are difficult to categorise, as writers he admires.The first writer that engaged young Benjamin was Fyodor Dostoevsky. He was a troubled boy, he says, upset by his parents’ orce and unsettled by moving from school to school. From an early age, he felt he didn’t fit in and he knew life was going to be difficult. Then he read Crime and Punishment. “I hadn’t read a book before that,” he recalls. At the same time he discovered alcohol and girls. The combination of high literature, booze and romance proved painfully irresistible. What followed was drink, drugs, heartbreak – and books that made sense of the chaos. He managed to make it to university, but was asked to take a year out because of his alcohol and drug abuse. Nevertheless he had plans to become an academic. Then he fell in love with a woman who was going into the film industry. So he decided to follow her.He describes it as a “catastrophic” time in his life. While everyone else seemed to realise that there was a serious point to what they were doing, he just thought: “We’re in a playground, what’s the point of going home now when we can stay out?” Was he a binge drinker? “Yeah. But I binged every night.” What drugs was he using? “Mainly things that helped with the drinking. Coke and speed.”Benjamin’s dreams of making elaborate arthouse films went nowhere. At 28, having hit what he describes as “rock bottom”, he decided to get sober. He joined AA and NA, but his way of dealing with life without drink and drugs was to set up a charity for homeless people with drink and drug problems. He still had a lot of pent-up anger, which he tried to channel into Thai boxing. “I got to semi-professional status,” he says, “but I was just constantly working out if I could take that guy and that guy at the same time. So that wasn’t useful.”He started visiting retreats in the UK and then joined a monastery on the west coast of America, living as a monk. He sang psalms and read philosophy, in between helping gang members and sex workers. He says he’s long had an urge to help people worse off than himself, partly as a coping mechanism. “I think I’ve always experienced the world quite intensely one way or another. I don’t want to make myself exceptional, but at the same time there are aspects of being alive that I’ve found extremely difficult. Being around people who have got it much worse has been one helpful way.”While he was a monk – not an environment renowned for procreative possibilities – he realised he wanted to have children. And it was then he met a spiritual mentor who told him he should work in neuroscience and psychology and spend his life writing about it. And that’s precisely what he did. He returned to the UK, went back to university at 32, qualified as a clinical psychologist and didn’t complete his studies entirely until he was 44, by which time he’d been seeing patients for about eight years.He met a partner and they quite quickly had two girls. Was fatherhood the experience that he’d hoped for? He thinks for a while. “There’s a narrative that goes, ‘Ever since I became a parent I’ve been the second most important person in my life and it’s such a relief.’ That’s not been my experience. It’s been another level of guilt, another sense of failure,” he says.That sounds bleak, but Benjamin is one of those people for whom awkward honesty will always come before social niceties. However, he does break into a broad smile when talking about the “pleasure and exuberant joy” he gains from being around his children.He also derived a lot of satisfaction from his job. “Building up relationships with people who are either on the brink of some terrible neurological devastation or on the other side of it is tremendously meaningful,” he says. But he found NHS neurological departments too restrictive and the medicalised environment increasingly alienating. “When you do an interview for clinical training,” he says, “you’re told not to say you were moved to do something like this because you care for people, because that’s regarded as woolly, anti-scientific bullshit. But that was the reason I wanted to do it.”He argues that patient sensitivities are overlooked by health professionals. The way first consultations are conducted is, he says, “hugely important in setting a tone and raising awareness”. In his opinion most doctors are terrible at it, because they’re too intent on establishing their authority rather than assessing the patient’s psychological or emotional needs.While he didn’t undergo the breakdown he depicts in Let Me Not Be Mad, he did suffer what he calls “burn-out”. The relationship with the mother of his children didn’t survive. He moved out, took a sabbatical, and headed off to Asia. What impact has this time away had on his children? “The relationship feels solid, but there’s an edge to them about it for sure,” he says and tells me about his pre-teen daughter who, when she discovered he was writing a book and its title, suggested with the same acid tongue of her father that it should be called “Let Me Not Be Dad”. They have reached an agreement that he’s going to spend more time with them in the future.All the same, I say, I can’t picture him in a settled, conventional life. “Thanks,” he says, pretending to take offence. “That’s all changed now. I’m in a stable…” He’s about to affect a new-found contentment, but stops, admitting he can’t maintain the fiction. He tells me he’s working on a book now called The Case for Love, which will involve further clinical vignettes.“It tries to work out how we’re capable of loving certain people and not capable of loving others,” he explains. It is unlikely, I suspect, to be a romantic, feel-good kind of book, but if his first richly impressive literary work is anything to go by, it will expose those unsettling truths that lie at that base of our psyches, where few us are brave enough or mad enough to venture.Let Me Not Be Mad: a Story of Unravelling Minds by AK Benjamin, Vintage, £16.99, or £14.95 at bookshop"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d11ee38ee84ad28b3dc35fa8d6e38ab770a3af02/0_0_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b8a015dddd4a1fb8fd098722a2ae1940","title":"10 of the best fitness trackers to buy","story":"From sleep to smart notifications, fitness trackers do much more than just count your daily steps.

Is there something you are not ulging?The dilemma For the past few months I have been befriended by a lesbian couple who welcomed me into their lives as family. I am a 40-year-old single, straight female and was greatly flattered by their attention. I enjoyed helping them out, unasked, financially, as I often do with family members I am close to. After spending a terrific week together (at their invitation), I left for my home overseas promising I would be back in six weeks to join one of them on a trip they had begged me to take with them, although the planned activities were not my choice. Upon landing I received a stilted note from the partner I shared the most with, cancelling the trip with no explanation. My response was simply: “You’ve got to be kidding. Is this a prank?” She replied: “No, it’s true.” Since then they have stayed silent. I am beyond hurt by this sudden cruel behaviour when I have always exhibited the utmost kindness towards them. I now dread that I may never hear from them again.Mariella replies You’re pushing me into uncharted waters here. Not because your friends are a lesbian couple, or because you’ve helped them out a bit with money, or because they’ve cancelled this impending trip without explanation – but because you consider these elements as trigger, motive and insult. It suggests you have an instinct about what might be the cause of this upset and perhaps pride, shame or self-righteous incredulity are hampering you from accepting what you sense but won’t confront.I have no idea what your friendship was based on or what the dynamic was between the three of you. Describing a relatively new friendship as family rings warning bells, though, and your outrage at the trip’s cancellation seems overwrought. The fact that the trip may have been causing issues between the partners is perfectly plausible. Why would you dread “never” hearing from them again? I have an overriding feeling that you’re aware of why they have made a decision to turn down the heat and the line of defence you’ve taken in your letter is to convince yourself you’re not at fault.Having had one of the most enduring and rewarding friendships of my life with a lesbian couple I shared a country home with for five years, I’m sure the fact that your buddies are in a same-sex relationship isn’t particularly relevant. But let’s start there for the heck of it. Three can definitely be a “crowd” and friendships require careful management just like any other relationship. Your being “greatly flattered” by their attention suggests a misplaced thrill. Friendships require full disclosure and honesty if they are to be meaningful and long-term. There’s little place for empty flattery. Often what’s best about your pals is that they aren’t family and don’t come with quite so many already taut emotional strings attached.If your interest in the relationship, and indeed theirs, was sparked by impulses that went unspoken then that would certainly complicate matters. I’ve no idea if your financial contributions were the lure you seem to suggest, but the golden rule with money is never give it unless you’re sanguine about losing it. The ability to use it as a weapon is way too strong and the sense of power it provides the giver and resentment or shame in the receiver are two of the strongest polluters of relationships. It’s perfectly feasible that you’ve tampered with the balance of power between this couple, using your charm, your money or the favouring of one partner over the other. You mention that your stilted note was from the partner you shared most with. Could you have shared too much, creating discomfort in her girlfriend? There aren’t many heterosexual couples that would withstand the pressure of one of them holidaying with a “friend” of the opposite sex and there’s no reason why this lesbian couple should be any different.I do smell something fishy when you bring up your financial generosity. You don’t explain why it should be relevant, but raising it confirms it’s a potentially contributing factor. Another unsettling element is your stuff about family. They aren’t your family and while I agree that, increasingly, friends are as important as blood relatives, it takes more than a few months for a relationship to reach that elevated status. You sound as if you’re looking to be adopted and that’s not a healthy impulse. Most of us are overwrought and trying to shed responsibilities in adulthood, not add new ones. I suggest you take a step back and let this upset be a catalyst to look at where you are in your life. This shouldn’t stand out as a seismic event, so there must be something you aren’t ulging. My sense is that you are projecting your own insecurity on to a situation and therefore over-complicating it. Take a breath, give them some space and keep your money to yourself. Then have a think about why you’re looking for “family” and whether you’re chasing it down in the wrong places.

First of all, he says, he never really liked or went to clubs. Nor was he ever much of a dancer. And despite his profound impact on, well, both clubs and dancing, he would prefer it if we stopped referring to him as the grandfather of dance music.“No, and I do not like being called the godfather of disco and electronic music either,” he says, wryly. “It’s better than being called the grandfather, but I still don’t like it.”But it’s not an overstatement to declare that Moroder definitively changed the face of modern pop. The man who created what Brian Eno breathlessly described to David Bowie as “the sound of the future” had a staggering knack for creating floorfillers that have birthed entire genres: one track alone, the euphoric 1977 Donna Summer mega-smash I Feel Love, has been credited with paving the way for Italo, house, techno, trance, Bollywood disco and, for better or worse, EDM.“Can you dance to it? I don’t even like dancing, but my wife dances quite well a lot.”I tell him I danced so hard to it at a wedding recently that my entire sari unravelled on the dancefloor. He roars. “Maybe that’s why I make good club music – because I don’t go to clubs!”Not only will this be his first ever live showing for the raft of iconic hits he and Summer created together, but a chance to revisit the golden period when Moroder released From Here to Eternity (1977) reinvented Sparks (No.1 in Heaven, 1979) produced Janet Jackson (Dream Street, 1984) worked with David Bowie (Cat People, 1982) and gifted Phil Oakey his then biggest hit (Together in Electric Dreams, 1984).Is he nervous?“All my life I was backstage, in the studio, in the background, but nervous? Me? Not at all.” He chuckles. Moroder may have worked with the biggest egos in film and music, but it doesn’t seem to have rubbed off he is softly tuned, self-effacing company. “If I were to play the piano or designed difficult things then I would be nervous, but I do exactly what I want to do and the big work is not mine – that will be the singers, and they are absolutely top.”He considers himself an average musician. “I learned a little about music, I play a little, I play enough to compose but with a computer, if you make a mistake you just redo it as often as you need. I could never play live what we have the musicians doing on stage or in the studio.”And yet, at his peak, Moroder led a hit factory that became dance music’s answer to Motown. Once the disco backlash kicked in, his team of musicians and engineers pivoted to Hollywood and scored Flashdance, Midnight Express, Scarface, American Gigolo, Top Gun and much more. He won four Golden Globes and three Oscars for his film work, and picked up four Grammys in a career that has ned more than a dozen studio albums. With the sort of silly money offers that come with the reputation Moroder had, it was inevitable that he also produced a fair amount of dross: blustering arena rock, cornball 80s guitars and a line of commissions for Olympics anthems. At one point, he was convinced by Sylvester Stallone to visit Bob Dylan at home in Malibu to ask if Dylan would write the lyrics for a song Moroder had composed for Rambo III. To his credit, Dylan listened to the track “about four times” before politely declining.A period of apparent quiet kicked in. Moroder married Francisca Gutierrez, the hostess of his favourite restaurant in Los Angeles, became a father at 50, and took up golf. He built and sold cars, designed a pyramid for the Dubai skyline and began spending half the year in Ortisei, the pretty Italian town he grew up in.Then Daft Punk called. The French duo have been lifting from the best of Moroder unashamedly since the beginning of their career their early noughties reconfiguration as a pair of robots was partially in homage to the sleeve of Moroder’s 1977 album, Munich Machine. “All I know is that Daft Punk say they wouldn’t be here without me being there,” he says, with an emphatic shrug.His son urged him to meet them, but Moroder didn’t think too much of the experience and had almost forgotten about it until, two years later, a track called Giorgio arrived on Random Access Memories, Daft Punk’s 2013 disco album. Suddenly, he was everywhere again: David Guetta, Avicii, Lady Gaga wanted to work with him. He began a DJ career at 73 and played sets across the world. A new album followed, 2015’s best-overlooked Déjà Vu, featuring Britney Spears, Sia, Kylie Minogue et al.Now, every couple of weeks, Moroder sits at the laptop in his home studio and works his way through the US Billboard 100 and UK Top 40 charts on YouTube. “The quality of recording is just so good now,” he marvels. “I love digital, I was one of the first to use it it’s clean. Some people say analogue has a sound that’s more human, but if you really want analogue sound you can have it in the computer too. And I still love dance songs and EDM – not everybody likes it, but I do. Even Ed Sheeran – he has some incredible sounds and arrangements some of the songs now have two billion clicks on YouTube, but they deserve it, they’re so good. All those new guys, they work so hard, I don’t know how some of them handle it.”Moroder is certain that hedonism is far rarer in the industry now than in his heyday. “I was talking to David Guetta recently – he doesn’t even drink coffee! Aoki has maybe one sake and he is exercising all day long. He does 150 shows a year, it’s mindboggling – you can’t drink or be high if you’re working like that. Of course, Avicii was an exception.”Moroder pauses solemnly and strokes his moustache. Swedish DJ Avicii was found dead in a Muscat hotel room last April, aged 28.Did they start kicking in studio equipment?“No, they would just get so high they needed to listen to music so loud, they blew the speakers. They were breaking one every week!”Still, the best of Moroder’s work – Utopia, First Hand Experience in Second Hand Love, Chase – builds to replicate the warm, skittish rush of being high. As the story goes, Love To Love You was extended into a 16-minute epic with Donna Summer moaning in no fewer than 22 recorded orgasms on the demand of Neil Bogart, head of Casablanca Records, who wanted a longer version of the original song to soundtrack the orgies at his house. She recalled being so mortified that she had to record it lying down in the dark.He won’t reveal some of the “terrible decisions” he made and offers he turned down over the years, but he will admit to saying no to being a judge on The X Factor recently. “It was a really big offer, a lot of money, but I was a little nervous. To live in a city which you don’t really like for three months and spend long hours with the TV company … I love to be in the studio and work when I want, so I passed on that.” Instead, a Moroder musical, Mamma Mia! style, is financed and in the works for “2020 at the earliest”, despite the fact “we are still looking for the story. It takes at least a year to find and develop the story.” He is busy but undaunted: “I’m very happy.”What’s the best thing about being Giorgio Moroder, then? He laughs. “Oh, he’s a nice guy! I’ve heard Giorgio is a nice guy – I love him!” This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

Bob Kerslake, the former head of the civil service, said the arrangement would “just confirm the view of many that this country is in a mess”.Asked if he had confidence in Grayling, Brokenshire told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show that the transport secretary had “done a huge amount of work to prepare for our departure from the EU”.Pressed on whether this meant he had faith in Grayling, Brokenshire said: “Yes, I think Chris has done a really tough job, really, really positively to ensure that we are well prepared. I strongly endorse all the work Chris has been doing.”The awarding of the contract to Seaborne to charter and operate freight ferries from Ramsgate to the Belgian port of Ostend if the UK leaves the EU without a deal was announced in December. But the news was soon dominated by the fact that the firm had no ships and had seemingly borrowed the terms and conditions on its website from a food delivery firm.The transport department said the contract had been ended after Seaborne Freight’s financial backer, Arklow Shipping, an Irish firm, decided to “step back from the deal”.The Brexit-backing Conservative MP Jacob Rees-Mogg questioned at the weekend if Arklow’s move had taken place at the behest of the Irish government. But Helen McEntee, Ireland’s European affairs minister, tweeted: “The first time the Dept of Transport heard about it was on the radio this morning. Absolutely no truth to it.”When the news emerged, the Conservative MP and former business minister Anna Soubry said Grayling “should be quietly considering his position”.She said: “Chris Grayling holds a critical position in government, trying to mitigate what would be a very serious crisis for the country if we leave the European Union without a deal. He has no grip on the very serious nature of his job. The prime minister should also be considering whether there is not someone else who could do the job better.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2befaf475a366f354675340a0c3d72f46f03b43d/0_17_4843_2905/master/4843.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ad29fee3ce84edb3fc4d78839328716f","title":"david cameron profile brexit memoirs weeks before we leave eu","story":"With Brexit weeks away, many see the former PM as the man who wrecked Britain. Cameron’s memoirs will reveal more but meanwhile, we ask his friends and former colleagues: where did it all go wrong and where does he go from here?In the icy depths of late January, just as Theresa May was absorbing the latest parliamentary defeat for her Brexit plan, David Cameron landed in the sunshine of southern India. He had been hired to deliver a lecture on geopolitics, plus a few amusing cricket anecdotes, in Chennai, in honour of the late Indian entrepreneur KS Narayanan. The businessman was known in his home country for quitting while he was ahead, retiring at the height of his powers. Cameron, however, is better known for doing the opposite.The official line is that the man who brought us Brexit, and then walked away whistling from his final farewell to the nation, has no regrets that all will explained in the memoirs he is due to publish later this year, and that meanwhile he is enjoying an agreeable retirement on the international speaking circuit. In private, it’s not that simple. He may be more sanguine about it than his old friend George Osborne, but Brexit has ided the Camerons’ social circle just as it has ided the country, and they have not been spared the backlash. One society hostess entertaining the couple recently had to ring fellow guests in advance, checking that they would be able to keep things civil not all the responses were positive. Even his wife Samantha’s Instagram feed, devoted mainly to holiday snaps and puffs for her new fashion business, is occasionally invaded by passersby criticising her husband.Meanwhile, the world is moving on without him. Osborne has reinvented himself as a newspaper editor even Nick Clegg has a swanky new life in California working for Facebook. But Cameron seems oddly stuck. Rumours that he fancies coming back as foreign secretary seem wide of the mark, but one old acquaintance describes him as being in an “incredibly reflective and self-searching” mood. “I think this is a really difficult time for him. He’s rethinking the usefulness of his time, all the decisions he made. Look at the Hagues and the Cleggs and the Osbornes, they’re all doing really well, and he’s the odd one out. He’s not been able to carve out a new life.”When in London, his day often starts with a run, after which there might be meetings – he is president of the charity Alzheimer’s Research UK, works two or three days a month for the US firm First Data Corporation, and serves on an academic commission on fragile states – or a gossipy lunch at someone’s club. Weekends are often spent either at the Camerons’ new bolthole in Cornwall or their Oxfordshire constituency home, where he famously installed a chichi revamped shepherd’s hut in which to finish his memoirs. But he lacks a grand purpose. Even the UK-China investment fund he is leading seems unfortunately timed, with Chinese growth slowing and wariness about Chinese companies being used for political ends.Writing the book has meanwhile forced him to relive painful decisions, and despite predictions that he will use it to settle scores with the likes of former friend Michael Gove, colleagues expect it to be reflective. “I know he’ll be very proud of what he did manage to achieve and I think he’ll put his case across, but you always wonder: ‘What if I’d done that differently?’” says a former aide. “You live it over again, and I think he will be quite honest.”For some, Cameron will always be the man who wrecked his country in a clumsy attempt to save his party. At worst, a bad Brexit could break not just the economy, but the union – giving Scotland new reasons to seek independence, even pushing Northern Irish voters towards unification with the south – and the political party system, if both Labour and the Tories are punished by voters for enabling it. Even if it somehow miraculously delivers everything leavers promised, Cameron probably won’t get the credit. “If it’s a success he didn’t want it, and if it’s failure he was the one who didn’t avert it. Brexit is his legacy in the same way Iraq was Blair’s,” says Tim Montgomerie, the pro-leave Conservative commentator.Had Brexit never happened, Cameron would still have bequeathed us the bedroom tax and axed Sure Start centres. He would be the man who cut tax credits for the poor while abolishing the 50p tax rate for the wealthiest, left headteachers soliciting donations from parents so they could buy basic supplies, and whose “jobs miracle” (record levels of employment) relied heavily on insecure and part-time work. And his defence for all this – that without austerity, Britain would have lost its credit rating and faced even more painful cuts – relies on something that can never be definitively proven. Whatever happened to the 39-year-old who became Conservative leader on a wave of such hope and promise?Back in 2005, David Cameron embodied everything a party that had lost three elections could want from a leadership candidate: charisma, confidence, and a sense of being at ease with modern Britain. True, he was an Old Etonian. But he was also a father who spent nights sleeping on the floor in A\u0026ampE, watching over his oldest son, Ivan, who suffered from a rare disorder that would sadly claim his life at the age of six. This Cameron argued earnestly for more understanding of young offenders, and demonstrated his eco-credentials by posing with huskies in the Arctic.Yet much of that turned to slush when he entered Downing Street in 2010. The man who evangelised about “sharing the proceeds of growth” so everyone benefited from rising prosperity found himself in the aftermath of a banking crash with no growth to share. A leader temperamentally suited to good times would wield the axe instead.Hints of the old sunny Cameron still surfaced periodically. For Nick Boles, a founding member of the “Notting Hill set” of socially liberal conservatives around Cameron, the legalisation of gay marriage in 2013 was “the high watermark” of modernisation in office.“It was sort of classic Dave, in that it was a liberal progressive and even radical move that involved extending one of the most conservative and traditional institutions around,” recalls Boles, who as an equalities minister helped steer the legislation and later used it to marry his own partner. “And it rang true because he was the most uxorious person I’ve ever met. I’ve never seen somebody so totally, utterly in love with his wife, who felt marriage was the best thing that ever happened to him. It was genuine, it wasn’t calculation.” It changed minds, as well as lives. And crucially, in championing it against fierce grassroots opposition Cameron was “putting people before party”, says Boles. It was the opposite of what he would later be accused of doing in the referendum.Beyond that, however, the record gets patchier. Military intervention in Libya soon turned sour and a frustrated Cameron couldn’t secure parliamentary consent to intervene in Syria. The two biggest public sector reforms were Andrew Lansley’s structural reorganisation of the NHS, which baffled most people outside the NHS and exasperated many within it, and Iain Duncan Smith’s rolling up of six separate welfare benefits into one universal credit. The latter is now a byword for bureaucratic incompetence and unintended cruelty, inextricably linked in the public mind with food bank use, rent arrears and evictions Duncan Smith himself eventually resigned over cuts to disability benefit, saying the project had been scuppered by insufficient resources.For many Labour voters, the welfare reforms alone would be damning. But for Conservatives who view austerity as having been painful but necessary to balance the books, the critique is different.The advantage of that “chillaxed” leadership style is that it arguably helped hold a potentially fractious coalition together. Cameron’s partnership with Clegg survived a full five years at least partly because he was unusually tolerant of dissent and pragmatic about compromises. (Were he still around now, some suspect he’d be rather better than Theresa May at brokering truces between warring Brexit camps.) His early career as a Treasury adviser during the Major years, the last time the Conservative party was this ided over Europe, left him suspicious of ideological purists in general as well as allergic to “banging on” about Europe in particular. He was insistent there was no such thing as Cameronism, that what mattered was what worked.“My general view of Cameron is that he held every belief fairly lightly. There was nothing very much he really believed passionately in,” says Montgomerie. “But I think that’s perfectly authentically Conservative, I think pragmatism and not believing in anything in a theological way is actually quite an important Conservative instinct.” But from the beginning, the downside of that flexibility was a willingness to put tactics above strategy.Back in 2005, Cameron was lagging behind David Davis, the initial frontrunner in the leadership race, when he gave a Daily  interview promising two things that sounded strangely at odds with his modernising agenda. One was tax breaks for marriage, and the second was an obscure hobbyhorse of the Eurosceptic right: taking the Tories out of the centre-right European People’s Party group (EPP) within the European parliament.The latter proposal was “entirely cynical”, says one MP who played a prominent role in his leadership campaign: “I’m sure Dave could persuade himself that we should have our own grouping at an intellectual level, but it was a stunt. It didn’t matter to him at all.” But it was an early indicator of willingness to gamble on Europe for short-term gain. Years later, leaving the EPP would arguably make it harder for Cameron to build the goodwill needed when trying to renegotiate Britain’s EU membership.His 2010 manifesto promise to reduce immigration to the “tens of thousands”, paving the way for the now infamous hostile environment for immigrants created by his home secretary, Theresa May, in an attempt to meet it, was arguably more sincerely meant. Cameron genuinely believed, says a colleague, that the British people had a “right to know that we understood” their feelings on immigration.But in making the promise, he essentially accepted Ukip’s argument that immigration was too high. Once it was obvious the target couldn’t be met while free movement within the EU existed, what then?Opinion was sharply ided when Cameron began thinking aloud, halfway through his first parliament, about an in-out referendum to settle the Europe question. Andrew Feldman, the party’s co-chairman and a close friend since Oxford, was against election strategist Lynton Crosby was wary. At a kitchen cabinet meeting to discuss options, Osborne warned that losing would be catastrophic. But Mitchell, by then chief whip, raised a different concern. “George told him not to do it because he might lose. I thought we couldn’t possibly lose, but I told him he shouldn’t do it because he was using a referendum to solve a party management issue,” he recalls. The charge of putting the whole country through the mill to solve an internal Tory psychodrama has been made ever since.Why did Cameron ignore the warnings? In his memoirs he is likely to defend it as democracy in action, giving the people the final say. But it was also surely driven by arithmetic. The splitting of the rightwing vote, with disgruntled Tories defecting to Ukip, had long hampered Conservative leaders but coalition turned a festering problem into an urgent one. Leftwing votes had also been split between two parties but were now consolidating, as Liberal Democrat voters swung to Labour in protest at their party entering coalition. His own backbenchers were jittery, threatening to oust him. If Cameron wanted more than one term in office, he needed those Ukip voters back.Boles is convinced that without promising a referendum in 2015, Cameron would have lost the general election. “I don’t see any way that he could have remained in No 10 in any form, in coalition or in a majority government. It had been building for so long and the Ukip situation was very real.” Tactically it worked, with Cameron becoming the first sitting prime minister since Palmerston to increase both his vote share and number of seats held. Yet, in seeking to ward off what he saw as the socialist threat from Ed Miliband, he unleashed a chain of events that may yet make Jeremy Corbyn prime minister.Cameron appears to have seen the referendum primarily as a safety valve, a means of releasing pent-up rightwing urges relatively harmlessly before getting on with what he regarded as the real business of the second term: returning to the themes that originally won him the Tory leadership.Shortly after the 2015 election, he asked the Downing Street policy unit to draw up a “life chances” agenda, envisaged as a way of bringing the party back together after the referendum. The strategy was designed to improve poorer children’s future prospects by investing in the early years, helping families at key transition times during childhood and into adulthood, and tackling social issues such as addiction. Having already decided to quit before the 2020 election to spend more time with Samantha and their three surviving children, Cameron wanted to focus in his final years on becoming the social reformer he had always intended. The dream was to go out on a high having lanced the Europe boil, belatedly balanced the national books and returned to the sunlit uplands of his early vision.Christian Guy was brought into Downing Street to work on the life chances programme from the Centre for Social Justice, a thinktank set up by Iain Duncan Smith that, in opposition, had taken Cameron on tours of the kind of deprived neighbourhoods Tory leaders rarely visited. “I think he met people that really moved him, and his eyes were opened to what was really going on. His instinct was to reform and change,” Guy recalls. “I never saw the Cameron that was all ‘steady as she goes’. He’d get frustrated with people who would kick things into the long grass.”There was some scepticism within Cameron’s inner circle about all this, partly because the intended beneficiaries were considered unlikely to vote Tory. But it appealed to Cameron’s sense of moral decency, building on his earlier notion of creating a “big society” – in which people recognised their responsibilities towards the less fortunate – which had fizzled out for lack of concrete ideas. As Guy puts it: “Deficit reduction he always felt was his duty, but the moral mission was social reform. Europe was something he just wanted to get out of the way so he could do these social reforms.”Had he won the referendum, it’s by no means guaranteed that Cameron would have got the chance. The jockeying for succession had begun the moment he admitted, in March 2015, that he wouldn’t stand for a third term even before the referendum, Boris Johnson’s supporters were boasting of submitting letters to the 1922 committee urging a leadership contest. If he’d won the EU vote, the right might still have come for him, triggering a contest that Johnson could well have won. “Boris’s great mistake was to win the referendum, in a way,” says Boles.But the fact that he was already in a tight corner may have helped convince Cameron he had nothing to lose from a referendum. As Guy points out, his instinct was usually to confront an argument head on. “Other politicians at a time of crisis would duck out of view he used to come in fired up. He had that ability – in party conference, in cabinet, in places where they frankly wanted to string him up – to lead.”In the recent BBC documentary series Inside Europe, Downing Street policy adviser Mats Persson recalled proposing a 2017 referendum to Cameron, only for the latter’s chief of staff to argue that if they left it that long Cameron would be “tired” of the issue by then. So it was pencilled in for 2016, leaving far too little time to overturn decades of British governments portraying Brussels as an enemy requiring handbagging into submission.Before Ireland’s referendum on repealing the abortion ban, the government published specific proposals for replacing it and held citizens’ meetings exploring the issue in detail. The referendum itself was bitterly fought, but voters largely understood what they were being asked and what might happen next.Cameron’s preparations, meanwhile, consisted of demanding concessions on immigration from Brussels which were refused, only reinforcing Eurosceptic voters’ sense of powerlessness. He failed to grasp how many Labour voters would see the referendum as a chance to hit back at the man who inflicted austerity on them. And he made far too few contingency plans for losing, leaving Whitehall exposed to a crisis for which it was woefully underprepared. On 24 June, the man who defined himself in opposition to the ideological wing of his party was duly beaten by it.Cameron was criticised for not staying on to help clean up the mess, but the consensus inside Downing Street was that it would be counter-productive. “He emailed me and said: ‘I’ve thought about it and my heart isn’t in what we are going to have to do,’” recalls Christian Guy. “He would have had no authority, or mandate within the EU.” He resolved from the start not to meddle publicly in his successor’s handling of Brexit, delaying publication of his memoirs until this autumn lest he be seen as a backseat driver. But according to his former press secretary, Craig Oliver, he privately favours the soft Norway-style arrangement – outside the EU, but staying in the single market – championed by Boles and Cameron’s former policy chief, Oliver Letwin. At the time of writing, it looks as if he may be disappointed there too.For his friends, the ignominiously abrupt end to Cameron’s political career represents a tragic waste of promise, a story of noble intent derailed by an economic crisis and Conservative neurosis over Europe as much as by his own flaws. Yet others will see an epic misjudgment rivalling Blair’s over Iraq, but without Blair’s redeeming record of prior achievements a leader who thought he had transformed his party, only for it to turn on him. Cameron always was a gifted communicator.

I want to see the Conservative party make sure that we show that that is completely unacceptable.”Asked how she would speak to him, Truss said: “I will be looking for him around the Commons. And I think Conservatives do need to put peer pressure on our colleagues who are stopping these types of things happening.”She added: “When I see one of my colleagues opposing a measure that could have saved girls’ lives, could have saved girls from that horrendous experience, I am absolutely appalled by that.”In a statement, 10 Christchurch councillors said Chope had been invited to explain his actions to the local party association. They said: “They do not believe that pedantry should take precedence over human rights and it is time for the misogynistic old guard to recognise and reflect the opinions of the modern Conservative.”Chope, who gained notoriety after he blocked a bill to make upskirting a criminal offence, used the same Commons procedure on Friday to block a bill tabled by fellow Conservative Zac Goldsmith, shouting “object!” when it was presented for its second reading.The FGM proposal, called the Children Act 1989 (amendment – female genital mutilation) bill, is intended to improve the 2003 law that prohibited the practice by allowing family courts to make interim care orders about children deemed at risk, simplifying the process.Such bills are read out at the end of business without debate, and pass to the next stage if no MP present verbally objects. If there is an objection, the bill has to be presented again. The government has indicated it will find time from its own Commons timetable to get the bill passed.The communities secretary, James Brokenshire, said Chope’s actions were “really shocking on such a serious issue”. He told BBC One’s Andrew Marr Show: “It is hugely disappointing that this bill is not able to proceed. That is why we are now looking urgently to get government time for legislation to make this happen. Obviously, Sir Christopher’s own association is investigating this. I think that’s the best place for this to be dealt with.” Chope has argued that even if he backs the intent of such bills he objects to them because he does not support the procedural principle of legislation being passed without debate at second reading.As Commons officials read out a series of bills on Friday afternoon, Chope and fellow backbencher Peter Bone objected to a series of them, including another proposed by Goldsmith, to help the finances of Kew Gardens.After he was criticised by ministers including Truss and the home secretary, Sajid Javid, Chope told the : “It is a pity they are indulging in virtue-signalling rather than looking at the substance.”He added: “My constituents know what I am doing. We are having letters saying: ‘What is parliamentary democracy all about?’ I object to bills going through undebated at second reading.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/75e118da4199919eb8bbf4ca31fe96bd0ba44845/0_238_4480_2688/master/4480.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4fd645b57c86e46f91663de675aac0f6","title":"lynton crosby 2022 qatar world cup ctf partners","story":"Tory strategist’s pitch detailed how CTF Partners would spread negative stories and press Fifa to ‘restart bidding process’Sir Lynton Crosby offered to work on a campaign to cancel the 2022 Qatar World Cup and get it awarded to another country in return for £5.5m, according to a leaked plan that gives a rare insight into the activities of one of the world’s best-known political operatives.The detailed pitch document – “a proposal for a campaign to expose the truth of the Qatar regime and bring about the termination of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar” – was written in April last year and personally signed by Crosby.He said that if engaged, his lobbying firm, CTF Partners, would require £300,000 a month for 18 months to focus on efforts to delegitimise the Qatari government and put pressure on Fifa to “restart the bidding process” and award the World Cup to another country.As part of the pitch document, named “Project Ball”, Crosby said CTF Partners could set up full-time war rooms around the world to spread negative stories about Qatar in the mainstream media, run fake grassroots campaigns on social media, and lobby potentially friendly politicians, journalists and academics.The pitch offers a glimpse into the secretive services offered by the Australian political strategist. Following success in his homeland he helped run the last four Conservative general election campaigns. He was given a knighthood by the former prime minister David Cameron after helping to secure an unexpected Conservative-majority government in the 2015 general election.Crosby is also close to the foreign former foreign secretary Boris Johnson, who has repeatedly described Crosby’s use of the “dead cat” media strategy to distract journalists. Johnson recently received a £20,000 interest-free loan from Crosby’s company, which has since been repaid.Crosby’s potential client for Project Ball was a self-styled Qatari opposition leader based in London named Khalid Al-Hail, who says he fled the Gulf country after being detained and tortured.Al-Hail has faced repeated questions over his funding and the nature of his campaign activities in London, which include his businesses paying MPs and prominent football players to appear at anti-Qatar events. His events have often aligned with the foreign policy objectives of Qatar’s regional enemies in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. Al-Hail has previously insisted the funding is from his personal wealth he denies receiving money from governments.Crosby’s lawyers said no contract with Al-Hail was ever entered into and none of the work outlined in the proposal was undertaken. They insisted that the proposed work was “hardly controversial” given widespread criticism of the Qatar World Cup bid and human rights in the Gulf country.“It is legitimate for one party to use the services of peopleentities such as our clients to put important information into the public domain in an effective manner,” said the lawyers for Crosby.CTF Partners confirmed it provided Al-Hail with “a minimal amount of media advice” during July’s state visit to London by the emir of Qatar. During this visit a PR company that had previously worked with Al-Hail made a disastrously farcical attempt to pay hundreds of actors to protest outside Downing Street during the emir’s visit to see Theresa May.CTF said it had no role in organising the fake protests and ceased all involvement with Al-Hail “upon hearing about such matters”.Crosby did not respond to a request for comment on claims his company also provided PR support for the Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman during his state visit to the UK last year.The pitch document was seen by the  and the campaign group Spinwatch as part of an investigation into how the UK has become a major centre for global lobbying campaigns as part of the proxy war in the Middle East.In the document Crosby lays out a proposal to coalesce global criticism of Qatar into a single narrative and “expose and undermine the actions of the current regime” in Doha, including linking the state’s activities to terrorism in the minds of the public.“CTF Partners has decades of experience in running campaigns that change or reinforce voter opinions and behaviour,” Crosby said in the document. “That experience tells us that an integrated campaign, professionally run and deploying all the levers of influence available can be successful. We are confident that though challenging this is equally the case with putting pressure on Fifa to strip Qatar of its right to host the World Cup as for any other campaign that we have run.”During the last year Crosby’s company has donated gifts worth tens of thousands of pounds to Tory MPs. In November 2017 cabinet ministers and dozens of Tory MPs, including the defence secretary, Gavin Williamson, and the health secretary, Matt Hancock, gathered for CTF’s annual Christmas party at the V\u0026ampA museum.Al-Hail, who has financed a series of lavish anti-Qatar events in London over the last 18 months featuring leading politicians and football players, has always insisted the events are funded with his personal wealth. He did not respond to requests for comment on this story.In the pitch document, Crosby told Al-Hail that, if engaged, CTF Partners would require £300,000 a month plus VAT to work to undermine the credibility of Qatar’s government. This was on top of more than £100,000 to conduct research that would associate Doha with terrorism in the minds of the public. In addition, CTF Partners would put direct pressure on Fifa to reverse the decision to award the 2022 World Cup to Qatar by establishing campaign bases in London, Washington DC, Milan, Sydney and Canberra.“We would identify all potential ‘allies’ in the media, politics, industry, academia, and government and reach out to them guiding a deliberate attempt to inform and motivate them about the need to reconsider Qatar’s hosting of the World Cup in 2022,” the document said.Crosby said his company could also run online campaigns to put Qatar under pressure, using Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and Snapchat to turn members of the public into campaigning tools.“The focus for our dedicated team would be to create activity and interaction, encouraging users to join an online community, sign up, share with their family and friends, like an activity or watch and participate in an event. These supporters can then be mobilised to communicate directly with key decision-makers at Fifa.Crosby’s proposal also offered to monitor and provide “metrics” to Al-Hail on the activities of members of the public who were willing to take online action against Qatar, in addition to running a global media campaign.“No false, misleading or unfair claim about Qatar or its World Cup should be allowed to be unchallenged,” said Crosby. “The campaign should operate on the basis of rapid rebuttal – always ensuring a vacuum is not left to be filled by Qatar or any of the country’s supporters. As with all other aspects of the campaign this would be the responsibility of a dedicated team.”Qatar’s World Cup bid has been repeatedly accused of bribing Fifa officials during the selection process - claims that have been vehemently denied - and criticised for disregarding the human rights of those building the infrastructure for the tournament.Crosby is not the first overseas inidual to discuss anti-Qatar campaigns with Al-Hail. One of Al-Hail’s previous attempts at organising an anti-Qatar event in London saw him employ the services of Thomas Mace-Archer-Mills, the chairman of the British Monarchist Society, who adopts an English accent for his work as a royal TV pundit but was later exposed as an Italian-American who grew up in upstate New York."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2b9fef9204b6c08b01b43587fa1f040de5ef4e12/0_217_5401_3240/master/5401.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5ed76e2f2058b2553731268feb5af7c9","title":"tinder and grindr face questions over age checks children","story":"Minister writes to companies after figures show dozens of offences linked to dating appsThe UK government is to ask Tinder and Grindr what measures they are taking to ensure child safety, after claims of exploitation on dating apps.It was reported on Sunday that police have investigated more than 30 cases of child rape since 2015 where victims evaded age checks on dating apps.Jeremy Wright, the secretary of state for digital, culture, media and sport, said: “I will be writing to these companies asking what measures they have in place to keep children safe from harm, including verifying their age. If I’m not satisfied with their response, I reserve the right to take further action.”Other data released to the Sunday Times under freedom of information laws revealed there have been a further 60 further cases of child sexual offences via online dating services, including grooming, kidnapping and violent sexual assault. The youngest victim was said to be eight years old.Last week a man who spent a night with a 12-year-old girl he thought was 19 and whom he had met on a popular adult dating app was jailed for two and a half years.Carl Hodgson, 28, who pleaded guilty to a number of charges, invited the child to his flat in Manchester city centre a few days after they first made contact via an app. The victim used a different name on her dating app profile and falsely stated she was 19, Manchester crown court was told.Social media companies are facing renewed demands from the government to protect children from harmful online content, amid growing concerns over suicide and self-harm among teenagers.Last month Matt Hancock, the health secretary, warned companies including Facebook, Google and Twitter that he would use the law to force them to act should they fail to remove inappropriate content.Grindr told the Sunday Times: “Any account of sexual abuse or other illegal behaviour is troubling to us as well as a clear violation of our terms of service. Our team is constantly working to improve our digital and human screening tools to prevent and remove improper underage use of our app.”Tinder said it used both automated and manual tools to moderate users, including scanning profiles for “red flag” images, and said it also depended on users to report profiles that may belong to a minor.A spokeswoman said: “We utilise a network of industry-leading automated and manual moderation and review tools, systems and processes – and spend millions of dollars annually – to prevent, monitor and remove minors and other inappropriate behaviour from our app. We don’t want minors on Tinder.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ace151e2c3ec64fff9564acdd76b1f7afc076134/0_212_4480_2688/master/4480.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=74c1665b6c51047657fbf567e2e750be","title":"england 44 8 france six nations player ratings from twickenham","story":"Elliot Daly 8 Getting better at full-back, with the pace to spot gaps and go through them.

Will be disappointed not to get in on act himself though.Henry Slade 9 Picked up from where he left off. His high kick that led to May’s third try showed he is playing with senses heightened and produced a classy finish.Manu Tuilagi 7 Used sparingly by England again, often as a decoy runner. Almost created a try on the right and is a reassuring presence in England’s midfield.Jonny May 8 Twelve tries in 12 matches and eight in his last six in the competition.

Given an armchair ride but made the most of it.Ben Youngs 8 Box-kicking was on the money and France could just not live with it. It was up to him to set a high tempo and he did so to devastating effect.Mako Vunipola 8 An injury concern after making way with an ankle injury early in the second half. Was again supreme at loosehead until an ankle injury forced him off.Jamie George 8 It has taken a little while but now looks at home as England’s starting hooker. One bruising hit on Parra and carried hard as ever.Kyle Sinckler 7 Powerful and dynamic again, though he crosses the line occasionally. You get the feeling Dan Cole’s recall to the squad was designed to keep Sinckler on his toes.Courtney Lawes 9 One trademark hit on Guirado in the first half, another on Bastareaud in the second and he carried with real menace. The outstanding lock on show.George Kruis 7 Not as conspicuous as last week, nor as much as Lawes, but hard to find fault all the same. Deserves to keep his place against Wales.Mark Wilson 8 Had one gallop in open play and dovetailed well with Curry. His enthusiasm for the hard grunt is clearly rubbing off on teammates. Yet to have a bad game for England.Tom Curry 9 Teamed up with Lawes for a monstrous hit on Guirado. Bloodied but in no way bowed, he topped England’s tackle count in another superb showing.

One day England’s opponents will pick a full-back at No 15.Damian Penaud 4 Took his try well but this was a trying afternoon. England targeted him from the word go and he was often found wanting. May made him look silly for his second try.Mathieu Bastareaud 5 It was a mistake to turn to him and overlook form centres in the Top 14. It may seem harsh but it felt like a step back in time because he does not represent France’s future.Geoffrey Doumayrou 6 Is obviously a capable player but could not make inroads into England’s resolute defence. Struggled with chaos going on around him.Gaël Fickou 3 On of two centres on the wing (not to mention playing alongside a wing at full-back). Is it any wonder France struggled so badly in behind?Camille Lopez 5 Came up with a clever kick for Fickou in the first half but exerted no control. Not all his fault when England are so rampant.Morgan Parra 4 Found himself caught in the backfield for far too long, looked shaky under the high ball and must surely be replaced by Dupont now.Jefferson Poirot 6 Kept on going and got stuck in at countless rucks but could not have the same kind of impact as either of England’s props.Guilhem Guirado 6 A bad start for the skipper – his knock-on led to England’s first try and his lineout work was messy but made some strong carries thereafter.Demba Bamba 5 Conceded a silly penalty early on but lined up Ashton and thundered into him. High tackle on Tuilagi was not malicious but clumsy.Sébastien Vahaamahina 4 At least he does not have to carry the can as much as last week. That won’t be any consolation though. Could not effect proceedings at all.Félix Lambey 6 Very good off the bench last week and among France’s better forwards this week.

She is loved for her flaws as much as her phenomenal physical giftsOlympic athletes have an unfortunate tendency to be recognized only for what they accomplish during the Games, and these days that fame is even more fleeting than it was in the past. Ashton Eaton became arguably the greatest all-round athlete in the world when he won decathlon gold at the 2016 Olympics but he is hardly a household name – a comparison of Google Trends shows him lagging far behind golfer Jordan Spieth over the past five years. And Eaton won the hallmark Olympic event twice.In the case of Lindsey Vonn, who has retired from skiing after finishing third in the downhill at the World Championships on Sunday, it was her high-profile relationships with Tiger Woods and NHL star PK Subban that kept her in the headlines rather than her achievements on the slopes. That’s because her home country, obsessed with its domestic sports leagues, tends not to notice skiing World Cups or World Championships. And that’s a pity, because the 34-year-old fashioned a model of consistent winning and resiliency that few athletes can match, until a long string of injuries finally forced her into retirement.In another country, perhaps each of Vonn’s 82 World Cup wins – more than any woman and just four shy of Ingemar Stenmark’s men’s record of 86 – would have led the sports broadcasts. Certainly her 20 crystal globes for World Cup season titles, more than any man or woman, would be celebrated. Even the New England Patriots couldn’t match the five-year run she had from 2008 to 2012, when she won four overall World Cup championships.During that run, she was nominated three times for the global Laureus Sportswoman of the Year award, winning in 2011. In 2016, she was nominated for the organization’s Comeback of the Year, appropriately for a woman who has battled back from countless ill-timed injuries, a by-product of her willingness to put her body on the line in a dangerous discipline. No one was more aggressive in the pursuit of victory than Vonn: “I’m willing to risk everything every time I’m in the starting gate, but it’s also been the reason I’ve crashed so many times” she told the  in 2018.The injuries – which often struck around the Olympics and World Championships, limiting her medal haul in the marquee events – range from a slashed thumb from a champagne bottle sustained at the 2009 World Championships to the horrific crash in the 2013 World Championship super-G, where the broadcasters’ microphones picked up her shrieks as she skidded down the course. She was airlifted off the slope and was diagnosed with a brutal combination of injuries in her right leg – a torn ACL and MCL and a tibia fracture.But after each crash, she showed a fierce – perhaps impatient – determination to get back to the starting gate. She tried to return for the 2014 Olympics but suffered another injury setback when she reinjured her knee. Perhaps it’s no wonder she’s now dating Subban, who plays a sport in which injured players are expected to get stitched up and get back on the ice as quickly as possible. Few other people could comprehend how she could suffer injury after injury and return.Vonn turned 30 in 2014, a few months after missing the Olympics. But she wasn’t done. She took bronze in the 2015 World Championship super-G and came back for another bronze in the 2017 downhill, raising her total of World Championship medals to seven. And in Pyeongchang last year, she took a third Olympic medal – a bronze – to go with her gold and bronze from the Vancouver Games in 2010.But as well as being a fierce competitor, Vonn was always human. She could be offbeat – she started her own herd of livestock after choosing a cow (“because she was really cute”) as a prize over a $5,000 check after a World Cup win at Val d’Isere. The cow, Olympe, turned out to be pregnant and Vonn now owns a family of them.And, perhaps most importantly, she was never afraid to admit she suffered like the rest of us – despite her gifts, fame and money. “She never acts like she is on Olympus, where she could be,” her friend and rival Sofia Goggia said last year. As well as her physical burdens, she has been open about her bouts of depression, which she has managed with medication, the support of her family and her beloved rescue dogs. “Everything about my life seemed so perfect to people. But I struggle like everyone else,” Vonn told the People magazine in 2012, adding that at one point in 2008: “I couldn’t get out of bed anymore. I felt hopeless, empty, like a zombie.”Her US teammate Mikaela Shiffrin, who won the super-G at this week’s World Championships, may well supplant Vonn one day as the most decorated female skier of all time. But, for now at least, it is time to pay tribute to one of history’s greatest skiers.

They are taking bloody revenge on everyone who beat them in 2018, Ireland last weekend and now France. This was another pitiless performance.The idea France might surprise them, and everyone else, was shattered in the opening 60 seconds with a couple of nightmare tackles. Yoann Huget ran smack into both Vunipolas. He may as well have burst in on the Krays in the back room of the Blind Beggar. Then Guilhem Guirado was splattered by Courtney Lawes. Guirado coughed up the ball like he had been choking on it and someone had just whacked him on the back. Take that.France were reeling already. And here came Jonny May and Elliot Daly speeding down the left wing, which seemed, all of a sudden, to have opened up in front of them as the French defenders scrambled to make their ground.When Eddie Jones explained why he had picked Chris Ashton on the wing ahead of Jack Nowell he said it was because he had a feeling he would sneak the team an early try. Turned out that was a feint. It was not England’s right that landed on France, but their left instead. Daly slipped out of a tackle from Camille Lopez during a lovely, jinking run and then threaded a grubber kick through for May to chase. All he had to do was tap it down.So just over a minute in, England were leading and there was already an irresistible feeling about which way the match was going, the result as inevitable as the black rain clouds coming over from behind the West Stand. The rain arrived midway through the half. It did not dampen England’s play in any way.It was May’s 20th try for England, which brought him level with Ashton in eighth place on their all-time list. Twenty minutes later, May overtook him, just like he did all those defenders. His second try was made by Owen Farrell, who ran a cunning switchback and then threw a sweet 15-yard pass that left May squaring off with France’s young wing Damian Penaud. For a second they stood a yard apart, each watching the other and waiting for the draw. May twitched left, then right, and then set off on his left again. Penaud, who had been turned inside-out, turned the right way around just in time to watch him score.The third, five minutes later, was the easiest of the lot. Morgan Parra spilled a high kick, Ashton gathered it, glanced up and then stabbed through a little chip for May to collect. So that was the hat-trick. It took him just under 30 minutes. It was not the fastest scored by an Englishman in the Six Nations – it was not long ago Jonathan Joseph took 17 minutes against Italy and Austin Healey scored one in 10 minutes against them too. But it was the first an Englishman had made in the first half of a match and the first for an Englishman against France since 1924.It won May the man-of-the-match award, though he did make one conspicuous mistake. He missed a tackle on Huget in the run-up to France’s try. England are such nit‑pickers these days that you guess that error will be almost as galling for him as the tries were gratifying, because May is one of the players who seems to have responded best to Jones’s ruthless perfectionism.May used to seem like a bit of a headless chicken on the pitch, running this way and that, sideways and back, but he has grown into a ruthless finisher. He is a real roadrunner of a wing, now, always three steps ahead of whatever clunking traps Wile E Coyote has laid for him. “Jonny is one of the hardest working guys in our team,” Jones said.He needs to be, Jones explained, because England have so much competition for places in the back three. Ashton was superb too, even if he could not catch a break. He almost scored once when he was clean through at the end of an overlap, but he fumbled Manu Tuilagi’s one-handed pass.Ashton had another near-miss when he was chasing Farrell’s kick through, but he was hauled down by Gaël Fickou. England got a penalty try instead. But if May got all the glory Ashton’s all-round contribution stood out too.England’s back three were a class apart from France’s but then Jacques Brunel had not done himself any favours when he decided to put a couple of centres, Penaud and Fickou, on the wings and a wing, Huget, at full-back. Anyone who wants to beat England, when they are in this form, will need to come armed with a better plan than that."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cb058b4c84b60a1947ab2b4e1f4b9e57f7a8fa59/0_232_5274_3164/master/5274.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=947395587c347ddc8592c14028d2ed40","title":"share your experiences of lost footpaths","story":"More than 10,000 miles of footpath are estimated to have been lost from maps. We’d like your help in documenting their recoveryEngland and Wales have about 140,000 miles of footpaths, but it is estimated more than 10,000 have been lost from current maps. Volunteers have been working tirelessly to rediscover them and put in legal applications for the recovery of lost paths before a government deadline in 2026 after which claims will no longer be accepted.If you have already found a lost footpath, how did you find and identify it? If you put in an application for a path to be recovered we’d also like to hear about it.Below are some tips on how to rediscover a lost footpath:1. The first port of call is the Ramblers, whose website gives clear advice on how to identify a lost path and make an application. The method involves comparing new and old maps, plus examination of historical sources. Walking and exploration is involved, but don’t forget that a lost path has to be proven before you can use it, otherwise you are trespassing.2. It is also important to be sure you are not replicating work already underway. This government website can give you information on current applications.3.

Young readers reveal why they adore it – from the sarcasm to the timeless love stories ... and Fat MonicaA new survey into teenage media habits done by Childwise shows that the New York-based comedy is the favourite TV show of viewers aged five to 16 in the UK. It’s a remarkable statistic, given that the majority of those surveyed would not even have been born when the series ended in 2004. We asked you to tell us why you love Friends. Here’s what some of you said:It gives us all hope that everything will work out. In real life, friendships don’t happen like they do in Friends and neither do relationships, but I think everyone who watches it wishes they did. I also think people love the idea of always having someone to talk to and share things with.My favourite character is Chandler. I think he is underplayed: many people like Joey and Phoebe because they are seen to get all the best lines, but Chandler has a different type of humour – one that I appreciate! His relationship with Monica is perfect, too, and they balance each other out.My favourite episode has to be The One with Five Steaks and an Eggplant. It’s a bit of an odd choice as the gang are at ends with each other, but I love how they do everything they can to work things out. This is really rare nowadays, when a tiny disagreement can end friendships. Molly, 15, HertfordshireI watch Friends almost every day and when I finish the 10th season I rewatch it. I find out a lot of things about life from the show. I like being treated like an adult when I hear people talking about it and I can join in. I have only been allowed to watch it since May as I’m nearly 12.I don’t have a favourite character – I have a list. My top favourite is Fat Monica. Second is Rachel and third is Chandler. Chandler is funny because he’s sarcastic and I like sarcasm.I like all the flashback episodes, but my favourite is where Rachel and Monica watch the Thanksgiving tape and see Ross about to take Rachel to prom. Leah, 11, EnfieldFriends is relatable to nearly every person, as well as being funny. It involves scenarios people my age are starting to go through, but instead of taking them seriously, it manages to make a joke of every single one. It’s based on everyday lives, and most people can relate to one of the characters. My favourite character? That’s a tough one. I’d have to go with Phoebe, because of how she deals with everything that comes her way. She gets herself into situations that are just hilarious.There are too many good episodes to choose from, however one of the best would be The One with Chandler and Monica’s Wedding: Part 2, when Rachel’s pregnancy is revealed to Monica and Phoebe. When Phoebe finds the pregnancy test she assumes it is Monica’s. When Phoebe realises that it is in fact Rachel’s, instead of revealing it, she says she is the one who is pregnant with James Brolin’s child and that she needs to call and let him know! Sam, 16, LeicesterI love Friends because it’s one of the first series (in another language) I ever watched. When I watch episodes again, it’s like going back to my comfort zone.If I had to choose a favourite episode it would be the one when Phoebe and Ross discover that Monica and Chandler have been going out. It’s SO funny … but I think I watched it too many times. Sol, 16, Rosario, ArgentinaFriends has surprisingly been a conservation-starter with a few of my friends. It’s like the glue that sticks us together. Plus, the show stands as the epitome of how friendship should be. Whenever I watch Friends, I fantasise about a friendship circle I would like to have. The silly jokes and the awkwardness between the characters are bonuses.My stand-out character is Phoebe because she is silly but smart and knowledgeable. For a person who you might think would have anger bottled up, she seems pretty calm. She takes control of her own life and she is not abashed about what she does and what she thinks. Hal, 17, IndiaFriends handles issues such as orce, unemployment and unrequited love in an excellently comedic way. It perfectly captures sibling rivalry between Ross and Monica that is surprisingly relatable. It looks at the difference of class and intellect between the friends and you get to know each one personally until you realise there is more to them than meets the eye.My favourite character has to be Chandler. His witty lines, physical comedy and mannerisms just turn him into a super lovable character. Also he’s kinda fit (good looking)! I think everyone has parts of all the characters in them, no matter how much you try not to. (Ross is my least favourite character. He’s so ANNOYING).All the episodes are really funny! If I had to choose a favourite, it would either be the one where Chandler hooks up with one of Joey’s sisters but can’t remember which one, or (spoiler alert) the one where Ross and Rachel finally start dating.

Some have embraced the challenge and now, past the halfway point, are finding hope as they see the 2020 election on the horizon. Others have wobbled, legs buckling, consumed by the anxiety that they will never make it. Oliver, a cheerful and charming presence in a conference room at HBO’s headquarters in New York, is surely one of those runners wearing a wacky costume, pointing out the absurdity of the exercise while embodying the stamina and stoicism required to reach the finish line.But as he prepares for a sixth season of HBO’s Last Week Tonight With John Oliver, which dissects current affairs with satire, silliness, meticulous research and a moral compass, Oliver wants viewers to know that he is neither a journalist nor an activist – and he can prove it. When I ask if he aspires to interviewing Trump, he says in an instant: “No, definitely not. There’s no point. I think he’s shallow. I don’t think there’s anything that I could get out of him. I don’t think he’s reflective in any way that is particularly useful. I think I’ll be taking up space that an actual journalist could use.“Generally, the times when he’s most illuminating are not in interview settings. It seems like that when you read the transcripts of his junkets on Air Force One: he tends to be a little looser. Any kind of longform transcript is more illuminating, I think, than him sitting in front of someone on a camera talking. I don’t know if many interesting things have come out of that.”The transcripts from Trump’s conversations with reporters on the presidential plane or at the White House are, indeed, surrealist works of art, demotic word salads matched only by Lucky’s monologue in Samuel Beckett’s play Waiting for Godot. In one episode, Oliver ran a comparison between Trump’s stream-of-consciousness ramblings and the predictive-text feature on a phone, concluding that the latter would make a more coherent president.Such outbursts show why Trump is the gift that keeps on giving to US political comedy, from Last Week Tonight and The Daily Show (where Oliver got his big break) to The Late Show With Stephen Colbert (which found its voice and had a ratings surge after the 2016 election) and Saturday Night Live (which has given the world Alec Baldwin as Trump). All ridicule the president, a fact taken for granted by most Americans, but which would be enough to trigger censorship and arrests under many authoritarian regimes. In that sense, television’s court jesters are helping to keep the blood of democracy circulating. But when I ask if he considers himself part of the anti-Trump “resistance”, the 41-year-old bursts out laughing.“I don’t think so, no. I think we’re only really responsible for ourselves. We try to be accountable to each other and in basic legal facts, which is why we research stuff so heavily. The press in America, of which we are obviously not a part, is under the kind of duress it has not been under for quite some time,” he says.“This is a confoundingly difficult presidency to cover, just because so much of what they say is not just flagrant nonsense, but also stuff that you know deep down they don’t believe, or retract the next month. It’s amazing to be in a position where you can’t really fully trust a single word that comes out of the president’s mouth, because he doesn’t believe it himself.”According to the Washington Post, Trump made 8,158 false or misleading claims in his first two years as president. Lately, he has been fearmongering about illegal immigration to justify his demand for a border wall, even forcing a 35-day partial government shutdown and threatening another. Does Oliver believe there is method in the mendacity?“That assumes he’s got the capacity for strategic thought,” he says. “You could definitely use the skills that he does have strategically – and sometimes, when he uses them to his benefit, it’s tempting to ascribe carefully calculated motive to it. But that’s probably not the case. He didn’t aim for the treble 20: he closed his eyes, flung some darts and one of them happened to hit it. He doesn’t even know that’s the right one to hit. He thinks the middle one is the one.”Trump appears to go with his gut – and Rupert Murdoch’s Fox News. Analysts have found a direct correlation between the network’s talking points and Trump’s statements and tweets. “I think the thing that’s unique about this is it’s not so much that there’s a state-run media as you feel like we’re getting close to a media-run state,” says Oliver. “If he’s getting primary information from horseshit commentators on Fox News who directly now have his ear, that’s incredibly dangerous.”Trump’s second state of the union address, on 5 February, was a case in point. He pushed the faux crisis at the border and said nothing of climate change. Fox’s cheerleaders were thrilled. So were Trump’s Republican enablers, for whom Oliver has open contempt.“It’s pathetic. It’s utterly, utterly shameful. Unfortunately, it seems to be happening with people who lack the capacity for shame. It is somewhere between disheartening and disgusting to see the extent to which they’ve made a calculated decision that: ‘We can get two-plus supreme court picks out of this, so it’s worth it.’ I would argue it’s not worth it. But they clearly feel differently about it.”Although he was born in Birmingham, grew up in Bedford and studied at Cambridge, Oliver moved to the US in 2006, married an American (a former combat medic) and instinctively says “we” rather than “you” to his viewers. But he admits the prospect of his two young sons speaking with American accents is strange.Nor did it occur to him that his children would be denied freedom of movement within the EU. “Brexit happened when he was a few months old. So that was the sad thing, looking at a baby and thinking: your horizons have slightly contracted and you don’t even know it yet. That’s beyond worrying about basically anyone under 25 in the UK and how this is going to fundamentally affect the rest of their life. It’s so sad.”“Also, at some point, the fact he’s 72 will kick in. He can’t beat death, even though I wouldn’t be surprised if he outlived everybody out of pure spite. But Brexit – who knows where that ends? Maybe it’s a great idea. There’s absolutely nothing to suggest that would be the case.”Oliver once admitted to having an “immigrant’s crush” on this nation of immigrants. He occupies a fruitful insider-outsider space, delving into domestic politics, such as internet privacy and Vice-President Mike Pence’s pet rabbit, but also zooming out for a global perspective. Last Week Tonight’s much-admired 20-minute segments have focused on topics including the Chinese president, Xi Jinping Facebook’s dangerous role in Myanmar elections in India, Mexico and Brazil and, of course, “a few whacks at the Brexit piñata”. This is like water in the desert for those left parched by America’s TV news networks, which were insular before Trump and now pay even less heed to the wider world. Is Oliver consciously plugging a gap?“No, I don’t think we’re plugging any gap,” he says. “I think the gap still exists, but it is a problem. It’s difficult, because this country is going through a lot right now, so it’s hard to make the case to viewers: ‘Hey, I know you’re thinking about this one thing right now I need you to think about the Mexican election.’ That’s a tough sell to the viewers and then, just in terms of how you tell that story, it’s complicated, because the Mexican election did not get a lot of coverage here, even on CNN International.”At the end of the previous season, Oliver and his team of writers, researchers and producers deftly put the US in a wider context as he discussed the rise of Jair Bolsonaro in Brazil and authoritarian leaders around the world. “I guess the thing that was fascinating to me, just as a very broad thesis in that story, was: every time we look at these stories and speak to experts on the ground in those countries, what they’ll usually say is: ‘In America, you’re lucky, because the institutions are holding up.’ The truth is, they’re holding up so far, but institutions in themselves don’t hold themselves up. They’re inanimate objects it’s people that hold them up. So your last best hope is that Americans will continue to fight back if ever they see a major institution under threat,” he says.“I think it’s always reassuring when you see pushback to aggressive behaviour from the US government, just like it was edifying to see pushback to America’s drone programme or the NSA, but it’s coming so thick and fast in the Trump presidency. I guess my worry is: how sustainable is this? When do people just start getting exhausted of being outraged by objectively outrageous behaviour all the time? When does it just become the background to people’s lives? Because, at that point, you’ve lost something.”For a moment, he is every inch the Briton again, contemplating his favourite forward. “I honestly think that Mo Salah might be my lifeline,” he says. “If he goes, I’ll think: ‘OK, burn everything to the ground.’”Last Week Tonight With John Oliver premieres in the UK on 18 February at 10.10pm on Sky Atlantic and Now TV"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bad36ef9742d719c08933882b66efbc5ef32889e/0_139_4432_2660/master/4432.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f575a3ffe8528eba93d3f401254d8a63","title":"amy klobuchar 2020 announces run minnesota senator","story":"‘Minnesota nice’ lawmaker who has kept a low profile in Washington aims to be a foil to Trump’s brashnessSenator Amy Klobuchar, of Minnesota, has joined the crowded field of Democratic candidates for 2020 that includes a historic number of women seeking the presidency.The three-term senator, who is often characterized as ‘Minnesota nice’ amid the rough-and-tumble of politics, is looking to be a foil to Donald Trump’s brash personality and often vitriolic rhetoric.She stood outdoors in thick falling snow in Minneapolis on Sunday afternoon to declare: “In our nation’s heartland at a time when we must heal the heart of our democracy … I stand before you … as the first woman elected to the US Senate from Minnesota to announce my candidacy for president of the United States.”Klobuchar on Sunday joined a jam-packed field that includes several of her Senate colleagues, including Elizabeth Warren, of Massachusetts, Kirsten Gillibrand, of New York, Kamala Harris, of California, and Cory Booker, of New Jersey, as well as the former San Antonio mayor Julian Castro and Hawaii Representative Tulsi Gabbard.Klobuchar, 59, is the sixth prominent woman to wade into the primary contest, which features a record number of women vying for a major-party nomination. She launched her candidacy at an outdoor event in Minneapolis on Sunday afternoon.But amid an upbeat launch for the White House, there is a cloud over Klobuchar this weekend in the form of several reports late last week where ex-staffers claim the Minnesota Democrat has a reputation for running a workplace in Washington “controlled by fear, anger, and shame”, according to Buzzfeed.A report in the Huffington Post said that at least three people withdrew from consideration to lead her forthcoming campaign — in part because of Klobuchar’s history of mistreating her staff and “bursts of cruelty”, despite being “beloved” in her home state as smart, funny and personable.A spokesperson for Klobuchar’s campaign put out a statement that began: “Senator Klobuchar loves her staff” and defending her record as an employer.Unlike some of her fellow senators, Klobuchar has kept a low profile in Washington. She is neither the progressive firebrand that is Warren nor has the vast social media following that transformed Booker into a star.Klobuchar is instead known a soft-spoken policymaker who has quietly built a network of supporters, in contrast with some of the Democratic contenders who have embraced confrontation with Trump head-on.The Democratic party has been somewhat torn over whether candidates should try and match Trump’s bullying tactics or fall back upon Michelle Obama’s 2016 advice: “When they go low, we go high.”Klobuchar suggested she would forge a middle ground, stating: “I don’t agree with, ‘When they go low, we go low,’ but I do agree that when they go low, we have to respond.”Elected to the Senate in 2006, Klobuchar had previously been the chief prosecutor of Minnesota’s most populous county. Democrats believe she would be uniquely positioned to appeal to independents and moderate Republicans, although it remains unclear if a centrist figure could survive a primary that will be determined by an animated progressive base.Klobuchar, in a departure from some of the other senators running for the Democratic party’s nomination, has not endorsed Medicare-for-All, the single-payer healthcare proposal championed by Bernie Sanders. She supports legislation around college affordability, but has not called for debt-free college tuition.Questions have also lingered over whether Klobuchar’s temperament as mild-mannered and restrained hold true behind closed doors. An online portal tracking Capitol Hill offices, dubbed as ‘Worst Bosses?’, found the senator had the highest annual staff turnover in the Senate.But the full statement from Klobuchar’s office in response to reports of her being sharply critical of staff, especially in early hours emails where staff reported they were dressed down, with colleagues included on the emails, disputed the characterization.“Senator Klobuchar loves her staff – they are the reason she has gotten to where she is today. She has many staff who have been with her for years – including her Chief of Staff and her State Director, who have worked for her for 5 and 7 years respectively, as well as her political advisor Justin Buoen, who has worked for her for 14 years — and many who have gone on to do amazing things, from working in the Obama Administration (over 20 of them) to running for office to even serving as the Agriculture Commissioner for Minnesota,” a campaign spokesperson said in the statement. “She is proud of them and the work they have done for Minnesota.”On a freezing day in Minnesota on Sunday, Klobuchar launched her campaign to an enthusiastic and warmly dressed crowd of supporters sipping on the hot cocoa and munching the cookies provided."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bfe866e42588a17ab60f3e64317791f2b1ead2aa/0_15_4252_2552/master/4252.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1007ff7ba00df8bd9a092ba800e79359","title":"amy klobuchar 2020 presidential run speech","story":"Supporters came out by the thousands, undeterred by snow, to hear Klobuchar’s announcement that she will run for presidentStrong suspicions that Senator Amy Klobuchar would run for president in 2020 were confirmed on a freezing Sunday afternoon in Minneapolis, just 11 miles from her hometown of Plymouth, Minnesota.“For every worker, farmer, dreamer, and builder, I am running. I am running for every American,” she proclaimed, pledging to get “dark money” out of politics, institute automatic voter registration for 18 year olds, and rejoin the Paris accord to deal with climate change.In opening remarks that set the tone for the announcement, Minneapolis mayor Jacob Frey praised Klobuchar’s ability to “get things done” and the mitten and snow pants-clad crowd erupted in cheers.A hundred meandering volunteers handed out cookies reading “Team Amy” in green icing, hot chocolate, cider and hand warmers to help attendees stave off the chill. The buoyant festivities bustled with local entertainment including the Twin Cities’ Sounds of Blackness and a local high school drumming team.Her speech relied on a metaphor tied to the event’s Boom Island location, situated along the Mississippi river and part of Minneapolis’ highly-decorated parks system, to form her foundational message of unity. “The Mississippi River – all our rivers – connect us to one another, to our shared story. For that is how this country was founded, with patriots who saw more that united them than ided them,” she said.Klobuchar referred to the devastating 2007 collapse of the I-35W bridge along the same river. She shared tales of heroic and selfless Minnesotans such as a truck driver who lost his life in an effort to save a school bus filled with children on the bridge that August day, creating a contrast to political isiveness.“But, my friends, that sense of community is fracturing across our nation right now, worn down by the petty and vicious nature of our politics,” she explained. “We are all tired of the shutdowns and the putdowns, the gridlock and the grandstanding. Our nation must be governed not from chaos but from opportunity. Not by wallowing over what’s wrong, but my marching inexorably toward what’s right.”Another Teamster, Bob McNattin, 80, said the group came to return the support they’ve received from Klobuchar over the years. “She has been rock-solid on our behalf,” he notes. “She is co-sponsor in the Senate of a bill that would solve our problem, and not just the Teamster problem, but all union pension problems. And we want to make sure she knows that we’re here because she’s been there for us.”Quietly passing the most Senate bills in 2016, Klobuchar gained fame beyond Minneapolis and Washington DC, for her role in the recent confirmation hearings of supreme court judge Brett Kavanaugh. In an exchange with then nominee, Klobuchar responded to Kavanaugh’s brazen inquiry into her drinking habits with a mention of her experience with her father’s alcoholism – and she remained largely unmoved by his eventual apology.What supporters see as a no-nonsense dedication to productivity drew many from across the state. Serena Pitala, 32, of Chisago City has supported Klobuchar in her Senate races because “she is a workhorse… somebody who’s going to get things done.”Klobuchar became the state’s first woman elected to the Senate with her 2006 win and was re-elected in both 2012 and 2018. “She seems no-drama, just straight working for the people of Minnesota, which I can appreciate,” says Amanda Nelson, 27, of Minneapolis.Klobuchar’s speech lacked charismatic delivery, despite earnest content. She stumbled a little, mid-sentence, just before saying she stood before the people to “announce my candidacy for president of the United States”, to whoops from the crowd, many of whom waved placards saying: “Amy for America”.Highlighting her work ethic, she cited her grandfather’s job as an iron ore miner. “I will look you in the eye. I will tell you what I think … And no matter what, I’ll lead from the heart,” she declared.It’s the unassuming tenacity of the midwest brand that Dr Paul Goren, a professor and chair of the political science department at the University of Minnesota, sees as setting Klobuchar apart from the growing Democratic pack for 2020.“A lot of candidates who have announced … they’re all east coast or west coast liberals. Klobuchar is a liberal as well, but a liberal of the midwest, or upper midwest, which can be seen as a liberalism that’s less extreme,” Goren said.Although reports have recently surfaced that she can be a scathing boss, he doesn’t see voters getting hung up on that.“I’ve been in Minnesota for over a dozen years. There has never been even a whiff of scandal surrounding her,” Goren says, and that might just be the ticket she needs to oust her competition. “She’s been on the national scene and been there for a while. She’s a nice contrast to President Trump in that way – a competent manager and gets thing done.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0a6f96d9126c4673e42694e96d154d35d605ac2d/0_132_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fd69d16853362e750bdaa6394709bf44","title":"avert us shutdown talks stalled immigration richard shelby","story":"Bipartisan negotiators are running out of time to reach a deal over Trump’s demand for a border wallBipartisan negotiators in Washington are running out of time to reach a deal over Donald Trump’s demand for a border wall after talks stalled, raising the prospect of another government shutdown starting on Friday.Leaders from both main parties sitting on a 17-strong negotiating panel must reach a deal over the disputed border security issue by Monday if there is to be time for Congress to pass legislation and Trump to sign it before the latest deadline of 15 February. Should they fail to reach agreement within hours, federal agencies, already exhausted after the 35-day shutdown that ended last month having impacted 800,000 federal employees, will yet again start to close from Friday at midnight.“The talks have stalled right now,” Richard Shelby, Republican chairman of the senate appropriations committee told Fox News Sunday. “I’m hoping we can get off the dime later today or in the morning, because time’s ticking away, but we’ve got some problems.”Shelby put the odds of a deal being reached against a second shutdown occurring at 50-50. “I’m not confident we’re going to get there. The next 24 hours are crucial,” he said.As jitters mount that the government might soon be inflicted with a second partial shutdown so soon after the first, congressional negotiators were trying desperately to overcome two sticking points. The most isive appeared to be Democratic demands that a cap be placed on the number of undocumented immigrants held in federal detention centers.The other potential sticking point is the big picture issue of whether compromise can be reached on funding for a border wall or barrier. Trump instigated the first shutdown, the longest in US history, after Democrats refused to give him $5.7bn for a wall, with the House speaker Nancy Pelosi vowing to award “not one penny” for a project she denounced as “immoral”.Positions held by both main parties appeared to have softened, with negotiators reportedly coalescing around a compromise sum of about $2bn. That in turn raised another critical question: would Trump himself accept a funding amount that would be less than half his initial $5.7bn demand?In his Sunday morning tweet, Trump accused the Democrats of “offering very little money for the desperately needed Border Wall”. But there are signs that he would be prepared to sign a funding bill that would keep the government open while giving him substantially less than his desired amount.Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff, told NBC’s Meet the Press on Sunday that a shutdown was still “on the table”. But he indicated that if the negotiators settled on a compromise sum the president would swallow it.“You cannot take a shutdown off the table, you cannot take 5.7 off the table, and if you end up somewhere in the middle you will probably see the president say ‘okay’ and then go and find the rest of the money another way,” Mulvaney said.He added that there were “pots of money” that Trump could dip into through his legal powers. Some of those funds, however, would only be open to him were he to declare a national emergency – an idea he continues to flirt with even though it would be highly contentious both for Democrats and increasingly for his own party.Following a by-now familiar game plan, Trump will take his case for a wall to his own people on Monday when he flies to El Paso, Texas, on the border with Mexico to address a rally of supporters. The event promises to be a feisty encounter – a protest march will pass nearby that will be joined by Beto O’Rourke, the El Paso resident who came close to winning back a US senate seat from Texas for the Democrats in the November midterm elections."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0965d22aae6d4865289ea83c7e48d3402543174c/0_64_1500_900/master/1500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ce13df15f2d8fc03de596270280b9a4d","title":"virginia ralph northam not going anywhere calls to resign","story":"Democratic Virginia members of the US Congress insisted that state governor cannot remain in officeDemocratic Virginia members of the US Congress insisted on Sunday that state governor Ralph Northam cannot remain in office after admitting that he wore blackface as a young man.Jennifer Wexton, elected in November’s midterms, on Sunday stood by a previous call she made for Northam to step down.And as the scandal in Virginia continues to boil, she told CBS’s Face the Nation that she also expects the state’s No 2, Democratic lieutenant governor Justin Fairfax, will “do the right thing for Virginia and resign”, citing “extremely credible” allegations of sexual assault made against him last week by two women.Also on CBS, Representative Don Beyer called Northam’s initial admission, and then denials, that he was in a racist photo “very bizarre” and said the governor had lost too much credibility to stay in office. Northam had later acknowledged he wore blackface at a separate event in the 1980s, dressing up as Michael Jackson for a dance contest. Beyer also said he believes the two women who have accused Fairfax of sexual assault. Beyer said if you believe the women, there is “no choice” but to call for Fairfax’s resignation. The congressman also said Democratic state attorney general Mark Herring, who also admitted to wearing blackface and is third in line to run the state if Northam and Fairfax are forced out, has been “very responsible” in owning up to his mistake.Wexman is withholding judgement on Herring, acknowledging that he came forward “proactively” about his past error.Meanwhile, after ignoring calls for his own resignation, Northam is declining to weigh in on whether Fairfax or Herring should step down.

The Met police put me on their domestic extremist database for years, when I was a member of their own oversight body, the Police Authority and deputy mayor of London,” said Jones.“It is deeply worrying that the Home Office has a report that must include definitions of extremism that many people would see as far too broad, when protest and dissent are necessary within a democracy.”An FOI request by the  found that the Home Office’s EAU – which was established by Theresa May in 2015 and has been involved in drawing up a blacklist of iniduals and organisations with whom the government and public sector should not engage – has produced, or is planning to produce, more than 21 reports.Three have titles indicating they are focused on the far right, such as Impact of Far Right Ideology on Young People and Rightwing Extremism – UK Groups.Three others contained the word “Islamist”, including How Islamist Extremists Gain Legitimacy. Others appear to be focused on the impact or reaction to terror events of recent years, such as Manchester Attack One Week On – Reaction and London Bridge Attack Islamophobic Sentiments.The list also contained reports called UK Sikh Nationalism and Women and Girls in Extremism.A Home Office spokesperson said: “The work by the extremism analysis unit helps improve our understanding of all types of extremism and guide how we should respond.”Detailing the work of the EAU when she was home secretary, May said the unit would “help us to develop a new engagement policy – which will set out clearly for the first time with which iniduals and organisations the government and public sector should engage and should not engage”.The EAU was also involved in developing a “counter-entryism” strategy to tackle Islamist radicalisation and ensure there is no repeat of the Trojan horse affair in Birmingham schools across the public sector."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/276dcefdcbf94b95f0c2e70e39445950077226a5/0_64_3126_1876/master/3126.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b8ef0192c2d9d80646668e3d92ca2bcd","title":"louvre abu dhabi to exhibit rembrandt and vermeer masterpieces uae","story":"Dutch Golden Age art exhibition to open at museum in UAE capitalThe Louvre Abu Dhabi, the first museum to carry the name outside France, has announced that it will display works by the Dutch masters Rembrandt and Vermeer this month.Works by the two artists are part of the gallery’s first exhibition of 2019 – Rembrandt, Vermeer and the Dutch Golden Age: Masterpieces from the Leiden collection and the Musée du Louvre.The exhibition in the United Arab Emirates capital is dedicated to the renowned fijnschilders (fine painters) of the Netherlands.“Rembrandt is a master of the Golden Age,” said the museum’s head, Manuel Rabate. “He’s a universal genius, he’s connected to the world.”The exhibition’s 95 works include Vermeer’s Young Woman Seated at a Virginal and Rembrandt’s Portrait of a Man.

But let’s look at other presidential costs. Why doesn’t the president, Emmanuel Macron, entertain visiting heads of state more frugally? If he hosted state visits sitting on a bale of hay with a mug of cider, it would send a clear message to the rest of France on reducing unnecessary costs.”One pensioner shouted: “And they could use paper plates, not the new presidential dinner plates they just spent €50,000 on!” A retired teacher said the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, went home at night and did her own shopping, yet France had a 365-room presidential palace that cost more than €100m a year to run. “That’s because in France we still have still a type of king,” sighed a trade unionist.For four hours, more than 100 citizens thrashed out their views on fat-cat pay, inequality in the tax system and Macron’s much-criticised drive to privatise certain state-controlled enterprises. A 16-year-old volunteer logged all comments in neat writing to send to the presidency.Macron’s “Great Debate” – a vast, unprecedented nationwide exercise in consulting citizens on how to fix France’s problems – is the latest attempt by the centrist president to try to bring an end to almost three months of spectacular anti-government revolt by the gilets jaunes or yellow vest movement.Macron’s idea to run thousands of local meetings was at first likened by some critics to the ill-fated consultation exercise by King Louis XVI in 1789. The king sought to quell popular discontent, but instead kickstarted the French revolution. Four years later he lost his head at the guillotine.Two months ago, at the height of protests, it was hard for Macron to leave the confines of his presidential palace without getting heckled and jeered. Now he has made several six-hour appearances at carefully organised debates across France. Speaking to local mayors and select young people, he has rolled up his shirt sleeves and defended his policies through a handheld microphone in what has been nicknamed The Macron Show.There is concern over whether citizens’ suggestions will be taken onboard. Macron has refused to change his stance on liberalising the economy and overhauling the welfare state, and the government is braced for protests to continue for several more months.The street demonstrations in Paris this weekend showed a new focus of anger against political institutions, with the French parliament and senate targeted. One protester in Normandy on Saturday had “Bring back the guillotine” written on his yellow vest.The country home of Richard Ferrand, the leader of the lower house of parliament and a key Macron ally, was targeted in an arson attack this weekend. No group claimed responsibility and the investigation is ongoing. Ministers blamed a climate of violence against politicians sparked by the gilets jaunes protests.More than 80 MPs from Macron’s party, La République En Marche, are said to have been targeted with written threats or attacks on their homes and offices since the start of the revolt. One MP woke up to find her home’s driveway had been bricked up in the night. Others have had cars burnt and windows smashed.Cherbourg, across the Channel from Dorset, has seen regular demonstrations. The industrial port and its surrounding villages face some of the problems that sparked the revolt in November. The area’s poor transport links means people depend on cars and expensive fuel. There are complaints about a lack of local doctors and the closure of public services in the countryside.Many talked about a lack of trust in elected officials at the debate. “I don’t even know why I vote any more,” said one engineer.Cherbourg’s MP, Sonia Krimi, won the traditionally leftwing town for Macron’s centrist party in 2017. She is known as an independent voice who has opposed some government moves, including a new law clamping down on protesters, on which 50 of Macron’s MPs abstained last week. She also raised eyebrows within her party for briefly donning a yellow vest during a meeting with protesters.Leading the Cherbourg debate, she insisted Macron would take all issues raised into account. “He won’t go back on the measures he’s taken so far,” she said. “But this is going to be a turning point.”Some are concerned that those turning up to the debates are mainly older and retired. “Where are the young people?” said one retired port worker.After protesters in the Cherbourg area blocked McDonald’s drive-throughs, many insisted multinationals must be made to pay more tax. Those in the north and the south-east have also blocked Amazon logistics sites. The French government has promised a new national tax on internet firms such as Google and Facebook.In the Normandy town of Caen, as hundreds of gilets jaunes gathered for another street protest, some carried signs saying: “The Great Debate is just blah, blah, blah.”Chantal, a former healthcare assistant in a retirement home, said she had written in the “grievance book” at her local village hall, but she added: “This Macron debate is all puffed-up nonsense. It’s stage-managed, he’s not listening to the little people. Us gilets jaunes are here for the long-term. I’d rather not have to spend my weekends protesting, but I’m not giving up now.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d8f457ad2395426a80db6e5f16679e6b7cac9d3e/0_31_1942_1165/master/1942.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5e376063ee3405cb3dba2c7d670c770a","title":"tusk merkel immigration bbc documentary","story":"Donald Tusk was enraged when Angela Merkel held private talks with Turkey to stem the flow of refugees and migrants into the European Union, warning the plan would be “a catastrophe”, a new documentary reveals.“I couldn’t believe it was true.

No mother would leave her kids like this,” she said, voice breaking. “But I had to leave my kids. I had no other choice.”Attempts to reach Bolooki’s family for comment went unanswered or were unsuccessful.Bolooki made her escape after being allowed to go to the toilet. She climbed through a window without her shoes and hid on a nearby construction site for two hours before asking a taxi driver to take her to a friend’s house in Sharjah, a city half an hour away.She had already left her passport in the safekeeping of a sympathetic acquaintance. “That’s when she called me and asked me to book her a ticket to North Macedonia,” said Nenad Dimitrov, a close friend.The pair had met while he worked as a personal trainer on a luxury cruise liner in Florida. They stayed friends, visiting each other in Dubai and Skopje. “She said she couldn’t use her own credit card. And I knew something was different this time,” he said.Bolooki travelled overland to Bahrain and then flew through Turkey and Serbia to Dimitrov’s family home. The euphoria of a successful escape was quickly extinguished by the realities of negotiating North Macedonia’s legal system to apply for asylum and a lack of contact with her children.At home, a family friend said Bolooki’s youngest children, aged 13 and 14, did not know their mother’s whereabouts and had been told she was on a pilgrimage to Mecca.Her 20-year-old daughter, Fatma, has been desperate for news of her mother, but contact with her stopped suddenly a few weeks ago. Bolooki’s friends fear her phone has been taken away.At every stage of the process, North Macedonia officials pressured her to drop her case and return home to her family, Bolooki’s immigration lawyer and Dimitrov allege.Bolooki was arrested and taken to the Gazi Baba immigration detention centre on 7 December on the grounds that she posed a threat to national security while her asylum application was pending. She has not been allowed visitors or access to her lawyer.The final rejection of her asylum application on Tuesday – on the grounds she did not face danger if she returned home to the UAE – included a 15-day grace period to leave the country. The refugee is keen to seek asylum somewhere else but cannot do so from detention.The Helsinki Committee, a human rights NGO, has tried to intervene, accusing the North Macedonian government of violating Bolooki’s rights by detaining her and rejecting her asylum at the request of the UAE.“It appears Bolooki’s case had been rushed through the asylum system at an unprecedented speed so the authorities can close her case and send her home,” the committee’s director, Uranija Pirovska, told local television.“She has no criminal record and no reason has been given for her detention. It is also exceptional that she has not been allowed visitors. The case is suspicious from top to bottom.”According to watchdog Transparency International, North Macedonia scores 35 out of 100 in its perceived level of public sector corruption.Adam Coogle, a Middle East researcher at Human Rights Watch, said: “Certainly if an Emirati woman flees to a country that doesn’t have a strong rule of law, it’s possible that the UAE can exert monetary and diplomatic pressure to send her back home.“Sheikha Latifa is an instructive case. There was clearly pressure put on the Indian government to board that boat and take her back. There is a lot of interest in fleeing Saudi women at the moment but the situation for Emirati and other women in the Gulf is often just as bad.”Sheikha Latifa, the 33-year-old daughter of Dubai’s powerful ruler, made headlines last year after she reportedly escaped ill-treatment by her family, only to be seized by armed men from a yacht off the coast of India and returned to the UAE.The UAE denied Sheikha Latifa fled ill-treatment and says she is safe and well at home with her family.Unlike in neighbouring Saudi Arabia, in the UAE control of women’s freedom of movement by male s is not written into law, but in practice travel is often highly restricted by husbands and fathers. Women cannot marry without a male relative’s permission and Emirati law prioritises men in personal status matters such as marriage, orce and custody of children.“Hind has been through such awful things,” said Dimitrov. “I’m worried I will get in trouble for helping her. But I’m more worried she will be locked away or killed if she goes back.”Several UAE sources, including the UAE embassy in Rome, which handles the country’s relations with North Macedonia, as well as the North Macedonia embassy in London were contacted for comment on this story but did not respond by the time of publication.

We have visited people who have been supportive to say thank you for that help.“Liverpool football club have been very, very good Jamie Carragher, in particular, has been very aware of Sean’s campaign and has been very supportive. Obviously this event tonight is in aid of Sean but also people like Jordan Henderson and one or two others seem to have taken a really personal interest in Sean’s story.”Last week an Italian, Simon Mastrelli, was extradited to England to face charges in connection with the attack that left Cox so badly injured. Filippo Lombardi was previously acquitted of assaulting the Irishman but was, like Daniele Sciusco, jailed for his part in the trouble that occurred before the game.Cox, meanwhile, continues to make a protracted recovery supported by his family and friends. “He is making progress,” says McNulty. “It’s very slow but he is making progress although the reality is that he is going to need lifelong care. His injuries are life altering but he continues to make progress and hopefully he can get to enjoy his family at home. Until then, he is getting great care out in Dun Laoghaire.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3788936.1549833228!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"aintree grand national could be first casualty of no deal brexit","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tAintree Racecourse, Liverpool: A tripartite agreement, which   currently exists under EU law,  allows for the free movement of and trade in horses between Ireland, Britain and France. Photograph:   Getty ImagesThe Aintree Grand National festival could be the first casualty of a no-deal Brexit on March 29th because free movement of horses would no longer be allowed between Ireland and the UK.A tripartite agreement which currently exists under EU law allows for the movement of and trade in horses between Ireland, Britain and France without veterinary inspections or health certificates.However, Fine Gael chairman Martin Hoyden has warned this could be “greatly challenged” if there is no deal on the withdrawal of the UK from the EU. He said the impact on Ireland’s €1 billion equine industry could be similar to the impact on the beef sector “because the Irish and UK markets for the breeding and racing of horses are so interlinked”.Mr Hoyden, in whose Kildare South constituency the Curragh and a significant slice of the horse breeding industry is based, said the equine industry could be the first affected by no deal by the deadline.“If there was no deal at the end of March, it would be far more difficult for Irish horses to travel to Aintree the following week for the Grand National festival” which takes place between April 4th and 6th, he said.And it would get worse, he warned. “Later that month, we want the best of the English horses which have been successful in Cheltenham to come and contest in Punchestown.“A couple of weeks later we are in the height of the breeding season. Some of the top stallions in the world are found in this country and mares will be travelling to and from this country.” State aidMr Hoyden, in a Dáil parliamentary question, asked Minister for Agriculture Michael Creed if a relaxation of State aid rules would be considered to support the industry.He also called on Mr Creed to work through Horse Racing Ireland, the national authority for thoroughbred racing, with all those potentially affected both in the short and long term, including the Irish Thoroughbred Breeders Association and racehorse trainers.Mr Creed said sectors other than the thoroughbred sector would be affected, “because the horse sport sector also sees considerable volume”. Recent figures suggested that anything up to 30,000 sport horses outside the thoroughbred sector move east to west every year.Mr Creed said the issue was further complicated by the all-island administration of racing through the Irish Resurfacing Regulatory Board. “There is an all-island stud book for the thoroughbred sector. It is complex,” he said.He acknowledged that the UK could not be part of the tripartite agreement once it becomes a “third country”.But he said there was extensive engagement on the issue which would “involve change to the current arrangements but we are endeavouring to make those as user-friendly and efficient as possible”."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3788908.1549831265!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"town in northern russia battling invasion of polar bears","story":"\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                                                            Polar bears  in the Novaya Zemlya archipelago, located in the Arctic Ocean, North of Russia.

A state of emergency has been called in Belushya Guba  as 50 polar bears are said to have invaded the town. Photograph: The Siberian TimesRussia is battling an unprecedented invasion of polar bears on a remote Arctic archipelago that is home to the country’s most northerly military base. Known locally as “Lords of the Arctic”, the wild animals have been terrorising the population on Novaya Zemlya, a group of mountainous islands off Russia’s northern coast once used as a testing ground for atomic bombs. “People are scared, afraid to leave their homes, daily routines are being broken, and parents are unwilling to let their children go to school and kindergartens,” according to Alexander Minaev, the deputy head of the local government in Novaya Zemlya. Global warming is melting Arctic ice, forcing polar bears to abandon their traditional habitat and move closer to human settlements in search of food. But hunting the unwelcome visitors is prohibited in Russia where polar bears are officially protected as an endangered species.The government in Russia’s Arkhangelsk region declared a state of emergency on Novaya Zemlya on Saturday citing an unprecedented build-up in the number of polar bears in the remote region since December last year. Some 52 bears have been sighted around Belushya Guba, the biggest settlement on the islands – or about one bear for every 10 members of the local population.Aggressive behaviour Most of the animals appear to have holed up in a disused military garrison, but some have ventured out to enter residential and public buildings and displayed “aggressive behaviour”. Army personnel have been trying to drive out the bears using non-lethal measures. But the polar bears are so “convinced of their own safety” they ignore barking dogs, bright lights and loud noises intended to scare them away, local officials said. Rosprirodnadzor, the Russian environmental watchdog, has so far refused permission to shoot the bears, but is sending a special commission to Novaya Zemlya to assess the problem. Local authorities are calling for drastic action and say a cull may be inevitable. UnprecedentedZhigansha Musin, the head of the Novaya Zemlya administration, said the number of polar bears sighted was unprecedented. “I have been on Novaya Zemlya since 1983 and there has never been such a mass invasion,” he said. “They have literally been chasing people.” Polar bears migrate from the south to the north of the Novaya Zemlya archipelago in response to seasonal changes in ice conditions, Ilya Mordvintsev, an ecological and evolution specialist at the Russian Academy of Sciences, told the Tass news agency. They were stopping off at Beyusha Guba to search for food in local dustbins. “If there was no alternative source of foot there, they would probably pass straight by” without stopping, he added. Polar bears are facing an increasing struggle to survive as global climate change warms the Arctic Oceans shrinking their natural habitat. The World Wildlife Fund estimates there are 22,000 polar bears left in the world and that their numbers could shrink by 30 per cent by 2050. Industrial developments in the Arctic where oil companies are exploring for new resources are also a threat to the species."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3787141.1549647870!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"jeff bezos alleges national enquirer tried to blackmail him for intimate photos","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tJeff Bezos, pictured here in 2018, is the founder of Amazon, and the owner of the ‘Washington Post’. Photograph: Jim WatsonAFPGetty ImagesJeff Bezos, the billionaire founder of Amazon and owner of the Washington Post, may have thought his moment in the eye of the media storm was over.Last month, news came out of his separation from his wife of 25 years, writer Mackenzie Bezos, sparking broad coverage of the impending orce.The richest man in America has amassed a fortune of about $137 billion (€120 billion), mainly through Amazon, prompting feverish speculation about the nature of the orce settlement.His wife’s involvement in the early days of the business – she once worked as an accountant for the fledgling firm – ensures that she is likely to get a sizeable chunk of the wealth.But this week further details of the circumstances surrounding the marriage break-up and its announcement emerged.In a highly unusual move,\u0026nbspBezos published a blog on Thursday night accusing American Media Inc (AMI), the owner of the National Enquirer, of blackmail and extortion. In a blog post on Medium, Bezos said that senior executives from AMI threatened to publish intimate pictures of him if he did not stop his investigation into how the organisation obtained a number of his personal text messages and photographs of him.Hours after\u0026nbspBezos’s announcement of his separation last month, the National Enquirer  published details of his extra-marital affair with TV personality Lauren Sanchez, who is also married.In recent weeks\u0026nbspBezos hired a private investigator to examine how the publication obtained the information and some incriminating text messages that it published.On Thursday he revealed in his blog post that AMI executives had threatened to publish the intimate pictures if\u0026nbspBezos and his investigator Gavin de Becker did not issue a statement saying they “have no knowledge or basis for suggesting that AMI’s coverage was politically motivated or influenced by political forces”.Bezos instead decided to publish a long blog post outlining the sequence of events. “Rather than capitulate to extortion and blackmail, I’ve decided to publish exactly what they sent me, despite the personal cost and embarrassment they threaten,” he wrote.Within hours, Ronan Farrow, the prominent New Yorker journalist who broke many of the #MeToo stories and has written about AMI’s many “hush money” payments, said that he had also faced blackmail threats from AMI.Together with another unnamed prominent journalist, he had “fielded similar ‘stop digging or we’ll ruin you’ blackmail efforts” from AMI, he said.The clash between Bezos and the National Enquirer potentially opens up a new front in Donald Trump’s battle with the media and another twist in the various investigations involving the president.Trump has frequently taken aim at the Washington Post and Amazon. In contrast, the National Enquirer and its owner David Pecker have been strong Trump supporters.\u0026nbspThe tabloid publication published flattering stories about the New York businessman in the run-up to the 2016 election while running damaging stories about Hillary Clinton. But the company found itself embroiled in a federal investigation into possible campaign finance violations by Trump last year.It emerged that the Enquirer had paid $150,000 in the weeks before the election to a former Playboy model Karen McDougal, who was alleging an affair with\u0026nbspTrump. The development shed light on a practice known as “catch and kill” whereby publications pay off the rights to a story in order to stop their publication.AMI subsequently testified that it made the payments in order to influence the election at the direction of Trump – a possible campaign-finance violation. As part of its co-operation with investigators it was given immunity if it did not commit any crimes.The new allegations by Bezos raise serious questions about AMI’s practices and whether the immunity deal with prosecutors could be in jeopardy. This will likely centre on the question of whether AMI has committed a crime in its alleged attempts at extortion.Intriguingly, Bezos’s post also claims that Pecker and his company have been investigated “for various actions they’ve taken on behalf of the Saudi Government”. He also claims that Trump rewarded Pecker’s loyalty with a dinner in the White House, to which the media executive brought a guest with important ties to the Saudi royal family.In a statement on Friday, AMI said it “acted lawfully” in reporting the Bezos story, but nonetheless will “promptly and thoroughly investigate the claims”.Where the story goes next is likely to be a matter for investigators. But for\u0026nbspPecker, his one-time loyalty to Trump may now be a source of regret."},{"url":null,"title":"kumbh mela worlds largest religious gathering pictures","story":"Thousands of Hindu devout arrive to take a dip at Sangam, the confluence of three sacred rivers the Yamuna, the Ganges and the mythical Saraswati, on Monday, as part of the Kumbh Mela or Pitcher Festival, in Prayagraj, Uttar Pradesh state, IndiaLibby Squire suspect remains under investigation as police charge him with unrelated offencesTheresa May agrees to hold fresh talks with Jeremy Corbyn over his plans for a soft BrexitSir Philip Green accused of \u0026#39flouting law\u0026#39 as minister vows to overhaul NDAsTheresa May under pressure to intervene over Sir Philip Green\u0026#39s knighthood after two Cabinet ministers describe it as a \u0026#39disgrace\u0026#39Sir Philip Green staff \u0026#39told to wear revealing clothes\u0026#39 when he visitedSir Philip Green faces Met police inquiry over allegations of sexual assault and racial abuseBaroness Brady clings to government adviser title not held since 2016 as Sir Philip Green controversy ragesEndeavour, series 6 episode 1 review: Morse is back in uniform, but there\u0026#39s a puzzling lack of imaginationComment: Why are the police wasting time arresting Twitter transphobes when they could be tackling knife crime?Comment: Britain was once a global trading power.

He added: The SHGA remains committed to equality in competition.Bu the Scottish Trans Alliance admitted it was not aware of any trans iniduals or groups who have been applying pressure on the Highland Games to become non-binary inclusive.James Morton, the organisation\u0027s manager, said he would welcome the SHGA considering the inclusion of non-binary people but said this should not needlessly delay including women.Meanwhile, it emerged that prisons in England could stop transgender inmates servings their sentences in women\u0027s jails, with the Ministry of Justice announcing plans to revise the current policy.Please review our commenting policyLibby Squire suspect remains under investigation as police charge him with unrelated offencesTheresa May agrees to hold fresh talks with Jeremy Corbyn over his plans for a soft BrexitSir Philip Green accused of \u0026#39flouting law\u0026#39 as minister vows to overhaul NDAsTheresa May under pressure to intervene over Sir Philip Green\u0026#39s knighthood after two Cabinet ministers describe it as a \u0026#39disgrace\u0026#39Sir Philip Green staff \u0026#39told to wear revealing clothes\u0026#39 when he visitedBaroness Brady clings to government adviser title not held since 2016 as Sir Philip Green controversy ragesSir Philip Green faces Met police inquiry over allegations of sexual assault and racial abuseEndeavour, series 6 episode 1 review: Morse is back in uniform, but there\u0026#39s a puzzling lack of imaginationComment: Why are the police wasting time arresting Twitter transphobes when they could be tackling knife crime?Comment: Britain was once a global trading power.

However, the reported reason was to allow for negotiations between the SDF and Isil, which had been seeking safe passage to other desert areas of Syria in return for the release of dozens of SDF fighters captured in battle several months ago.Talks collapsed on Friday and on Saturday Isil released a video of the execution of two Arab members of the SDF and ordered sleeper cells across eastern Syria to attack the forces. The SDF, backed by coalition air power including UK support, has mowed through Isil’s former territory, moving south through Deir Ezzor province to a one square mile wedge of territory bordered by the Iraqi border to the east and the Euphrates river to the west.The SDF pushed towards the village of Baghuz on Sunday, backed by coalition airstrikes and artillery fire. Up to 600 jihadists could remain inside the area, including many foreign fighters, said Mustafa Bali, SDF spokesman.Our forces are relying on direct combat with light weapons, Mr Bali said. He added that his men had captured 41 jihadist positions before the day’s end.  On the Iraqi side of the border, French troops were poised to attack, lest any jihadists try to escape across the border they once bulldozed through with ease.Coalition deputy commander Christopher Ghika last week said Iraqi forces had sealed their border with Syria.Since September, when the SDF moved into the third phase of what military planners call Operation Roundup, more than 1,270 Isil militants, more than 670 SDF fighters, and around 400 civilians have been killed in the fighting, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.But even as the physical ground held by the jihadists shrinks, the terror group maintains a network of cells and supporters that s the globe. The presence of hundreds of foreign fighters and their wives and children raises difficult questions about the group’s legacy and the willingness of other countries to tackle it head-on.Libby Squire suspect remains under investigation as police charge him with unrelated offencesTheresa May agrees to hold fresh talks with Jeremy Corbyn over his plans for a soft BrexitSir Philip Green accused of \u0026#39flouting law\u0026#39 as minister vows to overhaul NDAsTheresa May under pressure to intervene over Sir Philip Green\u0026#39s knighthood after two Cabinet ministers describe it as a \u0026#39disgrace\u0026#39Sir Philip Green staff \u0026#39told to wear revealing clothes\u0026#39 when he visitedBaroness Brady clings to government adviser title not held since 2016 as Sir Philip Green controversy ragesSir Philip Green faces Met police inquiry over allegations of sexual assault and racial abuseEndeavour, series 6 episode 1 review: Morse is back in uniform, but there\u0026#39s a puzzling lack of imaginationComment: Why are the police wasting time arresting Twitter transphobes when they could be tackling knife crime?Comment: Britain was once a global trading power.

Officials voiced fears that the toll was set to riseIn the months that followed, the company has reportedly not leased or purchased any land or buildings for the facility. And, that lack of investment means Amazon could still change course if it felt like local conditions were not as ideal as previously thought.The situation in Queens stands in contrast with how the company has proceeded in Virginia, where local leaders moved quickly to approve an incentive package to keep Amazon\u0027s interest in the region. New York politicians are still mulling over their own package, which is not expected to receive approval until 2020.Should Amazon choose to scrap its plans for New York City, the company would still theoretically have plenty of options after having received numerous proposals from all over North America during a lengthy bidding process.Among the politicians in New York State who have spoken out against the deal are Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, whose district borders the areas chosen by Amazon for development. In the aftermath of the public announcement, opponents have gone door to door in the Queens neighbourhood to warn residents of coming rent hikes if the tech giant moves in.It is not clear what Amazon would do in the case that New York ultimately abandons its plan to offer an incentive package, and some analysts have noted that the company could still develop in the city on a smaller scale. Other tech giants, like Google, have notable already opened up facilities in the city with that strategy.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

If, for example, a user asks a digital assistant for information on purchasing a birthday gift, the digital assistant may use a happy emoji to present results.Apple already has a history of developing animated emojis, most recently with the launch of\u0026nbspan Animoji feature with iOS 12 called Memoji.Other features described in the patent include gesture controls and Face ID, meaning HomePod users could perform basic controls like scrolling through a menu simply by moving their hands.The FaceID feature would allow the smart speaker to recognise inidual users through facial recognition technology, allowing for greater personalised use of the HomePod.It is not clear if Apple intends to introduce these technologies with the next iteration of the HomePod – expected to be launched later this year – and company policy is to not comment on rumours or speculation surrounding forthcoming devices.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

A rising hash rate will also raise concerns about bitcoin\u0027s environmental impact, with its electricity consumption estimated to be more than the country of Ireland.Other analysts had warned that a fall below $3,000 would have signalled a blood bath for bitcoin, as traders sought to offload the crashing cryptocurrency.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Except it didn’t. We were delayed 28 hours.At first, as we waited in the lounge, no explanation was given. Then it was announced a faulty part had been discovered on a wing flap.

He treated the passengers like human beings, like grown-ups, describing how the wing flap was not operating properly when they tested it, and on inspection, a tiny bracket was found to have snapped. BA didn’t have one, but he was optimistic that Emirates did. It could be fitted fairly quickly, and we would soon be able to fly to London safely.After an hour it emerged Emirates did not have the part, after all.\u0026nbspKLM might, we were told. Before long, the captain was back to\u0026nbsptell us we would not be flying that night.\u0026nbspWe would have to wait 24 hours, for the bracket to be flown in from London, while BA would put\u0026nbspus up in hotels.British Airways celebrates 100 years with a retro paint jobSpanish Airways? BA seeks support from Spain amid Brexit anxietyAirlines that are on the EU’s banned listHe was calm, open and authoritative. As we clustered round he dealt clearly with all our queries. Nobody had any complaints. Thanks to the captain’s communication skills, the mood was one of good-humoured acceptance. He said he would see us the following evening, bade us farewell, apologised again, but stressed that our safety was paramount, and returned to his aircraft. Not one person had a bad word to say about him, or BA.If anything, as a result of his performance, BA’s stock actually soared. We understood that these things happen, it was just our bad luck the break occurred on our trip\u0026nbspbut, thank God\u0026nbspand thanks to BA’s\u0026nbspdiligence, it was spotted in time.Alas, the company’s standing was to sharply plummet. There was no one to guide us out of the airport, the hotel we were due to go to kept changing, there wasn’t a bus to take us there. We felt abandoned, at 5.30am at Dubai airport, a huge, sprawling place, buzzing with people even at that hour in the morning. After waiting forlornly for a coach, some of us took a cab and headed to one of the hotels that had been mentioned back in the lounge.When we got there, the hotel reception was unprepared for our arrival. Another wait ensued, while they tried to contact a local travel agent who was liaising with BA. Finally, at 7.30am, we went to our rooms.At night, we again went off to the airport. Again, there was no bus, no one co-ordinating our departure from the hotel, nobody taking care of us. Again, we had to jump into taxis.Once more at the airport, there now was pandemonium. We had to check in, at the same time as the passengers booked on that night’s BA106. Two sets of customers all trying to check-in simultaneously on flights bearing the same number. Eventually, after much shouting, those due to go as scheduled that evening were allowed to go first –\u0026nbspwe were informed our plane would be taking off an hour after theirs, at 3.30am.Forget the outrage about Dyson’s HQ move - we need to learn from itCheck-in staff were swamped, not least because many were also\u0026nbspchecking in for connecting flights at Heathrow. We reached the lounge, and waited,\u0026nbspand waited.We saw the other passengers leave for their flight which took off as planned. Ours, due to depart in an hour, was still not being shown as ready to board. A\u0026nbsptannoy\u0026nbspannouncement said it was being pushed back further. No reason was offered – that was it. Now there was anger, and mutterings of “next time I will fly Emirates”. Finally\u0026nbspwe left Dubai, 28 hours late.The contrast between the earlier delay and this one, between the captain and the ground staff, between the orderly manner in which he told us we would be staying in Dubai for 24 hours and the chaos subsequent to his news could not have been starker.Why? A captain feels responsible for his aircraft, its crew and passengers. Ours was driven by a sense of duty to see that we were okay, that we understood and appreciated the situation. The ground staff, and whoever was meant to take care of our well-being after we left his charge did not share his feeling of responsibility. They were local, they were dealing with numerous flights all day long, not just one that was late.The captain was driven by ownership they were not. The captain had been well-taught\u0026nbspbut he also came across entirely spontaneously. His colleagues had either missed the lesson or had not taken it in. Rather than behave naturally they stuck to an all-too familiar, inflexible, robotic style of delivery. No one was in command, nobody cared about the customers.Sadly, all the captain’s efforts were undone. BA must try harder: it’s no use one person stepping up, if the others around him fail to do so. It’s about everybody working together, and them all being joined up, not an inidual operating solo. He may have been brilliant, but the brand still emerged as the overall loser.Chris Blackhurst is a former editor of The Independent, and director of C|T|F Partners, the campaigns, strategic, crisis and reputational, communications advisory firmOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

And that Bank of England forecast assumes a smooth Brexit rather than a rupture at the end of March.The view of most economists is that the economic damage of Brexit is indeed already being done – and it is hurting the UK even if we end up avoiding a no-deal disaster later this month.Got an unanswered question about Brexit?

For good reason: the life of Elizabeth Morgan, née Caswell, is like a plotline on Call the Midwife. Morgan was born in Castleside, County Durham, as an unexpected twin to a family so poor\u0026nbspshe had to sleep in a drawer.Aged\u0026nbsp16\u0026nbspshe qualified as a nurse and worked in the Edinburgh slums. After responding to an advert from the Department for International\u0026nbspDevelopment in the 1970s, she was posted to Borneo\u0026nbspwhere she delivered babies in the rainforest and set up medical centres in remote tribal villages. By the time she came home, she had been involved in delivering the last ever smallpox vaccine.Michelle Obama’s memoir promotion will look like ‘a Madonna tour’This simple summerhouse near Berlin hides the most incredible storyPrince’s memoir will finally be released later this yearFor exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialMorgan had been to classes to learn how to write a memoir. She tried to write down the things she had experienced, but they always looked like lists of dates. Then last year, when she learned she had an aggressive form of breast cancer, her daughter knew it was their last chance. Ms Stewart says: “We thought if we didn’t get it written down we never would.”In February, Ms Stewart and her mother received four bound copies of their mother’s hardback memoir: Elizabeth Caswell: Ai ya, Sister!\u0026nbspElizabeth appeared in a black and white portrait on the cover: a striking\u0026nbspdark-haired woman with clear eyes and a prim white nurses hat. The memoir is one of hundreds that have been produced by Story Terrace, a startup founded on the idea\u0026nbspthere should be a biographer for every person. Using ghostwriters, it plans to turn a million life stories into books within 10 years.\u0026nbsp“It’s like social media for writing books, you find the person who fits with you,” Ms Stewart says. \u0026nbspShe had looked at hiring a biographer before, but had always been put off by the cost, which ran into the thousands. On the Story Terrace website, she\u0026nbspwas able to browse writers, read sample chapters and select a package starting at £1,500 for four\u0026nbsphours of interviews and four copies of a 60-page colour hardback book.\u0026nbspRutger Bruining, who started Story Terrace in the Netherlands in 2014, got the idea for a bespoke writing service after he saw\u0026nbspAustralian company Freelancer,\u0026nbspa platform described as “the world’s largest marketplace for outsourcing” where people can compete for jobs,\u0026nbspgo public. In 2013\u0026nbspthe company was forced to close its initial public offering (IPO) early after demand overwhelmed supply of the 30 million shares offered.\u0026nbspThe IPO caught Bruining’s attention. He had been thinking about scalable ways to tell people’s stories. After a stint in management consultancy, he did an MBA at Columbia University in New York and then returned to Europe to work in private equity in London. He saw the Freelancer IPO and was struck by two things: the site hosted really good writers who were offering their services to anyone, and the founders were using software to manage freelancers all around the world.\u0026nbspThis technology opened up the possibilities for a memoir-writing agency. Rather than hire 20 staff writers to work with customers, Story Terrace works with 500 writers and matches them to clients based on their location, education and cost, among other factors. “We can do that anywhere in the world, and we can still make beautiful books for people,” Mr Bruining says. “Without tech that wouldn’t be possible.”Story Terrace recommended a writer called Judy Brown to tell Elizabeth Morgan’s story. The family were allocated several hours, but Ms Stewart says they spent a productive afternoon. Ms Brown came to see her mother despite a broken ankle and asked gentle questions that started to reveal a narrative. Ms Brown says that process of getting to know a client well enough to inhabit their voice “can take a few gos”, but describes the process as an honour. “It makes people feel like they have done something. Until you look back and you see the story as a whole it can be hard to see quite how much you’ve achieved.”Neither Mr Bruining nor Ms Brown reveal writers’\u0026nbsprates. The former\u0026nbspsays the writers, who get paid a set fee per job, are “by far the biggest cost” to the business. Ms Brown, who is retired and has worked on as many as 14 memoirs through Story Terrace, says\u0026nbspthe work provides useful extra income, but that it would be difficult to make a full-time living out of it.Story Terrace launched in the UK in 2016 and has now had 700 clients globally. The company raised £590,000 in a crowdfunding round with Seedrs in 2017, taking the total value raised to £1.5m. Mr Bruining says the money is going towards building a “bookmaker platform” that will automate the design processes so they no longer have to employ inhouse designers.The next task will be to scale. In January\u0026nbspthe company recruited new board members Francois Coumau, a former eBay executive, to make new hires and smooth processes as the company grows. Angela Watts has joined the board after spending eight years at Spotify in the lead up to its IPO, to work on building awareness of the brand. Ms Watts says\u0026nbspshe was impressed by the early success of the service: “Story Terrace’s growth to date is admirable for a company creating a completely new product category – and they’ve only just scratched the surface.”\u0026nbspHalf the books commissioned on Story Terrace are gifts, often from relatives. Many have revealed extraordinary stories. A woman called Teresa Ibrahim has narrated her story growing up in poverty in rural Sudan, “in the fog of civil war”, to setting up charities for the education and empowerment of other displaced women. Another\u0026nbspexplores the journey of a Mongolian child to Britain in 1998 as one of the first generation of post-Soviet Mongolians allowed to leave the former communist regime. \u0026nbspFive real life stories that will change what you believe aboutAlison Stewart says her mother, now 80,\u0026nbspnever thought her story was that special. But the process of writing the book has brought back many memories, from the ambulance men who used to flirt with her at the Mayday Hospital in Croydon, to the sudden surfacing of a whole set of photos from her graduation as a nurse.Ms Stewart, who has a passion for working out her family history, imagines the book will sit alongside her other research: from the family tree, to the diary of her great great grandfather, who was born in 1801. “I’ll put them all together,” she says. “In 100 years, someone else will be able to find it.”\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Officials voiced fears that the toll was set to riseIn the months that followed, the company has reportedly not leased or purchased any land or buildings for the facility. And, that lack of investment means Amazon could still change course if it felt like local conditions were not as ideal as previously thought.The situation in Queens stands in contrast with how the company has proceeded in Virginia, where local leaders moved quickly to approve an incentive package to keep Amazon\u0027s interest in the region. New York politicians are still mulling over their own package, which is not expected to receive approval until 2020.Should Amazon choose to scrap its plans for New York City, the company would still theoretically have plenty of options after having received numerous proposals from all over North America during a lengthy bidding process.Among the politicians in New York State who have spoken out against the deal are Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, whose district borders the areas chosen by Amazon for development. In the aftermath of the public announcement, opponents have gone door to door in the Queens neighbourhood to warn residents of coming rent hikes if the tech giant moves in.It is not clear what Amazon would do in the case that New York ultimately abandons its plan to offer an incentive package, and some analysts have noted that the company could still develop in the city on a smaller scale. Other tech giants, like Google, have notable already opened up facilities in the city with that strategy.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Except it didn’t. We were delayed 28 hours.At first, as we waited in the lounge, no explanation was given. Then it was announced a faulty part had been discovered on a wing flap.

He treated the passengers like human beings, like grown-ups, describing how the wing flap was not operating properly when they tested it, and on inspection, a tiny bracket was found to have snapped. BA didn’t have one, but he was optimistic that Emirates did. It could be fitted fairly quickly, and we would soon be able to fly to London safely.After an hour it emerged Emirates did not have the part, after all.\u0026nbspKLM might, we were told. Before long, the captain was back to\u0026nbsptell us we would not be flying that night.\u0026nbspWe would have to wait 24 hours, for the bracket to be flown in from London, while BA would put\u0026nbspus up in hotels.British Airways celebrates 100 years with a retro paint jobSpanish Airways? BA seeks support from Spain amid Brexit anxietyAirlines that are on the EU’s banned listHe was calm, open and authoritative. As we clustered round he dealt clearly with all our queries. Nobody had any complaints. Thanks to the captain’s communication skills, the mood was one of good-humoured acceptance. He said he would see us the following evening, bade us farewell, apologised again, but stressed that our safety was paramount, and returned to his aircraft. Not one person had a bad word to say about him, or BA.If anything, as a result of his performance, BA’s stock actually soared. We understood that these things happen, it was just our bad luck the break occurred on our trip\u0026nbspbut, thank God\u0026nbspand thanks to BA’s\u0026nbspdiligence, it was spotted in time.Alas, the company’s standing was to sharply plummet. There was no one to guide us out of the airport, the hotel we were due to go to kept changing, there wasn’t a bus to take us there. We felt abandoned, at 5.30am at Dubai airport, a huge, sprawling place, buzzing with people even at that hour in the morning. After waiting forlornly for a coach, some of us took a cab and headed to one of the hotels that had been mentioned back in the lounge.When we got there, the hotel reception was unprepared for our arrival. Another wait ensued, while they tried to contact a local travel agent who was liaising with BA. Finally, at 7.30am, we went to our rooms.At night, we again went off to the airport. Again, there was no bus, no one co-ordinating our departure from the hotel, nobody taking care of us. Again, we had to jump into taxis.Once more at the airport, there now was pandemonium. We had to check in, at the same time as the passengers booked on that night’s BA106. Two sets of customers all trying to check-in simultaneously on flights bearing the same number. Eventually, after much shouting, those due to go as scheduled that evening were allowed to go first –\u0026nbspwe were informed our plane would be taking off an hour after theirs, at 3.30am.Forget the outrage about Dyson’s HQ move - we need to learn from itCheck-in staff were swamped, not least because many were also\u0026nbspchecking in for connecting flights at Heathrow. We reached the lounge, and waited,\u0026nbspand waited.We saw the other passengers leave for their flight which took off as planned. Ours, due to depart in an hour, was still not being shown as ready to board. A\u0026nbsptannoy\u0026nbspannouncement said it was being pushed back further. No reason was offered – that was it. Now there was anger, and mutterings of “next time I will fly Emirates”. Finally\u0026nbspwe left Dubai, 28 hours late.The contrast between the earlier delay and this one, between the captain and the ground staff, between the orderly manner in which he told us we would be staying in Dubai for 24 hours and the chaos subsequent to his news could not have been starker.Why? A captain feels responsible for his aircraft, its crew and passengers. Ours was driven by a sense of duty to see that we were okay, that we understood and appreciated the situation. The ground staff, and whoever was meant to take care of our well-being after we left his charge did not share his feeling of responsibility. They were local, they were dealing with numerous flights all day long, not just one that was late.The captain was driven by ownership they were not. The captain had been well-taught\u0026nbspbut he also came across entirely spontaneously. His colleagues had either missed the lesson or had not taken it in. Rather than behave naturally they stuck to an all-too familiar, inflexible, robotic style of delivery. No one was in command, nobody cared about the customers.Sadly, all the captain’s efforts were undone. BA must try harder: it’s no use one person stepping up, if the others around him fail to do so. It’s about everybody working together, and them all being joined up, not an inidual operating solo. He may have been brilliant, but the brand still emerged as the overall loser.Chris Blackhurst is a former editor of The Independent, and director of C|T|F Partners, the campaigns, strategic, crisis and reputational, communications advisory firmOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Come at me, says David BarnettClick to followThe IndependentOasis’s London debut at the Water Rats, January 1994There will be those who have just read the headline and already gone directly to the comments to take issue. For any waverers, I’ll set out my stall again: 1994 was the best year in music. Possibly ever.\u0026nbspStill here? Right, we happy few, let’s unpack this a little. Putting the words “best” and “music” together is always going to be subjective. One woman’s Metallica is another man’s Joe Dolce. And there’s also time and place to take into account. If you were six years old in 1994, you might not have been bothered about contemporary pop. If you were 76, maybe ditto. But there are certain immutable, irrefutable truths, and this is one of them. The year 1994 was spectacular for music on so, so many levels.Perhaps a bit of wider context is needed. To live through 1994 as a relatively young person (I turned 24 in the January) was to be at the centre of what felt like a time of transcendent change in the UK.That was the year the IRA ceasefire was signed, and 911 was still seven years away, and not on on our radar at all. After the breakup of the Soviet Union three years earlier, Russia was more interested in implementing democracy and capitalism than fighting a Cold War. It felt like the dawn of an age – sadly short-lived – when nobody was trying to blow us up.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialIn 1994, Bill Clinton was in the White House, and still a year away from staining his character (and a dress) by not having sexual relations with Monica Lewinsky. Neil Kinnock’s Labour had somehow lost the 1992 general election, despite everyone being confident the Tory stranglehold was finally over, but in 1994 Labour named Tony Blair as leader of the party, and things...\u0026nbspwell, things could only get better.To live through 1994 as a relatively young person ... was to be at the centre of what felt like a time of transcendent change in the UKAfter what seemed like years of stagnation, there was a whiff of change in the air. Things felt in some way more optimistic. The country felt more inclusive, less isive. There was opportunity, and expectation. It was the year they launched the National Lottery. Any one of us could become a multimillionaire by buying a ticket for a quid.And music reflected this, as it always reflects the world around it. There was a sensation of rapid, almost out-of-control evolution in music. People’s record collections became more eclectic, more wide-ranging, more small-c catholic. The old boundaries seemed to melt away. You didn’t need to choose between being a rocker or a raver or an indie-kid or a popster. You could be all of them at once, because if the bands and artists were refusing to stay in their pigeonholes, why should the public?Why we haven’t had a decent Christmas song since 1994Slap bang in the middle of the year, at the Glastonbury Festival at the end of June, I stood in a field and had a transformative experience watching the progressive techno band Orbital playing a set to what felt like half the people in the world. They had come to Glastonbury to see Oasis, or Rage Against the Machine they had come for Björk and James. They had come to listen to Nick Cave, to jump around to Blur, to dance to M People. And in the end, they all came to watch Orbital playing their bleepy, unnerving, bass-pounding music of the spheres, and for what felt like the first time ever the tribes were all united in the love of music.Of course, that could just be the drugs talking. But look at that Glastonbury line-up! Just one year, one scorching hot June weekend! And you can add to that list St Etienne, Paul Weller, Pulp, Spirtualised, Radiohead...\u0026nbsppossibly the best Glastonbury ever, in the year of the best music ever?That coming together at the Orbital set heralded a sea change for Glastonbury. According to Sheryl Garratt’s excellent book detailing the rise of rave culture, Adventures in Wonderland, Glasto organiser Michael Eavis had previously shied away from having a dance stage because of the negative connotations attached to rave and techno – primarily the drugs, illegal events and mass takeovers at places like Castlemorton two years previously.She wrote: “But after Orbital’s live set stole the show in 1994, a dance stage and dance tents were finally introduced the following year, and Glastonbury has become an annual event on the club calendar.”If I had to fight with myself over this bold claim for 1994 to be music’s finest year, I’d probably employ maybe 1988 as my weapon of choice. That was really the start of rave culture, and where dance music began to cross over with guitar bands, resulting in the baggy Madchester sound epitomised by the Happy Mondays, the Stone Roses, James and\u0026nbspthe Inspiral Carpets.But while that might have been where the seeds of fusion of the genres and inclusivity were sown, I’d argue that it wasn’t until 1994 that those ideas and concepts properly blossomed. And, of course, 1994 was the year of Britpop.It was actually in 1993 that Britpop got going, thanks to a feature in the now defunct music magazine Select. Grunge, with its poster boys Nirvana and their lead singer Kurt Cobain (more of whom anon) had held sway with its nihilistic, fuzzy guitars in Britain for a couple of years among an army of plaid-wearing, chain-smoking disaffected youth. But Select wanted to wave the flag for Blighty, quite literally as that month’s issue featured on its cover Suede’s Brett Anderson against a union jack background and an article\u0026nbspinside headlined, “Who Do You Think You Are Kidding, Mr Cobain?”. Denim, Pulp, Suede, The Auteurs and St Etienne were all featured, in a bid to push British pop back up the agenda.By 1994, two seminal Britpop albums went head to head – as did the bands responsible for them. Oasis released their debut Definitely Maybe, while Blur brought out their third LP, Parklife. Oasis v Blur bubbled under throughout the year, battle lines drawn at the Watford Gap. It was the naughty north vs the sexy south, Manchester’s Oasis and their Beatlesque anthems set against Blur’s cheeky chappy Camden Kinks roisterers. By the following year, the so-called rivalry even made the BBC evening news as the two bands released singles on the same day.If there ever was any proper animosity between Oasis and Blur, it didn’t extend to the fans. Blur or Oasis might have been a perennial pub debate throughout 1994, but I don’t think I knew anyone who didn’t own both Definitely Maybe and Parklife. The rivalry added a bit of spice, and music fans were the winners with two defining albums of the decade.Britpop wasn’t only about Blur and Oasis, of course, though as the cocky lads in the class they tended to get most of the attention. But let us consider some of the other releases that came under the red-white-and-blue Britpop banner:\u0026nbspPulp’s His ’n’\u0026nbspHers, considered to be the album that brought them to mainstream attention, especially for the standout tracks “Do You Remember the First Time?” and “Babies”\u0026nbspEchobelly’s debut Everyone’s Got One, with its spiky, caustic, feminist songs Suede’s second album Dog Man Star, which perhaps exemplified how bands were not afraid to evolve and transform in 1994. Suede’s first album was almost a paean to Bowie with a side order of The Smiths here they’d gone much more personal and perhaps introspective.Another band that completely reinvented itself in 1994 was Primal Scream. Never a band to stick with one musical style, they had, however, found a niche in the dance-rock mash-ups of 1991’s Screamadelica. When they returned in ’94 with Give Out But Don’t Give Up, it could not have been further from the blissed-out rhythms of “Loaded” and “Higher Than the Sun”. The Scream had gone full-on Rolling Stones blues, and the\u0026nbspfirst single from the album, “Rocks”, was the band’s highest-charting release.Had 1994 given us only Britpop, the year would still have deserved a place in posterity. But it was about so much more than that. Select magazine might have jokingly tried to drive America back into the sea the previous year, but US bands released some absolutely classic albums that year.What about Green Day’s Dookie, and its single “Basket Case”? By 1994, REM were stone-cold alt-rock royalty, and while their ninth studio album Monster might not be in everyone’s top five REM albums, it did at least give us the single “What’s the Frequency, Kenneth?”. Weezer released their self-titled debut, and Beck gave us the unalloyed eclectic joy of Mellow Gold and the single “Loser”.But the most influential American band of the era, Nirvana, came to a tragic end when, in April,\u0026nbspleader Kurt Cobain wrote a note to his imaginary childhood friend and then put a shotgun to his chin and pulled the trigger. He had gone and joined that stupid club, the one where the most talented musicians of a generation end their own lives at the age of 27. Janis Joplin, Jimi Hendrix, Jim Morrison. The year\u0026nbsphad its martyr.This was also the year that music fans who’d previously filled their CD racks with white boys playing guitars began to embrace rap and hip-hop\u0026nbsp– and also when hip-hop transformed, Kafka-like, into something quite new.Then Notorious BIG\u0026nbspreleased his debut Ready to Die, and indeed he did, becoming the martyr of 1997 a few years later. Public Enemy brought out their highly acclaimed fifth studio album, Muse Sick-n-Hour Mess Age, and the Beastie Boys fused hip hop with the greatest 1970s police detective show that never was with the video to their single “Sabotage”.In Britain, this acceptance of rap into the music collections of the largely white indie-kid audience led to the birth of something else we can thank 1994 for: trip-hop.The term was coined that year by a Mixmag journalist to describe the bass-heavy fusion of hip-hop and dance music that was largely coming out of Bristol. Massive Attack had already released the seminal Blue Lines album and the evergreen “Unfinished Sympathy” in 1991, but this year saw their second album Protection, and its standout single release “Karmacoma”. But the year was most notable for Portishead’s debut, Dummy, drenched in blue and heartbreak, and the soundtrack to a thousand all-back-to-mine post-club chillouts.What else? Well, we could still get away with forgiving Morrissey a lot back in 1994, especially with his fourth solo album Vauxhall and I. The Manic Street Preachers released The Holy Bible, the last work to feature troubled lyricist and guitarist Richey Edwards. The following year he would go missing, never to be found, making a martyr of a more introspective kind than Cobain’s dramatic exit. The old-stagers were keeping on keeping on, with albums from Madonna and the Rolling Stones, and even a wealth of previously unheard Beatles material from their sessions at the BBC.But if there was one comeback that exemplified 1994, it had to be The Stone Roses. Their self-titled debut album in 1989 soundtracked a generation. Their return five years later had a lot riding on it in terms of expectations. So, of course, they titled it The Second Coming.Bill Gates basically predicted rise of Netflix and Facebook in 1994Read this full unedited Tom Petty interview published in 1994Was it ever going to be as good as The Stone Roses? No, of course not, because that album was perfection. But with singles such as “Love Spreads” and “Ten Storey Love Song”, they made a pretty good fist of it. But it was an event, it was exciting, it was history-making. And it was brave and reckless and so typically Stone Roses\u0026nbspto release their first new album for years when everyone had all but written them off, and especially to do that in the greatest year for music ever.Without the benefit of the internet or smartphones, we discovered new music in 1994, we heard it in the pubs and at gigs and in clubs and festivals and on John Peel’s radio show. We bought indie music then we went to Creamfields or to superclubs in places like Leeds, and danced until dawn.Techno got hard and heavy. The aforementioned Orbital released Snivilisation, a growling, science-fiction nightmare of an album. The government tried to kill off rave culture good and proper with the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994, which drove people into the clubs but also earned a response from the Prodigy in the form of Music for the Jilted Generation, a howling, psychopathic protest album that gifted us the insane energy of “No Good (Start the Dance)” and “Voodoo People”. The Chemical Brothers, under the name the Dust Brothers, started releasing singles. Dance music became raw and scary, a self-fulfilling prophecy for those in positions of authority that thought they simply had to ban it.Music in 1994 was a erse mess, just like it always is. But it seemed as if there was an invisible thread running through all these genres\u0026nbspthat connected people through a general love of music. You might love Oasis more than the Prodigy, or Blur more than Portishead, but the chances are you listened to all of it. The year was about invention, about reinvention, about throwing open the doors and just trying everything. It was involving and inclusive and seems to shine so very brightly from the vantage point of today.\u0026nbspThe obvious answer to all this is that I am just old and clinging on to a year that seemed glorious just because I was there. But I insist: 1994 was the best year ever for music, and its spirit is something we could sorely do with today.

But the mission was retired in October, when its fuel finally run out and Nasa moved the telescope into a safe orbit and shut it down.The image – called last light, just as the first light was taken nearly ten years earlier – closes a mission that has discovered thousands of those distant worlds and brought hope that habitable planets deep in our galaxy could be waiting to be found.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialSince Kepler first opened its eye up to space and started looking for those stars, it found more than 2,600 worlds beyond our solar system – proving that planets are far more common than expected and that other places like our own Earth could be lurking out there.The image also shows some of the effect of those ten years. The blackened gaps at the middle and top of the image are where parts have failed in the camera, but Kepler was designed in a modular way that meant those problems did not affect the rest of the instrument.The final image came after Kepler\u0027s last observation campaign, for which it was pointed towards the constellation Aquarius.

That slight overlap means astronomers can compare data from the two spacecraft, helping calibrate and improve the data Nasa will go on to receive.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It’s been cancelled now, but that doesn’t mean you can’t catch up with it, and then write Netflix a strongly worded email.220 Money Heist (TV series, one season, 2017–)Known as La Casa de Papel (House of Paper) in its native Spanish, Money Heist is Netflix’s most streamed non-English language show. The bank heist is a tired dramatic trope these days, but don’t let that, or the show’s bland English-language title, put you off – creator Álex Pina has made something special. The heist here, led by a mysterious man known only as The Professor, involves breaking into the Royal Mint of Spain and printing off €2.4 billion. There are even more twists in the show’s 15 episodes than there are hostages. 320 One Day at a Time (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)In stark contrast to the off-beat, low-key comedy that currently rules TV – the kind that provokes a wry smirk rather than a hearty laugh – One Day at a Time is a big, bright sitcom filmed in front of an interminably enthusiastic studio audience. You wouldn’t have thought that the story of a Cuban-American army veteran  nurse  single mother – who suffers from PTSD and depression – would fit into this format, but it does so beautifully, tackling issues of sexuality, racism and sexism in the process.  Based on writer  director Tamara Jenkins’s own fertility struggles, Private Life stars Kathryn Hahn and Paul Giamatti (both giving brilliant performances) as a spiky, loving middle-aged couple desperate to have a baby. They even rope their enthusiastic but irresponsible niece Sadie (Kayli Carter) into the mix, much to the horror of Sadie’s mother (Molly Shannon, turning a potentially repellent character into one worthy of empathy). It’s subtle, restrained and beautifully realised.520 Big Mouth (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)Crude, rude, and rife with surprise emissions and bodily functions, animated sitcom Big Mouth is also a sensitive, nuanced deep e into the various horrors of teenagehood. When 12-year-old Andrew Glouberman (John Mulaney) is visited by the hormone monster (Nick Kroll, who voices many of the show’s best characters), he finds his life irreversibly – and seemingly disastrously – changed. Unlike many other puberty-centred comedies, Big Mouth makes as much time for its confused female protagonists as its male ones Maya Rudolph is a delight as the female hormone monster, and look out for Kristen Wiig’s wonderful turn as a talking vagina.  620 Easy (TV series, two seasons, 2016–)Joe Swanberg’s style of defiantly undramatic mumblecore isn’t for everyone, but if you enjoyed his earlier films, Drinking Buddies and Happy Christmas, you’ll find plenty to admire in this anthology comedy-drama series. Big-name stars such as Orlando Bloom and Aubrey Plaza crop up, but Jane Adams – who you might remember from Todd Solondz’s chronically depressing 1998 film Happiness – is the show’s heart, and Marc Maron is its jaded soul.Community’s Gillian Jacobs is brilliant as the prickly, magnetic recovering addict Mickey, who forms an unlikely – and arguably deeply unwise – relationship with her nerdy neighbour Gus (Paul Rust). Despite Gus’s pathological need to be the nice guy, we’re never quite sure who or what we’re rooting for – which is what makes Love such complex, compelling viewing.  In 2016, comedian Patton Oswalt’s wife, the true crime writer Michelle McNamara, died suddenly in her sleep. That subject matter doesn’t exactly scream “stand-up special”, but out of his devastating loss, Oswalt managed to craft something funny and profound. Over the course of an hour, he processes his grief onstage, managing to find humour in the struggle to raise his grieving six-year-old daughter alone.920 Santa Clarita Diet (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)Granted, this horror-comedy – which stars Drew Barrymore as a neurotic real estate agent who suddenly develops a taste for human flesh – is really silly, and really, really disgusting. But it’s also strangely charming, and funny. Timothy Olyphant is excellent as Sheila’s frazzled husband Joel, and the pair’s idiosyncratic but respectful relationship with their smart teenage daughter Abby (Liv Hewson) isn’t quite like anything else on TV right now.1020 Dark Tourist (TV series, one season, 2018–)New Zealand journalist David Farrier is an unlikely TV presenter in the same way that Louis Theroux is – in just about every scenario in which he finds himself, he’s a little bit awkward. But as with Theroux, Farrier’s weakness is actually his strength, allowing him to endear himself to the many unusual people he meets on his journey through the world’s most questionable tourist destinations. Farrier’s stops include the site of the Fukushima nuclear disaster, the road where JFK was assassinated, and the Milwaukee suburbs where serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer murdered his victims.1120 Sacred Games (TV series, one season, 2018–)Based on Vikram Chandra’s epic 2006 novel, Netflix’s first Indian original series is a slowly unfolding gem. The first season of Sacred Games – which follows a troubled police officer (Saif Ali Khan) who has 25 days to save his city thanks to a tip-off from a presumed dead gangster – only covered one quarter of Chandra’s 1,000-page novel. As the show itself declared when it announced the forthcoming second season, “the worst is yet to come”.When the trailer for Dumplin’ first landed, it seemed all the ingredients were in place for a film that was at worst tone-deaf, and at best vaguely patronising. Thank heavens, then, that the trailer did Dumplin’ such a disservice. Starring Danielle Macdonald (who broke out in the excellent 2017 film Patti Cake$) as Willowdean, a self-described “fat girl” who enters a local pageant to annoy her former beauty queen mother (Jennifer Aniston), Dumplin’ is as funny, warm and sensitive as its protagonist – and with a killer Dolly Parton-laden soundtrack to boot.1320 Dark (TV series, one season, 2017–)This sci-fi thriller – which features disappearing children, a mysterious local power plant, and scenes set in the Eighties – has, for obvious reasons, drawn comparisons to Stranger Things. But Dark is even more beguiling and (true to its name) less family-friendly than Stranger Things.1420 The Death and Life of Marsha P Johnson (Film, 2017)Though it’s been somewhat tarnished by claims that director David France appropriated the work and research of trans film-maker Reina Gossett, this documentary is nonetheless a loving, respectful tribute to gay rights activist Marsha P Johnson. One of the key figures in the Stonewall uprising (though her involvement was almost entirely eradicated in 2015’s critically hated Stonewall), Johnson modelled for Andy Warhol, performed onstage with drag group Hot Peaches, helped found the Gay Liberation Front, and then died under suspicious circumstances in 1992.1520 On My Block (TV series, one season, 2018–)This coming-of-age series might not have found as many eyeballs as it deserved last year, but those it did find were glued to the screen. In fact, it was the most-binged show of 2018 – meaning that it had the highest watch-time-per-viewing session of any Netflix original. Created by Awkward’s Lauren Iungerich, On My Block follows a group of Los Angeles teens as they navigate both the drama of high school and the danger of inner-city life.Two beleaguered assistants (Zoey Deutch and Glen Powell) conspire to get their over-demanding bosses (Taye Diggs and Lucy Liu) together in order to get their lives back in this winning romantic comedy. Set It Up is responsible not only for coining the term “over-dicking” (it’s much more innocent than it sounds), but for rejuvenating a tired genre.Martin Freeman stars as the father struggling to protect his young daughter from a zombie epidemic spreading across Australia. So far, so overdone. But this drama thriller, directed by Ben Howling and Yolanda Ramke and based on their 2013 short of the same name, throws a handful of unpredictable ners in the works.    1920 Godless (TV series, one season, 2017–)With shades of John Ford\u0027s The Searchers, this languorous western was critically acclaimed but swiftly forgotten after it landed on Netflix in 2016. Set in 1884, it\u0027s about Frank Griffin (Jeff Daniels) and his notoriously ruthless gang of outlaws’ pursuit of their injured former ally Roy Goode (Jack O’Connell), who is hiding out in a small town populated solely by women after a mining accident killed off all its men. A gun-toting Michelle Dockery, clearly relishing the change of scenery after years of Downton Abbey, and a taciturn Jack O’Connell, are on brilliant form.2020 Atypical (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)This coming-of-age series about a teenage boy with autism was sweet and well-intentioned from the start, but its first season was criticised for a handful of inaccuracies, and for its lack of autistic actors. Rather than drowning in a sea of defensiveness – as too many shows tend to do – it listened, and brought in autistic actors and writers for its excellent second season.120 American Vandal (TV series, two seasons, 2017–2018)Part satire of true crime documentaries such as Making a Murderer, part carefully observed portrayal of teenage life, American Vandal was criminally underappreciated during its two season run. It’s been cancelled now, but that doesn’t mean you can’t catch up with it, and then write Netflix a strongly worded email.220 Money Heist (TV series, one season, 2017–)Known as La Casa de Papel (House of Paper) in its native Spanish, Money Heist is Netflix’s most streamed non-English language show.

Not exactly caring and progressive.”The advert has drawn comparisons with a series of 2016 Spotify posters, one of which seemingly expressed concern for singletons on Valentine’s Day.Banking company condemned for ‘single-shaming’ advert“Dear person who listened to the ‘Forever Alone’ playlist for four hours on Valentine’s Day, you OK?” the caption on the poster read.In a statement on Friday, the ASA said: “We received a small number of complaints in connection with the Revolut ads.“Where these make claims about the product or service it falls within the remit of the FCA, and we have passed on complaints that deal with these for their consideration.”Revolut said it was hosting a Valentine’s Day drinks event at its London office for “anyone who doesn’t yet have plans”, but declined to comment on the adverts.The company\u0026nbspfamed\u0026nbspfor its metal bank cards and free foreign exchange transactions, has grown rapidly since its 2015 launch.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The British people have waited three years to enjoy the benefits of life outside of the EU and for a Conservative government to prevent this would be an unforgivable betrayal.“We urge the party to reverse this avoidable collision course with the British electorate, before it is too late. Ignore us at your peril.”The development came after the government admitted MPs might not get a chance to vote on the final deal until next month, despite exit day looming on 29 March.MPs will consider a Valentine’s Day motion on Brexit with a series of amendments, including a Labour push to impose a 26 February deadline for a meaningful vote on the deal.Created with Sketch.

Some 28 per cent disagreed with the statement.Asked if they would support a final vote, whether a deal is reached or not, 50 per cent backed the idea, while 32 per cent opposed it.More than 1\u0026nbspmillion people have backed\u0026nbspThe Independent’s\u0026nbspcampaign for a\u0026nbspFinal Say\u0026nbspreferendum on the prime minister’s Brexit deal, with hundreds of thousands of protesters taking to the streets last year.MPs are bracing\u0026nbspfor a Valentine’s Day\u0026nbspclash over\u0026nbspMs May’s Brexit plan, as the prime minister scrambles to break the impasse over the isive Irish backstop.Ms May held talks in Belfast, Brussels and Dublin this week after MPs ordered her to ditch the mechanism, which acts as an insurance policy against a hard border on the island of Ireland.The EU\u0026nbsphas repeatedly said it will not renegotiate the Brexit deal that took 18 months to secure.Even a written constitution can\u0027t save us from Brexit nowWhat does the latest offer from the EU to renegotiate Brexit mean?Work begins to turn the M20 into car park ahead of BrexitUK ‘forcing poor nations into risky trade deals’Labour want new Brexit vote if May rejects our plan, McDonnell saysThe BMG poll showed\u0026nbspthe majority (53 per cent) believed she will fail to win the concessions she needs to get the deal through parliament, with only 22 per cent saying she would be successful.If Ms May cannot bring a revised\u0026nbspdeal back to parliament then\u0026nbspshe must table a\u0026nbspmotion on Valentine’s Day, allowing the\u0026nbspCommons a fresh chance to seize control of the Brexit process.MPs are poised to launch a\u0026nbspfresh\u0026nbspbid\u0026nbspto thwart a\u0026nbspno-deal exit after the original plan led by Labour MP\u0026nbspYvette Cooper and Tory Nick Boles was defeated in the Commons\u0026nbsplast month.The Independent understands that a new version of the\u0026nbspbid\u0026nbsphas been drawn up to extend Article 50 to prevent a disorderly exit in March.However senior cross-party MPs involved in the project are said to be\u0026nbspwaiting to see what the prime minister brings to parliament\u0026nbspnext week before deciding to act.Meanwhile, a separate group of Tory ex-cabinet ministers has warned Ms May that the “monumental”\u0026nbspproblems with her Brexit plan cannot be solved by “cursory tweaks”.Pro-EU Conservative Nicky\u0026nbspMorgan and Brexiteers Iain Duncan Smith and Owen Paterson, who are\u0026nbspin talks\u0026nbspto find an alternative to the\u0026nbspbackstop, said the measure was “simply never going to pass the Commons”\u0026nbspin its current form.Attorney general Geoffrey\u0026nbspCox has been leading work within Whitehall on securing\u0026nbspeither a time limit on the backstop or giving the UK an exit mechanism from it.Both proposals have been rejected by Dublin, which insists the backstop cannot be time-limited if it is to provide an effective insurance policy\u0026nbspagainst a hard border on the island of Ireland.BMG Research interviewed a representative sample of 1,503 British\u0026nbspadults online between 4 and\u0026nbsp8\u0026nbspFebruary.

have\u0026nbspbeen gearing up for\u0026nbspa Valentine’s Day\u0026nbspshowdown, assuming Ms May is unable to\u0026nbsppresent a revised deal to parliament by Wednesday, including a push by Labour to force her into a meaningful vote by the end of the month.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialBut in an effort to see off attempts to bind the government\u0027s hands, Downing Street is promising another opportunity to table amendments - which are likely to include measures aimed at taking a no-deal Brexit off the table - on February 27.MPs should approve Theresa May’s deal – subject to a new referendumThe move is aimed at postponing a rebellion by ministers who are committed to removing the possibility of the UK crashing out of the EU without a deal on March 29.But there is no commitment to hold a binding vote on the deal itself by the end of the month.Mr Brokenshire told The Andrew Marr Show: “I think that gives that sense of timetable, clarity and purpose on what we are doing with the EU – taking that work forward and our determination to get a deal – but equally knowing that role that parliament very firmly has.”It comes as Sir Keir Starmer said Labour\u0026nbspwould stop the prime minister “running down the clock” to exit day in March, by drafting an amendment to compel her to offer a vote by the end of February.And Labour\u0026nbspMPs Peter Kyle and Phil Wilson were poised to launch a new push for a second referendum, writing in The Independent: “It would also be reckless to accept the withdrawal agreement without the approval of the British people.”Both bids are expected to be among the\u0026nbsprange of amendments tabled for votes on Valentine’s Day.Ms May flew to Brussels, Belfast and Dublin last week to hold last-ditch talks after MPs ordered her to replace the isive Irish backstop with an alternative plan.But she was met with stony\u0026nbspopposition from EU leaders, who have repeatedly said that the Brexit deal cannot be renegotiated.The shadow Brexit secretary said Labour was determined to prevent the prime minister from taking Britain to the brink of a no-deal Brexit.“We have got to put a hard stop into this running down the clock,” Sir Keir told\u0026nbspThe\u0026nbspSunday Times. “And that’s what we want to do this week.”Tony Blair says no-deal Brexit will lead to ‘really hard border’Rebel Labour MPs warned of constituency costs if they back May’s dealMajority of voters want Theresa May to delay Brexit, poll findsEven a written constitution can’t save us from Brexit nowWhat does the latest offer from the EU to renegotiate Brexit mean?He accused Ms May of “pretending to make progress” and said she intends\u0026nbspto return to parliament after a crunch European\u0026nbspCouncil summit the week before Brexit and offer MPs a “binary choice” – her deal or no deal.“We can’t allow that to happen,” Sir Keir said. “There needs to be a day when parliament says that’s it, enough is enough.”Meanwhile, Labour backbenchers Mr Kyle and Mr Wilson have come up with a plan to back Ms May’s deal if she offers a referendum once it passes through parliament.Writing for The Independent, the pair said: “We believe that to leave the decision to 650 MPs and the unelected House of Lords smacks of the accusation of elitism levelled against politicians during the referendum campaign.“The right and proper step to take is for MPs and the Lords to approve the prime minister’s deal followed by a confirmatory vote of the British people.\u0026nbsp“We believe this process started with the people and should end with the people.”A new version is also\u0026nbspbeing drawn up of a plan by Labour MP\u0026nbspYvette Cooper and Tory Nick Boles to extend Article 50 to prevent a disorderly exit in March.Created with Sketch.Brexit deal

comes after Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn wrote to Ms May setting out his party’s terms for backing a Brexit deal, which include backing a customs union with the EU.However chief secretary to the Treasury\u0026nbspLiz Truss twice refused to rule out quitting if Ms May\u0026nbspaccepted the demand for a customs union.She told Sophy Ridge On Sunday: “I appreciate Jeremy Corbyn has come to the table but the reality is what he is proposing does not deliver on what we want as a country.”Asked if she could stay in office if the government backed a customs union, she said: “I absolutely do not think that should be our policy.”The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereOnly the best news in your

It would be economically very, very dangerous for Britain, and for the peace process in Ireland it would potentially be devastating.“You would have a hard border, very hard border.“A no-deal Brexit means a really hard border between north and south in Ireland, it’s contrary to the Good Friday Agreement and it will cause an enormous fissure within the United Kingdom.”An\u0026nbspexclusive survey for The Independent found 53 per cent of voters would support postponing Britain’s departure from the European Union, opening the door to a second referendum or further talks with Brussels.Mr Blair said: “I’ve never thought that you would get to another referendum going directly to it – you’ll get to it when people see what the true Brexit alternatives are. And the truth is there are two.“You can have a soft Brexit, which is really what Jeremy Corbyn is suggesting, or you can have the hard Brexit that Boris Johnson and Nigel Farage and other people want.”He said the type of Brexit must be decided before the UK leaves the EU, arguing that a lack of clarity would lead to a lack of “closure”.The ex-Labour leader said: “The argument just goes on, and by then you’ll have left, you’ll have paid your money up front, you’ll have given up your negotiating leverage.“And for the country to do that, as Theresa May wants to do – to leave without knowing what Brexit you get – this would be, in my view, an incredibly foolish thing for the country to do.

Republican lawmakers and pundits have mocked everything from Ms Ocasio-Cortez\u0027s appearance to her background.\u0026nbspThere are new examples all the time. Republicans Ed Rollins and Rush Limbaugh recently dismissed Ms Ocasio-Cortez as a “little girl” and “some young uppity.”The Washington Examiner\u0027s Eddie Scarry tweeted a photo of her in November and wrote that she doesn\u0027t “look like a girl who struggles.” The Daily Caller promoted what it described as a possible “nude selfie” of her last week before walking back its headline.In return, Ms\u0026nbspOcasio-Cortez has frequently clapped back at her critics online and in interviews. She did not, however, appear to respond to Mr Dunn\u0027s “bimbos” tweet.Mr Dunn has served on the city council in Richardson, a Dallas suburb, since 2011, according to his bio.State of the UnionOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I can be totally funded by oil and gas, by big pharma, and there’s no limit to that whatsoever.”The congresswoman, who represents New York’s 14th district, then noted how a corrupt legislator could even buy stocks in a\u0026nbspcompany, then write laws deregulating that industry, causing the share price to soar and pocket a huge profit.“You could do that,” confirmed one of the officials, adding that even the minor ethics regulations which did apply to members of Congress did not affect the president.“So I and every member of this body are being held to a higher ethical standard than the president of the United States,” Ms Ocasio-Cortez concluded.“It’s already super legal as we have seen for me to be a pretty bad guy. So it’s even easier for the president to be one.”Ms Ocasio-Cortez won her seat in congress by unseating long-time Democrat elder statesmen Joe Crowley, who outspent her in the primary campaign 18 to 1.Almost 75 per cent of her campaign funding came from small inidual donations, compared to just 1 per cent for Mr Crowley, who was mostly funded by larger businesses.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Officials voiced fears that the toll was set to riseMr Trump responded to Ms Klobuchar’s announcement by remarking on the local weather, apparently confusing it with the global climate.“Well, it happened again,” he wrote on Twitter. “Amy Klobuchar announced that she is running for President, talking proudly of fighting global warming while standing in a virtual blizzard of snow, ice and freezing temperatures. Bad timing. By the end of her speech she looked like a Snowman(woman)!”Ms Klobuchar became the first woman senator from Minnesota when she was first elected to the office in 2006, and had previously worked for eight years as the attorney for the state’s largest county, Hannepin County.While she focused on those issues that are likely to come up repeatedly during the Democratic primaries, Ms Klobuchar has taken a notably less progressive than other candidates in the burgeoning field of presidential candidates.She is publicly undecided on issues like Medicare-for-all for instance, which she has said sould “be considered” but has not supported outright. In general, the senator from Michigan is considered to be something of a pragmatist in a field that is likely to be defined in part by a tilt to the left\u0026nbspsince Mr Trump’s election.\u0026nbspBut\u0026nbspwhile Ms Klobuchar may not appeal to that portion of the Democratic electorate, she has argued she is capable of appealing to a geographically erse group of voters. That includes blue collar white voters in the midwest who shocked the nation in 2016 by voting for Mr Trump in several key states including Ms Klobuchar’s own state.Ms Klobuchar is one of the highest profile candidates to emerge from the American midwest to run for 2020, but may be joined by the likes of other candidates like Ohio Senator Sherrod Brown, who would likely appeal to a similar set of voters.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

We respectfully commemorate Abdurehim Heyit and all our kinsmen who lost their lives defending their Turkish and Muslim identity.”Heyit’s detention is indicative of China\u0027s determination to crack down on Uighur intellectuals and cultural figures in an effort, some say, to eradicate a separate Uighur language and identity.His death has not been independently confirmed and China had no immediate response to the minister\u0027s remarks.After months of denying their existence, Chinese authorities under increasing outside pressure acknowledged the system of camps, terming them vocational training centres.They have provided little or no information on how many are interned within them and how long they are being held.Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan had once accused China of genocide but has since established closer diplomatic and economic relations with Beijing.Additional reporting from agencies\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Everything would be settled. But we’re not going to get a deal.We’re going to get a withdrawal agreement and our future trading relationship will not be determined until after we’ve left the European Union.That is not what the British people were promised that is not what they voted for.

To proceed without informed consent would be a catastrophic mistake.” A further six Labour MPs came out in support of a second referendum for the first time in January, saying  it was the “the only logical option”the party could not secure a general election.Debbie Abrahams and Lilian Greenwood, both previously Labour frontbenchers, backed the campaign along with John Grogan, Graham Jones, Stephen Morgan and Matt Western.Labours policy is to keep all options on the tablethe party can’t seek a general election including a second vote.But Corbyns reluctance to commit to another referendum so close to Brexit day is costing him with some members.In the latest twist, the party has denied a suggestion by Shadow Brexit Secretary Matthew Pennycock that it would automatically back a referendumTheresa May rejected Jeremy Corbyns offer of support.Labour wants to prioritise pursuing its own version of Brexit – with a customs union, a close relationship to the single market, and stronger protections for workers’ rights and environmental standards.Corbyn said in a letter to the Prime Minister would back her Brexit planshe agreed to these conditions.The proposal has angered Remainer MPs who want him to press for a second referendum.According to polling, Labour members are signicantly more opposed to Brexit than Corbyn, with  per cent thinking their leader should support a second vote.A new poll shows the partys failure to back a second vote could be far more damaging than the Iraq war.Corbyn is the only Westminster party leader to have refused to meet the Prime Minister following the overwhelming rejection of her withdrawal plan, insisting she must first rule out a no-deal Brexit.He is not expected to make a judgement on whether to move towards backing a second referendum until after the Government’s “Plan B” Brexit strategy is voted on in Parliament.Labour backbencher David Lammy has warned that Jeremy Corbyn risks splitting the partyhe doesnt back a second EU referendum.Mr Lammy told Sky Newss Ridge On Sunday: There is a small group in our party who are so frustrated, who have so much grievance, the fear is they are going to go off and form another party.Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, said he was open to extending Article that meant Britain avoided leaving the EU without a deal.He has also ramped up pressure on Corbyn to back a second EU referendum by insisting the option remain on the table."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/NINTCHDBPICT000465396770.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"donald tusk brexit sun says opinion","story":"Yet with one jaw-droppingly crass ­diatribe about Brexit campaigners he has further poisoned the negotiating well and converted hordes of aghast Remainers to Leave’s cause.What possessed him  What did he hope to gain from such a tantrum Did he think Boris Johnson and others alone would feel chastened That .million Leave voters wouldn’t feel they too were being abused  It couldn’t be clearer what disdain Tusk and his arrogant acolytes also have for them.The Sun doesn’t believe in hell, or a “special place” roped off there awaiting leading Brexiteers.Butwe wanted to match Tusk’s juvenile rhetoric, we might speculate that Satan’s flames are more likely to consume an unaccountable elite whose ideology condemned millions across the continent to long-term unemployment.Who have such disregard for democracy that they have tried endlessly to bully its oldest champions into reversing our biggest ever ballot box mandate.Who are so desperate to hobble Britain that they seek to impose exit terms so vengeful and harsh they would tear our United Kingdom apart.It’s no surprise to see diehard Remainers like Anna Soubry spinning for Tusk.More moderate ones now see that these sneering, sniggering goons are exactly why we voted as we did on June , .WE have no sympathy for the reckless rich kids who broke into Stansted to ground a plane deporting failed asylum seekers.It is disgraceful not one will serve jail time, given the gravity of the offence and widespread chaos they caused.A little “unpaid work” is no deterrent.

Quick, the ambassador has had a seizure!Had Herr President Tusk, at this most delicate of moments, really told the likes of Boris Johnson and Nigel Farage to go to hell  Yes, pretty much.I know we are supposed to take ­mortal offence. I know we are meant to fan our faces and ask Nurse to bring us something to soothe our nerves after that nasty man uttered such a frightful insult.But I couldn’t help laughing at toothless Tusk’s tirade.At last, a European Union bigshot has blurted out his contempt for British voters.That’s surely preferable to all those smarmy smiles and fake phrases about “respect for each other’s values” and how we hope to work with “our European friends and partners”. Real friends don’t nick £billion off you.There are two things worth knowing about Donald Tusk. The first is that in his youth he was a bit of a brawler.The ­second is that five years ago he resigned as Polish prime minister to take up his current cushy number in ­Brussels.Born in , Tusk grew up in the city of Gdansk, when Poland was a grimy ­colony of the USSR. His family had ­German roots and his dad, a carpenter, died when Donald was . It can’t have made for an easy youth.Gdansk gave rise to the Solidarity trade union ­movement which protested against Iron Curtain suppression.Tusk has recalled that in his youth he was “a typical hooligan” who would ­saunter along the streets in a gang, ­“cruising for a bruising”.In some ways, who can blame him  They were edgy days and young men will do what young men have done since time immemorial: Defend themselvesunder attack. Communism wasa ­stinking and ruinous creed.Decent Poles bravely reasserted their national sovereignty after too many decades of being governed by ideological bureaucrats who couldn’t give a fig about the electorate.Er, remind you of anything, Mister ­Eurocrat That colourful background in the Gdansk of the s and s made it all the odder when, in , Tusk quit the premiership of his country to become an EU grand fromage.He had been Poland’s PM for seven years and the country had done well.Yet he chucked that in so that he could succeed shrivelling nonentity ­Herman Van Rompuy as president of the European Council.The job is less important than it sounds. Its occupant basically acts as a collector of opinions from EU heads of government and acts as their representative at ­international shindigs.That it was held by such a blinky-eyed vole as Van Rompuy was a measure of its signicance. Yet Tusk chucked in the prime ministership of his country for it!Brussels may offer wonderful pensions, top-trough brasseries and as many rides in the back of a BMW  Series as you could wish, but had Tusk gone mad The answer to that question is “not ­necessarily”. He saw that under EU rules, national governments are now increasingly junior to the federal superpower.The real power in Brussels lies not with Tusk, nor even with boozy European ­Commission president Jean-Claude ­Juncker, but with the backroom officials such as Martin Selmayr and Sabine ­Weyand. Both of them, you may notice, are ­German. This sht in powers has ­happened slowly over decades and ­electorates have taken a while to notice.But now the voters are copping on and are at last making their ­displeasure plain.The British Leave vote was the firstgreat expression of that anger.All of which helps to explain why ­unelected EU officials have been so ­spittingly angry with the British public for voting Leave. We have busted the dam.That is why Tusk snarled at us on Wednesday. He and his sort feel badly threatened by Brexit.They feel understandably insecure about the future of the federal EU project.The Tusks of this world regard the ­peoples of Europe as an inconvenience.They were appalled with David Cameron for letting the referendum happen and they are now appalled with our MPs for not stopping Brexit.Shortly before his “hell” remark on Wednesday, Tusk expressed his disbelief that Theresa May was insisting on ­pressing ahead with Brexit, and his ­disappointment that Remainers at ­Westminster had not succeeded in blocking our departure from the EU.At that point I must confess I shouted something rude at the television in my office. “It’s because we had a f***ing ­referendum and we voted to leave!” I cried.Shouting at a TV set: Uh-oh, I may have been driven as mad by Brexit as dotty Tory Europhile Anna Soubry. Tusk’s ­outburst was similar. Everyone’s losing it!The teenage Donald Tusk — the one who used to tour the streets of Gdansk with his gang — would, I think, have ­understood. I am not recommending ­violence but politically this is certainly a time we could all do with clenching our knuckles and looking out for our interests.Cruising for a bruising, a young lad in Gdansk might once have said.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

There’s so much he’s got to give! He’s completely positive!In footage from , the then anonymous backbench MP from the People’s Republic of Islington ­lambasts “the European empire” and mocks Brussels for wanting referendums re-run until they produce the “correct” result.Oh, Jeremy Corbyn!I bet all the middle-class kiddies who worshipped at your sandals-and-socks combo at Glastonbury never saw this coming.The footage of Corbyn dissing Brussels to an Irish audience is so incendiary it makes Liam Neeson look as though he chooses his words carefully.Comrade Corbyn really, really could not be clearer about his true feelings.“We are creating here one massive great Frankenstein which will damage all of us in the long run,” he says of the EU.“If you succeed in getting a No vote herethat will be such a boost to people like us, all over Europe, who do not want to live in a European empire of the st century.”You tell ’em, Boris! I mean, Jeremy!After being forced out of the Brexit closet, JC can no longer cynically have it both ways — playing a Remainer to the middle class and a Leaver to the working class. That hypocritical ploy to squeeze into  Downing Street will no longer fly.It is a dead ploy. That ploy is extinct. It is no more.On the great issue of our time, the old boy just got shoved right off the fence. And fell on his face.Donald Tusk, Brussels’ head bully boy, digressed from condemning .million Brits to hell for voting Leave to sneer that there is a “leadership void” in the Remain camp. He means YOU, Jeremy.Tusk has seen right through two-faced Corbyn, evenall the little Marxist morons who chant his name are only just waking up to the cruel truth. Corbyn deserves to be despised by both sides of the debate.He placed the prospect of power above his principles. And we still don’t really know how he voted in the Referendum — although we can make an educated guess.The irony is that Jeremy Corbyn could have been a true hero to the working-class men and women who have voted Labour for a letime and then voted in their millions to leave the EU.Corbyn could have spoken for those men and women and stood up for them when the sneering elite dismissed them as thick, racist bigots too stupid to have a valid opinion.It was Tony Benn, Corbyn’s great hero, and the most eloquent opponent of the European Union in our nation’s history, who famously said he felt like “a slave to Rome” when he went to Brussels.Tony Benn would have had the courage to advocate Brexit and ­Corbyn must know it.Jeremy will be a tiny footnote in our nation’s history but what a crying shame that, in our country’s time of need, the Labour Party could not produce a leader who would represent the millions of working-class men and women who have learned to despise the EU.Corbyn tried to play it smart — and still does — by endlessly parroting that “everything is on the table” and never truly engaging with the debate that has come close to tearing this country apart.And now he has been caught out because Corbyn, always more Mickey Mouse than Machiavelli, was never clever enough to play this duplicitous game.The EU is revealing its true nature — a bullying empire that has no interest in being a partner, friend or ally of the Britishwe eventually manage to leave.The EU wants to see us on our knees.The EU wants to see us suffer for refusing to be their obedient colony.The EU wants us to pay such a high price for leaving that the remaining countries will be too timid to dream of le beyond this democracy-despising empire.All we can do is oppose these arrogant, unelected bullies. All we can do is demand our independence — no matter the dark warnings, no matter the sneering, no matter the threat of punishment beatings.What a tragedy for Labour that their leader never had the guts to join this nation’s fight for independence.ELLE MACPHERSON has revealed her simple guide for looking drop dead gorgeous.Most of Elle’s tips are eminently doable for any of us – eat your evening meal early , get fresh air every day, have some calming tea before bedtime and,sleep doesn’t come, put your feet up for five minutes.Only one of The Body’s tips is more dficult to arrange – Elle suggests regular relaxation in a sauna or steam room – but most of her guidelines for healthy radiance are simple common sense.But she has missed the most important tip of all.Be born beautul.Don’t forget that one, Elle!THE Tories are very keen on “autonomous” vehicles – driverless cars with no steering wheels and “no human oversight” – and hope that they will be zipping about on our roads within two years.Automotive minister Richard Harrington says: “We need to ensure we take the public with us as we move towards having self-driving cars on our roads by .”But I remember when a Labour government swore to us that diesel cars were the bright, shining future.In , Chancellor Gordon Brown introduced tax changes to petrol-fuelled cars that led to a massive increase in idiots like me buying diesel cars.The thinking was that diesel would help the environment because diesel engines produce less carbon dioxide than petrol engines.Unfortunately, diesel also produces far more pollutants and poisons, resulting in around , deaths every year.Whoops.I now have an elderly diesel car sitting on the drive that everyone hates.My excuse is that Gordon Brown told me I was saving the planet.Nobody wants diesel today. That is why Japanese car- maker Nissan will not be building its X-Trail SUV in Sunderland. Brexit doesn’t come into it.These days driving a diesel is considered to be slightly less healthy than smoking crack. And the Tory “dash to driverless” is as muddle-headed as the Labour “dash to diesel” when Gordon Brown was in his pomp.Driverless cars – what could possibly go wrong WHEN Prince Charles met the Spice Girls in , the Prince of Wales clearly towered above the then Geri Halliwell.Reunited this week, they now appear to be the same height.Has the former Ginger Spice grown over the last  years Or is our future king shrinking  Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

In the afternoon we started to train, boys, in my new team.”Sala later sent another message saying: “If you do not have any more news from in an hour and a half, I don’t knowthey need to send someone to find me...I am getting scared!”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/NINTCHDBPICT000467952353.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"polar bears invade russia government state of emergency","story":"A state of emergency has been declared on Soviet nuclear testing archipelago Novaya Zemlya as the beasts enter the front doors of apartment blocks.Despite the siege, residents have been warned they face prosecution is they shoot the endangered species.People are “afraid to go outside” and “daily le is in turmoil”, said deputy head of local administration, Aleksandr Minayev.He said: “Parents are wary of letting children to go to schools and kindergartens.“There are cases of aggressive behaviour of wild animals, such as attacks on people and entering into residential and office buildings.”The invasion has left people “fearful” and is the worst case of wild animal invasions this island has ever seen.The focus is the town of Belushya Guba where  polar bears have been counted scavenging for food in local dumps, and wandering around the settlement.Many of the residents of this bleak outpost are Russian military personnel.Head of the local administration, Zigansha Musin, said: “I have been in Novaya Zemlya since , yet Ive never seen such a massive polar bear invasion.”He warned the animals are “literally chasing people and even entering the entrances of residential buildings”.Despite this, some go outside even when the bears are a few feet away.The beasts have lost their fear of people, and are no longer afraid of shots being fired into the air, sounding car horns, reported The Siberian Times.The species are endangered and instead a team of specialists has been dispatched to the outpost to give advice to residents on other measures to discourage the bears.Teachers have pleaded for security measures to protect pupils.The bears come and go but there are always at least “six or ten” prowling the apartment blocks, said Minayev.Resident Anastasia Bondarenko has moved out but she said the bears were no longer threatened by humans.She said: “There are no more enemies….they became insolent.

You’re an anarchic shambles, without any discipline.His hardline views, formed more than four decades ago, reportedly positions which are much more extreme than current Labour policy.Mr Corbyn believes any controls on immigration are intrinsically racist and supports fully open borders, according to the book.Mr Bower also claims the Labour chief has never abandoned his lelong opposition to Britains EU membership.Although he publicly backed Remain, the biography says Mr Corbyn found regular excuses not to campaign properly.He was seen laughing with his allies the morning after Leave won the vote - but denied that hed secretly voted for Brexit.The party leaders close allies John McDonnell and Seamus Milne both voted for Leave, according to Mr Bower.When Mr Corbyn took over the party in , allies expressed concern that he was too nice to force through the hard-left agenda.But he apparently told Ken Livingstone: John McDonnell will do all the scary stuff.The telly star has apparently teamed up with JK Rowlings agent to try and set up a new political movement.The efforts are being led by two former Blair aides who believe Mr Corbyn has made Labour unelectable.And superstar author Ms Rowling has been suggested as a possible leader of the new party.Ms Riley and Eastenders actress Tracy Ann Oberman were among the guests at an event to discuss the new movement last week, the Mail on Sunday reported.Jonathan Powell and Phil Collins, who both worked for Tony Blair in No, hosted the party at the office of Ms Rowlings agent Neil Blair.They said they want the new political grouping to be launched later this year.Guests cheered when one member of the crowd said Ms Rowling should take charge because of her high public profile.The book also accuses Mr Corbyn of inspiring attacks on Jewish MPs whove spoken out against the partys anti-Semitism scandal, and using bullyboy tactics to inspire support.The MPs political obsession is so intense that it repeatedly took priority over the wellbeing of his family, Mr Bower says,He reportedly called Mr Veness to talk about Northern Ireland policy - as his second we Claudia was giving birth.His friend blasted: Haven’t you got something more serious to worry about  You’re about to be a father!But there was one moment when his principles did take a backseat - when he was invited to dinner with Fidel Castro.Despite being a devoted vegetarian, he happily ate beef when it was offered to him by the Cuban dictator.Tory chairman Brandon Lewis told the Mail on Sunday: What Corbyn has done to his own party is shameful, what he would do to our country would be a tragedy.

Was there ever anything among men more holy “He reportedly restored le to the dead and spoke of things beyond the human reach. And, unlike Jesus, there is evidence to prove that Apollonius actually existed.”Jesus Christ was a first-century Jewish preacher and religious leader born in Jerusalem in BC.He is the central figure of Christianity and is believed to have been the son of God.Traditional views of Apollonius believe that he was no more than a philosopher, however many scholars claim he was a contemporary version of Jesus.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But it strikes a powerful chord with real people, particularly voters in the North.They resent claims they are racist thickos and believe all parties lied to them in  when they promised to deliver on the referendum, whatever the outcome.Like the BBC — and, indeed, the EU itself — Remainers are slow to realise time is running out. Brexit is to the EU what Netflix is to the BBC. The £billion licence fee — like the European “Grand Project” — is on its way out.Whatever last-minute deal Theresa May brings home, the scepticism which brought Brexit to le cannot simply be turned off.It is a disruptive force and is already beginning to sweep away the EU as we know it.Economist Bernard Connolly famously identied this as the logical consequence of EU skulduggery in his book The Rotten Heart Of Europe: The Dirty War For Europe’s Money.Connolly was in charge of setting up the euro, the slow-burning catastrophe which has wrecked economies and young lives across the EU.He was sacked for exposing the secretive abuse of power at the very top, exposing the unscrupulous methods deployed by an unaccountable regime to bludgeon critics into submission.The same tactics are used on rebellious nations like Britain today and Greece in , triggering the explosion of anger we are seeing among protesting citizens and a rise of authoritarianism against such dissent.EU states are at each other’s throats — Italy against France, Brussels against Hungary and Poland.The rise of military-style policing — French police firing hard rubber bullets at unarmed yellow-jacket protestors, the jailing of dissident politicians in Catalonia — is alarming.Romania, a former Soviet police state, is reverting to type and spying on its own citizens.Hungary locks up opponents and silences the media.The EU does nothing, fearing for its own survival.Europe-wide polls reveal increasing antagonism to Brussels, deeper even than here in the UK.He remains a cherished champion of free speech and razor-sharp inquisitorial combat.Mean-spirited as ever, the left-wingcould not resist suggesting he was past his sell-by date.Not by such a margin as this preachy, unpopular rag which is about to go out of print.Those politicians who believe we mustto the EU’s totalitarian embrace are grievously out of step.Yes, Brexit has been botched, both by Theresa May and by Brexiteers themselves. There may be trouble ahead.But those who voted in their millions in  to leave have not budged. If anything, their mood has hardened.In a second referendum, a straight choice between Leave and Remain would turn Brexit into a landslide.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The Tory leader is set to deny MPs a fresh “meaningful vote” until next month - edging closer to the March  withdrawal deadline.Appealing to Labour MPs through their leader, Mrs May told Jeremy Corbyn on workers’ rights: “In the interests of building support across the House, we are ... prepared to commit to asking Parliament whether it wishes to follow suit whenever the EU changes its standards in these areas.”The revelation came in a reply she sent the Labour chief after he wrote to the PM last week demanding a customs union as the price for supporting a deal. Treasury Chief Secretary Liz Truss refused to rule out quitting the CabinetMrs May bowed to demands for a customs union.   While she did not completely rule one out, the PM said the political declaration part of the withdrawal agreement “explicitly provides for the benefit of a customs union” while allowing the UK to strike deals with other countries. She added: “We intend to give Parliament a bigger say in the mandate for the next phase of the negotiations”. Mrs May faces a string of Valentine’s Day votes which could derail her Brexit timetable. She stands accused of trying to run down the clock before presenting a revamped package to MPs, possibly just days before the UK is due to leave the EU. Labour will try to force ministers to stage the final, “meaningful vote” by February . Communities Secretary James Brokenshire admitted MPs may not get a vote on a revised pact this month, but claimed there could be more votes on amendments to the proposed deal instead.   He told the BBC: “If the meaningful vote has not happened, so in other words things have not concluded, then Parliament would have that further opportunity by no later than February .” Shadow Brexit Secretary Sir Keir Starmer demanded a vote before February  to put a “hard stop” to Mrs May “running down the clock”. He fears the PM is “pretending to make progress” but secretly plans toto Parliament after a Brussels summit the week before Brexit and offer MPs a “binary choice” between her deal or no deal. “We can’t allow that to happen,” Sir Keir told the Sunday Times. “There needs to be a day when Parliament says, ‘That’s it, enough is enough’.”  Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay meets EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier in Strasbourg on Monday as the Government tries to thrash out plans to overhaul the backstop.

CBI boss Carolyn Fairbairn told Sky News: “I think we really are in the emergency zone of Brexit now.” Full text of Theresa Mays letter to Jeremy Corbyn Dear Jeremy Thank you for your letter of  February. It is good to see that we agree that the UK should leave the European Union with a deal and that the urgent task at hand is to find a deal that honours our commitments to the people of Northern Ireland, can command support in Parliament and can be negotiated with the EU - not to seek an election or second referendum. My visit to Northern Ireland this week underlined to me what is at stake. In that light, I am grateful to you for meeting me last week, for your letter setting out your position in more detail and for the offer of further discussions. Whilst the issues you raised in your letter are best dealt with in those discussions, I thought it would be helpful to briefly set out our position in writing. When we met, you outlined your concerns about the possible indefinite nature of the backstop, concerns which you repeated publicly afterwards. I hope you will therefore agree with me that seeking alternative arrangements to the current backstop is a necessary step to finding a deal that can command support in Parliament. One of the things I would like our teams to discuss is the exact nature of those alternative arrangements. However, this is not the only action the Government is taking to find a deal that commands support in Parliament. We intend to give Parliament a bigger say in the mandate for the next phase of the negotiations to address concerns that - because the Political Declaration cannot be legally binding and, in some areas, provides for a spectrum of outcomes - MPs cannot be sure precisely what future relationship it would lead to. We have also made commitments on workers rights and environmental protections and we are examining opportunities to provide further financial support to communities that feel left behind. Turning to the changes to the Political Declaration you would like to see: As I explained when we met, the Political Declaration explicitly provides for the benefits of a customs union - no tarfs, fees, charges or quantitative restrictions across all sectors and no checks on rules of origin . However, it also recognises the development of the UKs independent trade policy beyond our economic partnership with the EU . I am not clear why you believe it would be preferable to seek a say in future EU trade deals rather than the ability to strike our own deals  I can reassure you that securing frictionless trade in goods and agri-food products is one of our key negotiating objectives . The fundamental negotiating challenge here is the EUs position that completely frictionless trade is only possiblethe UK stays in the single market. This would mean accepting free movement, which Labours  General Election manesto made clear you do not support. The EU have said that the deal provides for the closest relationship possible outside the single market. The Political Declaration sets out clear arrangements for dispute resolution . I am not sure what exactly you mean when you say “shared institutions and obligations” but our teams can explore that. I have always been clear that Brexit should not be at the expense of workers rights or environmental protections. However, the Government does not support automatically following EU rules in these areas because, given their importance, we believe these decisions should be taken in our Parliament by our elected representatives. We have, however, made legally-binding commitments to no regression in these areaswe were to enter the backstop , intend to build on these commitments in the future relationshipand are prepared to consider legislating to give these commitments force in UK law. In the interests of building support across the House, we are also prepared to commit to asking Parliament whether it wishes to follow suit whenever the EU changes its standards in these areas. And of course we dont need to automatically follow EU standards in order to lead the way - as we have done in the past under both Conservative and Labour Governments. The Government supports participation in EU programmes in a number of areas as set out in paragraph  of the Political Declaration. We also want the closest possible relationship with EU agencies in the heavily regulated sectors, subject to us being outside the single market, and such co-operation is reflected as a shared aim in paragraph  of the Political Declaration. The Government shares your ambition in relation to security arrangements. We have secured agreement on the exchange of Passenger Name Record, DNA, fingerprint and vehicle registration dataand on arrangements akin to the European Arrest Warrant to surrender suspected and convicted persons efficiently and expeditiouslyas well as a commitment to consider the exchange of data on wanted or missing persons or objects and criminal records . The negotiating challenge here is the EUs position that, as a third country outside of the Schengen area and without free movement, there are restrictions on the UKs ability to participate in some EU tools and measures. The Government does not believe it would be in the interests of either the UK or the EU and its Member States to see a reduction in joint security capabilities. Labours support for this position going into the next phase will I hope send a powerful signal that the EU should reconsider its stance. I look forward to our teams meeting as soon as possible.

The following day, although Labour came second, the result far exceeded expectations. Having begun the campaign  points behind in the polls, Labour won an astonishing % of the vote. “Never have so many trees died in vain,” Mr Corbyn later quipped. “Next time make it  pages”. And so it seems clear that today’s decision by the Mail on Sunday to devote a whole  pages to Corbyn is about more than just promoting Tom Bower’s latest biography. On first reading, the excerpts from “Dangerous Hero: Corbyn’s Ruthless Plot For Power,” tell us that the Labour leader cares more about politics than his personal le, ain’t the biggest barrel of laughs, and likes cold baked beans.   On the Andrew Marr Show, the claims were described as “a complete hatchet job” and have been branded “nonsense” by sources close to the Labour leader. Tonight, after initially declining to digny it with a response, Labour issued a heavy attack on the coverage. A party spokesman called it a poorly researched and tawdry hatchet job, packed with obvious hoods and laughable claims - from events that never took place to invented conversations and elementary errors of fact. Claims included that Mr Corbyn ran up debts of pound, in the s after paying a community centres rent and salaries out of his own pocket, infuriating his second we who went on to leave him. His first we Jane Chapman claimed he didnt read a single book in their four years of marriage, accusing him of a lack of emotional awareness and a joyless approach to le.   According to the excerpts, he wouldlate from council meetings with friends in the s to sing IRA songs while they all got drunk on beer”. Former staffer Keith Veness - who quit in the early s in what is described as a falling-out - claimed he once stumbled in to see Diane Abbott naked on Mr Corbyn’s bed, many decades ago. And he accused the Labour leader of sounding delighted after the EU referendum result. Another key figure in the book was former ally Reg Race, who said Mr Corbyn was not fit to be Britains Prime Minister”. His feelings have been long known - Dr Race was a part of the Saving Labour group which tried and failed to oust Mr Corbyn in . But the claim that turned most heads on social media was about Mr Corbyn’s culinary taste. He would happily “open a can of beans, swallow them cold and declare himself satisfied”, the book declared.   The extent of the coverage also tells us something more: that the Tories are taking Corbyn more seriously as a threat than they have for some time. There’s a reason that there has been repeated rumours that the Tories are gearing up for a general election. Whenever one eventually does happen, they can’t afford not to be ready. At the last election, Labour won the highest percentage vote since Tony Blair’s second landslide of . Of the last  polls, only  have a Conservative lead out of margin of error according to academic Matthew Goodwin. Labour only need a two point swing to be the largest party. There is much that still stands in the way of a Corbyn-led Labour government - not least the ongoing conflict in the party over Brexit and Mr Corbyn’s poor personal ratings. But large swathes of the population - Brexiteers and Remainers alike - feel hacked off with the unpopular Tory government, and believe Labour could offer an alternative, brighter future.

Mitchell Balzan would binge on  cans of lager and a litre of vodka every day. And at the age of just , his alcoholism left him bedridden. He would steal from his family and friends and emotionally manipulate them in order to get his hands on more booze. Mitchell - who was just  when he started drinking and an alcoholic by  - said it started when he began to self medicate because of severe anxiety.He told the Liverpool Echo : I wouldnt be without alcohol, my last binge lasted  months , I wouldn’t stop, I couldn’t stop.As a result of his last binge, which lasted a year, he drank so much he started to turn yellow.   He said: I looked like Homer Simpson. I would describe myself as swollen and yellow, I really looked like a cartoon, it was surreal. When I looked at myself I thought, I’m not yellow but other people would tell me. By this point Mitchell was drinking a litre of vodka a day and says he was at the point where he cared more about alcohol than dying. He said: I’d drink  cans of lager in one day and graduated to a litre of vodka a day. My anxiety was keeping me awake but the alcohol was forcing me to sleep.   It’s not a normal existence. I’d wake up have a couple glasses , vomit, be retching, have to get more alcohol and then sleep again. It was waking up, drinking, feeling like I was about to die have another drink to calm down, put a programme on TV, go to bed, that was the cycle. He added: When drinking, I never worried about dying. I was drunk, I was resigned to being drunk, even though my girlfriend just had our first baby. Family and friends tried to help Mitchell get sober but he believed that drinking was keeping him alive and instead of accepting their help he would steal from and manipulate them to buy him more booze. Mitchell said: It came to the point my family, they didn’t know who I was, it was completely Jekyll and Hyde. It send shivers round my body.  I took my girlfriend Leannes purse numerous times, it got to the point she wouldn’t bring money to the house at all. I’d search and find notes saying ‘there’s no money, you need help,’ he said. During a particularly dark binge Mitchell stole his cousin’s laptop and cashed in all the money on booze. The -year-old said: He gave me the laptop to play a game on and I’d had no drink, so I took it to cash converters and got someone I know to go to do it with their ID because I didn’t want it traced back to me. Mitchell made multiple attempts to give up drinking but they all failed and he was hospitalised every time because of seizures. He said: People didn’t understand, my mum tried to help me, she had been an alcoholic but she’d been sober for  years, in my family there’s a phobia of hospitals. I came off it at home, tried to cut down the ale, but Id go into a seizure. I tried cold turkey and it wasn’t working. I thoughtI didn’t have it, it would kill me. I couldn’t think past the drink.  On Christmas Eve in  Mitchell was taken to hospital after his family doctor told him he was on the brink of dying. Despite the desperate circumstances, Mitchell still could not let go of his drink and was taking a bottle of vodka, disguised as Lucozade, into hospital with him. He had his last drink from that bottle on Christmas Eve and was rushed to ICU the next day and diagnosed with Hepatic Liver Disease. Mitchell credits his mum, Christine, who has now passed away, with helping him get le saving treatment. He said: I’m here now because she never gave up on me. I could have been on the streets, I was willing to do anything. As a mother she wanted to protect me but she knew she was killing me [by buying alcohol]. I was completely willing to do whatever, it had control of me. I have two children now and it breaks my heart thinking about what I’d be like in her position.  The shocking truth of how ill he was and the realisation he had a baby that was relying on him forced Mitchell to sober up. He said: Once I was in hospital my girlfriend brought me a picture of the baby before she would bring the baby in. I remember clearly, she said you’re sober now but look what you’ve got, you’ve got a daughter. It was the realisation someone was dependent on me, I’ve never had that before. Since then I’ve never drunk. Mitchell has now been sober for over two years and says he feels lucky to be alive. He added: My latest bloods came back and everything is within the normal range. I’m lucky, it’s a miracle, I wasn’t expecting it.  Since being sober Mitchell has focused on his family and now has two young daughters. He said: I got back some time I missed with Scarlett, now I dont take anything for granted. Mitchell wants other people to know the warning signs of addiction and encourage people to seek help early. He said: If you get a feeling of angst or you love that alcohol and you notice it, say. Ask for help immediately, go and speak to someone, a doctor or family. If you noticed a drink is what makes you feel ok, that’s not normal.

Aliny Mendes, , was stabbed to death as she collected her kids from school on Friday. Residents on the busy A-road in Ewell, Surrey, said she was carrying a child at the time of the shocking incident. A man in his s was arrested on suspicion of the Brazilian-born womans murder.

Thomas Markle showed the Mail on Sunday the letter, which Meghan wrote shortly after her wedding last year. In it she tells her father he has broken her heart into a million pieces and asks him to stop exploiting her relationship with Prince Harry. She claims despite not changing her number, her father has not attempted to call her or message her. The Duchess also slams Mr Markle for siding with her half-sister Samantha, who has attacked her in the press while she silently suffers at the hand of her vicious lies.  The letter reveals just how much their relationship has broken down. Thomas was once her biggest inspiration, her hardworking daddy  and someone who always believed she would succeed - even when she didnt. And for Thomas Markle, daughter Meghan was always his favourite child, who would always get whatever she asked for at Christmas, no matter how expensive.\u2028Family photos of the now Duchess of Sussex with her father, cuddling closely, playing and joking around, show just how close the two once were. \u2028But today the relationship between father and daughter couldn’t be more dferent - a toxic stew of outbursts, insults and public freeze-outs. \u2028It would be sad and destructive in any family but with Meghan it was inevitable that their increasingly bitter rt would be played out in front of billions around the world.   And wherever Meghan goes, the tensions with her father - as well as other family members - are never far from the surface.This week it emerged Meghan had written her father a letter after her wedding to Prince Harry to beg him to stop “victimising her”.Friends concerned that the “emotional trauma” of dealing with her dad could have a negative effect on her baby, told People magazine that Thomas responded with a long letter of his own, in which he asked his daughter for a photo shoot. So what went wrong to fracture a relationship that not so long ago was so close it was admired by all who knew them  Only four years ago Meghan described her father with love and affection as she spoke of the sacrices he made so she could chase her dream to be a performer.  Revealing their “special quote” as she paid tribute to him on Father’s Day, she said: “If I had all the water in the world, I’d give all the water to you…” And she has also described how the unconditional love of her father and his determination for her to fulfil her dreams made all the dference as she grew up in Los Angeles. Royal biographer Andrew Morton claims that Meghan was the favourite of his three children. He claims he would always make sure she got her preferred present at Christmas. And he described how half-sister Samantha “often told the story of the time before Christmas when Meghan was looking at a jewellery catalogue and picking out a ring, which Tom Senior promised as a gt. Browsing the pages of the pricey catalogue, Meghan teased her much older sister by saying that whatever her father bought [her half-sister Samantha], Meghan would receive the most expensive gt as she was the most favoured child. Meghan herslef once said: “It’s safe to say I have always been a daddy’s girl – he taught me how to fish, to appreciate Busby Berkeley films, write thank-you notes, and spend my weekends in Little Tokyo eating chicken teriyaki with vegetable tempura.”   She recalled how one Christmas he created a Barbie family for her when they were only sold in sets of white dolls or black dolls. Her new collection of dolls had “a black mom doll, a white dad doll, and a child in each colour. My dad had taken the sets apart and customised my family”. And when Meghan was confronted with a tick-box form to fill in at school about her ethnicity and found she did not fit into just one category, she revealed: “My dad said words that will stay with me forever: ‘Draw your own box.” Meghan also revealed how as she grew up he taught her the importance of kindness and along with her mother, Doria Ragland, they would buy turkeys for homeless shelters at Thanksgiving. They would deliver meals to patients in hospice care, donate spare change in their pocket to those asking for it, as well as offering a simple hug, smile or pat on the back to those who needed it. And she has described a doting father who was determined for her to lead a le of happiness and kindness where she could fulfil her aspirations.   Meghan has said previously: “He is the person who believed in this grand dream of mine well before I could even see it as a possibility.” And she once paid tribute to “the blood, sweat and tears this maninvested in my future so that I could grow up to have so much”. When aged  she told him she wanted to be a photographer, he dug out his tools and got to work transforming her bathroom into a darkroom where she could develop her snaps. He shaded the windows, as well as filling the cabinets with the chemicals she would need to produce the pictures. And he also took her to tap and ballet classes every Saturday morning despite him working + hours a week”.  He also regularly did the lighting for her high school musicals so that they felt as grand as a Broadway show. When he won ,on the lottery in , Thomas used part of it to pay for Meghans private school fees so she would have the best education. Her birth date was among the numbers that helped him win big when she was aged nine. Thomas, who now lives a quiet le in Mexico, worked a lightning director on shows such as hit sitcom Married…With Children and popular US drama General Hospital, for which he won two Emmys for his team’s work. It was while accompanying her father that a young Meghan got a taste of what le was like to be an actress.   She said in : “Every day after school for  years, I was on the set of Married…with Children, which is a really funny and perverse place for a little girl in a Catholic school unorm to grow up.” She described being surrounded by famous actors, multi-million dollar budgets, and crew lunches that always included filet mignon and enough sweets to make you think you were at Willy Wonka’s Chocolate Factory. As she went from audition to audition trying to make it as an actress, it was Thomas who put petrol in her car so she could get to them. He also coached her how to handle herself on set, right up to her big break as Rachel Zane on the TV show, Suits. She said: He taught me to write thank you notes, to always arrive early, to drink Arnold Palmers, to find my light when I’m on camera…and beyond. And that, right there, is the point: my dad taught me to find my light. And he taught me to always make my own box.  Thomas has also spoken of their close bond, recently revealing letters and cards he received from his daughter over the years. One letter read: “Daddy, Because you have always been so generous with me and taken the best care of me it brings me so much joy to be able to give you this Christmas. I love you to no end. Meg.” A Valentine’s Day she sent him read: “Daddy … I don’t express as often as I should how much you mean to me. :Everything you do for me has turned me into who I am and I am so grateful. All I want to do is make you proud … and I promise, no matter what, I’ll do it.  Thank you for everything daddy. I love you with all of my heart now and forever. Love Bean”. Bean was Meghan’s childhood nickname. Thomas told the Daily Mail: “I loved getting cards from Meghan. “She wrote me hundreds of little cards and notes through the years. Sometimes they were for special occasions, other times just little notes she would leave around the house. I’ve still got a Post-It Note on my fridge which says, ‘I love you Daddy’”. Their close and loving relationship makes its breakdown since her wedding to Prince Harry in May last year even the more tragic and incomprehensible.Up until just a few days before the Royal Wedding, Thomas was planning on attending. He was due to meet the Queen and other members of the royal family, including his future son-in-law Prince Harry for the first time, before the wedding on Saturday. But then it emerged he was paid money from a photographer to stage pictures of him trying on suits and researching the royals before the wedding. Meghan, still eager on having her father attend, was still reportedly prepared to forgive the scandal.  But then he suffered a heart attack and had to undergo surgery ahead of the wedding, and decided not to go. And things just kept going went downhill from there. On theFriday before the wedding Thomas appeared on Good Morning Britain to explain why he was not attending. Then, talking to TMZ he said he had watched his daughter’s wedding from his hospital bed. He said: “My baby girl is a duchess and I love her so much. When you watch your child getting married, every thought goes through your mind, every memory from the first day she was born, the first time I held her.”  In another Good Morning Britain interview he claimed he made Prince Harry promise never to hit his daughter as a condition of securing his blessing for their marriage But confirmed that he still hadn’t met his son-in-law.And in an interview with The Sun , he said he hadn’t spoken to Meghan since a brief phone call after the wedding.He claimed he was worried he might die soon without patching things up with her. He said: I had a heart attack, doesnt anybody care  I could actually die soon.  Does she want this to be the last thing weve said to each other  It is probably the longest time I have gone without speaking to her ever. I just want to clear the air and tell her how proud I am of her. Thomas later also criticised the Royal Family, saying his daughter looked terried in her new role. He claimed: I see it in her eyes, I see it in her face and I see it in her smile. Ive seen her smile for years. I know her smile. I dont like the one Im seeing now. This one isnt even a stage smile — this is a pained smile.  Meghan and Harry were reportedly blindsided by the interviews Thomas continued to give to media and his daughter allegedly begged him to stop talking to the press. But instead his comments turned increasingly nasty and he turned his attacks on Meghan herself. Speaking to the Daily Mail for nearly nine hours over three days in July he described his daughter as “cold” and even suggested “it would be easier for MeghanI died”. He said: What riles me is Meghans sense of superiority. Shed be nothing without me. I made her the Duchess she is today. Everything that Meghan is, I made her. “I was... making good money, and could afford to give her the best, with a good school, good education, good home.  “She became the woman that she is today thanks to everything I did for her. And did I get any recognition for it  Any thanks  She doesnt even speak to me now. How cold is that  I tell you, Ive just about reached my limit on Meghan and the royal family. I’m about to unload on them. They want me to be silent, they want me to just go away. But I wont be silenced. I refuse to stay quiet. In another interview with the Daily Mail, he claimed he hung up on Prince Harry after a heated phone all before the royal wedding. Thomas claimed the prince, who had warned him to stay away from the press, told him “ you had listened to me this would never have happened.” "},{"url":null,"title":"jet2 flight tenerife diverted manchester","story":"NewsJet flight to Tenere erted to Manchester due to no water for tea and coffeeDisgruntled passengers said the aircraft had to turn around and make an emergency landing due to the issueShareCommentsByKirsty McKenzieClaire Gilbody-Dickerson:,  FEB NewsPassengers were delayed because there was no water for teas and coffees \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email Holiday-makers travelling on a Jetflight to Tenere had their flight cut short because there was no water for teas or coffees on board.

Gullible Labour MPs wanting to buy Mrs May’s unicorns should think again before voting for the Prime Minister’s bad faith deal. Downing Street’s confected assurances on workers’, consumer and environmental rights won’t be worth the paper that they’re written on. Brexit Minister Chris Heaton-Harris inadvertently gave the game away during a gathering behind closed doors with  business, trade union and civic society leaders at the respected Institute for Public Policy Research. Brexit: Families already have pound, LESS to spend since  referendumIntended to be a no-notes frank discussion off the record, my snout heard Heaton-Harris cutting the ground from under the feet of opposition MPs toying with selling their votes to May for a few bob. Hardline Tory Brexit no-deal ideologues in fanatic Jacob Rees-Mogg’s European Research Group don’t object noisily to May’s proposed concessions to Labour, because once Britain is out of Europe, any commitments on jobs and other areas can be broken, explained Heaton-Harris. “The ERG are relaxed about it because it’s domestic, so they know they will be able to change it later – and evenit’s in the agreement, there won’t be any supervision or enforcement,” the Brexit Minister told the meeting. And he’s absolutely right.   Membership of the European Union prevents the Conservatives abolishing employment and social protections, such as guaranteed paid holidays hated by right-wing Tories plotting Brexit. The likes of Liam Fox, Jacob Rees-Mogg and UKIP partner-in-crime Nigel Farage dream of transforming our country into a rich man’s Treasure Island playground for the world’s elite. Slashing taxes on the wealthy, while simultaneously eroding the rights of the many and running down already-stretched public services, would be their plans for Brexit Britain. Shrewd Margaret Beckett, Labour’s wily former acting leader and Cabinet Minister, stated the obvious that May’s pledges are meaningless when she won’t be around for much longer. How valueless they are is underlined by Heaton-Harris candidly conceding that a large chunk, perhaps a majority, of Tory MPs don’t intend to keep them once we leave the EU. May’s letter to Corbyn mocking the Labour leader’s hostility to a potentially Brexit-saving second referendum is a PM laughing at her compromised opponent.

Dan Howie, from Derby, weighed more than  stone when he decided he need a change - and has since shed half his body weight. The -year-old had to buy two seats on planes because of his size, and couldnt fit through the turnstiles whenever he went to watch his beloved Derby County.Dan told Derbyshire Live he was struggling to cope both physically and mentally.He said: Eating the wrong stuff, no exercise, working behind a desk, it was a combination of things which caused the weight to creep up. I became lazy, started drinking heavily on nights out four times a week. I used to drink a bottle of rum before a night outbecause I felt I needed it to give me the confidence to go out being the size I was.   He continued: While I was out Id have  pints, plus shots and jaumlgers. Then Id get a takeaway after. It was a vicious circle, I’d go to work, then straight to the pub. It was a bit of depression as well, I used to order a takeawayin so I didn’t have to go out. I was heavier than a sumo wrestler, and not living a healthy lestyle in the slightest. But, Dan was inspired decided to change his habits of overrating and heavy drinking by the birth of his niece Olivia, now six, and nephew Riley, now five. He said: My niece and nephew being born, being a godfather to my best friend’s little girl. Those kind of things put it in perspective, and were wake-up calls for me to do something about it.   Danmoved to Blackpool and Preston for ten years of work in online recruitment. While living inthe North West in , he had keyhole surgeryto have a gastric sleeve fitted, which removed two thirds of his stomach. Despite losing four stone in the first year, it was when Dan ed to Derby and joined Fearon’s Gym and Boxing Academy a couple of years ago that he really felt the full benefit. Dan, who is thankful for the support of the gyms founder Clive Fearon, said: Training at the gym five days a week has helped me so much. Clive has done me the workout and meal plans, but he’s helping a lot with the mental side of things as well. It’s hard because I have to think of everything dferently now. I still sometimes think as that bigger person, thinking I can’t do things because of my size. I’m trying to get over stuff like that. I never went for a walk before, I got tired and out-of-breath after five minutes. But, I can now play sport with my nephew, and take the dog for a walk around Elvaston Castleon a Sunday. Average daily diet before weight loss Breakfast:No breakfast until at work, then just a sandwich from the supermarket around the corner A van would come around at .am - Dan would have a bacon or sausage cob, with a bag of crisps, chocolate and a fizzy drink Lunch:Went to the pub for a fried dinner like steak and chips with a pint Dinner:Takeaway or go to a Chinese restaurant twice a week Snacks:Constantly snacking on sweets or crisps Drinks:Drink half a bottle of rum before a night out then  pints, plus shots, four times a week Average daily diet now after weight loss Breakfast:Apple then four cups of coffee Lunch:Soup Dinner:Salmon with a boiled egg, and spinach or salad Drinks:Dan only drinks alcohol on special occasions now - three or four pints at Christmas and thats about it Le’s getting a lot better, easier, and I’m a lot happier with myself generally. Before embarking on his weight loss journey, Dan, wore XL clothes he bought online and from specialist shops. Now, Dan has slimmed down to st lbs, the weight he was when he was at school. Dan is delighted that his new  waist means he can now buy XL clothes from high-street shops. He said: I haven’t been this size since I was . I used to buy my clothes from Big and Tall or Jacamo, or a shop in Blackpool which imported stuff from America. It hit me just before Christmasthat I can now buy clothes off the peg for the first time in my adult le, which is a massive thing for me.  I don’t know why, but people think that all big blokes want to wear Hawaiian shirts, we don’t! I can shop at Next and MS now. It’s nice to be able to buy normal clothes. Some of the most embarrassing moments of Dans le came when he was forced to use the disabled entrance to get into Pride Park to watch Derby County. Dan, who works in Birmingham for online recruitment company CV library, said: I used to go and watch Derby County, but I couldn’t get through a turnstile without having to squeeze through sideways or getting stuck. They had to open the disabled access for me. It was too embarrassing and it put me off from going for a long time. But, last week I felt confident enough to repurchase my season ticket and get one for my nephew. After his confidence took a big step forward last week, Dan’s next target is to visit a theme park this summer.  Dan, who is ft , said: A few years ago, I went to Oktoberfest in Stuttgart where there were some rides, and I actually got turned away because of my size. Ive never been anywhere like that since. So my next big one is to go a theme park, because I’ve never been to one just in case I got turned away because of my size. Dan has another huge challenge ahead of him, when he takes to the ring for Fearon’s Gym charity boxing event on Friday, March . He said: When I started the boxing training, the weight dropped off hugely, and I’ve lost over five stone since September. That five stone has been the dference which means I can go and buy clothes off the rack in shops. There’s been sweat, blood and tears, but quitters never win and I’m determined to get over the line and hopefully win that belt.Those who would like to support Dans fundraising for Ashbourne Animal Welfarecan visit his JustGiving page here."},{"url":null,"title":"mcdonalds workers reveal secrets what","story":"NewsMcDonalds workers reveal secrets of what its like to work at fast food chainThe ex employees spoke about relationships between workers, the hygiene standards, and what they think the most stressful part of the job isShareCommentsByDanya BazaraaNews Reporter:,  FEB Updated:,  FEB Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video mcdonalds-works-dont-wear-gloves-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News ,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,swipeNavigation:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News ,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,swipeNavigation:true\"\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailTwo former McDonalds workers have revealed the secrets of what its really like to work at the fast food chain. The ex employees, who wish to remain anonymous, have spoken about their experiences of working in two separate Grimsby based stores between  and . Relationships between colleagues - dubbed McRelationships - are said to be common and they even get free meals depending on their shts, they told Grimsby Live. There are special cleaning procedures put in place to make sure conditions are as hygienic as possible, and hand washing is very regular. The former crew member and crew trainer also revealed the breakfast changeover is the most stressful part of the job, in their opinion.   Time to lean, time to clean The founder of McDonalds, Ray Croc, would say If you have time to lean, you have time to clean. This meant thata worker has time to lean against a counter, then they have time to clean something instead. Rays saying reportedly continues to be used as a motto in stores around the country. The crew member said: I remember being told time to lean, time to clean in my first week. Wed just finished a busy lunch time and it was around .pm, and instead of taking a breather I was told time to lean, time to clean. Theres always someone cleaning something in McDonalds - its probably one of the cleanest fast-food restaurants around. Although the saying makes me cringe, I think its a good idea because it keeps up high cleaning standards.   Breakfast change over The breakfast change over is the most stressful part of the job, the former crew member said. They said: The change over from breakfast to main menu was always a nightmare. Breakfast ends at .am, but youd always end up with someone coming in at .am wanting a McMuffin. By .am, all breakfast equipment has been chucked into the back sink to be washed and as harsh as it sounds, were not going to fish it all out the sink, wash it up, and put it all back together again just to serve one customer one McMuffin. McRelationships Many employees end up in relationships with other employees, the former workers claimed. The crew member said: So many employees end up in relationships with other employees. I never went out with another employee, but I can think of five or six examples from my store alone, and I know this was a thing across all the stores in Grimsby and Cleethorpes. The crew trainer said: Employee relationships are a thing, and they are very common. There was a lot of crew members getting together and even a lot of managers going out with each other.  Broken milkshake machines The former workers said theyd often get complaints about the milkshake machine not working. They said: Customers would always complain when our milkshake and ice cream machine was broken. Just to clear things up, the milkshake and ice cream machine is the same machine. Sometimes wed even be accused of lying about it being broken, but the truth is wed love to serve customers an ice cream rather than tell them it wasnt working. The reason why it always seems to be broken is because it has a very complicated cleaning process. The machine has to be cleaned every night, then a big weekly clean, and an even bigger monthly clean. They added: Sometimes the machines would have a cleaning error in the middle of the night, which would stop its cleaning process. It could happen at am when nobody is around to sort it out. The morning workers would then have to sort it out and continue it on its cleaning process. The machine does not allow you to cancel a clean - it has to finish it in full before it s to normal. So, instead of explaining this to each and every customer, we would just say its broken because its much easier and less time consuming.  Break time allowance Employees are allowed a free meal when working, but what youre allowed depends on what sht youre working, according to reports. The crew member said: Your break allowance is dependent on what sht you are on. If you are on an seven-plus hour sht then youre allowed any medium Extra Value Meal. If youre on a sht which is less than six hours then youre only allowed something small like a cheese burger and small fries. However this really depended on which sht manager was running the sht. If it was someone more laid back, then they may allow you a medium Extra Value Meal on a five hour sht. The crew member added: We were allowed any meal on breakfast shts, but when it came to main menu, we were not allowed the promotion meals. Wraps and Chicken Legends were always a weird one because we were sometimes allowed these but sometimes we were not allowed them. I think it depended on who was running the sht. Washing hands There is a reportedly a strict hand washing policy in McDonalds - with a loud alarm to remind people when its time for the next wash. The crew trainer said: If you worked on till or on dining area, then youd have to wash your hands on an hourly basis. If you worked in the kitchen or on fries, then youd have to wash your hands every half-an-hour. There is a really loud alarm which goes off every half-an-hour and every hour which beeps until manually turned off. This is the wash your hands alarm.

In an astonishing five-page letter lambasting Thomas Markles behaviour, the Duchess of Sussex accuses her -year-old dad of fabricating stories about her and Prince Harry.Meghan wrote that her dads conduct before and after the Windsor Castle wedding last year have broken my heart into a million pieces. The former Hollywood lighting director has given a series of critical interviews since the wedding and accused the royal couple of ghosting and shunning him.But Meghans letter to her dad, written last August but only revealed this weekend, reveals the Duchesss wrath at him.In it, she writes: We rallied around to support and protect you from day , and this you know. So to hear about the attacks youve made at Harry in press, who was nothing but patient, kind and understanding with you is perhaps the most painful of all.   Mr Markle denies ever attacking the Prince but admits telling him to man up for allegedly not replying to his father-in-laws messages or asking him in person for his daughters hand in marriage. The Duchess continues in her letter: For some reason you continue fabricating these stories, manufacturing this fictitious narrative, and entrenching yourself deeper into the web youve spun. The only thing that helps me sleep at night is the faith and knowing that a lie cant live forever.  The anguish between Meghan and her dad began to emerge publicly when he was exposed for staging paparazzi photos shortly before she and Harry tied the knot. Mr Markle later pulled out of the wedding entirely for health reasons, leaving Prince Charles to walk Meghan down the aisle instead. Since then the pair have not spoken and Mr Markle has slammed his daughter in media interviews. His other daughter, Samantha, has also laid into the Duchess in a series of interviews and widely reported Twitter tirades.Tension between Meghan and her dad boiled over this week when anonymous pals of the Duchess told a US magazine she had written the letter to ask him to stop victimising her in the media.In retaliation, Mr Markle released the letter to the Mail on Sunday , describing it as hateful."},{"url":null,"title":"michael mcintyres gags used see","story":"NewsMichael McIntyre’s jokes used by scientists to help ward off fluScientists are using Michael McIntyres jokes as part of a £, clinical trialShareCommentsByStephen White:,  FEB Updated:,  FEB NewsThe study will also seeMcIntyre’s jokes can cheer up pensioners before their jabs \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailCan a good laugh help ward off the flu  All joking apart scientists want to finds outtop comic Michael McIntyre’s gags can boost the effect of a flu jab.

A spokesman added: Society makes leaps forward when people are prepared to take action. Schools encourage students to develop a wider understanding of the world around them. A day of activity like this could be an important and valuable le experience.   But not everyone was as positive about the news, journalist and former director of free schools charity the New Schools Network said the walk-out was nothing more than truancy and blasted the NAHT for a shocking dereliction of duty. While former head teacher and Chairman of The Campaign for Real Education, Chris McGovern called the strategy dangerous, misguided and slightly delusional. Department for Education guidelines say termtime leave should only be allowed in exceptional circumstances and when it had been authorised by a head teacher, although when approached said the planned strike was a matter for inidual schools.

We are already facing devastating and irreversible impacts around the world. This is our final chance to fight for our futures, and our ages will not be what stop us.

The rugby-mad royal stood next to Rugby Football Union president Chris Kelly in the stands, and was spotted joining in as the crowd sang the National Anthem before the match. The appearance marked the first time Prince Harry has been seen in public since details of Meghans bombshell five-page letter to her dad Thomas Markle was made public.Excerpts from the letter, said to have been written shortly after the Royal Wedding last year, caused an international sensation today.  The letter was shown to the Mail on Sunday by Thomas Markle Snr , who released it after its existence was revealed last week by Peoplemagazine. He called the letter hateful. In the letter , the Duchess of Sussex accuses her father of breaking her heart “into a million pieces” by giving critical interviews to the press and attacking Prince Harry. She also accuses him of making up stories about her, of contacting the press rather than speaking to her despite her phone number remaining the same, and for siding with her half-sister Samantha whose vicious lies she said had caused her suffering.Despite the furore surrounding the letter, Prince Harry was in good spirits and received well wishes on his impending fatherhood. He also dished out his own advice on rugby to a group of six schoolboys involved in the CBRE All Schools programme. George Reynolds, , of Marsh Academy, said of the prince: We were just talking about sport, the Invictus Games and all of that. Id expected him to speak really posh, but hes just really normal.   The Dukes outing gave no hint at the turmoil revealed in his wes anguished letter to her father, who has not held back from unleashing scathing attacks on the expectant young couple in the first year of their marriage.“Daddy, it is with a heavy heart that I write this, not understanding why you have chosen to take this path, turning a blind eye to the pain you are causing, Meghan Markle wrote in one extract.She added: “Your actions have broken my heart into a million pieces - not simply because you have manufactured such unnecessary and unwarranted pain, but by making the choice to not tell the truth as you are puppeteered in this. Something I will never understand.” Markle Snr has repeatedly accused the Duchess of cutting contact with him in a series of interviews.  But the letter revealed just how early on the Duchess, now expecting her first child, had begged him to leave the couple alone. In it she tells him she loves him, but reveals his outbursts were causing her pain. She also called into question accounts that he had given to media about his no-show at the Royal Wedding, after which he had begun giving regular interviews criticising his daughter. You’ve told the press that you called me to say you weren’t coming to the wedding — that didn’t happen because you never called, she wrote.  You’ve said I never helped you ﬁnancially and youve never asked me for help which is also untrue you sent me an email last October that said: ‘If I’ve depended too much on you for ﬁnancial help then I’m sorry but pleaseyou could help me more not as a bargaining chip for my loyalty. She continued: I have only ever loved, protected, and defended you, offering whatever ﬁnancial support I could, worrying about your health... and always asking how I could help. So the week of the wedding to hear about you having a heart attack through a tabloid was horrying. I called and texted... I begged you to accept help — we sent someone to your home... and instead of speaking to me to accept this or any help, you stopped answering your phone and chose to only speak to tabloids.

While conditions have improved over the past few days following the deadly storm, the worst of winter is yet to come as the Met Offices long range forecast predicts snow could hit over the coming weeks. A yellow warning for ice is still in place for northern parts of Scotland overnight until am on Monday.But things are looking up for the rest of the week as meteorologists say the south and east of the UK can look forward to temperatures in the double digits, with highs of C in store for the south. The weather is set to get drier from Monday for most parts except for the far north, and areas can still expect to be pummelled with strong winds.Met Office forecaster Craig Snell told : As people wake up in the morning at the start of the working week, it should be dry for most for us. For the commuters going to work on trains- apart from the risk of ice for Northern Scotland - for most of us it should be OK once the sun comes up.There will be rain across the south clearing eastwards early in the afternoon to leave sunny spells and showers, perhaps thundery. Rain in the far north and also for Northern Ireland into northern England and Wales is expected later. It will be windy in the north and west. While conditions will settle for a while, more frost and snow are likely from February  until March , with temperatures set to plunge and snow possible in coming weeks. “Weve certainly not had the last cold spell of winter,” Met Office forecaster Simon Partridge told the Star. “We may see snow to low levels with nights below zero, although its too early to say how low temperatures will go. “March is the start of spring but computer model output shows no reason to change the emphasis for likely chilly weather as we head into March. “The greatest chance of snow may occur just before milder air ousts cold air across the UK.”The settled forecast comes after the system dubbed Storm Erik by Irish forecasters swept through the isles over the past week, bringing heavy dumps of snow that trapped drivers on the roads, caused rail delays, and yielded intense wind gusts that brought down trees.The storm proved deadly for at least two people on the roads, with a -year-old man killed on the A in Buckfastleigh, Devon on Friday morning, and a van driver killed after he collided with a fallen tree on the B between Pontyberem and Llannon in west Wales. A spokesman for Devon and Cornwall Police would not confirm whether the death on Saturday of kitesurfer amid strong winds in an incident on the Saunton Sands beach in north Devon was weather-related.  Tonight:The Met Office predicts rain with some snow destined for the hilltops, moving southeastwards as the chill moves across central and southern England and Wales, bringing strong winds. The Yellow warning remains in place for Scotland. Showers are predicted for the north with the risk of frost and ice overnight.Mr Snell said overall the weather is not looking that bad overnight in most parts of the UK, with northern parts of Scotland expected to bear the brunt of the frost.This week: Mr Snell said there is good news ahead for most of the UK beginning on Monday, with those of us living in the south and east likely to reap the best chance of a much-needed dose of Vitamin D as the tail of the storm peters out, moving across the eastern seaboard overnight. The Met Office says cloud and wind can still be expected in the northeast. But the forecaster predicted double-digit temperatures are on the way for the south of the UK from tomorrow. Mr Snell said the mercury should be peaking on Thursday for most parts, with highs of around -C possible for the southeast. While the predictions are for a mostly dry week, he warned the west and northernmost parts could expect some ice and rain risk throughout the week. But despite the warmer days in store, Mr Snell also reminded people to continue to wrap up warmly for the winter nights, as frosty temperatures are still taking their grip on the UK when the sun goes down: But thats to be expected at this time of year.

Nottinghamshire Live says Katarina had more than  sugar daddies in three years, though the says the strangest was the man in his s who asked her to frequently wipe his bum.“He was giving me a pound allowance each month and it was a long-term arrangement. He had a real kink for me wiping him after he used the toilet, but obviously the money was worth it,” she said.   Sugar daddies are defined as “rich older men who lavish gts on young women infor their company or sexual favours.” Findings from the recent Save the Student’s national student money survey suggest three percent of UK students finance their studies with adult work whilst one in  students uses their bodies to raise funds in an emergency. Katarina started ‘sugar dating’ after seeing a girl on YouTube talk about ‘Seeking Arrangement’, a popular dating website where sugar babies “enjoy a le of luxury by being pampered with fine dinners, exotic trips and allowances” infor their ‘services’. Dozens of British women have resorted to selling or auctioning their virginity on seekingarrangement. The website insists it is not a front for prostitution and discourages “sugar babies” from meeting men on a “pay-per-meet” basis. Yet a probe found as many as  women advertising they were virgins. Many were openly asking men to pay. One -year-old medical student joined last year, saying: “Auction for my virginity... Highest bid before midnight on New Year’s Eve wins.” A British -year-old wrote: “I’m offering a triangle with  virgins . Candidate who offers the biggest amount will get to be our first romance.” Another -year-old stated: “I need money as I am a student. I’m willing to do anything except sexual shyintercourse… If I was to do that it would come at a very high cost because I am a virgin.” Since launching in , the site boasts more than  million users – two million “sugar daddies” and eight million “sugar babies”, in  countries. Sugar daddies, who pay a monthly fee, reveal details like their net worth. Sugar babies, who are mostly women and can advertise for free, state their “lestyle expectation” of how much they would like to receive. Millionaire founder Brandon Wade, who did not kiss a girl until he was , has said: “The idea came when I was a teenager in Singapore, I was very shy.” SeekingArrangement insists it encourages “real relationships”. Wade claimed his team “kick off dozens of escorts and prostitutes every day”. The site says the rise of university tuition fees has fuelled the , UK students signing up by .  She added: It would be really naive to say you can find a sugar daddy that will give you money in exchange for a friendship or just company – that’s a misconception. You know you have to be ready to be intimate with these men, whether he’s in his early s or  plus. “It was always dficult to make ends meet and it was an everyday struggle on top of uni work, family problems – all these things I have to think about. Money was a factor that was triggering my mental health and making it worse. “Straight away it hit me, it was very real, men started messaging me talking about the details of arrangements and it seemed like there was so much to learn.”  A Mind charity report highlights mental health issues suggesting money can be a major factor in it. Findings suggested the link was clear and that “being in debt can negatively affect a person’s mental health”. This is something Katarina feels has affected her. “This one time, a guy asked meI could meet with him in his car to show him my genitals for pound. It’s ridiculous. “I know that some people would never consider this whatsoever and have their standards, but with my position and my struggles at the moment – I wouldn’t think twice, Katarina added. A spokesperson fromNottingham Tent University stated the support they offer to students, however, did not comment on the issue itself. “We are not aware of this matter and do not comment on inidual student behaviour. We offer comprehensive support services for all students, including those facing financial dficulties and mental health issues. “If any of our students is in need of support we would encourage them to come forward and contact us.” "},{"url":null,"title":"voice mirror saving tv licences","story":"NewsopinionVoice of the Mirror: saving TV licences for over-s is a battle we must winIt would be a grave mistakethe BBC does Theresa May’s dirty workShareCommentsByVoice of the Mirror:,  FEB NewsopinionIt would be completely unacceptable to isolate the elderly \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailSaving free TV licences for the over-s is a popular crusade.

Unsurprisingly the real estate listing has gone viral due to the contents of the basement - and even Fty Shades author E. L. James has tweeted about the place.This has been a big shock to the neighbours living on the street, who were previously unaware of the goings on inside the property. One male neighbour was especially angry about the listing and complained to Leonard, telling her to take it down.According to Slate he said: Were very upset about this whole thing. We do not want something like this in our neighbourhood. Take that off the internet. Thats digusting.

The unnamed man in his late s, claims he nipped to the bathroom right after having sex with his girlfriend and it was at this moment that things started to take an unusual turn.

He then admitted that he had tried to take the condom away from her, but she began shrieking so he had to back off. People on the site were appalled by the womans actions and warned him to stay away from her in future. One commented: Cut her out of your le immediately. Do not contact her in anyway. If she claims to be pregnant demand a paternity test. Another wrote: Its not against the law, you had consensual sex with her. A third replied: Apart from all the other good advice about getting her out of your le, call Planned Parenthood and ask them about the likelihood of her getting pregnant via this method.

Zakaria Al-Jaber was allegedly approached with his mum while they visited a shrine to the Prophet Muhammad in Medina, Saudi Arabia , and askedthey were Shia Muslims. After the mum said yes, a taxi pulled up beside them and her son was snatched, reports say. He was then beheaded with a piece of glass for being the wrong branch of Islam , it is claimed. The mum collapsed out of trauma, its reported.  A poignant photo of Zakaria has now emerged as campaigners react in fury to the news. The campaign #JusticeforZakaria is growing on social media. Smallest coffins are the heaviest, wrote one Twitter user. Another called the killing barbaric. The hashtag has already been shared widely online. Others took to social media with heartrending tributes tonight.   Speaking of the gruesome moment of the attack, a source said: The taxi driver then broke a glass bottle to obtain a shard of glass, which he then used to cut the throat of the child and stab him”. Shia Rights Watch, a Washington DC-based campaign group, said: There was no intervention from anyone and no response from authority thus far. The Saudi Shia community came together in mourning and to show solidarity with the parents. The community also reported this incident is a result of ongoing violations and lack of protection by the Saudi authority toward its Shia population.  Saudi Shia have been under military crackdown by their government and many Shia are in prisons and on death toll. But Saudi Arabias predominant branch of Islam is Sunni, accounting for around three quarters of the population. Human rights groups say practitioners of other forms of the faith - including Shia - are persecuted.

President Julius Maada Bio blasted the sexual violence epidemic blighting the African country, where the crime rate nearly doubled since last year, according to police statistics. The girl, whose identity has been kept secret for her own safety, was left paralysed waist down after being raped by a -year-old male relative a year ago. She may never walk again, and I want vengeance for what has happened, her grandmother told Reuters, sitting next to the girl in her wheelchair in a Freetown medical clinic.  The man who did this ruined her le and deserves to spend his le in prison. The assault was one of many that have gone unpunished in Sierra Leone, where until now sexually-motivated crimes carried a maximum penalty of  years in prison and few cases were successfully prosecuted. Following months of campaigning by activists, the president declared a national emergency and said those convicted of sexual offences against minors would face le in prison. Some of our families practise a culture of silence and indference towards sexual violence, leaving victims even more traumatised, Bio told a crowd at the State House. We as a nation must stand up and address this scourge. According to police statistics, sexual and gender-based violence reports nearly doubled last year to over ,, a third of which involved a minor. Activists, including First Lady Fatima Bio, say the actual figures are much higher as most cases are never reported.  Gender-based violence is a traditionally seen as a taboo topic in Sierra Leone. Only  years ago parliament passed its first gender equality laws in  years of independence, following lobbying efforts by womens rights groups. Implementation of these policies has been slow and law enforcement agencies have been hampered by inadequate resources, promoting a culture of impunity. In December, the first lady led a demonstration in the capital to raise awareness of the issue, and has since launched her Hands Off Our Girls campaign to increase awareness of violence against girls across West Africa. The presidents declaration of a national emergency is seen as a step in the right direction, but activists such as Fatmata Sorie say progress must continue. We still need to think about how services for survivors are not accessible, especially for the poor, said Sorie, who is president of Legal Access through Women Yearning for Equality, Rights and Social Justice- an all-female group of barristers who provide pro bono legal services to vulnerable, women and girls. Weve made a big step today, but this is a very complex ,issue that will require complex and continuing solutions, she said.

whole of Tayside and Fe.“We are already supplying sanitary products to  local organisations with almost , women and girls benefitting each month.“This number is increasing constantly as we continue to partner many new organisations.“We are reaching a wide iety including foodbanks, job clubs, family support services, youth groups and homeless services.“We are also soon to begin delivering training and educations workshops throughout the region regarding period poverty.”Amanda said that as well as providing practical support, the group also aims to raise awareness of the issues.She said: “It’s about giving women their dignity.“We want to break down taboos and reduce stigma associated with period poverty and work with women and learn from their experiences of period poverty.“Women shouldn’t have to make a choice between feeding their family and buying themselves sanitary protection.“They shouldn’t have to stay at home during their period because they are frightened to go out because of

additional stalls.“The additional market stalls are subject to theapproval.“The market operator will act as the first point of contact for traders and shall ensure adequate supervision of all

Kicking could do with improving, however.James HorsfieldAnother loanee, -year-old Horsfield is eager for game time after not featuring much for Scunthorpe this season.The former Man City kid, who has trained under Pep Guardiola, Manuel Pellegrini and Patrick Vieira, has shown a steady start at right-back both with the ball and defensively.Ryan McGowanThe Australian international has slotted in no problem at all and immediately strengthened the Dundee backline.Two strong performances already at centre-back, once he gets more settled there’s more to come.Andrew DaviesThe former Ross County skipper hasn’t had much luck in his time at Dens, breaking his foot in his first bounce game after signing.Injuries have been a feature of his career but all reports of his time in the Highlands and down south suggest, when he’s fit, he’s a strong leader at the back.Andreas HadeniusNot much was known about the big Swede before he signed for the Dark Blues just over a fortnight ago.We still don’t know too much but he’s shown in his two starts so far that he’s a ball-winner in the middle of the park who keeps possession ticking over.Ethan RobsonParent club Sunderland rate this kid highly and Jim McIntyre admitted he was surprised to be able to get the midfielder in on loan.His debut at Hamilton on Saturday largely passed him by before picking up a groin issue that kept him out of the - draw at Kilmarnock.Once up to speed, the hope is Robson can begin to realise the potential plenty down south recognise.John O’SullivanAnother loanee largely unknown up here, O’Sullivan made a fleeting debut at New Douglas Park last weekend.Andy DalesThe winger has made an impressive start to le up here. His direct, pacy running has caused defences plenty of problems but his final ball looks certain to frustrate Dees.Exciting player, though, and an asset to the team.Scott WrightThe talented forward hasn’t been able to push his way into Derek McInnes’ first team at Aberdeen yet and has joined Dundee to prove himself at this level.He’s fast becoming a favourite at Dens after a super goal at Hamilton and an impressive first-half showing against Kilmarnock.Craig CurranA frontman Jim McIntyre knows very well from his time at Ross County, Curran has shown he’ll work tirelessly and keep defenders honest. A tidy knock-down for the opening goal against Killie, too. More of that and the Dark Blues will be happy.Andrew NelsonWe were told the young striker was raw but full of talent and he’s shown that already.

Increasingly, we want to support people to stop them from getting to that position.”Candidates will be put through a multi-week training course which doubles as an assessment, with an interview at the end of the process to determine their fitness for the work.If accepted, staff will go through a six-week supervised period before becoming fully fledged volunteers.To get involved with the Samaritans, visit www.volunteer.samaritans.org and follow the links to become a listening volunteer."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 01","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsThe conditions being endured by refugees on a remote Greek island might seem of little importance to folk living in Argyll, but Pam Gregory spends time helping make their lives easier.More volunteers are desperately needed to assist as conditions worsen during the winter and Samos Volunteers would love to hear from anyone with the inclination to help.Pam#s dedication and the support of the Craignish community deserve great credit.

However, a good friend of the museum has stepped forward with the offer and agreed to allow Dunadd Community Enterprise time to explore the possibility of buying the building and make a final decision that any community use has the full support of its members and is sustainable.Since the Church of Scotland moved to its new premises in Kilmartin, it has been its intention to sell Kilmartin Church and the Glebe, as well as the churches in Ford, Kilmichael Glassary and Kilmichael of Inverlussa. Kilmartin Museum has been in discussions with the Church of Scotland about buying the Glebe to use for their education programmes, and to develop overflow parking in a small area to accommodate the extra visitors expected when the redeveloped museum opens in .At the recent AGM, members of Dunadd Community Enterprise supported the committee to go ahead with seeking funding to commission a full feasibility study that would explore sustainable community use of the building. Funds would be required to buy, renovate and convert the church.There have been lots of ideas and discussion, but careful business planning is required to ensure whatever the church is used for would attract grant funding and crucially, would be sustainable in the long term. This will take some time and funding needs to be sought for a feasibility study in the first instance, so Dunadd Community Enterprise could not currently buy the church.Kilmartin Museum already has funding in place to purchase the Glebe Field, and they need to go ahead with this to keep to their redevelopment project timescales. However, the benefactor has said it will be possible to maintain public access to the historic stones housed in the church and that the museum can also use the building while the building work required during the redevelopment project is taking place.Dr Sharon Webb, museum director said: ‘It would have been a real shamethe church and the historic stones had become inaccessible, and this decision by the church head office could have presented real dficulties to both the museum and community enterprise, so it’s great that a temporary solution has been found. It’s wonderful that there are such generous and philanthropic people who want to make a dference to both the museum and the local community.’David Bracken, chairman of the Dunadd Community Enterprise, added: ‘This gives us the time we need to explore all the possibilities and make sure thatwe do go ahead and raise funds to buy the church, it’s the right thing for the community now, and for future generations.’Negotiations between the Church of Scotland head office and the anonymous buyer are ongoing."},{"url":null,"title":"tarbert blow after festivals funding bid rejected","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowTarbert is undeniably the festival capital of Argyll, but organisers say two summer events in the fishing village will be #diminished# after council cash was refused.Tarbert Enterprise Company submitted bids to Argyll and Bute Council#s Strategic Events and Festivals Grant Scheme for three events # Tarbert Scottish Series , Tarbert Music Festivaland Tarbert Seafood Festival .The bids for the music and seafood festivals were rejected in their entirety, while the Scottish series yachting event was granted £,.John Hardie, chairman of Tarbert Enterprise Company, said the two high-profile summer festivals would be #diminished# after failing to receive council support.#It#s pretty devastating when you think you#ve put a good bid together,# said Mr Hardie.He questioned why three large events # Cowal Highland Gathering, Tiree Music Festival and Oban Live # should receive around  per cent of the total funding allocation of £,.Mr Hardie asked: #Are these events being generously funded at the expense of others #He added: #A contribution would have been acceptable.

First performed in , Within This Dust has gone on to be staged all over the UK and internationally, including at the   memorial and museum.Especially inspired by Richard Drew#s unforgettable photograph, The Falling Man, Within This Dust details the experience of witness, Lisa Hood, and victim, Vince Virr, of the   attacks.The witness finds herself surrounded in dust, made of crumpled paper, and begins a grieving process of hunting through the papers, finding meaning in the words, as someone tries to tidy around her. The second act features the victim joining the witness, creating a connection that will inevitably be broken, when finally, in the third act, the victim is alone, caught between a choice of the smoke and fire within the collapsing building or the  metre drop to freedom.It was a very poignant performance, tenderly expressing the horror of the incident, perhaps now weakened due to overindulgence. When the lights came up everyone stayed where they were, perhaps a little too stunned to move. Chatter was in whispers, for respect to people who could not hear them.As the narrator of the show captured and pieced together from coverage of the attacks said, the dust has not settled, and never will. The losses of the people in the planes and buildings is still felt, and the wider western world is still wary, still learning, still recovering.Within This Dust manages to depict the horror of that day beautully, and more importantly, delicately. No easy task for a grieving world.PIC:Craignish Village Hall was full. _aWithinThisDustLisa Hood amongst the #dust#. _aWithinThisDustDancer, Lisa Hood. _aWithinThisDustLisa Hood collecting dust. _aWithinThisDustLisa Hood and Vince Virr. _aWithinThisDustDancer, Vince Virr. _aWithinThisDustVince Virr facing the smoke, or the window. _aWithinThisDust"},{"url":null,"title":"mid argyll rugby fans form scotlands honour guard","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThree Mid Argyll-based girls were among those given the honour of forming the honour guard at Friday February #s Scotland v Italy women#s rugby game.Amber Russell, Drew Buckley and Anya Gritten travelled to Scotstoun stadium on Friday night with their Oban U teammates to form the honour guard for the Scotland women#s team as they took on Italy in the first game of this year’s six nations tournament.The girls formed a tunnel of Saltire flags for the teams to run through as they took to the field.

This area of Argyll is the most fragile in the region. The people of Argyll, businesses and visitors deserve no less.Forget the squandering of £m on unreliable, mitigation measures trying to justy a flawed decision made many years ago to use the Old Military Road as a ersion which has failed on many occasions and now has a landslip between the two roads. Forget the expensive excavation of pits by the A rather use the cuttings into the hillside to form a two lane road protected with a flow over canopy with closed outer edges at the four problems gullies. If the contractors on the present scheme can work without any road closures then the flow over canopy option would not lead to closures as many officials and some politicians claim.This is a red herring postponing #a proper solution#. When this is option is completed it will save on the expense of manning the ersion route involving - personnel and - vehicles, replacing expensive nettings, delays whilst the farmer clears his animals and collect his fees. A scandalous waste of public money. Solve The Rest Landslides and stop wasting on mitigating measures.Like Brendan O#Hara I#m neither an engineer or geologist but both of us are blessed with plain common sense. If the Faroese can build a tunnel at £.m per kilometre surely a simple open sided m canopy would cost considerably less. In  at Dawlish .km of double tracked railway and .km of sturdy seawall was built at a cost of £m in eight weeks.

Transport Minister Michael Matheson, Transport Scotland and our Government must abandon their obsession with mitigation measures and fund a permanent solution.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13926204.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_18355078.jpg","title":"ayr united 2 inverness 3","story":"NewsAyr United  Inverness : John Roberston hails Somerset Park among best grounds in worldThe Inverness gaffer was full of praise for the old fashioned surroundings as his side clung on in the face of a stirring fightback.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN NewsNathan Austin puts Caley - up \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailJohn Robertson hailed Somerset Park as one of the best grounds in the WORLD after Caley held off a storming Ayr fightback.

Its brilliant...one of the best grounds in the world to come and play your football. In the past we might have lost a game like this so Im delighted.  Ayr knew a win here would take them top of the Championship and started well with Robbie Crawford missing a good chance in the first minute. But they soon hit the self destruct button as their defence went AWOL to allow Nathan Austin in for a double before Liam Polworth rammed home a third. The game looked over with barely  minutes on the clock and shellshocked Ayr took time to regroup. Coventry-bound Michael Rose rocked the post with a header before Michael Moffat drew a fingertip save from Cammy Mackay. McCall turned to the bench at half time and introduced top gun Shankland who immediately turned the tide. He set up Declan McDaid to haul Ayr back into the contest with a close range finish eight minutes after the restart. And a resurgent Ayr thought they had a penalty when Carl Tremarco appeared to handle in the box but ref Nick Walsh waved away loud protests. United continued to pour forward as the clock ticked down and Shankland set up a grandstand finish when slamming home a  yard free kick with five minutes left.  But their comeback proved too little too late as Inverness clung on. Ayr boss McCall said: Im just gutted. Weve conceded three goals and at least two of them were gted with just crazy defending. And were the team with the best defensive record in the league. I think a draw would’ve been fair but it’s just one of those nights.

It will also advise on any further, long-term solution to the issues at the beach.The groyne at the northern end of the beach will provide protection over part of the northern section of the seawall, with the potential to develop a higher beach in front of the wall.Finally, armour stones will be put in place along Lamer Street to protect the seawall.Discussions on how to revitalise the East Beach, which was once a popular tourist attraction, have been ongoing for more than five years.Pippa Swan, chairwoman of the townrsquos community council, has been heavily involved in the talks to find a solution.She was hopeful the latest measure would help and told community councillors: ldquoThe rock breakwater, the design has been worked on for more than two years.ldquoIt is now the preferred design solution and is the subject of a planning application.ldquoThere has been a lot of chatter about the East Beach and I wanted you all to be aware of what is going on and to be able to speak with some authority.Stones weighing anywhere between three and six tonnes will be used as part of the project, with work expected to take place throughout the summer and into the autumn.Mrs Swan was expecting heavy machinery to be on the site and said: ldquoIt will require big machines, at least -tonne trucks, moving these rocks around.ldquoThe East Beach will be the site of quite a lot of activity over the summer and we are bound to get some negative comments.

The doorsquocot is a clue that once a residence of some signicance stood here. It was called Dolphingstone Castle. Nothing now visibly remains of the castle, but around  years ago ruins were still to be seen.It was at one time an elegant mansion, but before that, on the same site, an older castle once stood ndash now all gone, and the structures of modernity are hemming in what is left of this ancient site. A wave of new housing laps at its walls to the west, the A traffic roars past on its south, and roads surround it on other quarters.One wondersthis small slice of East Lothian history will survive the developers. I hope it does. It is a small, historic fingerprint and gives a mysterious glimpse into our countyrsquos past, in an area now being carpeted with thousands of new houses.Earlier maps suggest that Dolphingstone Castle was surrounded by woodland. So perhaps the planting of a small wood or orchard within the old walls could create an island of both nature and history amidst the tide of urbanising development in this area.Up above on the ridge of Falside Hill to the south, the restored Farsquoside Castle looks down on the developments below . It sits like an eagle perched on a high ridge, observing the land below.How dferent the landscape it surveys would have been in  when, according to an old story, a small force of hand-picked warriors descended from the castle under the cover of darkness.It was just past midnight when they left, guided by a slither of moon. It was a raiding party, bent on revenge and heading for Preston Tower in what is now Prestonpans.Tradition tells us a feud had existed between the houses of Farsquoside and Preston for some years. The cause of the feud was the breaking down of walls between the two estates and the animals of each side grazing on the land of the other. Regular, and sometimes violent, clashes had taken place.But then Hamilton of Prestonrsquos livestock had been poisoned, or so it seemed. They had drunk from a burn which flowed from Farsquoside and it was assumed the water had been deliberately poisoned. Hamilton of Preston Tower, making no investigation, sent his men on a raid of violent retribution.Farsquoside Castle was attacked and blood was shed. This was the act which the select band of warriors who had set forth from Farsquoside were to avenge.In darkness, they filed down from the ridge on a path now known as Whinney Loan. This took them down to where the new houses are now being built on the southern edge of Wallyford.From here, great care was needed lest they be seen or heard. Dolphingstone Castle lay ahead and although their grievance was not with the occupants of Dolphingstone, early discovery could ruin the element of surprise.So the raiders veered north of Dolphingstone, by way of Prestoungrange, and at dawn, with the smell of the salt pans in their noses, they set about their vengeful work.Screams and running bairns alerted the occupants of Preston Tower. Armed men were ready, for this raid was expected, although not from this direction.The walls of Preston Tower held the attackers at bay but the people of the village suffered the worst of the slaughter. What senseless violence: neighbours separated only by the brae of a hill had been whipped up into a hateful frenzy against each other. Gradually the raiders melted away, back up the hill, with blooded swords.But hate builds on hate and the reckoning was not slow in coming. The very next day, Hamilton of Preston led a force westwards. It arrived by the walls of Dolphingstone Castle and then rounded past them to head up the hill towards Farsquoside, crossing where now the A speeds by.No attempt at surprise was required, this was to be an open fight. The Lord of Farsquoside had arranged his men along the top of the ridge, looking down on the approaching force of Hamiltonrsquos men. The order to charge was given and the men of Farsquoside poured down the slope.The leaders of both sides were in the thick of the fighting. It was the Lord of Farsquoside who fell, pulled from his horse and hacked to death by Hamiltonrsquos men.Seeing the death of their leader, the men of Farsquoside fled back to the castle. But the Lady of Farsquoside, in shock and rage at the death of her husband, rallied the men. She led them out of the castle in a furious charge as the sun began to set, forcing Hamiltonrsquos men to flee back to Preston.The battle, or skirmish as some would call it, was over, and the feud had reached its bloody climax. Soon after it was discovered an infectious disease had stricken the cattle, not poisoned water. Cattle on both sides had been equally affected. No one was to blame.How easy it had been to make enemies out of neighbours based on  assumptions. We are told Hamilton attempted to make amends. But the dead could not rise and the Lady of Farsquoside was said to be devastated at the loss of her husband. We can be sure others of lesser status suffered no less.This feud was over little remains to record it except tradition passed down, captured and retold by th-century writers such as P MrsquoNeill and Robert Seton, from whose works this account is garnished.Preston Tower still stands in Prestonpans, in a ruined but still defiant state. Farsquoside, much restored, is a visual delight still keeping watch atop the ridge.

But spring still feels like a long way off.I crave it, not just because it makes the evening walks in the woods possible once more, but because of the beauty it s to the landscape.The land is still dormant, with nature seemingly sleeping. Itrsquos at this time of year that the ugly results of peoplersquos disregard for the land can be most clearly seen. Litter of all kinds lsquodecoratesrsquo the roadsides. In summer it is partly hidden as hedges, roadside bushes and grasses grow. But in winter nature retreats and exposes the extent of peoplersquos uncaring behaviour.I canrsquot understand it, I really canrsquot. Our country is so beautul, yet so many people just throw rubbish from their car window. Do they not see the results and feel a sense of shame and horror  In a country where we have the facilities to dispose of our rubbish, there is simply no excuse to trash our landscape like this.And in a time when there are cuts to vital services, councils having to pay money to pick up peoplersquos rubbish from the sides of roads is just another unseen effect. Itrsquos not just that itrsquos ugly to look at, itrsquos polluting our environment, killing wildle and leaving an appalling legacy for our children.And so as we set off last Sunday for a walk, the sight of litter strewn everywhere along the roadside was quite depressing. And my children noticed its ugliness too. ldquoWhy do people litter like this  I was asked by my five-year-old Skye, and to be honest I struggled for an answer.ldquoI really donrsquot know, but it must be because they donrsquot care.My daughter seemed forlorn at this reply as we drove past a mass of discarded fast food remains, plastic bottles, beer bottles, plastic bags and yet more fast food rubbish.But I wanted to lt her spirits and so told her we were going on a hunt for something beautul. We were on a snowdrop hunt! And so as we drove to our destination, I reminded them of my version of the old story:lsquoMany years ago, Snow had no colour. It felt ashamed and left out to be colourless, especially when the land was so beautully covered in flowers of all dferent colours.And so Snow asked the flowersthey would be willing to share just a little of their colour. First Snow asked the daffodils, who were a beautul yellow. But they said no, they needed all their colour for themselves.Then Snow asked the bluebells, who were a wonderful blue. But they said they were too small to share any of their colour.Then Snow asked the whin bushesthey could share some of their vivid yellow, and they said no because they needed the colour.Snow even asked the roses of summer, but got the same answer: no.Then Snow heard a small voice and looked down. It was a small white flower. We can share some of our colour, with you it said.ldquoBut you are so small and you need your colour for yourself, said Snow. ldquoYes, the flower replied, ldquowe are small and we need our colour, but there are many of us andeach one of us gives a little then we can give you enough colour.ldquoThat is very kind of you but I donrsquot want to ruin your beautul appearance, said Snow.ldquoDonrsquot worry, said the wee white flower, ldquowe can all take a little colour from the inside of our petals, so it will not be noticed that any white is missing.rsquoAnd so that is how Snow became white. And because of the kindness shown by this little flower, Snow agreed to share its name with it, and so they became known as snowdrops.Snow also shared its space with the wee flower, so snowdrops and snow are often seen on the ground together. Andyou look carefully inside the snowdrop, you will see the hidden part where the white has been scraped off to give to Snow.With the storyrsquos end we arrived at Smeaton Lake, near East Linton, our destination for the snowdrop hunt. Itrsquos such a beautul place where a planted wood stands guard by a lake created  years ago. The woodland here is possibly unsurpassed in East Lothian for the canopy of snowdrops it displays.Excited screams at small patches of the flower soon gave way to ldquowow, look as we reached the end of the waterside and a wood carpeted by the wee flowers.My spirits were lted as I watched my daughter carefully examine flowers for evidence they had shared their colour. She showed her wee brother the green strips inside, explaining that is where the white was shared from. Both were careful not to damage or pick the flowers, despite their desire to do so.ldquoWersquoll find some growing in a less happy place and take those ones home, I assured them.And so we eventually headed back, a delicious bowl of ice cream at The Goth in Prestonpans, accompanied by traditional music, the reward for a good dayrsquos hunting.That night my daughter was reflective. ldquoI wish people wouldnrsquot spoil nature, she said. I felt guilty shersquos only five, I thought to myself, and shouldnrsquot have to be concerned about such things at that age. Perhaps I should have kept my thoughts to myself.ldquoBut I wonrsquot, and Irsquoll tell my friends not to as well. Can you tell me the snowdrop story again  So I told her the story once more.She had one wee snowdrop in a bowl by her bed. We had found it growing precariously at the verge of the road, surrounded by litter, and she wanted to lsquosaversquo it. So we did, hopefully with roots intact.ldquoWell we will plant the snowdrop in the garden and perhaps we will have our own snowdrops next year! I said to her, and she was happy at this.I went downstairs as she slept. My thoughts and emotions flooded me. My anger and depression at the ignorant mess we are making of our planet was superseded by my daughterrsquos determination to make a small dference, just like the snowdrop in the story.And perhaps therein lies the true message of that old tale: a dference can be made,we all do a little, but do it together.The children are the future, but letrsquos not leave all our ugly mess and destruction to our children to deal with. Let us all do something small, as many already are, to change the way we behave and how we appreciate what we have been gted.For our childrenrsquos sake, I really hope itrsquos not too late."},{"url":null,"title":"county-team-conquer-kilimanjaro-in-memory-of-vera-cameron","story":"Dougie Cameron and daughter Laura-Jane were joined by seven other men and women in climbing Mount Kilimanjaro last week.The trek was the latest fundraiser in memory of Vera Cameron and in aid of Cancer Research UK.Laura-Jane said that her mum would have thought the fundraisers were ldquooff our heads but would be ldquoreally proud of their achievement, which takes the fundraising total to about pound,.She said: ldquoIt was a really tough challenge but the fact we were doing it for charity kept us going.ldquoAt the end of the day, it was for such a good cause and we wanted to get to the top and keep the sponsorship going.ldquoThe whole experience was totally dferent to what I expected.ldquoBeing over seven days, we have never done anything like that before and it was tough mentally and physically.ldquoWe had one goal ndash to get to the summit ndash and we ended up making lots of new friends and spent a lot of time with other groups.ldquoIt was a really good experience overall.Vera, of Macmerry, worked for East Lothian Council as a senior administrator in transportation.Dougie, who is site attendant at Kinwegar Recycling Centre in Wallyford, was joined by seven colleagues from the council on the memorable trip.Laura-Jane, , and her dad set off from Scotland on January  alongside Ray Montgomery , Paul Ritchie , Lorraine Faulds , William Kelley , Stuart Baxter , Rachael Cormackand Vanessa Sanal .The group began the trip up the near-,-metre-high mountain on the Saturday and reached the summit last Thursday.Then it was back down before flying home on Sunday and back to work on Monday.Laura-Jane, who works as a PR officer, said it was ldquosurreal to think that just a few days earlier she had been standing at the top of Kilimanjaro.Already, more than pound, has been donated to the good cause, with that figure set to rise to pound, when all the money has been donated and counted.Previously, fundraisers have completed a number of other challenges ndash although nothing on the scale of the latest achievement ndash in memory of Vera, who was  when she passed away from cancer in .The West Highland Way, which stretches from Milngavie to Fort William , and the Three Peaks Challenge, which sees the highest peaks in Scotland, England and Wales ndash Ben Nevis, Scafell Pike and Snowdon respectively ndash climbed have been completed.Laura-Jane, who lives in Tranent, said: ldquoI think my mum would think we were off our heads for doing what we have done but really proud of us.

An ammonoid. Some  million or  million years ago this was the shell for a marine mollusc of some sort that was feeding and breeding in the region of what is now the Anti-Atlas Mountains in Morocco.Related to squids, cuttlefish and octopuses, this creature died, sank to the bottom and was buried in the sediment. Eventually the shell and surrounding loose sediment grains were cemented together to produce solid rock.Millennia later it was quarried and transported halfway across the world to become part of the Scotsman Steps at the instigation of Turner Prize winning artist Martin Creed, for his  art installation Work No. .McGowan, all hair and enthusiasm, is speculating on how this little creature ended up encased in marble millennia ago. ldquoThere are very many dferent pathways to becoming a fossil, he explains.He traces the outline of the ammonoid with his finger. ldquoThe inner part has been preserved in a whiteish mineral, which Irsquom guessing is Calcite, and the outer part has been preserved in sediment because thatrsquos open like a bucket.As McGowan lies on the stone floor, people pass up and down the steps around us, oblivious.Obliviousness is the default human position, isnrsquot it  We accept the world as it is and rarely think about the how. Itrsquos typical human behaviour. ldquoMost people donrsquot think about how Maxwellrsquos equations relate to their mobile phone or how the internal combustion engine works, McGowan points out.And yet our st-century lives are rooted in the distant past. The stones beneath our feet, the stones in the buildings that surround us, are the physical evidence of the planetrsquos millennia-long story. Deep time made manest.On every street you walk on there are stones ndash sedimentary, igneous or metamorphic ndash that are in a way a form of frozen time travel. Stones from local quarries, stones from Caithness and Yorkshire and Morocco and Baia, stones laid down in the Carbonerous era and repurposed for our own use over the last few centuries. The world around us is a Tardis.Most of the time wersquore too busy popping into Starbucks for a Soy Chai Latte or checking our mobile phones to notice. But the past is all around us,wersquod only open our eyes. Today, the Doctorhas offered to lend me his.And there is so much to see in Edinburgh, this city built around and on top of an extinct volcano.More than that, the volcanic plugs of Arthurrsquos Seat, the volcanorsquos main vent, and the Castle Rock, have done much to shape the look and the settlement patterns of the city. Edinburgh is an example of geology as design.We are on a journey into the planetrsquos primordial past. It will take us from Morocco to Austria and from the Highlands to Argentina, all without leaving the old town. These are the stories of the stone of the city.ldquoThese slabs here are from Caithness, McGowan tells me, pointing at the paving stones beneath our feet as we walk down East Market Street towards The City of Edinburgh Councilrsquos offices.ldquoThey were the base of an ancient freshwater lake up around Orkney and down to round about the Moray Firth.The stone dates back some  million years ago to the Devonian era. At that time the environment in what is now the north of Scotland would have been arid.ldquoThe analogy we use for the Devonian is Death Valley in Calornia, McGowan explains. For anyone who has spent a winter in Wick that might be hard to imagine, but there it is.We move onto Waverley Court to look at the walls. Council workers come and go from the building. Some stand around outside having a fly cigarette, watching with vague interest as we start to feel up the sandstone faccedilade on the building.ldquoWersquoll just shuffle along a bit and yoursquoll start seeing some obvious fossils, says Doctor McGowan. ldquoThatrsquos an ammonoid, he says pointing to another ice cream cone on the side of the council offices. ldquoThe piece next to it is a two-dimensional section of a belemnite, he adds. ldquoBelemnites were around in the Jurassic and Cretaceous period, between  million and  million years ago.The sandstone the fossils are embedded in is smooth and creamy to the touch. As smooth and creamy as yoursquod want your le to be. ldquoTherersquos a lot of touching in geology, McGowan admits.He runs his hands over the walls of the building. ldquoThis is known in the trade as Baian gold limestone, he points out. ldquoThis is from the lagoonal environments in the Solnhofen in Eistadt, the lagoons where the archaeopteryx [a transitional fossil between dinosaurs and modern birds] comes from. No archaeopteryx here unfortunately, but very, very fossilerous.Fossilerous might be my new favourite word, I think, as he looks for more examples. We both caress the stone, tracing the shapes of ancient sponges and bivalves.We cross over the road and walk up the hill towards the Royal Mile. On the rise therersquos another building that has used Baian gold limestone as for its facia. The stone here is rougher textured, not so finished.Still, it has stories to tell. We stand back and take in the patterns that can be seen flowing across the surface of the stone. These stones were once the bed of a river, my guide explains. And, indeed, as I look, I can see the flow of the water, great sweeping arcs of it, a liquid path now scoured in stone.Over coffee in the City Art Centre Doctor McGowan charts his own course. It starts with feathers not rock.ldquoI was always interested in birds when I was wee. I was born in Paisley and I grew up in Aberdeen. Two of the big boys on my street were in the YOC, The Young Ornithologistrsquos Club, so I got into that.At university in Glasgow, McGowan says, he wanted to study astrophysics. ldquoBut my calculus remains a bit fy. Instead, he segued into geology. After uni, he worked for three years in a boatyard in Knoydart and spent time building mountain footpaths in Torridon and up Arthurrsquos Seat.He then went to Bristol to do a masters in paleobiology and then decamped to Chicago for his PHD, before eventually ing to Scotland. He is  now. His partner is an atmospheric physicist. They have three children, a -year-old girl and eight-year-old twins.In a bid to manage family commitments McGowan went freelance. And, so, he does upland bird surveys in the Highlands and Duke of Edinburgh expedition work.And when asked he will show people the geology of Scotland that surrounds them, whether that be up mountains or in the city itself.From birds to stones doesnrsquot seem an obvious step, I suggest. That turns out to be a very st-century notion. ldquoIf you go back to the th century, the heyday of the Victorian collecting mania, geology was very much part of natural history. Rocks, soils, fossils, minerals are the non-living part of natural history, what we call geoersity. If you like, they set the stage for the biological actors ndash the plants and animals ndash to strut upon.What he does is big picture stuff, you could say. ldquoThinking about evolution, but on enormous scales, up to the point where you are shting tectonic plates around and the signature that that will leave on the fossil records. And that feeds back to reconstructing what the environment was like.ldquoSo, itrsquos doing natural history, but on a really, really, big scale. And that does go onto the elements of what we are made up of, because we are all children of stars. Wersquore formed in supernovas.He brings out a map of the rocks and stones of Edinburgh, points out the volcanic crag and trail and the surrounding coal fields. His maternal grandfather used to be a miner before becoming the last provost of Prestonpans. His family story is written in the rocks that surround us.The city of Edinburgh is shaped by the geology of the landscape it is built upon. The layout owes much to the volcanic geology and the Norrsquo Loch which once extended from the Castle Rock down to Market Street.ldquoThe old town was incredibly tight and confined onto the crag and tail until pretty late on, McGowan points out. ldquoEdinburgh didnrsquot really break out of the old town because of a combination of the Norrsquo Loch, the fact that it was an important military site, and also dferences in the land ownership patterns.ldquoGlasgow is built on a series of ridges and valleys that are part of a drumlin field which are the result of the last ice age, whereas, here, you have one big feature that yoursquore working around. Itrsquos a mixture of geology setting the stage of what yoursquore going to do and then what people want to do. We set up our ecosystem as we want it.In Glasgow that meant building on the slopes of the drumlins. In Edinburgh the relatively soft sedimentary rock on the downhill side of the castle meant people could tunnel into it. ldquoYou could dramatically expand your living space. Itrsquos the th-century equivalent of people putting those sub-sub basements in in London.We walk on and eventually turn into St Johnrsquos Hill, climbing up past the NCP car park to a scrubby little garden full of plastic bottles, newspapers, empty Kronenberg beer cans and a small memorial to James Hutton, one of the founders of the science of geology who lived on this site until his death in .ldquoThis is how Hutton is memorialised in Edinburgh, McGowan points out. It is, it must be said, a slightly shabby little memorial garden for such an important scientic figure.But maybe the memorial is all around us. Its there up on Salisbury Crags where you can see what Hutton saw a dolerite sill caused by magma forcing its way between layers of existing sandstone rock. Millennia later this rock formation shaped Huttonrsquos thinking and was then named after him: Huttonrsquos Section.Edinburgh is a city that was made for the most part from local stone. On a map McGowan points out the ious quarries. Hailes, Craigmillar Hawkhill, Craigleith.But stone travels too. On Chambers Street, we stop at the statue of Greyfriars Bobby. McGowan rubs his fingers over the glossy, polished black grained stone at the base.ldquoI will make no comments on the tale, but this is Shap granite from Cumbria. Itrsquos very distinctive because of these very large phenocrysts, he says, pointing to the glittering crystals that pattern the black rock.Like everything, there are fashions in stone. Igneous rocks from Norway are popular for shop faces, for example.Glasgow, meanwhile, has more Portland stone than Edinburgh. But you can find one example on Hanover Street, now home to Lakeland and the Royal Society of EdinburghldquoThat was originally owned by one of the insurance companies, McGowan explains [the Edinburgh Le Assurance Company]. ldquoBy showing that you could bring that stone all the way from Portland you were basically saying, lsquoWersquove got the capital to pay out on your claim.rsquoAnd so, rocks, laid down millennia ago, are dug up and transported around the world. We shape the world that shapes us hellip those Caithness slabs in East Market Street can also be found around the Cutty Sark in London. Some, McGowan points out, have travelled as far as Buenos Aires.Wersquore only going as far as the Grassmarket, where we pop into Stan Wood Dinosaurs to meet its manager Matt Dale. He has had the fossil shop for the last  of its  years. This morning, he tells me, he has just sent his empty crates down to Bristol where they will be shipped out to America in time for a trade show he is attending in Arizona. Trade shows are where he picks up the bulk of his stock.Looking in one of the display cases McGowan points out ldquosnakestones from Whitby. ldquoThey used to be a tourist good luck charm, Dale explains. ldquoThe story is that when Saint Hilda arrived at her abbey, she was disgusted to find snakes there, so she turned them into stone and cast them into the sea.ldquoWhen people found ammonoids they didnrsquot know what they were and assumed they were the snakes.ldquoThere are lots of stories that are peoplersquos attempts to explain things in the natural world, adds McGowan. ldquoDragon myths, which are pervasive all over the world, are probably a mixture of people seeing ice age dinosaur bones because how  could you possibly explain this flying winged beast We tell ourselves stories about the stones that surround us. The stones tell their own stories.For a moment I think again about that little ammonoid fused in marble on the Scotsman Steps. Caught in stone, caught in time. A small mark on the face of eternity.

March  Brexit date in order to leave MPs with a stark choice of accepting her deal or crashing out of the European Union without any agreement.If no deal on the changes to the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement has been reached with Brussels by Wednesday, as seems overwhelmingly likely, Mrs May will address MPs on progress made, say more time is needed for negotiations, and table a ldquoneutral motion for debate the following day.Sir Keirrsquos new deadline is expected to be one of a range of amendments tabled for votes on Valentinersquos Day.The PM is promising another ldquomeaningful vote in the coming weeks but Labour will seek to take the decision out of her hands.ldquoWe have got to put a hard stop into this running down the clock, Sir Keir told the Sunday Times. ldquoAnd thatrsquos

Brexit deal by a record  votes.ldquoItrsquos this blinkered approach thatrsquos got us to where we are, with her never wanting to see where the real majority is in Parliament, Sir Keir said.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, who has written to the Prime Minister setting out his demands for a Brexit deal he could support, accused Mrs May of an ldquoutterly cynical approach.In a speech in Coventry he saidLabourrsquos plan ldquocould win the support of Parliament and bring the country together but Mrs May has so far ldquochosen the path of ision.ldquoIf she is unable to adopt a sensible deal

employees had agreed to keep the details of their complaints confidential under NDAs.Sir Philip obtained the injunction, but last week it emerged that he was dropping the case because it was

And, despite attending Holyrood twice a week for many years, never understood motions, amendments and standing orders.But even I,I so chose, could easily find myself elected as a list MSP, like Jamie and James, in effect the leftovers from elections. Theyrsquore elected indirectly from the list, which is a free pass to Holyrood for losers .For my taxpayerrsquos money, itrsquos time we re-evaluated this system, so that we get elected representatives who are well-travelled, oratorically confident, brave, bright and well turned out. Not people like me.CHIPS news, and the controversial comestibles could shrink by in after last yearrsquos wonky weather, according to top lardologists. The potato crop may have been grievously affected, leaving smaller, misshapen spuds, from which sculpting a decent-sized chip might become impossible.Asthat werenrsquot grim enough news, nutritionists are calling for fish and chips portions to be reduced in size by inflicting smaller cartons on consumers. How dastardly of them.Every Friday recently, I had a humungous fish supper served in a in-wide box, and herersquos what these food boffins donrsquot factor in: driving home with this monstrous supper safely strapped in to the passengerrsquos seat, the aroma would sometimes cause a tear of happiness to fall down my cheek, and I found myself experiencing the unusual feeling that le might be worth living after all.They say that being happy is good for our health and, in that sense, I estimate that each fish supper has added a month to my le. To reduce them in size would diminish our joy, making us sullen and unproductive, with deleterious consequences for the health service and economy.If this coming year is truly to feature little chips in little cartons, I fear for the country, and would advise the Samaritans to draft in extra troops.HOW amusing to read that Scottish islands are producing guides on how to use single-track roads for visitors.Visitors would be within their rights to reply: ldquoWhy donrsquot you join up all the passing places and make normal, two-lane roads, as they have in the rest of the world Irsquove never understood single-track roads. Before they were forced to create passing places, did the clots who built them not envisage the possibility of traffic coming the other way Presumably, as with everything in our increasingly wealthy society, expense will be the reason for leaving them so ridiculously user-unfriendly. In the poor past, people could build roads but, in the rich present, we canrsquot even widen them a little.Itrsquos the same with the South Edinburgh Suburban Railway.

He headlines the debut event, Going To Extremes, and will be joined by others who have taken on the elements, performed daredevil stunts or tested themselves in the wilderness.Among them are Robbie Grfith, whose Trainspotting-inspired parkour tricks were so cool they went viral, Hazel Robertson, explorer-in-residence at Royal Scottish Geographical Society who has run a -mile ice Ultra in snowshoes and trekked across Alaska, and Calum Maclean, the wild swimmer who has brought new meaning to the word ldquoBaltic.Cool Conversations will be your chance to ask burning questions, hear tales from, and to share time and perhaps a cocktail with, some of Scotlandrsquos coolest. Tickets are available at pound each. To whet your appetite here are a few stories from these boundary-pushing adventurers.Aldo KaneExtreme adventurer, Moment of cool: Beating Ed Stafford in a race through the mangrove swamps of BorneoldquoYoursquore not born an adventurer. I think being adventurous can be nurtured. I joined the marines at , where I then was taught in spadefuls how to be courageous and strong. But I think it was actually being in the scouts, in Kilwinning, when I was a kid that gave me that confidence to know that I could go outside on my own. I could stay outside at nightI needed to. And as a kid to have that in your back of your head, that you could probably stay out at night and not die, is quite a big thing. Confidence grows. Yoursquore just building good foundations, building mental and emotional resilience. You can learn it, whatever your age.Irsquom just about to fly out to Oman for the Expeditions series with Steve Backshall. Itrsquos part of a series of ten expeditions to do ten world firsts - whether thatrsquos been cave-ing in Mexico or kayaking and climbing in Greenland. Oman is number nine and wersquore basically climbing a big wall, about  metres high. Itrsquos a vertical clf face and itrsquos never been climbed before.Itrsquos not that hard to find firsts to do. Itrsquos actually relatively easy, even in the UK. In Scotland for example there are so many thousand kilometres of coastal sea clfs. Not every single part of it has been climbed. A couple of friends and I rowed across the Atlantic two or three years ago. We rowed from mainland Europe to mainland South America and in  that had never been done before. But Irsquom not chasing world firsts, Irsquom just chasing adventureIn the last year and a half shooting, Irsquove done some scary things. Being inside a volcano in the Congo when that erupted was pretty terrying But filming The Real Narcos [a documentary series investigating the South American drugs trade] was definitely up there as the scariest thing Irsquove done. All around the world Irsquove worked in hazardous environments, but the worst environment is people.

Itrsquos quite, quite frightening.Calum MacleanWild swimmer, Moment of cool: A dip in ice-covered Loch Coire an Lochain, the highest loch in Scotland.ldquoI was never a competitive swimmer as a child. I just liked being in water. About ten years ago I really got the bug for it. I put it down to one swim in particular. It was in Hobart in Australia. I was born there and half my family live there. In those days I ran a lot and cycled a lot, but I didnrsquot really swim. Therersquos a big river called the Derwent in the middle of Hobart and I was out on the bike one day and I thought, lsquoYeah, I could swim that. Letrsquos go try it.rsquo When I did it, I got a real buzz. it was a revelation. It was like, yeah, I love this. Irsquom going to keep doing stuff like this.I began blogging while I was working for the BBC and based on the Isle of Skye as a broadcast journalist. Irsquod been doing the job for about three years and I was bored of it. I started to blog and luckily at the time BBC The Social was starting for young people in Scotland and the producer asked me to do some videos. So I did a few and they were okay and then I did the water temperature chart, where instead of using temperature in degrees I talked about the water as ldquoBaltic or ldquoHoora cold or ldquoBaltic. It just took off. Irsquove even been heckled at in Tesco in Aviemore. Irsquove had strangers coming up to me, lsquoIs it Baltic Hazel RobertsonExplorer, Moment of cool: Soaking in the -hour daylight while trekking through the Arctic.ldquoProbably every time Irsquove done some new challenge, it felt like the most extreme thing Irsquod done, whether itrsquos been running across Arctic Sweden in snowshoes, or racing across the Sahara in the Marathon des Sables. Each time itrsquos felt like this is really pushing the bar a bit higher. When you do get to the end I guess itrsquos a confidence boost in yourself of having done something you werenrsquot sure you could do. Then itrsquos about looking at whatrsquos next.I guess my most extreme challenge was probably the three-month expedition that my husband Luke Robertson and I went on in , aiming to go from the southernmost to the northernmost point of mainland Alaska by sea-kayak and bike. Alaska is also this place of extremes. In the south we were starting in temperate rainforests that get  inches of rain every year, crazy wet. We were then passing all these glaciers and mountains, and then when we headed up to the Arctic and the flat, undulating tundra. Once wersquod passed the Arctic Circle we had  hour daylight for the last few weeks of our expedition. I felt so energised. It was just this absolute buzz. You almost donrsquot want to go to bed because yoursquove got so much energy.But the trip was cut short. When we hit the Arctic, we started crossing a series of lakes that are connected by rivers. Itrsquos actually the old historic trade route that the indigenous Inupiat used to kayak along. The plan was to kayak through these lakes by the rivers. And for a few lakes it was fine but as we got further inland, we realised that the water levels in these lakes were really really low and there was this sludgy mud at the bottom that the kayaks kept getting stuck in. Long story short, we found out once we got back was that actually climate change, as the air temperature is warming the permafrost that covers all of the Arctic and sits under these lakes had been starting to thaw.Robbie GrfithParkour athlete, Moment of cool: Somersaulting over a screeching car, Renton-styleldquoI think I was just ten when I started parkour. I actually went along to classes at my primary school, and there were coaches, it was like a gymnastics class just for parkour. In gymnastics itrsquos very regulated therersquos lots of rules, but in parkour there are no rules. You can move any way you want and itrsquos more creative. My most famous parkour video is a remake I made with one of my friends of the classic Choose Le scene from Trainspotting. My brother suggested we used the track for a normal parkour video. Then my dad said why donrsquot you go one better and make the actual scene, remake it in a parkour sense.

At times the Nigerian capital is nothing short of a tumultuous pandemonium, for in the cityrsquos teeming streets are found some of the worst traffic congestion on the planet.Sitting in what can feel like an interminable log jam of vehicles, itrsquos not uncommon to see the trucks of a special paramilitary police unit with the acronym KAI emblazoned on the vehicles sides.The initials are short for the rather more colourful full name, lsquoKick Against Indiscipline Brigadersquo a law enforcement unit that is the brainchild of former Major General Muhammadu Buhari who today serves as Nigeriarsquos president.In many ways the KAI says a lot about Nigeria, set up as it was back in  to crackdown on everything from illegal petty traders to controlling the cityrsquos notorious criminal street gangs in some of the poorest neighbourhoods.Buhari the ex-general, who led a short-lived military junta back in the rsquos, was elected president in  by an electorate who by and large accepted his claim to be a ldquoreformed democrat.Four years on he rules over a country beset with problems, whose population of  million, one the largest in the world, will next weekend go to the polls in an election that will be the judge on whether Buhari is worth re-electingRunning against him is fellow septuagenarian and former vice-president Atiku Abubakar, a wealthy businessman whose pointed campaign slogan is ldquoLetrsquos Get Nigeria Working Again.Should Atiku - as hersquos widely known here - win, he will undoubtedly have his work cut out fulfilling that campaign pledge.Indeed many Nigerians argue that there is little to choose between the two leading candidates one of whom has presided over four years of lacklustre growth and the other an alleged kleptocrat of international repute.Nicknamed ldquoBaba Go-Slow by his political opponents in reference to his age and sluggish response to crises, Buhari many insist is way past his political sell by date.Atiku on the other hand continues to have trouble shaking off the air of impropriety that has surrounded his business and political dealings since .It was back then that a US Senate Report on keeping foreign corruption out of the United States concluded that Atiku and one of his wives had transferred  million of ldquosuspect funds into American accounts and said that his business dealings ldquoraise a host of questions about the nature and source of his wealth.For his part Atiku has denied the claims butone thing is certain itrsquos that corruption remains a major problem in Nigeria. Indeed many in the country and beyond regard it as a kind of plague, comprehensively infecting public officials who have embezzled vast funds generated from Nigeriarsquos crude oil exports, the mainstay of its economy.Analysts are near unanimous in their assertion that corruption is now the single greatest obstacle preventing Nigeria from achieving its enormous potential as an oil rich nation.ldquoNigerians themselves view their country as one of the worldrsquos most corrupt it perennially ranks in the bottom quartile of Transparency Internationalrsquos Corruption Perception Index, says Matthew Page, a Nigeria expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.ldquoThis is not because there is anything unique about Nigerians that make them more corrupt, Page observes, but because of a ldquoperfect storm of circumstances.Nigerias vast oil reserves he says mean, ldquotherersquos an enormous amount of money flowing into public coffers.Years of military rule prior to theto democracy in  ldquoresulted in a hollowing out of public institutions, he explains.Tales of corruption in Nigeria are legion. Page himself tells for example of the mile-long ldquomonorail to nowhere in the city of Port Harcourt.There a state governor invested  million into building it then shortly before completion, his successor halted construction. ldquoSo, its never run a single train, says Page.For analysts like Page and most ordinary Nigerians any amusement at such tales however is tempered by concern over the larger implications and impact corruption has on peoplersquos lives.Nigeria after all has now overtaken India as the worlds poverty capital, according to a report by the Brookings Institution, a US-based think-tank.The  study estimated that  million people - slightly less than half of Nigeriarsquos population, were living in extreme poverty, compared with  million in India.Four of every  people in the countryrsquos workforce are either unemployed or underemployed. Half of its population also has no electricity despite billions of dollars budgeted for power supply over the years.For many people beyond Nigeriarsquos shores this most populous country in Africa is perceived as an oil-rich state from which the majority benefit. But nothing could be further from the truth with most of the countryrsquos citizens surviving on the equivalent of  dollar or less a day.Nigeria might be oil-enriched but that is only one side of the story. This oil wealth in part accounts for its , millionaires and handful of billionaires, sixty per cent of which live in Lagos. But as with other African metropolises, Lagos has long nurtured an elite class only marginally inconvenienced by the squalor and poverty enveloping the city as a whole.In short, this is a city and country of stark contrasts and nowhere is this more apparent that in the lives of the poorest, especially young women. Of the  million adolescent girls in the world living in poverty, more than  million live in Nigeria. During my last visit to the country I was to meet some of the poorest, among them a teenage girl in Lagos called Elizabeth who lived on the streets.Elizabeth lost her mother when she was six years old and never really knew her father who was from the neighbouring West African country of Benin.Sleeping rough anywhere is a terrying experience. Here in the frenetic madness that is Nigeriarsquos capital, where somewhere between  million and  million people live, sleeping on the streets doesnrsquot bear thinking about, especially for a young woman.ldquoI used to pray before sleeping, Elizabeth told me when we met, her voice almost drowned out by the roar of a nearby ubiquitous petrol generator that provides round-the-clock power in a city where the electricity supply is erratic.Elizabethrsquos bed was wherever she could lie down in comparative safety. For over a year her nights were spent curled up on top of a sack inside a flimsy street kiosk.If darkness brought its own terrors then daytime was not much better for her.ldquoI lived by begging, sometimes I would rub menthol on my eyes to make tears, so that passersby might give me a little money, the teenager confessed.For those millions of Nigerians like Elizabeth who struggle to survive or eke out a living, next weekrsquos elections might as well be happening on the moon for all the impact it will have on their lives.But itrsquos not only corruption and widespread poverty that pose the key challenges to those politicians contesting next weekendrsquos ballot.Insecurity is also a major electoral issue for President Buhari as he seeks re-election. When he came to office in  he pledged to end attacks by the Islamist terrorist group Boko Haram but has since struggled to keep that promise.Most analysts doubt the governmentrsquos claim of victory over Boko Haram. While evidence shows that the jihadists have been pushed out of some territories they held, Boko Haram still continue to ambush security forces, launch attacks on civilians, and stage kidnappings.A recent escalation of attacks these past months has ensured that insecurity and the continuing battle against Boko Haram dominates the election campaign right now.To date the Islamist insurgency in the north east of the country has resulted in some thirty thousand deaths and the internal displacement of up to two million Nigerians. During my last visit to the volatile north eastern region I was to see for myself the horric and devastating impact this was having on peoplersquos lives there.It was during the final months of the countryrsquos dry season when I arrived in the town of Gombe. Nigerians call the town the lsquojewel in the savannahrsquo. But nothing much glitters here. Gombe might not be much of a jewel, but for one young man called Abbas his family and thousands like them, the town is a precious sanctuary of sorts.Even before speaking with Abbas I sensed from the faces of his family some of the trauma they had undergone during the five months that Boko Haram had stalked their village, Nduva, in neighbouring Borno State.ldquoWe had to stay indoors much of the time and couldnrsquot go to our farms, there was little food and water and always Boko Haram slaughtering people, Abbas told me.ldquoThey cut off peoplersquos heads with knives and placed the heads back on top of the shoulders, he continued his grisly account.ldquoThe decapitated bodies were left to rot in the street without burial, a sign that Boko Haram regard them as Kafirs ndash non-believers ndash and as a warning to others, he went on.As he told his story, nearby clearly exhausted, his elderly mother, we and children sat in the dust of the sparse rundown compound in which they now sheltered.Lined up along one wall were a handful of bulging trolley bags and holdalls containing all the personal belongings they could carry during the five gruelling days it took them to escape their village and come to this impoverished neighbourhood in Gombe.Abbas still remembered the day Boko Haram came to his village, their black flags fluttering from the speeding pick-up trucks that had heavy machine guns on tripods bolted down in the back. Some fighters also arrived on motorcycles and others on foot, quickly overrunning Nduva.ldquoThe moment you violated their instructions they either cut your throat or shot you, he recalled. ldquoI saw people tied up crouching, waiting to be butchered in this way.For what seemed like endless months, Abbas, his family, neighbours and other villagers lived in constant fear, struggling to survive as the cost of basic items soared.It was only when the Nigerian Army fought its way into the area and gaps in the Boko Haram defences opened up that Abbas family and a handful of others managed to slip away.In the days that followed, they trekked over  miles across scrubland studded with acacias and baobab trees that provided the only shelter from the searing sun. Finally they arrived at the town of Damboa, from where they journeyed to the comparative safety of Gombe.The story of Abbas and his family is far from unique and the plight of those displaced by Boko Haramrsquos violence goes on unabated. These past days as Nigeria gears up for its election, thousands of people have fled in a continuous stream over the border into neighbouring Cameroon after Boko Haram attacked the town of Rann.Andrew Mews, Country Director in Nigeria of the humanitarian organisationrsquo Medecins Sans Frontieressaid the attacks gave the lie to suggestions of improved stability in the countryrsquos north-east.ldquoThe emergency is not over yet, said Mews. ldquoTherersquos been quite a lot of talk that perhaps the situation is stabilised, and that we could start looking at doing more development activities in the north-east, but the reality is the context doesnrsquot allow that. We wish that was the case.So too no doubt does President Buhari who has staked much of his election campaigning on the claim that Boko Haram are effectively neutralised. Itrsquos against this stark unpalatable reality of the insurgents continued presence however that he will take on Atiku in the  February vote.While there are more than  other candidates, it really only boils down to these two men who between them have run for president on nine occasions. That the election matters far beyond Nigeria goes without saying.One out of every four sub-Saharan Africans is a Nigerian, and Nigeriarsquos economy is among the two largest on the continent. Given the countryrsquos heft, credible elections next week would be a boost for multi ethnic democracy in Africa. But concerns over the outcome and post election period remain.ldquoIn a society as ethnically and religiously ided as Nigeriarsquos, democracy is as fragile as an eggnot handled carefully, it could drop and shatter into a thousand pieces impossible to glue back together, warned the Polish-Nigerian journalist and political analyst Remi Adekoya last week. Few would be inclined to disagree with such an assessment."},{"url":null,"title":"scottish-parliament-msps-can-breastfeed-in-holyrood-chamber","story":"Ken Macintosh was responding to a letter from the Standards Committee on whether the Parliaments standing orders are sensitive to ersity.A growing number of legislatures across the world are allowing mothers to feed their babies in debating chambers.Larissa Waters, a Green MP in Australia, addressed colleagues in  while feeding her  month old baby, Alia Joy. In Canada, Liberal MP Karina Gould breast-fed her three month old son during a debate on legalising recreational marijuana.In Scotland, following a Bill introduced by Labour MSP Elaine Smith, Holyrood passed legislation making it illegal to bar women from breastfeeding their babies in public.However, it is understood the definition of ldquopublic place in the legislation makes it unclear whether the MSPsrsquo chamber is covered by the provisions.SNP MSP Bill Kidd, who is the convener of the Standards, Procedures and Public Appointmentscommittee, wrote to Macintosh in December about a recommendations of a commission on parliamentary reform which the Presiding Officer had set up.He wrote: \"The Committeehellip..agreed that it was important that there should be specic provision to ensure that Members with childcare responsibilities, particularly nursing mothers, were able to participate in Chamber business.ldquoI would therefore be gratefulyou would give consideration to Members being allowed to breastfeed in the Chamber should the need arise.A Scottish Parliament spokesperson said: ldquoThe Presiding Officer is responsible for MSPsrsquo conduct in the Chamber. He has indicated that, although the situation has yet to arise, he would always support any mother who wished to breastfeed in the Chamber.The move is expected to build on Holyroodrsquos family-friendly working hours, which were introduced when the Parliament was created in .However, although the Parliament was commended for this approach, other aspects of its operation are believed to be in need of reform.The Committee also told the Presiding Officer there should be ldquosufficient flexibility in how MSPs can use the Holyrood creche, in order to ldquofacilitate their participation in parliamentary business.By contrast, MPs are not permitted to breastfeed in the House of Commons debating chamber, a ban that angers parliamentarians.Westminsterrsquos long hours also infuriate campaigners who believe the working practices do not reflect the needs of the twenty-first century.Labour MP Tulip Siddiq, who was heavily pregnant at the time, was last month pushed through parliament in a wheelchair so she could vote on Brexit.MPs who cannot go through the Commons ision lobby because they are ill or have a small child with them can be ldquonodded through, which means their vote is still countedthey are on the parliamentary estate.Smith said: ldquoI welcome this clarication from the Presiding Officer, as it is extremely important mums are able to breastfeed whenever and wherever they want.

Sometimes the bands on downstairs can drown out your conversation, its dark, close and sweaty, but its full of good intentions.The food, although vegan from before vegan was a \"thing\", is very good indeed and theres always spaceyoure a big group.There have been excellent birthday nights out held here and it is the location of my best first kiss ndash but its not sentiment that recommends it, its merits are solid.Best for: A night that could end up entirely dferently than you expected.Avoid : You like a sense of decorum.CATRIONA STEWARTOblomov, Candleriggs, Glasgow Sadly no longer with us, this stylish Merchant City bar was my favourite when I lived round the corner in St Andrewrsquos Square, in a le before children and responsibility and huge mortgages.

Iniably I reply that there is no question of \"\", it is only a question of \"when\" but that depends on a great many iables.So my response to a question on January  on Good Morning Scotland was that wersquore not yet ready for a fresh referendum because there are too many practical questions as yet unanswerable precisely because of the shambles Westminster is inflicting upon us. That our collective patience is rapidly running out is completely understandable, given the mess the UK Government and the official opposition have put us in, but this is precisely the time for cool heads to prevail and recognise that we need to know what Brexit will look like before we make our next, decisive move.I refuse to accept the  equivalence between Brexit and independence that our political adversaries are increasingly peddling. The main reason Brexit is so dficult is because its proponents, Tory and Labour alike, simply cannot agree on what the term means and what the future should look like. If you donrsquot know where yoursquore going and how to get there, then of course the leaving process will be dficult!That is where independence is dferent. Independence is about principle, but also practicalities. It behoves us as serious people to explain in detail to folk how le will change and how le will stay the same. The deeply dishonest Leave campaign has shown us what happens when such a change is considered without any detail or indeed bearing with the world as it exists.In , we put a realistic and detailed proposition before the people of Scotland. We will do so again next time. We cannot put the same proposal forward for two reasons, firstly because that proposal was rejected and secondly because the landscape is likely to be very dferent due to the material change that Brexit represents.Crucially, our proposal was predicated upon all the nations of these islands being in the EU,the rest of the UK does leavethen we will need a dferent proposal. Only once the current uncertainty has dissipated can we can lay out the detailed proposition people have a right to expectwe are to ask them to put their trust in us.Crucially, this proposal must be based on reality. The key reason why over the last two years Brexit has been such a grotesque spectacle is that, from the beginning, the Leave campaign has been utterly ignorantof the most basic realities of the modern world and the relationships between states. Our independence proposition must be ndash and will be ndash based on facts and reality.Through no fault of our own, there is still too much uncertainty about the future relationship of the UK and the EU, which an independent Scotland will be part of. Like Ireland, independent in Europe, we cannot pretend that Brexit is just a British thing and that independence will immunise us from it.We have a land border with only one country, and in our interconnected world Brexit will still be relevant to us. And not all negatively, indeed an independent Scotland within the EU will be an incredibly attractive place to relocate to. Just how much more attractive has not yet dawned on many folk, but it will.As I travel the country, my sense is that a good proportion of people who were unpersuaded in  are now much more open to the independence question, but many are not with us yet and they have real questions that need real answers. ldquoWersquoll sort it out later will lose them before we start. We are not yet able to provide them, through no fault of our own, but we will be soon.I suspect the clarity we need will come quickly when it comes, and the broken Union we are part of will visibly have a lot less going for it than independence in Europe.In the meantime, there is plenty of planning that we must be getting on with ndash and we are. The good news is that we can already be certain of a great deal. Scottish independence will mean being part of the EU and being part of Nato it will mean being open and welcoming to anyone who chooses to make Scotland their home it will mean ramping up our already substantial efforts in international development co-operation and help those less fortunate it will mean leading the way in clean, renewable energy it will mean equal opportunities and access to healthcare and education for all our citizens. Any Brexit will be inferior.So Brexit affects independence for now, we recognise that, but independence does not depend on and will in no way resemble Brexit, provided we keep our cool just a little while longer. People up and down the country are keen for conversation.Many are disquieted by the UK they thought they knew suddenly looking and sounding very dferent to how it did, and are thinking hard about independence. We donrsquot have all the answers yet, that is the reality of our situation and it is an honest and open stance to take. But there is nothing stopping us having the discussions.We can mobilise, we can be visible and open about the challenges we face. We might not have a date, because we do not have a proposition yet, but we already have the biggest part of the answer ndash our passion for a better future than the one Westminster is offering us."},{"url":null,"title":"Iain Macwhirter  After making demands she couldn t accept  Corbyn has made Theresa May an offer she can   t refuse","story":"Last week, Corbyn made a remarkable overture to the Prime Minister. He effectively dropped his opposition to her Withdrawal Agreement, which Labour had repeatedly condemned as the ldquoworst of all worlds. The Labour leaderrsquos letter still calls for a customs union, regulatory alignment on trade and guarantees on workers rights and security cooperation. But, crucially, Labour is no longer holding to the ldquosix tests, and insisting a Brexit deal should deliver ldquoexactly the same benefits as being in the single market.Labour has even dropped its opposition to the Irish backstop, which Mr Corbyn condemned, as recently as December, for leaving Britain ldquoin an indefinite halfway house with no say on its future. The explanatory note that Labour circulated after the leaderrsquos letter to May is quite clear. ldquoAny withdrawal agreement,\" it says, ldquowill need to include a backstop.\" Labour is also hinting at further compromises in ldquonegotiations.Hitherto, Labourrsquos policy has been to make demands May could never accept now they are trying to make her an offer she canrsquot refuse.So at last, after months of there being nothing much new to say about Brexit, suddenly we have what looks like a breakthrough, a historic compromise. Of course, you canrsquot overestimate the ability of political leaders to look a gt horse in the mouth. Theresa May may be so wedded to being a ldquobloody dficult womanthat she may find a way to avoid accepting Labourrsquos free hooved mammal. But the deal is there to be made.Senior Tories like Sir Oliver Letwin have welcomed the Labour offer, seeing it as a step towards a Norway-style agreement, even though it isnrsquot. Labourrsquos plan is much closer to Turkey, which is also in a customs union and accepts regulatory alignment. Brussels likes Corbyns proposals too, as a way out of hard Brexit ldquohell.Ive argued that the logic of Labourrsquos position was always to back something resembling Theresa Mayrsquos deal with the EU. It corresponds to Labourrsquos manesto commitments to leaving the EU, including the single market, and ending free movement while seeking frictionless trade. Mrs May has always supported regulatory alignment, since the ldquocommon rule book in her Chequers plan. And the backstop, remember, involves the UK remaining in the customs union until there is a future comprehensive trade deal.In what could almost have been a coordinated intervention last week, Mrs May restated in Dublin her determination to prevent a hard border in Ireland. This put the wind up the DUP, since they fear that the border might now move to the Irish Sea.It didnrsquot appeal to the hardline Brexiteers in her own party either, who are adamant that no deal is better than her bad deal. They thought it had been killed off by last monthrsquos record-breaking Commons defeat ndash but it may now live again with Labourrsquos backing.They canrsquot admit it, of course, but May and Corbyn are now speaking broadly the same language. The customs union, regulatory alignment, rights and protections etc are all matters to do with the future trade relationship with the EU, not the Withdrawal Agreement. It covers only money, citizenship and the Good Friday Agreement.The trading relationship can only be negotiated after Brexit. It is to be hammered out within the up to four years of the transition period, during which the UK remains in the single market and the customs union.Onlythere is no agreement does the backstop comes into play, and that really just extends the transition period indefinitely. May has said she will get assurances that the backstop will be time-limited, but she canrsquot get that from the European Union. If it was limited, it would no longer be a backstop.What hard Brexiteers really fear is that the transition period might lead to a soft Brexit, not a clean break ndash and they are right. What we know is that MPs will block any no-deal Brexit. Hardliners face a choice of May Corbyn or no Brexit at all.To secure a Commons majority without them, Mrs May could promise legislation to keep Britain in regulatory alignment with the customs union until a new trade deal is finalised ndash one which delivers the same benefits. This is anyway implicit in her promises to keep trade ldquofrictionless. Indeed, remaining in a customs union is the only way of achieving this. Up to now, she hasnrsquot been able to say this openly for fear of a rebellion by her hardline backbenchers, led by Jacob Rees-Mogg. They want a managed no-deal now, or in four years, under the so-called ldquoMalthouse Plan.Butshe has an ounce of political sense, May will now face them down and pivot to Labourrsquos softish Brexit. Labourrsquos demand that she put the customs union in primary legislation can be finessed, because the trade negotiations canrsquot happen until after Brexit. She doesnrsquot even need to ensure that Labour votes with her. Labour could abstain in the meaningful vote and achieve essentially the same result. The DUP would accept the customs union as a guarantee against a backstop or an east west hard border.Jeremy Corbyn could explain Labourrsquos abstention, which will be attacked by Vote Leave MPs andleader writers, by saying, as his spokespeople did last week: that the top priority ldquofor the nation is to avoid a no-deal. Corbynite commentators can be relied upon to condemn any Labour MPs who continue to vote against Mayrsquos deal as traitors.

He is a front-bencher, but it turned out that the proposals were not approved by the rest of the Labour Party.She added: ldquoTo give credit to Alex Rowley, at least he brought forward a proposal. Given that he is a front bencher, we assumed that it was an official Labour proposal, but Labour members cannot even get their act together to agree with each other on the budget, let alone with anybody .Rowleyrsquos solo intervention caused anger in the Labour group at Holyrood and the bitterness lingers.Another senior party figure said: ldquoWe need real action from Richard Leonard before Rowley causes further embarrassment.

months, following a fire in the old building back in .Temporary accommodation on site was made for the nursery children.The new library space at Kinellar SchoolThe new school is built on the same site as its predecessor. As part of the build, the project team used the opportunity to improve facilities in the village by redeveloping a derelict tennis court and constructing an enclosed children’s play park as well as additional parking for use by the school and local community.The school’s social staircase is already becoming a well-used architectural feature alongside its many other bright and airy flexible learning spaces, including the glass fronted library and learning area upstairs.Its teaching wings benefit from cleverly designed acoustics, modern set up and technology offerings in all  classrooms, and are on two levels, with lightwells connecting them.Specially commissioned artwork is also an important feature of the new school.Local artists worked with pupils to design and create a number of pieces, including a large Oak tree in the dining area symbolizing growth with leaves painted by every child.  Aberdeenshire Provost Bill Howatson said: “A great team effort has led to the delivery of an extremely high quality building on time and on budget, and we’re thankful to everyone who has played their part in that. data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Erasums students question what will happen after Brexit\"  What is the future for Erasmus students after Brexit  viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"“It stands testament to what a community can achieve by working together, right from those dark early days after the fire when local people rallied round to offer soup and sandwiches to staff, to the lovely reception pupils received from the community in Kintore.”Chair of Education and Children’s Services Committee, Councillor Gillian Owen said: “It’s not only wonderful to see the pupils at Kinellar enjoying their new school but also to reflect on what a fantastic learning experience this project has given them. In addition to the educational opportunities – working with artists, the community and the construction team – the pupils have also learned important lessons when it comes to being resilient and flexible.”Head Teacher Pamela Farquhar added: “As much as we loved our time at Kintore it is nice to be back home.“The new school was made possible thanks to Anne Gibson who sold her land to Aberdeenshire Council.“Her husband was a former head teacher here so the school has a special place in her heart.”"},{"url":null,"title":"inspectors praise north east nursery","story":"Education inspectors have expressed confidence in the ongoing improvements being made at Rothienorman Pre-School Nursery.A recent visit led to the village hall facility being described as a “welcome and nurturing environment” and Inspectors said children were “happy, enthusiastic, and developing confidence”.Key strengths included a “dedicated team” which inspectors said have developed positive relationships and a “strong sense of community”.But the nursery has been asked to improve in certain areas, including increased use of national guidance to develop a “robust and rigorous approach to self-evaluation”. Inspectors said this will enable practitioners to identy what is working well and what needs to improve.They also want to see development of approaches to assessment and planning to help improve the quality of learning experiences and provide “greater depth and challenge” for all children.Improvements are also being sought in the development of practitioners’ knowledge and understanding of how to support children’s early language and mathematical thinking.Inspectors are confident that the setting has the capacity to continue to improve and will make no more visits in connection with this inspection.data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..!

He said some areas of the town, such as Shore Street and Upper Ormlie, had been designated as one-way streets some time ago but this had not been implemented. \"That needs to be corrected,\" he said at Tuesday nights meeting.Mr Potts and other community councillors felt something had to be done to address the issue of speeding and one suggestion was for more sleeping policemen to be installed in problem areas of Thurso.Councillor Rosie, who represents Thurso and Northwest Caithness on Highland Council, said what is needed is a transport review which can take a comprehensive look at the issue. \"We need a strategic look at the whole thing ndash something which covers transport management and pedestrians,\" he said.However, community councillor and former police officer Bert MacLeod urged caution. He said: \"You need to be careful you dont go overboard with this  mph limit. Modern cars can stop quicker than vehicles did in the past. We need to be sensible.\"Mr Potts claimed \"some of the driving in Thurso is abysmal\".Mr MacLeod replied: \"Why should you and I be affected because someone drives like an idiot \"He also pointed out there are problems with installing sleeping policemen on roads. New laws have been introduced as cars have been damaged by them, he said.\"It is not just a case of putting them down,\" stated Mr MacLeod.

We have been calling for more parking enforcement in Wick for a while now.\"High Street and Bridge Street are far too regularly packed with cars parked where they shouldnt be. Its an issue that has been raised time and time again by both drivers and pedestrians. Some people think they are above the rules and for too long theyve got away with it.\"He added: \"Under the current proposals Bridge Street and much of High Street will essentially become double yellows, meaning no parking at any time. This should also help stop the constant issue of people selfishly parking in areas like the Market Square.\"The parking bays there are intended only for those who are disabled badge holders but these rules are often ignored by people who just canrsquot be bothered walking.\"Councillor Sinclair said the order would give council officers the power to enforce parking restrictions once they receive the required training but, initially, existing enforcement staff would carry out the work.\"We should expect a much more regular presence than under the old system,\" he said. \"The discussions Irsquove had with the officer responsible for parking have been extremely encouraging.\"Having an enforcement officer in the town for regular and random visits is a great start butthe situation doesnrsquot improve we will still be pushing to get someone in this post locally to clamp down on rogue drivers.\"He explained that in Inverness several council employees have been trained to undertake parking enforcement duties as well as their day-to-day jobs. \"There is no reason why the same couldnrsquot be done up here. If these orders get the go-ahead, and I am confident they will, then I hope we will begin to see a dference in peoples behaviour.\"The Caithness civic leader, Councillor Willie Mackay, also backed the plan. \"It is a fantastic idea but it is the enforcement that is the key to the success of this,\" he said. \"If we can get enough staff trained up to act as traffic wardens ndash and I am pretty sure we can ndash then their presence will deter bad parking.\"Parking in the centre of Wick has been a contentious problem for some time and has often been raised by the local community council and others. If this is approved, it will make a massive dference to the town centre, although there will always be some motorists who will take a chance and park there.\"However, Councillor Mackay has misgivings about the extent of the restrictions planned for other parts of Wick.Sunday  Feb  : PM"},{"url":null,"title":"Prince Harry set to attend Mey games","story":"THE Mey Highland Games is going to ldquoput Caithness in the global spotlight, according to its organiser Captain Richard Otley, after Prince Harry announced he would attend the event this year.Rumours were re last year that Harry and his we Meghan would attend the special event which included para-athletes for the first time but when the royal retinue appeared at pm there was no sign of the couple.Capt Otley believes that the information released over the weekend to the media about Prince Harryrsquos attendance may have come from Buckingham Palace itself.

Following a fault investigation process, damage has been located to a section of the Pentland Firth East cable near the shore at Rackwick Bay, Hoy.“There is no impact to customer supplies on Orkney as a result of the fault and contingency measures are in place, including the potential operation of the backup power station at Kirkwall, supported by mobile generation sets, to ensure a safe and secure supply of electricity for customers.“SSEN is committed to ing the network to normal operation as soon as possible and has instigated a repair plan. Following the receipt of the necessary permissions from statutory authorities late last week, work to undertake a sectional cable replacement is now under way.#The statement added: #It is expected this work, which will be contingent on tidal flows and weather conditions, will be complete early next week, with the line re-energised shortly after.“As part of SSEN’s subsea cable inspection and replacement programme, a project to progress an end-to-end replacement of the Pentland Firth East distribution cable is already at an advanced stage of development, with cable installation and commissioning currently due to take place in autumn next year.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

In addition, D photogrammetry is taking place so that digital D models of the wreck can be produced. By using these techniques, in essence, the team is able to digitally bring HMS Royal Oak to the surface.Survey organiser and licence-holder Emily Turton said: “The wreck of HMS Royal Oak is the final resting place of  men and boys. As the most intact underwater dreadnought-era battleship, she has an architectural grandeur befitting of any national memorial. However, at the smaller end of the scale, artefacts pertaining to everyday le on board are scattered around the site, bringing home the human story of those lost. The site is peaceful, yet vibrant, and supports a thriving marine eco-system. It is both an honour and a privilege to get to know the site.”Full details and further pictures in The Orcadian this week.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The planning application also covers landscaping and future restoration of the site.The application process is being handled by consultants AECOM.The council-owned quarry currently supplies stone and aggregate materials for Council roads and building projects as well as the local construction industry.  It extracts Devonian Flagstone which is highly suited to a range of crushed aggregate products, in particular as roadstone and aggregates, used for producing asphalt for road construction and maintenance, with the quarry being the only active producer of asphalt in Orkney.The activity at the quarry generates an income for the Council which is reinvested to provide and protect some of the vital services we provide in Orkney.The current quarry area is heading towards the end of its use and an expansion would safeguard supply of materials. Current output ranges between , and , tonnes of rock per year andapproved, the ha expansion will release approximately  million tonnes of additional resources, sufficient for another  years of production.Full details are available on the Council website at http:www.orkney.gov.uk Council C long-term-development-of-cursiter-quarry-in-firth.htmPersons wishing to provide comments on the proposed development can do so by writing to AECOM at fraser.blackwood@aecom or by post to Fraser Blackwood, APEX ,  Haymarket Terrace, Edinburgh, EH HD by  February .OIC says that, at this stage, comments made to Aecom are for the purposes of assisting with the scheme design and EIA process and as such are not representations to the Planning Authority.

We would like to thank everybody for the great support locally.”The house was originally built in  for Eilidh#s great grandfather Samuel Campbell, and for many years it operated as a temperance hotel.Fire ravaged the building in the s and, although part of the domestic side was occupied up until around  years ago, it has since lain dormant.Councillors on the review body said the couple deserved sympathy and support in their vision to restore a building which had been in Mrs Mcniven#s family for four generations.The couple#s supporting statement before planners said: “It is important to remember that this is a property that has been in the same family for  years and is about to become a new home for a young local family. The historic value of the property is not lost on them. However without intervention it may very well be lost entirely.”Dingwall councillor Margaret Paterson said she thought it “sad” that obstacles had been placed in the way of a couple who proposed to put so much into a building that was “almost falling down”.Lochalsh councillor Biz Campbell and Raymond Bremner, who represents Wick and East Caithness, also spoke in support of the couple#s plans.Councillor Bremner said he believed the aluminium window frames, as proposed for the development, had changed considerably from previous types which did not stand up well to spray from seawater.He added: “I have a lot of sympathy with the applicants and with the points made in their appeal. I don#t have an issue with the change of use.”Broadford and Strath Community Council had lobbied in support of the couple, while neighbours and local businesses also backed the proposed conversion.Community council chairman Hamish Fraser said: “They are proposing to restore a building that will become an asset to the community. It#s a common-sense decision to support a young couple who want to live and make a business here.”Planning officials had turned down the original application on the grounds that it had breached three policies of the Highland-wide local development plan.In their reason for refusal planners said modern windows and a door with patterns “is not in keeping with the character of a historic building”.In his letter of support of the couple, local historian and broadcaster Professor Norman Macdonald said: “In many years of regularly attending Highland Council planning committee meetings at all levels I do not recall a single application where a big and ambitious idea has come to the brink of jeopardy over such relatively immaterial and tangential matters.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/15_9_21-Barcelona-by-Xavier-Mercade-5-Copy.jpg","title":"the waterboys set to kick off skye live festival","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineLegendary Scottish-Irish folk-rock band The Waterboys are to kick-off the Skye Live festival’s fth-anniversary celebrations this autumn.The opening concert in Portree on Thursday th September will see the bandto Skye for the first time in nearly  years.

An entrepreneur and pioneer in his field, Sir William, despite his worldwide success, has never forgotten his strong ties to Ballymena.“His vision and dedication has put our borough firmly on the map as an area of manufacturing excellence and innovation.”Mid and East Antrim Borough Council agreed to bestow the Honorary Freedom of the Borough of Mid and East Antrim on the Wrightbus founder in February . It followed a motion proposed by the previous Mayor, Councillor Paul Reid, and seconded by Councillor Audrey Wales MBE.Among those who paid special tributes to Sir William was former Mayor of Ballymena, P.J. McAvoy, who, as a long standing SDLP representative was poles apart on constitutional issues from the ardent unionist. On Friday, however, he told the audience of the personal bond that had grown between the pair during their service on Council.“I well remember Sir William giving me a lt in that great big car of his many times when going or coming from council meetings! “I’m happy to be here today to pay tribute to the man I call my friend,” he said. Further tributes came from North Antrim MP, Ian Paisley who remarked on Sir William’s political activism at a time when many in the business community ‘kept their heads below the parapet’. And he recalled nights in the harsh days of the troubles when his late father would receive ‘phone calls from the man he codenamed ‘Ahoghill’. Mr. Paisley said Sir William was a rare breed in today’s society: “He is a character. If anyone wants to see what makes a real Ballymena man they need only look at Sir William Wright.” Lauren Christie, speaking on behalf of the extended Wright family, thanked all who attended for the honour conferred on her grandfather and paid special tribute to Mrs. Ruby Wright, who, she described as ‘the great woman behind the great man’.

I was born in , my family have been resident in Ballymena for generations, Allen, obviously, on my fathers side and Gribben on my mothers. My parents moved into the Demesne Estate shortly after it was built, first living in Carnduff Drive and then after a few years moving to Glenshesk Drive where they lived the rest of their lives.  I attended Ballymena Boys Secondary School. Music lessons were pretty much a non event. Every exam time each student would be hauled up to the front of class to sing a song and was awarded a C grade. My standout memory of music lessons was hearing the music teacher playing an album of Holsts Planet Suite to himself, this at least started a le long love of classical music.  In my early teens Glam rock was the big thing but apart from Bowie, T Rex, Rod Stewart etc I seldom listened to the charts.  I was more into album bands like Cream, Taste, Hendrix, early Fleetwood Mac, Pink Floyd and especially Led Zeppelin. Of course I followed the usual links from these back through Willie Dixon, Muddy Waters, Howlin Wolf to the Delta greats, Robert Johnson, Son House and Charley Patton.  First real early Blues album I heard was by Leadbelly and then Robert Johnson : The King of the Delta Blues , album which has been a major influence on my playing ever since.  I started playing bass guitar when I was about twelve then switched to six string. FLAMINGOMy first paying gig was at The Flamingo playing bass with local rockers Angel when I was fourteen.  After discovering the joys of Blues and Booze, I could be found many a night after closing time, sitting around a fire in the woods at the back of my old school, playing guitar and singing the Blues with friends.  Many Friday nights were passed in The Bridge, Dunloy listening to South Bound Train and most Saturdays were spent in The Pound or The Harp Bar in Belfast, catching as much live music as I could.  This was during the dark days of the Troubles, with bomb warnings and check points an everyday normality but somehow music lovers seemed to live in a world apart, music clubs being one of the few places religion didnt encroach on.  I have played in ious bands throughout the years, including Angel, AGS, Harpers Hill Blues Band, The Flood and BIDDY EARLY as well as playing as a solo Delta Blues player, playing slide guitar harmonica.  Lately I have seriously got into electric Blues Harp, being influenced by Sonny Boy Williamson ii, Little Walter, Paul Butterfield, John Myall, Walter Horton etc. I currently play Blues Harp with The Matchstick Men, Irelands premier Status Quo tribute act, and I also regularly sit in with Legal Tender and Blues Taxis. I can be found most first Saturdays of the month at the excellent BT Blues and Rock Club sitting in on Harp with the featured bands. For the last six years I have been host of BIDDY EARLYS Open Mic at the BT Club, one of the Provinces most successful Open Mics which I also founded. I have finally decided to call an end to it at the start of this year to concentrate on my own music.  I play ious instruments guitar,  string guitar, slide guitar, bass guitar, banjo, mandolin, auto harp, Appalachian mountain dulcimer and of course Blues Harp.  Yeah, after all these years, Ive still got the Blues, once your hooked, thats it for le! - see BB King, John Lee Hooker, Buddy Guy etc.  As for other local promoters of the Blues, theres the afore mentioned BT Blues Club which Looi Burns has been doing an excellent job of running for many years and of course local bands like Legal Tender and Blues Taxis.

And back in the hungry s when every day was a grind to put the most basic grub on the table and keep a roof over your head, it was women like the lady opposite who you relied on to get you to your work on time.Our pictures show one of the last of the ‘knocker-uppers’ who rose well before the crack of dawn every day in le to go round the doors to give people their morning alarm call.Known as ‘The Lady With The Map’, Mary Millar plied her trade in Kells and Connor.A knocker-up was a job in Britain and Ireland that started during and lasted well into the Industrial Revolution, when alarm clocks were neither cheap nor reliable.Most had given up the role by the begnning of the s but Mary was still performing her morning task up until the outbreak of World War .  The knocker-up used a baton or short, heavy stick to knock on the clients doors or a long and light stick, often made of bamboo, to reach windows on higher floors. At least one of them used a pea-shooter!In , the knocker-up would be paid a few pence a week. The knocker-up would not leave a clients window until they were sure that the client had been awoken.A knocker upper would also use a snuffer outer as a tool to rouse the sleeping. This implement was used to put out gas lamps which were lit at dusk and then needed to be extinguished at dawn.There were large numbers of people carrying out the job, especially in larger industrial towns. Generally the job was done by elderly men and women but sometimes police constables supplemented their pay by performing the task during early morning patrols.The pictures, re-discovered by areporter on a research task at the Local Studies Department of Ballymena Library appeared in the Belfast Newsletter in January of .

Redmondshows Halax representatives Alan McLachlan and Gillian Boyd around the charitys new social enterprise shop, Wings n Things.“Mrs McFadden would have done a lot of work for charity within our town and in the local community so we really have brought that sense of community back in here,” Ms Redmond explained.Over the past six months charity staff and volunteers have been busy turning the run down pub building into a vibrant community hub which now houses a food parcel distribution project, a catering and education programme for vulnerable adults and those with learning dficulties and a senior citizens’ lunch club. Via Wings at Wellington House also provides space for after schools and parent and toddler groups, a monthly supper club and games nights, as well as volunteer and employment opportunities for many isolated and vulnerable members of the local community.Yesterday the charity held a special event to mark the opening of its new shop Wings ‘n’ Things, which will sell shabby chic and new craft items made by local crafters.Among the guests at the celebration were representatives from the Halax Foundation, which has provided funding for Via Wings to help it expand its Dare  Care project, which distributes food parcels to people in need.Thanking the Halax Foundation for providing £, towards the salary of a project manager, Ms Redmond said: “Their funding has enabled us to run the project much more efficiently because it has grown from a cupboard-sized project into a three-centred project.“We now provide food parcels to around  families every month, which averages out at about  people.To move or not to move  That is the Brexit question Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"“As the number of people using our foodstore increases month-on-month the manager’s role is essential and the funding from the Halax Foundation ensures that we can continue to expand and develop the foodstore.”Gillian Boyd, trustee of the Halax Foundation NI, commented: “The Halax Foundation for Northern Ireland is delighted to support the important work of Via Wings. This particular award will enable the organisation to help those who are most vulnerable in their local community. We wish them every success in the future.”So far half of the old pub building has been renovated and Via Wings at Wellington House now boasts new offices, counselling rooms and a conference room. But that’s not the end of the redevelopment work.The charity is in the process of constructing a new coffee shop with a sensory garden and play area, which should be open within the next few months. And it also has long-term plans to redevelop another section of the building and create a wellbeing centre.“The wellbeing centre is going to be phase four,” Ms Redmond continued. “It would be our passion to have it up and running by the end of the year, but that will depend on fundraising and securing the necessary funding.“We hope the centre will help people – men and women – learn to live with their mental health. We want to provide things like reflexology, aromatherapy, breathing techniques, helping people learn about self care.”Praising the charity’s staff and volunteers for their dedication and hard work, she added: “Without them we couldn’t run this project. We have a team here that have a passion to serve this community, to walk in unity with them and see change happen.”• About the charity and its work...Founded in  by Gail Redmond, Via Wings was set up to help people in need in Dromore and surrounding areas.The faith-based charity’s aim “is to show God’s love in a loving, caring, practical, non-judgemental way.”It runs a range of projects designed to tackle problems such as poverty, loneliness, isolation, deprivation and more.

At only four-days-old Dáithí travelled to London where he underwent open heart surgery. Six days after that he underwent his second open heart operation.Máirtín described the stay as a “hard week” for his family and told the Andersonstown News that although Dáithí’s hearthasn’t declined, there had been slight damage done to his kidneys due to the high dosage of medicine the Ballymurphy toddler has to take.“It was a hard week for Dáithí, it was a hard week for us as well,” explained Máirtín. “There were constant needles, test after test for Dáithí but we got through it. The staff were amazing and the cardiologist seemed happy with Dáithí’s heartbut noticed some kidney damage.“Dáithí takes medicine for his heart, to help him go to the toilet he takes aspirin, around  doses of medicine in total a week. The hospital will be keeping an eye on it. Dáithi’s heartis okay at the minute and he is stable.“I know I speak for Seph and I when I say it was tough for us. When we first went over last year we have been educating ourselves ever since around organ donation and it’s got a lot more real. We were speaking to the surgeon who is going to be taking Dáithi’s heart out and eventually putting in a new one hopefully, it’s a lot more real,” he saidSince the family’s ‘Is Deontóír Mé Yes I Donate’ campaign began back in July, launched by Lord Mayor Deirdre Hargey, there has been an increase of four per cent in the number ofpeople in the north who have opted into the organ donation register.Máirtín stressed how transplant is not a cure, but a last resort when all other options have been exhausted.“Seph and I came back from Newcastle saying we had to up the campaign, we have to keep raising awareness. When we were over we had to sign consent forms for the heart surgery for when Dáithí receives his gt, for the surgery to go ahead. You are basically siging a consent form with a list of risks and the first thing that it states is ‘death’ in capital letters and that’s jumping out of the page.“I did a radio interview this week and we were asked ‘so you are basically waiting for someone to die’ so that Dáithí can receive his gt – I said my son is dying, that’s the reality of it. We are desperate to help save his le and truly believe that awareness is key.”“Dáithí had his tube out for three months there and people thought he was fixed because he looks so well, people don’t always think he is sick.”An avid Paw Patrol and Liverpool FC fan, Máirtín and Seph spoke of how their son will continue to wait on the routine list. “He is stable enough to be at home,” explained Seph. “We asked the medical team over in Newcastle what are his chances of getting a heart on the routine list and there was little to none. It’s not impossible but it doesn’t happen that often. There are quite a few children around Dáithí’s weight and age that are unfortunately on the urgent list. We want to be at this stage because it means we are getting more time.”“You don’t want him to get worse but he is going to get worse,” added Máirtín. “While organ donation as a whole is up, hearts for children are down the last two years and that list is going up. As I said transplant is not a cure, transplant give you time. Everybody is dferent the first transplant baby in the UK is now in her ’s. The anxiety that Seph and I have will probably never go away. The last two years have been some of the best and worst times of our lives. We love Dáithí so much and will do anything to get as much time with him as possible.“We have put down hurdles, the first was getting to Newcastle, the second was getting Dáithí assessed, the third was getting him accepted onto the organ list and the next one is getting him a new heart. There will be lots after that but we’ve been taken it one wee step at a time. We would rather be on that rocky road than no road at all,” he said.A family health morning will take place on Saturday February  from -pm as part of Heart Awarnesss month at Glór na Móna.To register to become an organ donor visit: www.organdonation.nhs.uk register-to-donate register-your-details "},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"catherine mcevoy to be named musician of the year","story":"FOR anyone who is familiar with Catherine McEvoy’s music it will come as no surprise to learn that she is to receive the Musician of the Year accolade at the upcoming TG Gradam Ceoil  in Belfast’s Waterfront Hall. As one of the leading concert flautists in Irish traditional music, recording success, TV and radio appearances and a considerable teaching contribution has marked her distinguished career. While Catherine is no stranger to critical acclaim, she says that she was “completely shocked” by the announcement of the award, which comes at a time in her le when she least expected it.Over the last  years Catherine has balanced her own music career alongside a teaching career at St Joseph’s School for Children with Visual Impairment and ChildVision in Dublin. By providing lessons and music therapies to students with multiple disabilities and visual impairment, she gives children a  for their talents and helps equip them with skills to improve their quality of le. The positive impact of Catherine’s work is undeniable but, admittedly, it allows her little time for her own music. Despite being a professional Catherine says she deals with her hectic schedule by treating her own music as a hobby.“I wouldn’t have loads of time for my own music, but I was never a full-time musician,” she explains.“Music was always a hobby for me. I would do some teaching at home, and I would do the Willie Clancy Summer School, and I would do some stuff in the States too. The funny thing about the trips away is that they’re almost like a holiday. “When you’re a professional musician you are under a certain amount of pressure all the time, but I’m lucky in the sense that I’m not because I still play my music in the way I want to play it – it’s something that I’ve always done and I love doing it. It’s still a hobby for me even though it takes up most of my le. I’d love to do a lot more playing for myself than I am, but sometimes work can get in the way.”In her family le, Catherine is also surrounded by music. Her husband Tom also plays the flute, while her three grown-up children, Jane, Ruairi and Fergus are accomplished musicians in their own right, but surprisingly, having grown up in Birmingham, Catherine says she herself hadn’t heard Irish traditional music until she was -years-old. However, it was in those musically formative years in the city that followed that she picked up the distinctive traditional music style of her parents’ native Roscommon, which she would become renowned for in the years to come.“My dad was more into football and my mum was a good ballad singer, she would’ve sang at parties and that,” she says.“I remember listening to Elvis and Clf Richards – we had those sort of records in the house when we were very very young, but not particularly traditional music. “It was only later when I was around eleven that I heard traditional music. I thought ‘oh, I like it’. Then my brother was away in boarding school learning classical fiddle and then he got into The Dubliners and started buying their records. That’s when the whole thing took off. “There was a prolic music scene in Birmingham, as there was in London, but it doesn’t get such a high profile. A lot of the big musicians gravitated towards London, but there was still a lot of great musicians in Birmingham, many of them from Roscommon, and there was lot of great musicians passing through. “Funnily enough I heard an interview with Finbar Furey recently where he was talking about playing in folk club in Birmingham run by a man called Mick Hipkiss – the Skillet Pop Club, and we actually used to play there. I remember seeing Finbar play there, and Christy Moore. I also remember the night when Mick Hipkiss announced this new group that had just been formed and were getting on the road called Planxty – that was back in the early s.”She continued: “A lot of County Roscommon players would travel to Birmingham. One of the first lady flute players I saw play was a woman called Peggy McGrath from County Roscommon and I was really taken with her style – that really spurred me on as well.“The Roscommon style, or the Sligo-Roscommon style, is a rhythmical, flowing sort of style as opposed to what they would call the Northern style,” she explains.“It’s slightly smoother and quite up-tempo. It’s something that I inherited. I wasn’t that I consciously decided to play in that style, it’s just because that was the flute playing that I heard. I’m self-taught and what you hear is what you learn.”Although Catherine says she inherited the Sligo-Roscommon style, she has made it her own indelible skill and fluency. Her recognition as the TG Gradam Ceoil  Musician of the Year undoubtedly encompasses a le-time of achievement, but having picked up a serious injury in her hand just over two years ago, she says it comes following a particularly low part of her career. While her musical ability has suffered as result of her injury, in some ways, the award could not have come at a better time.“Two years ago I had aspontaneous rupture in my right hand in part of my tendon, so I’m very lucky that I can still play,” Catherine says.“It took a lot to get over that I initially thought I wouldn’t be able to play again. I’ve actually had to change my hold on the flute slightly. Obviously the older you get the harder it is to recover, but it has taken a lot of mental anguish to get back to level of playing that I would be happy with. I’m probably only back to about  per cent – I’ll never be  per cent, which is sad in away because I had this idea of retiring and going off into the sunset playing for the rest of my le. I had just gotten over it, and then they go and give me a Gradam Ceoil.”She continued: “It was the biggest shock I ever got in my le. It was massive boost, especially coming from a very low part of my le two or three years ago and sort of clawing my way back. “There are probably loads of other people out there who deserve it, but it’s a great thing and I’m really honoured. I’m delighted and to get an award for something that you’ve been doing for most of your le, something that you get pleasure out of doing, is a great bonus.”She adds: “It’ll be wonderful. It does come with a certain amount of pressure because it’s live TV. I’m the type of person who doesn’t really know how to handle the limelight, but I suppose a lot of Irish people are like that. But it is great, and I’ve had so much good will, which sometimes you don’t realise because you live in a bubble where you think people aren’t thinking about you and then you are showered with all of this good will. That’s nice, and the traditional music community are great.” Gradam recipients, who represent the crème de la crème of traditional music and song, will be joined in live performances on stage by their own special musical guests, including Irish fiddler Paddy Glackin, Michael McCague and multi-instrumentalist Sinéad Egan, to name but a few. A range of VIP guest presenters will also take to the stage last year, actor Stephen Rea and President Michael D. Higgins were amongst the VIP guests at the event.Tickets for the February th TG Gradam Ceoil Awards , priced from £., are available from www.waterfront or +  ."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"reflecting on pat finucanes legacy","story":"A SPECIAL event to reflect on the le and legacy of Pat Finucane is to be held at StMary’s University College on Sunday.Organised by Féile an Phobail, the event is being held to mark the upcoming th anniversary of the prominent human rights lawyer, who was murdered by British state-backed loyalist death squad in his home on February , .Mr Finucane’s son, John Finucane, who is also a solicitor, will be joined by Gerry Adams as they reflect on the legacy of his father’s death and work.Speaking ahead of Sunday’s event, John said it will also offer a chance to share personal memories of his father, who he fondly remembers as a fun-loving “messer”.“It was just before my ninth birthday when he was killed, but I always remember kicking a ball with him,” he said.“He was a good soccer player and would have played at a fairly good level in the Irish League and Amateur League. People still talk about him, and I don’t think there is that much rose-tinted glasses, as there can be when people aren’t about any more, but he was a very successful forward and good goal-scorer, and I remember kicking a ball with him in the back garden and going to games with him.“I remember the house being very busy with phonecalls and taking messages. I also remember going on holidays – we used to go camping every summer – so I have all of those good memories.”He continued: “He was a messer. He would have wound me up, he would have wound my brother and my sister up, and he would have been good fun about the house.“The older I get the more I appreciate it more from doing this type of job – although he would have been doing it in a dferent context than me – but I imagine that it would have brought a lot stress and challenges and I suppose going back to the house and winding the kids up and having a bit of craic was a way to unwind.”John was present with the rest of his family when loyalist gunmen broke into their Fortwilliam Drive home and murdered his father as they sat down to Sunday dinner. The “brutal” murder is still “very clear” to him as it changed his family’s lives forever. The proceeding years would be marked by the campaign for justice as they took on the British state.“I don’t even think I appreciate how taxing the campaign has been,” John admits.“My le growing up has been in the context of making allegations of collusion against the state in a time, from the early s onwards where the word collusion was a dirty word you were a republican propagandist. That was my normality.“It has taken me until my later years to appreciate that my mother was raising three kids, she was going to work and getting children up to get them ready for school, getting breakfast lunch and dinner ready – doing all of that having lost her husband. It has taken me a few years to realise the impact that it had on her, and that makes me appreciate and admire her a lot more than I already did.”Pat Finucane’s case is still under review by The Supreme Court as his family continue to fight for an inquiry. Asked about the signicance of the campaign for other victims of state violence, John said: “Something we have said from the very beginning of our campaign is that this apparatus and this policy that the British state had, which resulted in the deaths and the murders of so many people here, wasn’t just about Pat Finucane. They didn’t set this up just to kill my dad they killed people before him and they killed people after him.“I think it has been an example of what you can achieveyou are persistent and you have that support around you. We weren’t just a family, we had the support of NGOs, we had the support of investigative journalists, we had the support of governments and politicians. Whilst it hasn’t delivered in an inquiry, it has resulted in the word collusion having a very dferent context – people now accept that it happened and there is no longer a ‘few rotten apples in the barrel theory’ and it is no longer ‘republican propaganda’.”He continued: “The support that people have given us over the years, it’s very hard to put that into words. Whether it’s people talking about their memories of my father, people having encouraging words about our campaign, or attending events like this one in St Mary’s, it really provides us so much support.“It’s very humbling and we have always been grateful and we will remain truly grateful for that. My father came from a community that had very little and he wanted to use his education to make people’s lives much better, so for people to come out to remember and pay tribute to him means an awful lot to me and my family.”Sunday’s event will be held at pm in St Mary’s University College, Falls Road."},{"url":null,"title":"catholics to be majority of workforce in northern ireland for first time in 2020 new","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsSix NationsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

However, unionist councillors voted down the motion, which would also have resulted in a council presence at the annual Belfast Pride Parade in August. Members of the DUP and Ulster Unionists rejected the plan and said they would not be taking lectures on equality from Sinn Fein. Last August, Sinn Fein spearheaded an attempt to fly rainbow flags on the councils premises to show support to LGBTQ+ citizens during Pride.Armagh, Banbridge and Craigavon was set to make history by becoming the first council in Northern Ireland to fly the Pride flag above its three civic buildings.But the DUP invoked the call-in mechanism, which allows decisions to be reconsideredat least % of councillors request it.The DUP said strict procedures on flying flags and emblems hadnt been followed properly.The council then sought legal advice, which both the DUP and Sinn Fein claimed justied their stance. The row meant Pride Day last August passed without the flags in place. People taking part in the Belfast Pride parade set off from Custom House Square in central Belfast. Michael Cooper PA WireSinn Fein council group leader Darren McNally told the Ulster Gazette newspaper it was disappointing but not surprising that both unionist parties had voted against lighting up the civic buildings. He said: \"We have a erse community and the onus is on us to ensure we not only represent minority groups such as our LGBT community but that we make them feel valued, included, welcome and safe. \"Lighting up the civic buildings on Pride Day and an official presence at the parade is a forward-moving gesture - small but signicant - which would send out a clear message that ABC council are here for our LGBT community at a time when they are subject to hate attacks and left feeling isolated. \"In amending our original motion of the flying of the Pride flag, we were recognising that some parties are on a journey with regards to this particular issue. Other unionist councillors have supported similar motions in other councils.\"However, UUP councillor Jim Speers hit out at what he called the \"mischievous\" motion. He said: \"Sinn Feins actions go counter to the good working relationships we need at ABC Council. \"They are the last party that should be giving lectures on the need for equality. For a party which was linked to an organisation which terrorised this community for over  years to be talking about equality is disgusting.\"The DUPs Gareth Wilson accused Sinn Fein of \"blatant electioneering\". He added: \"Given the ious and well publicised anti-DUP messages associated with the event in question, our party grouping decided unanimously to decline support for this latest Sinn Fein motion.\" "},{"url":null,"title":"labour plan to force may to put her brexit plan to decisive vote","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsSix NationsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

a second Commons showdown on her Brexit deal by the end of the month..pushShadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer said Labour will use a Commons amendment to require the Prime Minister to hold another “meaningful vote” on her deal by February .The move is in response to fears that Mrs May is engaged in a “cynical” attempt to run down the clock before the March  Brexit date in order to leave MPs with a stark choice of accepting her deal or crashing out of the European Union without any agreement.If no deal on the changes to the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement has been reached with Brussels by Wednesday, as seems overwhelmingly likely, Mrs May will address MPs on progress made, say more time is needed for negotiations, and table a “neutral motion” for debate the following day.Sir Keir’s new deadline is expected to be one of a range of amendments tabled for votes on Valentine’s Day.The PM is promising another “meaningful vote” in the coming weeks but Labour will seek to take the decision out of her hands.“We have got to put a hard stop into this running down the clock,” Sir Keir told the Sunday Times. “And that’s what we want to do this week.”He believes the Prime Minister is “pretending to make progress” but actually intends toto Parliament after the March   European Council summit the week before Brexit and offer MPs a “binary choice” – her deal or no deal.“We can’t allow that to happen,” Sir Keir said. “There needs to be a day when Parliament says that’s it, enough is enough.”In the interview Sir Keir described Mrs May’s approach as “reckless” and “blinkered” and blamed her “tunnel vision” for the devastating defeat suffered  last month when MPs threw out her Brexit deal by a record  votes.“It’s this blinkered approach that’s got us to where we are, with her never wanting to see where the real majority is in Parliament,” Sir Keir said.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, who has written to the Prime Minister setting out his demands for a Brexit deal he could support, accused Mrs May of an “utterly cynical” approach.In his letter to Mrs May, the Labour leader set out five demands, including a permanent customs union and close alignment with the single market.The move led to a backlash from pro-EU Labour MPs, but Sir Keir defended the approach and warned against a split in the party.“When you go through something like Brexit, it is very important that you keep the opposition strong and united,” he said.“We have to keep it together, because in the end, any chance of effective opposition goesan opposition party starts to lose members from their team.”Treasury Chief Secretary Liz Truss refused to rule out quittingMrs May did accept the demand for a customs union.She told Sky News’ Sophy Ridge On Sunday: “I appreciate Jeremy Corbyn has come to the table but the reality is what he is proposing does not deliver on what we want as a country.”Ms Truss said the UK must have an “independent trade policy” and questioned whether a customs union could command a majority in Parliament.Askedshe could stay in officethe Government backed a customs union she said: “I absolutely do not think that should be our policy.”Ms Truss also rejected calls for Brexit to be delayed to allow further time for negotiations.“As the deadline approaches, minds get focused and a deal gets done,” she said.“I think by extending the deadline that doesn’t create any new information, all that does is delay things and I think that would be a very bad idea.”"},{"url":null,"title":"golden age of youtube replaced by darkness youtuber joey graceffa","story":" Hi

These standard quality checks are carried out every three months, in line with UK best practice.The Western Trust said it immediately set up a review team, alerted the Public Health Agency and Department of Health and initiated the review process.  As a result of the review, a total of  women have been asked to arrange repeat smear test with their GP.Of the  women affected,  of them are from the Western Trust area,  women from the Belfast and South Eastern Trust areas and  women from the Republic of Ireland.Dr Dermot Hughes, Medical Director of the Western Trust, said: “The women affected will have received letters inviting them to contact their GP to arrange a repeat smear test. This does not necessarily mean that the results of their initial test were wrong the repeat test is a precautionary measure to provide reassurance that all women are being followed up appropriately.“I understand that this may cause worry and inconvenience for the women affected and I sincerely apologise for this. I would like to reassure everyone that the samples that were reviewed were a small percentage of those screened and reported between April  and June .“The stringent quality checks that are in place have reassured us that it was only a certain number of tests within this timeframe that were required to be re-examined.” ‘Le-saving’Sinn Féin Councillor Caoimhe McKnight has said her party has requested an urgent meeting with the Western Trust.The Derry councillor recently encouraged local women to have regular Smear Tests as she reflected on her own experience with the “le-saving” procedure.Cllr. McKnight said: “I can speak from experience when I say that a Smear Test could literally save your le.  When living in Scotland at the age of , which is the age there at which you are eligible for a smear, I received the notication of my eligibility and advised to avail of it.“But like many young women I put it off for a couple of months before finally going for the test.  When I tell you how grateful I am that I made the decision to have the test it is no exaggeration.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh“It was luckythat I made the decision to have the test as they found abnormal cells.  I dread to think what I may have been toldI had to wait until the age of  before being tested.“After treatment and a few yearly smears everything is now fine and I am now in the normal  year test cycle.”She said it will be a “distressing” time for the women recalled but urged them all to contact their GPs to schedule a repeat smear test as soon as possible.\"While the Western Trust have said that this is a precautionary measure it will still cause concern and worry so it is important the affected women do not face undue delay in receiving a repeat test.\"In June ,  women in Belfast and Newtownabbey were also invited to attend for repeat smear test after the Public Health Agency were made aware of concerns identied in April that year.\"As I understand it, the Western Trust’s review of cervical smear tests concerned those in April and June , but it is not clearthere is a connection with what happened in Belfast and Newtownabbey in June and this recent action by the Western Trust.\"Sinn Féin have requested an urgent meeting with the Western Trust and we will be raising these concerns directly with them,\" she added.‘Mistakes’Meanwhile, SDLP councillor Angela Dobbins told women to call the Western Trust helpline, to allay any concerns.Cllr Dobbins commented: “This is not the first time mistakes have been made in regards to cervical screening laboratories lessons should and must be learnt from issues both in the South and in England.“Undoubtedly this recall will be a cause of concern for many women. However, I must stress the fact that only a fraction of those tested between April to June  were affected and will receive letters this week to arrange a repeat test with their GP.“This does not necessarily indicate that initial results were incorrect, rather the recall is a precautionary measure intended to allay concerns.”The Western Trust has advised the affected women thatthey have any concerns or want further information, they should contact the Western Trust’s Laboratory Department on   , from Tuesday  February to Wednesday  February between am to

Hannaway reflected upon the organisationrsquos work over the past year during the annual rates meeting.He said the organisation continued to deliver on both the services and key projects that were agreed in its current four-year corporate plan which ends in , working to improve the local authorityrsquos recycling rates, both for blue and brown bin collections, reducing the amount of waste going to landfill by %.Mr Hannaway said the council was also delighted to open the new poundm Down Leisure Centre which he described as a ldquosignature project that will make a real contribution to improving citizensrsquo health and wellbeing.ldquoWe are even more ambitious for the coming year, with the agreement on funding for the Belfast Region City Deal, we have plans for a new conference and theatre facility in Newry City, the delivery of the Southern Relief Road and a -year programme of economic growth, the chief executive continued.ldquoThe reopening of the Warrenpoint Municipal Park in August and the opening of the Carlingford Lough Greenway from Newry to Victoria Lock in July demonstrate our councilrsquos commitment to improving our arearsquos attractions and environment.Mr Hannaway said that in the coming year Newry and its Cathedral Corridor would see pound, for improvements, festive lighting and events, to building on what has already been achieved in these locations.His focus also turned to Brexit, explaining that as the March  deadline for leaving edges ever closer, the councilrsquos relationships with government departments, the EU, cross border bodies and institutions across Ireland and Britain will become even more important as it seeks to improve the district.ldquoThese partnerships will remain a priority for the coming year as we deliver initiatives, programmes and services for all the people living, working and investing in our district, he continued.ldquoSome of the projects that will be progressed during the   year include further revitalisation of Warrenpoint, with pound, for town improvements, including shop fronts, new signage and a promotional and marketing campaign.ldquoThe council has also secured approval for the Ballynahinch bypass, a plan that will greatly improve access throughout the area and relieve the traffic congestion in the town centre.Mr Hannaway said plans for the southern relief road in Newry will be progressed after the preferred route was announced and was confident that developing a strategic link road between the A Dublin Road and the A Warrenpoint Road mdash a project that the council is working on with Stormont officials ndash will contribute to increasing the economy of the whole region.He said improving public services and the way they were implemented was another important goal for the council in the new financial year, revealing that five ambitious performance improvement objectives had been identied.They include encouraging healthy lestyles, improving economic growth and promoting the district as a premier tourist destination, delivering urban and rural regeneration initiatives, creating a cleaner, greener district, and encouraging and empowering local communities to work with the Council to deliver on its programmes.ldquoOver the coming months, the council will be working with local groups to ensure that their views on how best to implement these important goals, he confirmed.ldquoOver the coming year, the historic town of Downpatrick will benefit from a new public realm improvement scheme as part of the Masterplan which will be delivered in partnership with the Department for Communities and the Department for Infrastructure.Mr Hannaway said the district continued to benefit from EU funding, with pound.m being provided to South East Area Fisheries Local Action Group which promotes economic growth and job creation in coastal and inland communities.Under the PEACE IV programme pound.m had been allocated to the council to deliver the Local Authority Action PlanmdashBeyond Tolerance in the three key areas of children and young people, shared spaces and services, and building positive relationships.Projects funded under this initiative include an

the table to nine points when they condemned Killough to the also rans category at The Links, Strangford on Saturday.Killough, who have been forced go play their home games anywhere they can as the Mill Field undergoes further repairs, could easily have collected three points with a resolute second half display, but Ballynagross closed up shop after taking - lead at the end of the first half.Both sides settled quickly with the excellent playing surface encouraging players to keep the ball on the floor. It was Ballynagross, who didnrsquot seem to miss the suspended Matthew Rooney and Declan Dowie too much, that drew first blood in the fth minute.The dashing Eoin Rooney, who was making his first team debut following a recent move from Downpatrick FC, took full advantage of a failed offside call from Killough, sped past Stevie Laverty and beat new lsquokeeper Peter Kelly with a clinical finish.Killough retaliated immediately with Michael Burns, Gareth George and Tony McIhone prodding patiently from the middle of the park and when an opening came, Declan Looney, a team-mate of Eoin Rooney at Downpatrick not that long ago, put the burners on and rled a sweet equaliser past Conor McCullough, a former Killough lsquokeeper, from just inside the box.As expected from a derby clash, no quarter was asked or given and it took a few yellow cards to bring the combatants under control before Daniel Taggart popped up in the box to restore the visitorsrsquo lead with a poacherrsquos finish.Killough tried to get back on level terms with Freddie OrsquoConnor raiding down the flank and Ross Armstrong working overtime in a bid to create something of note. However, a Ballynagross back four of Conor Marron, John Shields, Aaron Beattie and Gary Carberry were in dominant form and they steadfastly refused to give way.Karl Gelstonrsquos side was more than happy to hit Killough on the break and midway through the first half, assassin Donal McCavera gave them a - lead as Killough were caught chasing the game.Killough had to throw caution to the wind and pulled a goal back just before the break when the dangerous McIlhoneexploded into le when he drilled in a beauty to give his side every chance of getting a result.The second half, although as equally as combative, never reached the dizzy heights of the first  minutes with two well-matched sides cancelling each other out in a midfield war of attrition.Chances were few and far between with the respective defences on top. Killough again did the chasing, but there was just no way past Carberry and Beattie and lsquokeeper McCullough did all that was asked of him.The longer the game went on, the deeper Ballynagross defended, but in the final analysis, Killough just didnrsquot have the necessary firepower to break them down.Killough: Peter Kelly, Colm Kearney, Stevie Laverty, Jason Clarke, Kevin Groves, Tony McIlhone, Michael Burns, Freddie OrsquoConnor, Declan Looney, Ross Armstrong, Gareth George.

He has a proud direct lineage to the band when it first started out  years ago. His great-uncle, James Strain of Woodgrange, was the bandrsquos first pipe major.He also has pipes dating back to the early days of the band, a much-prized piece of heritage along with the framed photographs of former pipe band members and lodge members which line the walls of the Orange Hall.James Strain was taught by the bandrsquos first piping instructor, William Maxwell from Newcastle, who used to travel by train to Tullymurry on the Ballydugan Road and then arrive by bicycle or horse and cart to the hall.Sammy, who joined the band when he was seven, says, as do other members, that his introduction into the pipe band world was a natural extension of his family le.ldquoIt was actually my cousin who taught me the pipes even though my father Sam was pipe major at the time, he said.ldquoI joined in  and played my first Twelfth in Newcastle in  when I was nine. At that time I was playing whatrsquos called a three-quarter set of pipes.ldquoI canrsquot remember being askedI wanted to join but as my great-grandfather was one of the first members, it was just in the family. It was just handed down, it was taken for granted, more or less, that you were going to learn the pipes.ldquoWhen we started out, there really was nothing  so the band was number one. Itrsquos dficult now to keep a band going with so many other things for the young ones to be doing, so how we managed to keep a band going  years, I do not know.From head to toe, it can cost from between pound to pound, to kit out an adult pipe band member in full unorm and around pound for child members.The unorm has always represented a major investment mdash in addition to practice and competition timemdash for any member.In his history of the band on its th anniversary, Sammy recounted the lower end of a quotation given for a new unorm in  coming in at  pounds  shillings, which is equivalent to around pound today.The retired farmer has been with the band during the worst and the best of times.ldquoWe went through a lean period in the late Eighties and we werenrsquot contesting then. We started contesting in  and then again about five or six years ago, he said.ldquoThe best time of the band I can recall was in  when I retired as pipe major. My cousin, Francey Strain, took the band over and as we had a lot of young ones then, those were the best years up until  where we went to the World Pipe Band Championships in Cowal and we were upgraded three times in that time.The best of times for Hollymount was when they came runners-up in their grade B at the World Championships on their first entry into the competition.Ronnie Steele recalls: ldquoWe were very nearly not going but decided at the last minute so it was a real rush to try and book the boat and to find somewhere for us all to stay.Hollymount achieved their biggest achievement to date on one of the blackest days in Northern Ireland history mdash the day of the Omagh bombing on August ,.While the band continued throughout the  years of the Troubles, it emerged unscathed, according to Ronnie, who adds: ldquoThrough all the Troubles we had never any bother down here we never missed anything out.Another strong family connection belongs to pipe major Sam Gill ndash whose maternal uncle is Sammy Strain. His two sons, Jackand seven year-old Charlie, are in the band. When the  year-old isnrsquot at the band or at work as a mechanic, he continues to perfect his skill as a former world ploughing champion and the winner of the NI title for  years.ldquoMy father, Raymond, played in the band as did my twin brother, David, who now plays for Drumlough Pipe Band.ldquoWhen I joined at the age of eight, it was just a matter in those days that after my father came home from work and got a bit of dinner, he would have say, rsquoRight, I take you up to the bandrsquo.ldquoSammy Strain taught me the notes on a blackboard whereas now you have the likes of Ronniersquos daughter, Christie, who records me on her phone playing and she practice.Ronnie shares his love of the band with daughters Christie , Ashleyand three year-old Megan. No doubt his youngest, one year-old Alexandra, will be drafted in a few years time.Piper Ryan Green, who used to play for the former Seaforde and Woodgrange Pipe Bands, has also introduced his  year-old son, Matthew, while piper Robert Neill plays alongside his  year-old daughter Laura.Sometimes the pull towards piping and Hollymount misses a generation. However, the family influence remains strong as in the case of siblings Jessica and Thomas Watson, whose great grandfather, David Stranney, was in the band, although their parents werenrsquot.But the members know that keeping the band going for the next generation is an even greater challenge today than it was  years ago.They are delighted that it currently has  members aged  and under in the band.Apart from marching in the annual Twelfth celebrations, the main activity for the band is performing at local concerts where it has raised more than pound, in recent years for charities.Sam Gill says that the next big push, once some of the younger members are ready for it, will be to start competing in contests again, although they know it may take some time to reach their former B grade.ldquoTherersquos still a hunger to try and get the band to be as good as possible. The problem we have mdash and any band will tell you the same mdash is trying to keep the young ones interested becauseyou donrsquot, they will leave, he added.ldquoBands like ours are often recruitment bands for other larger ones but we would dearly love to see more experienced band members joining Hollymount and passing on their experience to the next generation..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Contractors continue with leisure centre demolition  ","story":"WORK is progressing at pace to demolish the old Down Leisure Centre in Downpatrick.Contractors are razing the old building to the ground as its poundm replacement continues to break membership records, with additional staff drafted in to cope with the volume of people coming through the doors.Four decades after the old centre opened, it is being reduced to a pile of rubble as the soaraway success of its ultra-modern replacement continues, with users flocking in their droves and membership doubling within a week.The old centre was the first major leisure complex built in the district and was one of the most modern of its kind when the doors opened for business, boasting a new swimming pool and a suite of other facilities, including a large sports hall.Contractors in charge of the demolition began work shortly before Christmas and over the past few weeks have made signicant progress.The old sports hall has been razed to the ground with contractors currently using heavy equipment to demolish the old swimming pools and reception area.The old centre was a major community hub and in addition to meeting the districtrsquos leisure needs, the large hall hosted many community events including public rallies, former Down Council election counts, drama productions and even concerts featuring a host of local artists.While the centre had long since passed its sell-by-date, the former Down Council was keen to replace it and the work the local authority started was completed by its successor, Newry, Mourne and Down Council.The old centre closed for the final time at the end of November,  years after it opened.

We have more quality control on our beef and that is what makes it high grade. This leaves us in a very dficult position because we cannot produce our beef for any less than we already do.ldquoOur fear is that, in the event of a lsquono dealrsquo and there isnrsquot enough UK beef to satisfy demand, they will look at bringing in beef from outside of the UK. If itrsquos brought in at a cheaper price it could very well leave us in a tight spot.Mr Rice, whose family has been in farming for generations, continued: ldquoBeef and lamb have been subsidised by the EU indirectly in the form of Single Farm Payments. Dairy, pork and chicken are already at world prices and can already compete. They will not see such a big fluctuation whereas we will be more exposed.ldquoIf Prime Minister Teresa May were to step in and take over the subsidies, the outlook looks favourable in the short term.ldquoBut when a boat load of beef comes in from Brazil then almost certainly subsidies will be reduced and wersquoll be paid to maintain the landscape. In other words wersquoll be reduced to gardeners.Describing Brexit as the ldquobiggest peacetime emergency in almost a century, Ballynahinch farmer Barry Higgins said the uncertainty of the situation did not do farmers any favours.ldquoWe feel itrsquos more of a back lash than a back stop, he remarked, adding that he hoped no farmers would be forced out of business.Dessie Canavan, from Kilcoo, said farmers were being ldquodragged into Brexit against their will.ldquoIt is unfair for us to compete against the likes of Brazil and Argentina, he remarked. ldquoDepending on the size of our farm, sometimes we are forced out into part-time jobs to subsidise our income. And thatrsquos before Brexit comes into force. There is much to be concerned about.A spokesman for Downpatrick Co Operative Marketing Ltd said its role was to respect the views of all its shareholders and customers, who are farmers.He added: ldquoOur business relies solely on the trading of livestock both locally and outside Northern Ireland and we are therefore concerned about the impact Brexit will have on our daily business and the local faming community we serve.ldquoAs part of a democratic society we respect the peoplersquos vote to leave the EU, but we are also aware the majority of people in Northern Ireland voted to remain.ldquoWe now have a situation with two main options mdash either crash out or negotiate a deal to leave. Our main fear with the crash out option is that it exposes us all to a greater risk of casualties rather than survivors.ldquoOver the past  months Teresa May has been trying tirelessly to negotiate a Brexit deal with the EU that represents and respects all the people within the UK.The spokesman said: ldquoAll we ask is the same respect is given to any deal which identies and supports the uniqueness of trading and faming in Northern Ireland. Businesses and farmers are very good at adapting to change in whatever form it comes but at present, with no clear decision on Brexit, the ongoing development of any business has been affected.The Ulster Farmersrsquo Union is also concerned at the prospect of a lsquono dealrsquo Brexit UFU president Ivor Ferguson added: ldquoWe respect the referendum result and that the UK will leave the EU. However, the uncertainty is very damaging.ldquoWith March  less than  days away decisions need to be taken urgently and a deal agreed. Leaving the EU without a deal would be catastrophic for Northern Irelandrsquos farming families and their businesses.ldquoNo deal means high tarfs on our exports creating an effective trade embargo and the possibility of lower standard imports flooding the UK market.ldquoThese practical issues will have an immediate and profound impact on farmers, causing major disruptions to the supply chain, crippling the industry and rendering our farmers uncompetitive..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C February 6%2C 1979  ","story":"BALLYNAHINCH mdash A Ballynahinch headmaster hit out at the education authorities this week for the lack of permanent accommodation at his school where two thirds of the pupils are in wooden huts.Mr Harry Bent said St Colmanrsquos High School had been promised a major extension, but was unlikely to get it ldquoas long as comprehensive education is the policy of the Government.Speaking at the schoolrsquos annual prize day, Mr Bent said it angered him that the provision of accommodation had not kept pace with the growing numbers and successes of pupils.ldquoIn St Colmanrsquos nine temporary classrooms accommodate  pupils out of a total of , he said. ldquoThis means that almost two thirds of our pupils are in temporary accommodation which was first erected as a temporary measure ten years ago.Mr Bent stressed temporary classrooms may solve a financial problem for the Government, but there was so substitute for normal school accommodation.ldquoAt least  of the  subjects on the secondary curriculum are practical subjects, such as domestic science.

Those players made a signicant dference, he said afterwards.ldquoWe knew we had to get something from the game, Tally continued. ldquoWe lost last week and we were disappointed with our performance. Wersquove still a lot of work to do. We made a lot of mistakes and conceded a lot of turnovers.ldquoThere are boys still finding their feet at this level, which is part of it.

The only exception would be when sensitive information is being discussed, he said. ldquoNo reasoning was given as to why the CIL visit should have been in private.Councillor Dermot Curran said the event should have been held in the ldquofull glare of the public and asked why more meetings were now being arranged mdash at the ratepayersrsquo expense mdash when one open to all councillors, the press and the public would have been sufficient.Slieve Croob councillor John Rice also expressed concern that only elected representatives were able to hear from the Commissioners.ldquoThis meeting was about a lighthouse and it was ridiculous that the public, in particular those campaigning to retain the beam, were not permitted to listen to the debate, he added.Cllr Cadogan Enright, whose proposal that reporters and the public should have been admitted was defeated, believes there was no reason to exclude them. He claimed the attitude of ldquohiding what was going on in council was becoming too common and needed to be stopped.ldquoTransparency in council is the best way to win public trust, he declared. ldquoThe Commissioners said they are not proposing to take away the existing apparatus except for the mercury bath. They propose putting a new rotating LED beam on the top of the lighthouse to demonstrate that they were listening to local people and plan to bring this all to consultation later in the year.Cllr Enright said the Commissioners confirmed that Newry, Mourne and Down Council could bring forward a partnership with a local preservation group in a manner similar to what happened at Loop Head lighthouse in Co Clare.A council spokesman said: ldquoThis workshop was a preliminary information session for councillors and prior to any plans being finalised or put in place for St Johnrsquos Point lighthouse, a wide ranging public consultation is planned, he said.The spokesman added: ldquoCouncillors present also agreed to invite officers from the Commissioner of Irish Lights to a joint DEA Forum meeting to ensure information can be shared and that local stakeholders and communities are fully consulted upon any proposals for the lighthouse in the immediate future..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Magical Mooney conjures up late%2C late winner  ","story":"DOWN were forced to rely on an eleventh hour intervention from Caolan Mooney to get over the line at Connolly Park, Sligo, on Sunday.The Rostrevor governor swooped in added time to turn a - to - deficit into a winning scenario with a sensational last-gasp goal to give Paddy Tallyrsquos charges their first win of the campaign.It all looked so bleak for the visitors for most of the game as Sligo dominated the exchanges, but Down hung on grimly and Mooney saved the day four minutes into added time.Sligo started in a hurry and points from Pat Hughes and Liam Gaughan gave the hosts a - to - lead after five minutes.Hughes slammed in a quick goal to increase Sligorsquos lead to five points before Paul Devlin registered Downrsquos first score with a converted free in the eighth minute.Further unanswered points from Pat Havern and Ryan and Jerome Johnston brought Down to within a point of the home side midway through the first half.

He has no doubt that they will be relieved to hear that the scheme is definitely going ahead.He continued: ldquoI had wanted an extra filter lane to be provided, but due to the extensive underground utilities, the cost to relocate them would have delayed the installation of the puffin crossings.ldquoIn the interests of public safety, it is essential to push on with the committed works to provide the new puffin crossings before the end of March.ldquoI would like to thank roads officials for listening to the concerns of the Newcastle community and delivering on this important road safety priority.Last year, a new plan to address road safety and congestion issues at the roundabout in response to mounting local concern was outlined.Roads officials plan to create a new dedicated filter lane, enabling drivers entering the resort from the Dundrum direction and wishing to access the Castlewellan Road to do so without causing major tailbacks, leaving two existing lanes for the exclusive use of traffic heading into the town centre.It is understood officials have not yet fully costed the scheme, but they have confirmed they will require to shave off a section of land at the side of the roundabout to provide the new link road which they are confident can signicantly reduce congestion..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Newcastle trio are nice and Trim  ","story":"FOR those preparing for a Spring Marathon, the Trim  Mile Road Race is the first opportunity to see how January training has gone and the progress made towards achieving whatever your goal might be.This has been a popular event among the NAC faithful in the past and the bus full of lsquomaybesrsquo was reasonably full last year.This year, the event proved more popular than ever and sold out in early January.

He said the review will not be completed until December.Cllr Curran said Ardglass, Kilkeel and Portavogie were at the heart of their respective communities and that new investment was required to allow them to develop.ldquoWhile I welcome the planned review, I am concerned at how long it will take to complete. In addition, how will any recommendations around future investment for example be implemented in the absence of a ing Stormont Assembly  he asked.Newry, Mourne and Down Council has agreed to make pound, to assist with plans to regenerate Ardglass harbour, helping secure the future of the villagersquos fishing industry.The local authority is making the cash available to the recently formed Ardglass harbour development group which has drawn up a series of proposals to help kick-start the economic regeneration of Ardglass.The money has been earmarked to help the new group complete a business case aimed at paving the way for a number of projects including deepening the harbour to accommodate larger herring and mackerel vessels and to upgrade berthing facilities for local trawlers.The Ardglass group is keen to relocate trawlers to the an area known locally as the Saw Pit at the harbour which it wants to deepen in order that vessels are able to put to sea when they want and not have to wait on the right tidal conditions.The provision of a dedicated repair facility for vessels is also a key aim for the new group as currently trawler skippers have to take their boats to Kilkeel or Portavogie which reduces the time they can spend at sea earning a living.Another key plank of the grouprsquos vision for the future is converting property at the harbour to provide a new hub offering essential office and training space. It is also hoped to provide a storage and work area and space for the community to use.Cllr Curran said many people were eager to read the conclusions of the government departmentrsquos review, particularly in the context of a post-Brexit scenario.He added: ldquoAt this point in time all those within the fishing sector in particular are looking at the ongoing discussions around Brexit and wondering what any final decision will have on an already heavily regulated industry.Meanwhile, Ardglass Golf Club is the venue for a special event next Wednesday, February , when funding opportunities under the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund support programme will be outlined during an information session which runs between am and .pm.The funding initiative is designed to support a broad range of projects that focus on promoting economic growth through job creation and social inclusion in coastal and inland communities which depend on fishing and aquaculture.This includes the ersication of activities within fisheries and into other sectors of the maritime economy with the pound.m funding cake being administered by the South East Area Fisheries Local Action Group which comprises representatives from the public, private and voluntary sectors within the Newry, Mourne and Down and Ards and North Down council areas.The projects eligible for financial support must must demonstrate how they will impact on fishing dependent communities..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Spa’s James and Kirsty dance to success  ","story":"YOUNG farmers from all over Co Down descended upon a Belfast hotel recently for this yearrsquos star-studded grand final of Strictly Young Farmers.More usually associated with Simmentals and Shorthorns the Strictly contestants showed they were equally at home with a good salsa or a samba on stage at the Crown Plaza Hotel in a bid to win the much revered glitter ball.The event sponsored by Barclays, saw Young Farmersrsquo clubs from all over Co Down welcome a crowd of over , made up of sponsors, family and friends, to support this yearrsquos dancers.The enthusiastic audience were dazzled with a vast array of steps and styles including the cha cha cha, jive, charleston, paso doble and American smooth.In preparation for the big night the committed couples underwent a strict regime every Monday evening since last November.Following much swinging, sweat and a lot of fake tan the couples were well able to showcase their talent at the annual event to raise funds for Alzheimerrsquos Society and local Young Farmersrsquo clubs.The event was hosted by past YFCU president Roberta Simmons, of Rathfriland YFC, past YFCU vice-president Harry Crosby, of Spa YFC, and current YFCU vice-president Andrew Patton, from Newtownards YFC.Assisting with the eveningrsquos entertainment were judges Karen Patterson from the BBC and past Young Farmer, James Trotman, Agri Manager for Barclays, Janet Plunkett, Fundraising Manager for Alzheimerrsquos Society in Northern Ireland, and Zita McNaugher, current YFCU deputy president.Competing couples George Porter and Laura Sproule, Matthew Ney and Rebecca Nelson, Chris Reid and Sarah Robinson, Harry Walker and Emma Connolly, James Gilpin and Emma McAnea, Ward Patterson and Sarah Reid, Richard Kennedy and Jessica Lee, Harry Hamilton and Louise McAnea, Graham Annett and Sarah Graham wowed the crowd with their twinkle toes.However, it was James McCauley and Kirsty Burrows, from Spa YFC, who danced their way to the top with their energetic charleston to be crowned Strictly winners .The organising committee, led by Co Down YFC chairperson Linzi Stewart and secretary Kristina McKeag, thanked everyone who helped make the night such a success, particularly sponsors, hosts, judges, family and friends and last but not least the dancers, who were the stars of the show..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/farming/resources/images/5560266.jpg","title":"outstanding quality at second calf fair","story":"Breed judges from throughout the UK and Ireland were unanimous in their praise for the Pedigree Calf Fair and Beef NI Expo, held at the Balmoral Showgrounds in Belfast on SaturdaySpeaking after the one-day show, which featured three show rings and  native and continental beef breeds, event organiser and Chairman, David Connolly said: ldquoItrsquos been another fantastic event, and we certainly exceeded our strap-line lsquoBigger and Betterrsquo.ldquoThe  show has surpassed last yearrsquos inaugural event, attracting hundreds of spectators and more than  trade exhibits.

It was made with willow grown in the grounds of Cogan Primary School.More than  people attended the hill rolling ceremony down Clf Hill towards Penarth Esplanade - with the school pupils from Cogan and pupils and families from Ysgol Pen Y Garth helping to roll it along.The head was accompanied by a wooden frame from the Mabinogion stories called the Window of Sorrows made by Tony Simms, and the artist Ifor Davies undertook the ritual sawing of the Window of Sorrows on the clftops and read the Bendigeidfran story from the Mabinogion tales before the rolling went ahead.The head of Bendigeidfran and the Window of Sorrows was accompanied by Penarths Mari Lwyd which is a symbol of hosting, and negotiating hospitality through song and teasing. Richard Parry led the Mari Lwyd this year, and on arriving at the bottom of the hill the celebration visited local shops and resaurants along the sea front wishing the proprietors and customers a Happy New Year. We sang for Romeo Italian restaurant, The Fig Tree, James Sommerin, The Crazy Cafe and Hamptons seaside shop. After reaching the bottom of the hill the head was carried by the children along with the Mari Lwyd to the shops and cafes along the seafront where dferent New Year songs - called Calenig - were sung in each venue and led by local opera singer Richard Parry.Speaking about the event, artist Haf Weighton said: \"I loved working with Cogan School. Itrsquos a hidden gem in Penarth with very enthusiastic staff who were happy to jump in to get involved in this project at short notice. Richard Parry and the schools deputy head Tom Lewis, ran a assembly to the whole school on the new year traditions. Then children from across the school came to see me working on the piece. \"It was lovely to hear children who donrsquot come from homes where Welsh is spoken enthusing about the mabinogi tales and Welsh traditions. Children from Pen y Garth joined in after the head was created.

Dealing with this type of call prevents our staff from dealing with genuine emergencies.ldquoCalling an ambulance when you donrsquot need one wastes time and resources which could have been better spent responding someone genuinely in need of the high level clinical care ambulance crews provide. Ambulances are not a taxi service and arriving at hospital by ambulance does not mean yoursquoll be seen quicker.\"She added: ldquoIf someone is seriously ill or injured and their le is at risk, you should call  immediately.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Mark, who is a double kidney transplant recipient, first received a transplant back in  but in January  that transplanted kidney sadly began to shut down.The programme chronicles how mum Jo-Anne, now Northern Ireland Ambassador for national kidney patient charity Kidney Care UK, put herself forward to donate her kidney through the renal unit at the Belfast City Hospital. Commenting on taking part in the BBC documentary Jo-Anne said: “Last March Mark and I literally placed our lives in the hands of heroes! The renal unit and it’s amazing staff hold a very special place in our hearts and we were absolutely thrilled to be part of this important documentary which has the power to inspire and to save lives through promoting the organ donation message. “The cameras followed us on our visits to the renal and transplant units at the City Hospital and Daisy Hill Hospital, as well as attending a very emotional organ donation service in Botanic Gardens and, at home and on our family farm.“Looking back it doesn’t seem anything like a year since we had our surgery and to see Mark looking so well makes it all worth while!It’s hugely important to us to continue to promote a message of hope and that’s why teaming up with Stephen Watson in this way to share our story and to let people see behind-the-scenes of our transplant journey means so much to us. Mark is one of the lucky ones because sadly not everyone has the opportunity to receive that gt of le through organ donation and this vital message is very much highlighted within the program. “Being a part of this BBC documentary was very important for both Mark and myself.

We tell client’s stories through engaging content written by former journalists – grab their customers’ attention with stunning design, maximise conversions by using the latest digital marketing expertise, and develop websites which are living, breathing, online stores or shop windows. As content director, my role is to bring almost  years’ experience in journalism, political communications, corporate PR, crisis management and digital content crafting to Grofuse. How did the business start and how has it grown The business was created by a fusion of expertise to achieve sales growth, including experienced digital marketers, PR consultants, web developers, software developers, graphic designers, illustrators and motion designers. I co-founded the company with expert digital marketer Denis Finnegan who has spent  years fuelling online lead generation for businesses. Growth has been swt over the last  months. We’ve employed an effective combination of marketing efforts and created fans of our existing clients.What is your background I’m a seasoned hack, having worked in print journalism for almost  years followed by a few years as a political communications adviser. I spent a brief period teaching English and history at secondary level before entering a newsroom. The working environments were poles apart in terms pace, excitement and... language choices. As a school pupil and university student, I worked on building sites, supermarkets, farms, bars, bread delivery vans, a bakery and even a bacon factory kill-line. However, I had never encountered such flurries of expletives as I did in newsrooms. Great places to work. High pressure, tight deadlines and great target-setting – a superb way to fuel productivity in any work environment.What do you do dferently from your competition and what are your strengths Clear communication with our clients is our greatest strength. We listen intently to what our clients’ goals are, take time to learn about their products and gain full understanding of their ideal customers. We start with a blank canvass and devise bespoke digital strategies to fuel each client’s business growth by engaging their target market effectively and delivering genuine sales leads that are easily quantiable.Who are your main customers Our customers operate across a wide range of sectors. We are currently working with clients across the UK and Ireland, US, France and Spain. Do you have a target in mind in terms of where you want the business to grow We are currently focusing the bulk of our efforts on the island of Ireland with a particular focus on Dublin and Belfast. What challenges have you faced The somewhat ‘snake-oil industry’ reputation of digital marketing sometimes poses a barrier to speaking with decision makers who in the past have invested with little . However, once we’re given an opportunity, we like to let the results do the talking. Who most inspires you Those who thrive in the face of adversity and have strong growth mind-sets. The type of person with the right measure of accountability, skill and relentlessness to inspire their teams to achieve targets. It’s a mind-set akin to that of a top athlete whose body is screaming ‘slow down’ in the business end of a race but whose mind interprets that as a cue to go faster. My we Martina – a former operations manager with Lidl Ireland who co-founded and runs leading human resources consultancy, HR Team – has these qualities in abundance. She inspires me in everything I do.Where do you see yourself in the next few years I love living and working in the North West. Whatever people like to call Derry or Londonderry, it’s a very special place with a lot of talent and a big future in driving the cross-border regional economy. With our headquarters at Catalyst Inc and plans underway for satellite offices in Dublin and the UK, we want to ensure our agency plays a part in shaping that economic prosperity with the provision of more high-quality jobs for the area.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/js_1.jpg","title":"uncertainty interconnectors and the future of ni energy post brexit","story":"Posted on Monday February  by Ulster Business With a potential ‘no deal’ around the corner on Brexit, what will that mean for the future of Northern Ireland’s energy policy – especially on renewables, the I-SEM all-island market and power generation  John Simpson takes a closer look On the last working day before Christmas , the System Operator for Northern Irelandpublished draft proposals of how the electricity systems and grids on this island may operate in -. Subject to confirmation by the all-island Single Electricity Market Committee, the auction for electricity generators to be awarded capacity contracts, on an all-island basis, has identied electricity capacityof , MW which will be in place for the year starting October ,  – , MW of that all-island total is attributed to Northern Ireland.This is a critical series of draft decisions which will reassure the large conventional generators about their contracts and will impose the discipline of revenue limits constrained by the capacity auction. The draft decisions also point to the expectations in terms of the capacity earmarked from renewable sources, from inter-connection with the Scottish grid and the capacity adjustments that may follow from demand-side adjustment contracts.SONI has not been as open and transparent as should have been possible. Readers must make the assumption that ties location to where capacity payments are identied in sterling and euro.The SONI statement lists  generator names ,  of which are identied as DSUswhich leaves  others. Eight are shown as part of the AES capacity in Ballylumford and Kilroot: four are small capacity generators, six each have capacity of over MW , and the last capacity source linked to Northern Ireland is the Moyle Interconnector.SONI does not present the capacity awards in a way that allows readers to identy the location of each successful unit.The Utility Regulator has agreed that the available Northern Ireland capacity should include  MW from the Moyle Interconnector which represents over % of locally available capacity. This is a judgement that might be queried. Is the interconnectora guaranteed source of capacity  If, at a time of peak demand in Northern Ireland, demand in the grid in GB had no spare capacity, presumably the capacity might not be available for supply to Northern Ireland. The regulator and SONI are well placed to judge the probability of this outcome and might argue that it is a minimal risk.There are some interesting features stemming from the assumptions made in setting the framework for the capacity auction. First, Northern Ireland has been treated as meriting some contract iations because of locational constraints. This is a reflection of the limited capacity of the electricity grid on the whole island to send electricity to the places where there is demand. Both the Dublin area and Northern Irelanddid not attract auction bids adequately to supply these area locational constraints. For Northern Ireland. the easy explanation lies in the absence of the long awaited north-south grid expansion from to the planned distribution hub in Co Tyrone.The capacity auction allowed for the acceptance of bids with prices which are higher than the main auction prices which would match supply and demand across the whole island. Because of the locational deficit, some Northern Ireland bids now show capacity payment prices above the all-Ireland ceiling of £, per MW which applies to most of the successful bids.In the quotation from AES for the two large fossil fuel burning units, the proposal is that they should attract payment prices of £, and £, per MW. At first sight this appears to allow a premium of nearly % on the payment price for each MW. This seems more than a marginal cost and points to the possible cost savingsthe proposed new north-south link had been operational.This answer for the older high capacity units at Kilroot is a further reflection of the doubt about the continued viability of these units. It will be remembered that a year ago, these same two units were deemed unsuccessful in the auction but, at a late stage when faced with a request for a derogation to be allowed to close these units, the initially agreed settlement was revised.A year ago, the first capacity auction under the rules of the newly instituted I-SEM, was accepted with a capacity supply of near to , MW for all of Northern Ireland. Now, in early , SONI has concluded that for security of supply Northern Ireland should contract for just under , MW. There is no obvious major uplt in demand in Northern Ireland so that, quietly, the suggestion is that the arithmetic in late  may now be thought to have been slightly too risky.The capacity auction is a fundamental building block of electricity supply policy for Northern Ireland. However, on its own, the allocation of capacity and the possible scope for investment in new generating capacity must also be seen in the context of increasing,market forces allow, the proportion of electricity supply that is supplied from renewable sources. The distribution of generating capacity is still dominated by fossil fuels. Northern Ireland’s capacity is nearly % from gas andcoal. However, the statistics showing the proportion of electricity supply from renewables points to average consumption from renewables of nearer to -%. Because of the iability in the contribution of wind based renewables, it would be hazardousgreater security dependence was allocated to renewables.In turn, the caveat about the possible role of renewables points to the possible value of further investment in energy storage for which no major scheme has been launched. If Kilroot power station survives for a further three to four years, then the experimental electricity storage capacity on that site may become an attractive asset.There are several continuing questions about Northern Ireland’s security of electricity supply. Will Kilroot be given further stays of execution after   Will the North South interconnector eventually be built  Will the proposed large natural gas burning power station be built in Belfast  Will the politically unpopular investment in anaerobic digestion plants be tackled  Will the Brexit settlement, or lack of it, damage the continued operation of the all-island single electricity market  But... it seems Kilroot has been given a temporary extension of its role in keeping the lights on.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/house_11.jpg","title":"future of house of fraser in belfast secured amid fresh lease","story":"Posted on Friday February  by John Mulgrew The future of House of Fraser in Belfast appears to be safe after the retailer signed a fresh lease on its anchor store at Victoria Square, it can be revealed.
