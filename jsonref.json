But that one bright wonderful moment was the space program.\u0027Four days after Apollo 11 blasted out from the John F. Kennedy Space Center, the spacecraft\u0027s Eagle module – carrying Armstrong and Aldrin – was running drastically low on fuel and urgently needed to land on the moon\u0027s surface.The module\u0027s autopilot mode had overshot the desired landing zone by some four miles, leaving the two men hurtling towards a crater filled with rocks and jagged terrain for what sure would\u0027ve made for a fatal crash landing.With the success of the mission literally in his hands, Armstrong switched off the Eagle\u0027s autopilot mode and took manual control of its reigns.Despite his heart-rate measuring at an erratic 150 BPM, Armstrong kept a cool head and a steady hand, guiding the Eagle away from the crater.

Kennedy\u0027s pledge to land an American on the moon by the end of the decade, beating the Russians to the feat. Armstrong was the first one to step out from the Eagle, coining the now iconic phrase: \u0027That\u0027s one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.\u0027 Reflecting on one of modern history\u0027s most incredible moments, President Donad Trump said: \u0027Few moments in our American story spark more pride than the Apollo 11 mission,\u0027 in a Space Exploration Day message. His statement reiterated the goal of sending astronauts back to the moon within five years and taking \u0027the next giant leap - sending Americans to Mars.\u0027         The Eagle lunar lander, carrying Armstrong and Aldrin, landed on the Sea of Tranquility on July 20, 1969        The mission\u0027s success held true on President John F.

At one point, we feared we would be kidnapped.It turned out the men knew our itinerary from the IRGC, which had bugged our vehicle, intercepted our interpreter’s mobile phone and bribed our driver. They knew exactly who I was. So serious was the risk judged to be, in fact, that we were given police protection – not against criminals or terrorists, but against the Basij and other agencies of the Iranian state. In the end, the hardliners won and we felt obliged leave four days early.Yet I still have huge affection for the Iranian people. I’ve been back since and have now written a book about why Iran so distrusts the West and Britain in particular.         Mr Straw believes that misunderstanding the Iranian temperament will cause further problems          Former Foreign Secretary Jack Straw, pictured yesterday at a service of thanksgiving for former Cabinet Secretary Lord Heywood, said Britain will never be trusted by the current Iranian regime         According to Mr Straw, Iranians have good cause to be resentful against the ‘cunning, colonial fox’       If we are to solve the current Gulf crisis in the Strait of Hormuz, then it is crucial to understand our shared history and why Iran today behaves as it does.The book is called The English Job, for example, because of a ubiquitous phrase in Persian – ‘it’s always an English job’ – which Iranians use when things go wrong.They have good cause to be resentful against the ‘cunning, colonial fox’, as they describe us. Iran never was a British colony but that didn’t stop us exploiting the country for treasure and power.At least our colonies got roads, sewers and railways. Quite the opposite was the case in Iran. Britain and Russia, after competing with each other for control of the country, eventually struck a deal which stopped all railway building right up until the 1920s.We bribed and cajoled Iran to do our will throughout the 19th Century and early part of the 20th Century and, if that didn’t work, we landed troops.         Mr Straw has written a book as to why Iran distrusts BritainWe invaded Iran in the First World War, helping cause a catastrophic famine in the process. In the Second World War, with the Russians, we jointly occupied the country for five years from 1941-6.We deposed a Shah in 1941 and installed his weaker, more compliant son.When the Iranian parliament waged an eight-year struggle to nationalise BP’s huge refinery and vast network of oil wells, MI6 and the CIA responded by organising a successful coup against the elected prime minister, Mohammad Mossadegh, in August 1953.We helped prop up the Shah in the mid and late 1970s, even when it was obvious that he was losing popular support. Catastrophically so, in fact. In 1979, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi was overthrown in a revolution led by Ayatollah Khomeini and that, in turn, led directly to the start of the Islamic Republic of Iran.But the worst was to come in 1980, when Iraq’s newly appointed president, Saddam Hussein, decided, without any justification, to invade Iran. Millions on both sides lost their lives in the bloody war that followed.The whole of the West – America, France, the UK and Russia – backed Iraq (with only Israel, improbably, supporting Iran). For eight years, Iran was effectively alone. It managed to avoid abject defeat, but this searing experience has defined everything that has happened since and shaped the attitude of those in power today.Iran’s Supreme Leader since 1989, Ali Khamenei, never ceases to preach that the West cannot be trusted. In 1980, he came close to being assassinated by a renegade Iranian terrorist group, the Mujahedin-e Khalq – once supported by Saddam and now by John Bolton, President Trump’s national security adviser – and lost the use of his right arm.The single most powerful military figure in Iran is Major-General Qasem Soleimani, the man behind the Revolutionary Guards’ seizure of the British-flagged tanker. His world view, too, was forged in the crucible of the war with Saddam.It’s Khamenei and Soleimani who now call the shots, both literally and figuratively. Iran, in their view, is fighting for its very survival.Bolton calculates that by strangling Iran through sanctions, the Islamic revolutionary regime will collapse and the government, led by President Rouhani, will come begging for a deal.This approach won’t work. It is based upon a complete misunderstanding of the Iranian psyche. Already, American pressure has strengthened hardliners such as Khamenei and Soleimani and has weakened moderates like Rouhani. An often discontented population has been unified. After two centuries of humiliation, what Iran seeks above all is respect and recognition.As I know, having been involved for three years in negotiating the first phase of nuclear talks with Iran (2003-6), if Iran is shown that respect, a deal is possible.Without that, the cat and mouse game in the Gulf and continued instability in the wider Middle East will continue.We may not like the way Iran is behaving but comprehending why they do so could prove critical. The English Job: Understanding Iran, And Why It Distrusts Britain, by Jack Straw, Biteback, £20. "},{"url":null,"title":"Washington Monument transformed stunning tribute Apollo 11 moon landing","story":"Share this article            The image of the moon is seen projected on the monument during the 17-minute light show         The third stage and CSM of the Saturn V are seen traveling toward the moon after stage separation         The Apollo 11 Lunar lander approaching to the moon is projected on the Washington Monument         The Apollo 11 Lunar lander touching down the moon is projected on the Washington Monument         Neil Armstrong\u0027s foot print on the rocky Moon is projected on the Washington Monument for the 50th anniversary At NASA\u0027s Kennedy Space Center, Aldrin showed Vice President Mike Pence the launch pad where he flew to the moon in 1969. At the same time halfway around the world, an American and two other astronauts blasted into space on a Russian rocket.

When Paul Beckermann arrives at the Bauhaus art school in 1922, he’s captivated not only by his teachers but his fellow students too, not least the enigmatic Charlotte. But while Paul is immersed in the seductions and rivalries among his new friends, the rise of the far right threatens the Bauhaus’s very existence. Interweaving the personal and the political, Wood creates an atmospheric backdrop through which to explore the impact of macro events on art, culture, friendship and personal freedoms.In this meticulously researched and absorbing biography, Haste reassesses the life of Alma Mahler: socialite, composer and muse. Through extensive reference to diaries, previously unpublished letters and interviews with Mahler’s granddaughter, Haste draws a portrait of a complex, ambitious, highly accomplished woman. Married three times – to composer Gustav Mahler, architect and founder of the Bauhaus, Walter Gropius, and writer Franz Werfel – Mahler is depicted as a woman who not only facilitated the creative pursuits of her husbands and lovers, but was an intellectual and creative force in her own right.Mona will soon turn 60. She lives alone by the sea, running a shop where she makes beautiful outfits for dolls. When she meets a local man and they begin taking day trips together, the newfound intimacy ignites memories from her troubled past: a tragic childhood, a difficult marriage, the death of loved ones. But Mona has found a means of coping with her grief – a process she shares with others in similar circumstances – in scenes that are as unexpected as they are moving. De Waal is a compassionate and insightful writer, and here she tackles addiction, depression and illness in luminous prose and with emotional acuity.• To order The Hiding Game, Passionate Spirit or The Trick to Time, go to bookshop or call 0330 333 6846.

Bosses, he insists, must commit to fighting inequality and tackling the climate emergency.“We are about to commit the biggest intergenerational crime in the history of mankind. We need to bring us together not drive us apart,” said the 63-year-old Dutchman, who won plaudits for pushing the benefits of sustainable business long before it became fashionable.“If you don’t address inequality and climate change, to keep it simple, a lot more people are going to be dissatisfied, feel not included or left behind, and making these choices of rejection at the ballot box. The fact we are having these issues of populism and schisms in society is exactly because we are not addressing the underlying issue to evolve capitalism and make sure it works for everybody,” he said. He believes the starting point is “heroic chief executives willing to step up and move outside of the comfort zone and take personal risks. I tried to do the same with Unilever. It’s a matter of willpower.”Polman has backed his words with cash by investing in Imagine, a foundation to push the UN’s sustainable development goals. But he has several other projects on the go, including helping the French president, Emmanuel Macron, and François-Henri Pinault, the boss of Gucci and Yves Saint Laurent owner Kering, to develop a fashion-industry deal to cut waste and carbon emissions that is set to be announced at the G7 meeting in Biarritz next month. Polman said the aim is to get a fifth of the industry on board. He his hoping that signatories including the Calvin Klein owner PVH, H\u0026ampM and Inditex, the owner of Zara, will inspire others.Polman is also backing an initiative that adopts similar tactics to advance disability rights, Valuable 500. The campaign, which is aiming to recruit 500 chief executives of major companies who commit to putting disability on their board agenda this year, has just won the backing of seven major financial institutions, including the Bank of England, HSBC and Lloyds. The banks join existing signatories, including Barclays, Accenture, Microsoft, Virgin Media and Sainsbury’s.“We are trying to create tipping points on a sectorial level. The premise is that chief executives in the private sector need to drive major change in the absence of politicians doing it right now. Not exclusively but actively helping de-risk the political process,” Polman said.The boss who has publicly backed the young people behind Extinction Rebellion and is a fan of the teenage activist Greta Thunberg, said businesses that do not embrace issues of ersity, sustainability and equal rights will also struggle to attract talented young workers.“Millennials want to work for companies that stand for more than just making money.”Polman said he is no longer ridiculed for suggesting that tackling climate change makes business sense and that companies are also beginning to see that addressing equal rights is just as important.“We are now at a point in society where the cost of not acting in these areas is higher than acting. It is becoming mainstream. It comes down to humans, that’s the missing element,” Polman said.Caroline Casey, the founder of the Valuable 500 campaign, hopes that persuading key business leaders, such as Richard Branson, who has dyslexia, to be more open about their own disabilities and take action to make their companies more inclusive will demonstrate change is “good for business, good for people with disability and good for society in general”.She points out that there are about 13m people with disabilities in the UK who, together with their families, have a spending power of £249bn. However, businesses pay them far less attention than vegans, for example, who number less than one million.People with disabilities are also valuable employees who may be concealing non-obvious conditions such as autism, mental health problems or even blindness in the workplace.“There’s a cost to exclusion because we’re not releasing potential,” Casey said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a617f528ce948729e6307dc727f9834eba9e3dda/24_159_4716_2829/master/4716.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ea53b95c6c6d52bf4c9ca7ab1e78ffaa","title":"regional policy requires rethink as myth of london productivity debunked","story":"Does a doctor in England’s capital really work three times harder than one in Merthyr Tydfil?Britain’s regional ide is well known and well documented. The richer bits of the country tend to be clustered below a line drawn from the Wash to the Severn estuary, while London is so different from everywhere else that it may as well be its own city-state.There is also another ide: between the big cities and the smaller towns. The north-west may be less prosperous than the south-east but on average people are better off in Manchester than they are in Blackpool.Economists have a posh way of describing the reason for this big-small disparity: agglomeration effects. This means that firms are more efficient if they are clustered together, with cities better locations for businesses than towns.Regional policy, to the limited extent that it currently exists, has involved encouraging regional hubs in the hope that they will pull up the struggling towns on their peripheries. Current thinking is that there is not a lot of point trying to encourage firms to relocate to places such as Blackpool because they are less efficient than the big conurbations.This notion, according to a new piece of research from Steve Fothergill and Tina Beatty of Sheffield Hallam University, is actually completely wrong. Once the official data for regional economic performance is broken down there is virtually no difference in economic efficiency between workers in one region and another, and workers in cities are no more efficient than workers in towns.This is not the picture provided by the official method of calculating productivity – gross value added. GVA per capita is the result of taking the value of the output of a country, region, city or town, subtracting the cost of the inputs that went producing it and then iding by the number of people.There are vast differences between the various parts of the UK on this measure. Against a nationwide average of 100, London has a GVA per capita of 179, almost three times as high as southern Scotland (61), west Wales and the valleys (63), and Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly (65).Intuitively, such wide disparities seem a bit weird. In any one part of the country, the range of jobs is generally pretty uniform. London has hairdressers and so does southern Scotland. There are supermarkets, hospitals and schools in the Welsh valleys just as there in the capital. There is a demand for solicitors in Bodmin just as there is in Barking.Is it really possible that a doctor in London is three times as productive as a doctor in Merthyr Tydfil or that it takes three times as long for the Cornish lawyer to do the conveyancing on a house as it does for the one in Camden? Fothergill and Beatty’s research suggests there really is no real gap to speak of.They come to this conclusion by gradually stripping away various elements of GVA per capita. An adjustment is made to ide GVA by the number of people of working age (16-64) rather than the population as a whole. Account is taken of the fact that employment rates among the working-age population are higher in some parts of the country than others because of the number of students or those on disability benefits.Commuting makes a difference because the number of jobs in each area is not necessarily the same as the number of residents in work. The mix of industries also matters: some parts of the country have a high concentration of high productivity jobs – such as banking, finance and business services.The split of head office and routine jobs within industries is not even: some regions tend to have a bigger share of white-collar and executive roles. GVA comparisons are also skewed by the number of hours worked in different parts of the country.Even that, the authors say, is probably an overestimate because of the difficulties of properly accounting for the concentration of the most senior and highest-paid jobs in London.This study should be read in the highest levels of government. While it does not dispute that some parts of the country are richer than others, it does challenge agglomeration theory and the notion that a more active regional policy would require sacrificing efficiency for equity.Encouraging businesses to set up in the Welsh valleys would not mean that the UK as a whole would suffer. On the contrary, if underutilised resources could be brought into use through investment in infrastructure, research and development and skills, the economy would benefit."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4a4844ef9c33fb0a90c9279d6af4c34a877f6351/741_828_4897_2939/master/4897.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f151201598cf33bd1406845c2ef666be","title":"tell us about your favourite canal boat shop","story":"There are more licensed boats using Britain’s canals than at the height of the industrial revolution – and barge-based businesses are booming too.

How long until another road claims the title?The world has a new steepest street! But it’s more than 1,000 years old. So, did something happen to the previous steepest street? Is this an off-colour attempt to look on the bright side of a horrendous natural disaster? No, the previous steepest street is still there.So, has the old one somehow got less steep, perhaps because of a horrendous natural disaster? No, it’s as steep as ever. There is no horrendous natural disaster involved with this story. So what’s happened?Well, a street has been discovered that’s steeper than the street that, for some years, has been proclaiming itself to be the world’s steepest street. But how can a street be discovered? Was it buried? Is it part of a newly unearthed hilly suburb of Pompeii? No, stop trying to link it to horrendous natural disasters.The new steepest street has been in continuous occupation since time immemorial. Much longer, in fact, than its predecessor as holder of the accolade. So, the fact is – and I hate to be rude about what we now know is, at best, the second steepest street in the world – that this predecessor was an impostor, a usurper, albeit an unknowing one. It was never steepest. Even on the day of its construction, a steeper street already existed.Fundamentally, this is a damning indictment of the system by which the title of world’s steepest street is awarded, a process that, slightly suspiciously, appears to have something to do with Guinness. Common sense suggests that Guinness is not a substance likely to be of help in the global ranking of gradients in built-up areas.I should clarify that there is no suggestion that the whole steepest street issue got screwed up because everyone involved was off their face on Guinness, or even that their concentrations were marginally impaired by the responsible enjoyment of Guinness. They may not have drunk any Guinness at all. The link with Guinness is pretty tenuous. Guinness World Records, formerly the Guinness Book of Records, isn’t even owned by Diageo plc (which owns Guinness) any more.But the fact remains that it’s called Guinness World Records because of Guinness, the drink, not because of a random Andrew or Steve or Janet Guinness who loved measuring things and decided to put them all in a book. So there’s Guinness all over this mess and perhaps we all ought to think about that before we buy any more Guinness.Where the rigour lapsed, however, was in failing to check whether there were any other streets that were steeper. It’s a strange lapse, when you think about it. It seems so obvious: in order to know which is the world’s steepest street, you need to measure the steepness of every street in the world.Now, you may say that that is one hell of a logistical challenge. Who’s going to pay for that to be done? Not Diageo plc. And the wearying expense and difficulty is, to my mind, only compounded by the undeniable truth that finding out which of the world’s millions of streets happens to be steepest is a colossally unimportant task. I would have been content with a state of affairs where everyone agreed that Baldwin Street in Dunedin is certainly jolly steep, and probably a lot steeper than most streets, and we left it at that.The tallest bloke you’ve ever met is almost certainly not the tallest man on Earth. He might be, but you really have to check. You can’t just watch him fetch a football off a garage roof, say “Wow” and then stick it in your book – not if you think that being accurate about these records matters. Personally, I don’t think it matters, but I’d expect the people running Guinness World Records to think it does if they want to cling on to an iota of professional pride and aren’t just in it for all the free Guinness they probably no longer get.There are other people it seems to matter to as well because, bizarrely, being named the world’s steepest street actually generates a bit of tourism. Some people want to go and see the world’s steepest street. More people than want to avoid it. I don’t really understand why. Steep is a bad thing for a street to be. Streets are supposed to facilitate access to houses or shops. The steeper it is, the less well it does that. It would be like being the street with the worst maintained road surface in the world or being littered with the greatest density of impacted chewing gum.Nevertheless, there is genuinely a small amount of sadness in Dunedin that Baldwin Street has lost its status and a small amount of joy in Harlech in Wales that a very old street there, called Ffordd Pen Llech (which looks like more of a lane if you ask me), has been confirmed as always having been steeper.But how long can that joy last when the majority of the world’s street gradients remain unmeasured and unverified? What a precarious position: constantly worrying about losing the title if another street proves it’s in a more precarious position."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/98aba5174772a3e45389ee6f4a3f2ea8ccaf4fa2/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=80a524efd3a513d72617c3709adc4052","title":"woman greatest enemy lack of time themselves","story":"If what it takes to create are long stretches of time alone, that’s something women have never had the luxury to expectA few months ago, as I struggled to carve out time in my crowded days for writing, a colleague suggested I read a book about the daily rituals of great artists. But instead of offering me the inspiration I’d hoped for, what struck me most about these creative geniuses – mostly men – was not their schedules and daily routines, but those of the women in their lives.Their wives protected them from interruptions their housekeepers and maids brought them breakfast and coffee at odd hours their nannies kept their children out of their hair. Martha Freud not only laid out Sigmund’s clothes every morning, she even put the toothpaste on his toothbrush. Marcel Proust’s housekeeper, Celeste, not only brought him his daily coffee, croissants, newspapers and mail on a silver tray, but was always on hand whenever he wanted to chat, sometimes for hours. Some women are mentioned only for what they put up with, like Karl Marx’s wife – unnamed in the book – who lived in squalor with the surviving three of their six children while he spent his days writing at the British Museum.Gustav Mahler married a promising young composer named Alma, then forbade her from composing, saying there could be only one in the family. Instead, she was expected to keep the house utterly silent for him. After his midday swim, he’d whistle for Alma to join him on long, silent walks while he composed in his head. She’d sit for hours on a branch or in the grass, not daring to disturb him. “There’s such a struggle going on in me!” Alma wrote in her diary. “And a miserable longing for someone who thinks OF ME, who helps me to find MYSELF! I’ve sunk to the level of a housekeeper!”Unlike the male artists, who moved through life as if unfettered time to themselves were a birthright, the days and life trajectories of the handful of female artists featured in the book were often limited by the expectations and duties of home and care. George Sand always worked late at night, a practice that started when she was a teenager and needed to take care of her grandmother. Starting out, Francine Prose’s writing day was defined by the departure and return of her children on the school bus. Alice Munro wrote in the “slivers” of time she could find between housekeeping and childrearing. And Maya Angelou got away from the pull of home by leaving it altogether, checking herself into an unadorned hotel room to think, read and write.Even Anthony Trollope, who famously wrote 2,000 words before 8am every morning, most likely learned the habit from his mother, who began writing at age 53 to support her sick husband and their six children. She rose at 4am and finished work in time to serve the family breakfast.I think of all the books, paintings, music, scientific discoveries, philosophy I learned about in school – almost all by men. The conductor Zubin Mehta once said, “I just don’t think women should be in an orchestra,” as if they didn’t have the temperament, or the talent. (Blind auditions put an end to that notion.) I think of an interview Patti Scialfa gave on how difficult it was for her to write the music for her solo album because her kids kept interrupting her and demanding her time in a way that they never would of their father, Bruce Springsteen. And it strikes me: it’s not that women haven’t had the talent to make their mark in the world of ideas and art. They’ve never had the time.Women’s time has been interrupted and fragmented throughout history, the rhythms of their days circumscribed by the sisyphean tasks of housework, childcare and kin work – keeping family and community ties strong. If what it takes to create are long stretches of uninterrupted, concentrated time, time you can choose to do with as you will, time that you can control, that’s something women have never had the luxury to expect, at least not without getting slammed for unseemly selfishness.Even today, around the globe, with so many women in the paid labor force, women still spend at least twice as much time as men doing housework and childcare, sometimes much more. One study of 32 families in Los Angeles found that the uninterrupted leisure time of most mothers lasted, on average, no more than 10 minutes at a stretch. And in mapping the daily lives of academics, the sociologist Joya Misra and her colleagues found that the work days of the female professors were much longer than their male colleagues, once you factored in all their unpaid labor at home. Even so, she found that the men and women she studied spent about the same amount of time at their paid work. But the women’s time at work, too, was interrupted and fragmented, chopped up with more service work, mentoring and teaching. The men spent more of their work days in long stretches of uninterrupted time to think, research, write, create and publish to make their names, advance their careers and get their ideas out into the world.In his Theory of the Leisure Class, Thorstein Veblen wrote that throughout history the people who had the ability to choose and control their time were high-status men. He dismissed women on page two, writing that they, along with the servants and the slaves, have always been responsible for the drudge work that enables those high-status men to think their great thoughts. Feminist researchers have argued that women have often had, at most, “invisible leisure” – enjoyable, but productive and socially sanctioned, activities like quilting bees, canning parties or book groups. Yet pure leisure, making time just for oneself, is nothing short of a courageous act of radical and subversive resistance. Easier to do, one researcher joked, if, like the writer, composer, philosopher and mystic Hildegard of Bingen, you became a nun.Feminist researchers have also found that many women don’t feel that they deserve long stretches of time to themselves, the way men do. They feel they have to earn it. And the only way to do that is to get to the end of a To Do list that never ends: the chores of the day, as Melinda Gates writes in her new book, killing the dreams of a lifetime. Indeed, I’ve been trying to carve out time to think and write this essay for more than four months. Every single time I’ve sat down to start, I’ve gotten a panicked call or email from my husband, son or daughter my mother, dealing with the strange frontier and endless paperwork of the newly widowed a credit card company or a mechanic about some emergency or other that requires my immediate attention to stave off certain disaster.I remember interviewing psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, famed for identifying the state of flow, the peak human experience when one is so absorbed in a meaningful task that time effectively disappears. It’s the state that artists and thinkers say is a requirement for creating anything of value. I asked him if his research explored whether women had as much opportunity to get into flow as men. He thought for a moment, then told me a story of a woman who lost track of time as she ironed her husband’s shirts.The poet Eleanor Ross Taylor lived her life in the shadow of her husband, the Pulitzer prize-winning novelist, short story writer and professor Peter Taylor. “Over the years, many times I would say to poems, ‘Go away, I don’t have time now,’” she told an interviewer in 1997. “But that was part laziness. If you really want to write, you can. I did keep the house scrubbed and waxed and that sort of thing.”I feel such a sense of loss when I think of the great, unwritten poems that took a backseat to polished floors. And for a long time, I thought the expectation that others be tended to first and the floors be polished and that she was the one who was supposed to keep them that way was what kept those untold stories coiled inside her, compressed, as Maya Angelou writes, to the point of pain. But I wonder if it isn’t also that women feel they don’t deserve time to themselves, or enough of it that comes in unbroken stretches. I wonder if we also feel we don’t deserve to tell our untold stories, that they may not be as worth listening to.The writer VS Naipaul claimed that no woman writer was his match, that women’s writing is too “sentimental”, their worldview too “narrow” – because, you know, men’s lives are the default for the human experience. And I’ve often wondered: would a woman who’d written a carefully observed six-volume novel based on her own life have received the same attention and international acclaim as the Norwegian writer Karl Ove Knausgaard, author of My Struggle?Virginia Woolf once imagined what would have become of Shakespeare were he born a woman, or if he’d had an equally gifted sister. (Think of the musical prodigy Nannerl Mozart, whose early compositions her brother Wolfgang praised as “beautiful” but have been lost, or remained coiled inside, unwritten, as she disappeared into an expected but loveless marriage.)The female Shakespeare, Woolf wrote, would never have had the time or the ability to develop her genius – barred from school, told to mind the stew, expected to marry young, and beaten if she didn’t. In Woolf’s telling, Shakespeare’s sister, despite her great gifts, wound up crazy, dead, or shut up in a cottage in the woods and mocked as a witch.But that wasn’t the end of the story. Woolf imagined that, in the future, a woman with genius would be born. Her ability to blossom – and the expectation that her voice, her vision, was worthy – would depend entirely on the world we decided to create. “She would come if we worked for her,” Woolf wrote.I do not claim to have any particular genius. But sometimes, I dream that I’m sitting in a dusky room at a kitchen table across from another version of me, who sits, unbound by time, quietly drinking a cup of tea. “I wish you’d visit more often,” she tells me. And I wonder if that searing middle-of-the-night pain that, at times, settles like dread around my solar plexus may not only be because there’s so little unbroken time to tell my own untold stories, but because I’m afraid that what may be coiled inside may not be worth paying attention to anyway. Perhaps that’s what I don’t want to face in that dusky room I dream of.I also wonder: what if we really did do the work to create a world where the sisters of Shakespeare and Mozart, or any woman, really, could thrive? What would happen if we decided women deserved the time to go to their dusky rooms and stay awhile at the kitchen table? What if we all decided to visit more often, drinking a quiet cup of tea with ourselves, listening to the coil of stories as they unspool, knowing they have value simply because they’re true? I’d love to see what happens next."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b983e3b8becc7992baaf1e01d56df66e8301c6bc/0_80_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=574e7e6a56ecd4bab3495ea3a6e2262f","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of climb","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘climb’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment, published in print in the Observer New Review is ‘climb’.Share your photos of what climb means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.The closing date is Wednesday 24 July at 10am.

Since then she has appeared as Jo, Greg Davies’s best friend, in Channel 4 comedy series Man Down. She created and stars in GameFace, a sitcom about a struggling actor named Marcella, which first aired on E4 in 2017. The second series is on Wednesdays at 10pm on Channel 4.Films to Be Buried WithPresenter Brett Goldstein interviews people about what films mean to them: it’s very personal, about when they first saw it, and how they felt at certain points of their life when they watched it. Some are really sad, some are really happy. I liked the episodes with Tom Basden, Aisling Bea, Suzi Ruffell: they all go off on different tangents. It’s very therapeutic – it’s something I can listen to when I need to chill out and not think about the world. It’s a unique way to discover a film: to hear what it means to someone rather than just the qualities of the film objectively.He’s a phenomenal artist who I discovered on Instagram – I think someone like January Jones posted about him. It’s the first piece of work I’ve seen on Instagram of an artist where I thought: “I want to go to his gallery.” I spent a couple of hours scrolling through all his work. The first painting by him I saw was Underwater, Out of Space, which is incredible. The colours are impressionistic and quite playful. When I’m online and trying not just to read about the news, I’m trying to fill my brain with nice stuff and I find his art breathtaking and really moving.This coffee shop in Crouch End is a tiny little boxy place, but I love it: they have the music at the right level, they serve amazing coffee, the staff are lovely and do a really nice breakfast. And they have good, cosy seats – I think sometimes the nicer the coffee, the worse the seats. Coffee Circus is the perfect coffee shop for me: it’s rustic, unpretentious, community-minded. It’s the only place other than my house that I write. I wrote quite a lot of my series in there, talking to myself, so they probably think I’m mad.An incredible piece of standup. I saw it live, and now it’s on Netflix. It’s feisty and exciting and multilayered, not formulaic at all. It’s a celebration of being a single mum, and different family lifestyles. It’s about her trying to have a room in her house – the “glitter room” – just for her and her daughter. She has all these amazing, important ideas about feminism and women and ageing, but it’s not a polemic, it’s all hidden within the joke. There’s no one like Katherine Ryan: her voice is completely original, and she hasn’t got any received opinions – they’re all hers.I watched this again recently. Lynne Ramsay is one of the best directors in the world – she’s a visual poet. I’m a writer, so I always think: “You direct what’s on the script.” But so much of that film is silent. I was stunned – I find it really impressive when you’re telling a story without words. And all the shots move the story on. I went to a talk about the film and they said they made the music while they were doing the edit, so it’s all very intertwined. I couldn’t understand why she didn’t win best director at the Oscars.This is basically an astrology app disguised as a kind of guru – it doesn’t use language like “Mercury retrograde” and so on. You put in your time of birth and some details, then you get updates: this is who you are, this is your destiny. My flatmate Caroline got me into it – she’s not even into astrology, but she was like: “It’s weird, it knows everything about you.” It’s accurate, well-written and quite addictive. It just feels like a mate popping up every couple of days going: “Today is the day when this is going to happen.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b5e829ce6bae54cfaf508f3e1cf12586085ed670/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d2a4795e855f7088a8808b62c58f4c83","title":"25 best childrens films mark kermode","story":"From early animation to foreign-language gems via all-time classics, a range of movies to whet budding cinematic appetitesWhat is a children’s film? Is it a film aimed specifically at younger viewers, tailor-made to cater to their growing needs? Maybe it’s a film about childhood, a coming-of-age story that resonates with a wide range of viewers, young and old alike. Or perhaps it’s simply any film that a child could watch, anything that isn’t restricted by its nature to adult-only audiences.When I was a kid in the late 60s and early 70s, there were two movie classifications that excluded younger viewers: the AA category, introduced in 1970, for which you had to be at least 14 years old and X-certificate movies, which were restricted to over-16s or (after 1970) over-18s. Films that fell under these prohibitive categories included everything from the David EssexRingo Starr Brit-pop romp That’ll Be the Day to the violent Sam Peckinpah shocker Straw Dogs via such innocuous fare as Blazing Saddles, American Graffiti and Conquest of the Planet of the Apes. All of these were out of bounds in my preteen years. Yet there were plenty more strange and wonderful films that fell into the U or A certificate categories, making them available to anyone (or at least anyone over the age of five), sometimes under adult supervision, more often not…From as far back as I can remember, I spent as much time in the cinema as possible, seeing anything and everything that I was allowed to watch – with occasionally traumatic results. I remember one Saturday morning in 1970, when I was eight years old. My mother dropped my brother and me at the local Odeon while she went and did the weekly shopping. She knew the film showing that morning would be suitable for us because it had a U certificate, meaning “universal” – fit for all!Two hours later, she picked us up outside the cinema in floods of tears. The film we’d been watching was Ken Loach’s Kes – a milestone of British cinema that didn’t shy away from depicting the grim realities of its central character’s hard-knocks life, including beatings, taunting, naked humiliation, and (in the final reel) horrible animal death.Despite my distress, I have never once regretted seeing Kes at such a young age (it has since been reclassified PG, meaning that parents should take care). Other movies that I saw around the same age included Stanley Kubrick’s 2001: A Space Odyssey, Andrei Tarkovsky’s Solaris, Arthur Hiller’s Plaza Suite, Jean-Luc Godard’s Alphaville, Franklin J Schaffner’s Patton (Elvis’s favourite film!), Jess Franco’s The Castle of Fu Manchu and a string of catastrophe-filled 70s disaster movies from Airport to The Towering Inferno. None of these would generally be considered “children’s movies”, but I saw them all as a child, and they were all part of my cinematic education, for better or worse.In compiling this list of 25 great movies for children, I have attempted to bear in mind the vast range of films that I was lucky enough to have encountered at an impressionable age, and to acknowledge that, until fairly recently, young moviegoers were raised on a diet of movies that played to audiences of all ages. To this end, I’ve used the current guidelines of the British Board of Film Classification (still the most reliable and accountable regulatory body in the world) as a yardstick, accepting for inclusion any film that they currently rate U, PG or 1212A – the classifications of movies which can legitimately be watched by audiences under the age of 15.My choices range from short animations to feature-length live-action films, from silent films to foreign-language classics (I’m assuming subtitles aren’t an issue) from a century of international cinema. Along with the more obvious contenders, I’ve included a few titles that some readers may not consider to be children’s films at all. Fair enough. But, crucially, these are all films that kids could watch, if they wanted. The list is arranged not by merit but by date, and I’ve included the most recent BBFC certificates for reference. Take a look, and then let me know your own choices.• Tell us about your favourite children’s films in the comments below or tweet us at @ObsNewReview• Unless otherwise indicated, the films listed can be found to rent or buy on one or more of the usual online streaming servicesJackie Coogan stars as Charlie Chaplin’s sidekickadopted waif in this timeless classic, widely regarded as one of the finest films of the silent era. In his first feature-length feature as director, Chaplin conjures “a picture with a smile – and perhaps a tear”, perfecting the blend of humour, pathos and tragedy that would make him a beloved icon around the world. No child or adult could watch this and remain unmoved.Lotte Reiniger’s 1926 German production is one of the oldest surviving animated features, and suffers from the kind of racial and gender stereotyping that beset so many films of this period. But for audiences mature enough to see beyond the outmoded politics, it offers a fascinating insight into the history of animation. Taking inspiration from One Thousand and One Nights, Reiniger’s film has influenced countless children’s classics, from Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs to The Sword in the Stone and Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows.Disney’s first feature-length animation played to packed houses of all ages when first released. An astonishing technical achievement, it benefited from eye-popping artwork, spine-tingling music, and an occasionally horrifying narrative (the BBFC originally rated it A, and it only got an uncut U in 1987). This note of brooding darkness would continue throughout all the finest Disney films, connecting them to the great traditions of the Brothers Grimm, and proving that children appreciate a touch of fear with their fun.Flying monkeys, terrifying twisters and melting witches – they’re all here in MGM’s brilliant adaptation of L Frank Baum’s fantastical source material. Shirley Temple was originally considered for the lead role of Dorothy, a part Judy Garland made her own. Despite winning an Oscar for best song, Arlen and Harburg’s Over the Rainbow nearly hit the cutting room floor after studio execs worried that the sepia-toned Kansas scenes were too long, and younger kids wouldn’t understand the complex emotions of the lyrics.Satyajit Ray’s directorial debut won the best human document award at the 1956 Cannes film festival, and became a key text in the evolution of modern Indian cinema. Adapted from the novel by Bibhutibhushan Bandyopadhyay, Ray’s film portrays the struggles and smiles of impoverished village life with clarity and compassion, aided by a wonderfully natural performance from young Subir Banerjee. The film was followed by Aparajito and Apur Sansar, which together form the acclaimed Apu trilogy.Albert Lamorisse’s short French film follows the adventures of a young boy who finds a balloon that seems to have a mind of its own. A beacon of hope amid a darkened landscape, it’s an endlessly intriguing and inspiring slice of poetic postwar cinema. Lamorisse won an Oscar for best screenplay, becoming the only person ever to triumph in this category with a short film.Jean-Pierre Léaud is the restless spirit who comes of age in François Truffaut’s nouvelle vague masterpiece. The French title, Les Quatre Cents Coups, refers to an expression meaning “to raise hell”, capturing the rebellious nature of Antoine Doinel, an alter ego character drawn in part from Truffaut’s own youthful experiences. Léaud would play Antoine in a succession of subsequent movies ning two decades.Barry Hines’s novel A Kestrel for a Knave is brought to the screen with astonishing verisimilitude by Ken Loach in this masterpiece of British social-realist cinema. David “Dai” Bradley is the young Billy Caspar whose dreams take flight when he trains and tends to a bird that becomes his closest companion. Despite an unforgivingly downbeat ending, Kes remains essential viewing for anyone who believes in the transcendent power of honest art.Originally released in France as Pollux et le Chat Bleu, this feature-length spinoff from The Magic Roundabout arrived in the UK with the voices of Eric Thompson and Fenella Fielding. Together they transform Serge Danot’s peculiar stop-motion animation into a brilliantly bizarre and eerily haunting oddity that continues to attract new generations of fans. No wonder Black Mirror creator Charlie Brooker chose Florence’s Sad Song (a track from the movie) as one of his selections on Desert Island Discs.Only on DVD (Second Sight Films)Writer-director Lionel Jeffries works pure screen wonder with Antonia Barber’s novel The Ghosts. When a family become housekeepers of a derelict mansion, time-travelling magic forges friendships across the ages. While Jeffries may be more celebrated for directing The Railway Children (one of the most enduring British children’s movies), this is his true masterpiece.Produced by the National Film Board of Canada, Caroline Leaf’s Oscar-nominated short – a mere 10 minutes in length – uses paint on glass animation to bring Mordecai Richler’s story (which addresses the taboo subject of death) to life with empathy and wit. In a 2003 interview, Leaf said that the key to her adaptation was “to drop as much of the text as possible, putting the storytelling into the images”.Free at nfb.cafilmthe_streetThis tearjerking tale of a young boy’s friendship with a stranded space alien may technically be a sci-fi movie, but it also represents a very personal account of director Steven Spielberg’s down-to-earth feelings of childhood isolation and anxiety following his parents’ orce. A wonderful script by Melissa Mathison and a surging score by John Williams help this to pack a mighty emotional punch.It’s hard to decide which of Hayao Miyazaki’s matchless animations to include in this list (Princess Mononoke, Spirited Away, Howl’s Moving Castle and Ponyo are all classics) but this 1988 Studio Ghibli offering about young children befriending forest spirits retains a special place in many viewers’ hearts. As with all of the Ghibli films, My Neighbour Totoro boasts the pan-generational appeal that has made Miyazaki’s works so popular.Only on DVD (StudioCanal)Frances Hodgson Burnett’s book has inspired several movies, from a 1919 production starring Lila Lee to a forthcoming version written by Harry Potter and the Cursed Child playwright Jack Thorne. But Agnieszka Holland’s 1993 adaptation, which earned a supporting actress Bafta nomination for Maggie Smith, is a particular delight, hailed by Roger Ebert as “a work of beauty, poetry and deep mystery… like entering for a time into a closed world where one’s destiny may be discovered”.Gillian Armstrong’s hugely likable adaptation of Louisa May Alcott’s novel about the lives of the four March sisters earned Oscar nominations for Thomas Newman’s score, Colleen Atwood’s costumes, and Winona Ryder’s starring role as Jo March. First brought to the screen in the silent era, the novel has inspired films by such luminaries as George Cukor and Mervyn LeRoy, with a new version written and directed by Greta Gerwig due to open in the UK in the new year.Youssou N’Dour provides the music for Michel Ocelot’s international co-production, an animated fable, inspired by a west African folk tale, about a young boy who takes on a sorceress terrorising his village. The BBFC, who rated the film U, note correctly that it contains “mild violence, peril and natural nudity” – the last of which reportedly caused problems in some territories.Only on DVD (BFI)Keisha Castle-Hughes shines in Niki Caro’s breakout New Zealand hit, based on the novel of the same name by Māori writer Witi Ihimaera. A young girl fights for the right to become the leader of her tribe – a role traditionally reserved for men. Castle-Hughes earned a best actress Oscar nomination, making her at the time the youngest ever nominee in that category (a record later broken by Quvenzhané Wallis for her performance in Beasts of the Southern Wild).It’s arguable that Angus, Thongs and Perfect Snogging, Gurinder Chadha’s 2008 adaptation of Louise Rennison’s teen novels, better suits the “children’s film” remit of this list. But her 2002 classic about the friendship between two young women (winningly played by Parminder Nagra and Keira Knightley) who bond on the football pitch seems even more pertinent today than it did when the film first came out. A hit with audiences and critics alike, Bend It Like Beckham spawned a stage musical and continues to inspire new viewers.Byambasuren Davaa, co-director of The Story of the Weeping Camel, returns to her Mongolian homeland for this blend of fact and fiction, centring on a family of hard-working nomads whose work-life cycles are defined by the rhythm of the seasons. Whether making cheese, dismantling their yurt or playing with dried dung (a highlight for the kids!) the Batchuluuns remind us that, trite as it may sound, life’s true joys lie in the simple things. A lovely movie with the power to engross, educate and entertain.Originally entitled Taare Zameen Par, this hugely popular Indian drama, produced and directed by Aamir Khan, follows young Ishaan (Darsheel Safary) as he faces up to educational challenges. India’s submission for the 2009 foreign language film Oscar, Like Stars on Earth was picked up by Disney on DVD, bringing it to the attention of a worldwide audience. Waad Mohammed is terrific as the titular Saudi girl who enters a Koran recitation competition in the hope of raising the funds she needs to buy herself a coveted bicycle. Written and directed by Saudi Arabian film-maker Haifaa al-Mansour, this Bafta-nominated treat is a little miracle – a film that challenges rules and stereotypes with a lightness of touch that makes it accessible to all.Inspired by the true-life story of Phiona Mutesi, this uplifting film follows a young woman living in the slums of Uganda whose life is changed by her talent for chess. Madina Nalwanga, David Oyelowo and Lupita Nyong’o head up a very engaging ensemble cast with whom director Mira Nair works wonders (fun fact: Moonlight helmer Barry Jenkins was at one point in the running to direct).UK-based Dutch animator Michaël Dudok de Wit directs this Japanese-French-Belgian co-production – a first for Studio Ghibli. A poignant, wordless tale of a man shipwrecked on a desert island, it boasts a sublime simplicity that unifies its complex elements into a singular, universal voice. Eloquent, profound and moving, The Red Turtle benefits from a wonderful score by Laurent Perez del Mar that says more than words ever could.Adapted from Deborah Ellis’s much-loved YA book, Nora Twomey’s beautifully animated tale of youthful fortitude in Taliban-era Afghanistan has something of the defiant feminist spirit of the French-Iranian gem Persepolis. When her father is imprisoned, young Parvana is forced to don’s men’s clothes in order to provide for her family.

Symptoms include tiredness, headaches, nausea and diarrhoea.It takes our bodies one day to adjust to a time difference of one hour, so Gardiner recommends pre-emptively adjusting our clocks at home: one hour a day towards the time zone to which you are travelling, no more than three days before travelling. “If the duration of travel is less than the number of time zones you travel across, you need to plan – getting your body used to the new time zone will help you adjust much faster.”“Diet plays a large part in setting the body clock,” says Lisa Artis, an adviser at the Sleep Council, which promotes healthy sleep habits. “Once you are on the plane, set your watch to the local time at your destination, then eat according to normal meal times at your destination.” Heavy meals increase our sleep drive, so a balanced diet helps kickstart our body clock into its destination timings.Be sure to drink plenty of water. Gardiner says that our body clocks can be set off-kilter by dehydration. “People don’t drink enough water on planes and often replace it with alcohol, which is a depressant and dehydrating, or they drink too much caffeine, which keeps you awake,” she says. “Your body needs to re-adjust naturally to its new time zone and it’s not advisable to manipulate it.”Dr Guy Meadows, a co-founder of the insomnia treatment service Sleep School, recommends getting 20 to 30 minutes of natural light exposure the morning after arriving at your destination. “Our body clocks are connected to light-receptive cells in our eyes, so making sure to darken down throughout the day is a very powerful way of synchronising with your new environment,” he says.If you are adamant about avoiding jet lag, travelling west – and therefore lengthening your day by going backwards through time zones – will alleviate the symptoms. Timings your flights is also important – Meadows says that we need at least 10 hours of wakefulness to induce a restful sleep. Factoring this into your flight time, and arriving after sunset, will help adjust your schedule."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e59e50977069728d6155d217c88e141aa2501ce0/0_18_4904_2944/master/4904.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bc1052292384ee91932455652a219d97","title":"has brexit saved the lib dems","story":"The Lib Dems have made an extraordinary comeback in 2019 because of their anti-Brexit stance.

Foreign Office veterans, however, defended the ambassador’s cables as nothing more than the type of frank talk expected of diplomats.Scotland Yard has launched an investigation into the leak to the Mail on Sunday and at one stage suggested editors could be prosecuted for publishing sensitive material.In his account of the affair, Edginton admitted to believing he could be arrested for his role even though he was not “the leaker”. He said he had begun investigating this year how the civil service was preparing for Brexit.“There had been repeated reports claiming that Europhile mandarins have been quietly working to thwart the result of the referendum,” he wrote. “I just wanted to discover the truth. This was not a Brexiteer plot to topple Sir Kim, nor was it some devilish scheme to torpedo the independence of the civil service by installing a political appointee in Washington. Instead, it was simply an honest journalistic endeavour.”Edginton, who has vowed to protect the identity of his “trusted source”, said he spoke to serving and former civil servants to find out about their role during preparations for Brexit. He said he was passed a letter written by Darroch describing the White House as “inept”. He realised it was a significant story and contacted Isabel Oakeshott, the journalist under whose byline the Darroch story first appeared in the Mail on Sunday.Edginton said: “I appreciate that my CV – and my pro-Brexit views – will inevitably fuel the conspiracy theories but I want to be absolutely clear: the leak of Sir Kim’s cables had absolutely nothing to do with the Brexit party.”Edginton worked initially for the political website Westmonster, founded by the Brexit-backer Arron Banks, before periods as a digital strategist at the Taxpayers’ Alliance and Leave Means Leave campaign. Since April he has been employed by the Brexit party, organising its social media feeds.In his Mail on Sunday article, Edginton said his name was left out of the original story to avoid “possible controversy”.It was a big scoop for a young journalist with no formal training. Although it is not unusual for British tabloids to use the work of journalists without giving them a credit, it is unusual for the freelancer to out themselves at a later date. Edginton said he had already provided stories on this basis to the Sunday Times, the Daily , the Sun’s website and the Mail on Sunday.Edginton previously described Oakeshott as “one of the best journalists this country has to offer” after she ran a story in the Sunday Times about Banks’s links to the Russian embassy.“I first contacted Isabel three years ago, when I was 16 and still at state school, asking if I could interview her for my YouTube channel,” he wrote this year, explaining that he had since accompanied her to many public appearances.In another tweet, recently deleted, he described helping Oakeshott to prepare for a Question Time appearance in December 2017.Having started an obscure politics YouTube channel while still a teenager, Edginton interviewed a number of prominent political figures and began adopting an increasingly pro-Brexit stance, which opened a number of doors.Last summer, he turned down the offer of a place at the London School of Economics to continue working for Westmonster, the hyper-partisan online news outlet founded by Banks and formeMichael Heaver, a former spokesman for Nigel Farage and now a Brexit party MEP.He then picked up a number of roles in quick succession, including a stint as digital campaign manager at the Taxpayers’ Alliance, and this year began work doing digital strategy work for Leave Means Leave. The pro-Brexit organisation was founded by the businessman Richard Tice.After Tice co-founded the Brexit party with Farage to fight the EU elections, Edginton joined as head of digital campaigns, where he was one of the few iniduals with access to the party’s Facebook page during the EU elections – helping to oversee a series of slick videos.

And despite rumours of Brussels compromises in the works, the EU has no off-the-shelf Brexit plan for the new prime minister, who is expected to be announced on Tuesday.Danuta Hübner, a Polish centre-right member of the European parliament’s Brexit steering group, said there was a “worrying” lack of time to find a compromise before Britain’s departure day on 31 October.She could not imagine the EU putting anything new on the table, but said it remained open to renegotiating the political declaration on future relations. “We cannot change the major red lines on our side, that there is no possibility of renegotiating the agreement, including the backstop.”Johnson and Hunt have vowed to tear up the backstop, the fallback plan to prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland, which both men have voted for at least once. Recent reports have suggested the EU is ready to offer a five-year transition to break the deadlock over the backstop.But three EU sources said this was a rehash of debates from the negotiation period, rather than fresh ideas. “It’s all quite ancient” and “not something that we are considering at all”, an official said.Another favourite Tory idea, a time limit on the backstop, also appears to be based on bar-room conversations that took place more than a year ago rather than new proposals. Before the backstop was agreed, time limits were “mused over by iniduals, typically over a beer”, said the official. The idea was never seriously discussed in the EU27’s formal negotiations and disappeared after Theresa May “embraced the backstop”, the person said.In what is seen as a major concession to the government, the prime minister persuaded the EU to accept a UK-wide backstop, rather than the original Northern Ireland-only plan.EU officials are also disappointed that guarantees to avoid the backstop – seen in Brussels as generous and far-reaching – did not help persuade MPs to support the withdrawal agreement, which was rejected three times.Between December 2018 and March 2019, the EU issued three sets of promises outlining speedy work on a future trade deal to avoid the backstop. Each text became more elaborate, culminating in the Strasbourg agreement, with its pledge of joint work on “alternative arrangements” to avoid a backstop – a key phrase for Tory backbenchers.But the Strasbourg agreement failed to move Eurosceptics who feared being “trapped” in a permanent customs union with the EU, after the attorney general, Geoffrey Cox, confirmed it provided no unilateral exit from the backstop.Officials believe they could work on similar guarantees, but are not convinced this will help Johnson win a majority. “People say that he is better at selling things than Madame May,” said the senior source. “It’s not a huge hope.”As Brussels waits for Johnson, the commission’s Brexit negotiating taskforce will be on standby over the summer.Meanwhile, the EU is trying to figure out whether Johnson is serious about his “do or die” rhetoric, or will attempt the political backflip of selling a rebranded version of May’s deal. “The next British prime minister has to choose whether they want to ruin their career on Brexit or move on,” an EU diplomat said.Some are still trying to figure our his true views on the EU. Hübner recalls a “wonderful conversation” with Johnson when, as European regional policy commissioner, she visited the then London mayor in 2008, to announce EU funds for East End startups. “He was also very positive about EU transfers to London to support a project. Now when I hear very nasty comments about the European Union, I am thinking: is this the same person?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7b93f66b20f1b62a21c89ede50492941545cb250/0_123_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fbe5a1bd06f183660757359966f40e1a","title":"uk defence minister tobias ellwood rebuffs criticism over tanker seized in gulf iran","story":"Tobias Ellwood denies Britain took ‘eye off the ball’ and says priority is to reduce tensionsThe defence minister, Tobias Ellwood, has rejected the charge that a British-flagged tanker seized by Iran in the Gulf could have been better protected, and said the priority for the UK must be to de-escalate tensions.Ellwood also called for more spending on the Royal Navy, and said the US’s decision to withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal had played a part in the increasing tensions in the region.Among critics of UK government actions ahead of the seizure of the Stena Impero in what the British says were international waters has been Admiral Lord West, the former first sea lord.Writing in the Observer, West said ministers should have done more, suggesting those responsible for such decisions were distracted by the race to succeed Theresa May.But asked on Sky’s Sophy Ridge on Sunday programme whether the UK had taken its “eye off the ball”, Ellwood replied: “No, not at all.”While the UK was sending another destroyer and a support ship to the region, he said, British vessels were going through 100 nautical miles of waterway every day. “It is impossible simply to escort each inidual vessel,” he said.Ellwood added that the situation had also changed quickly. “Let’s place it into context – this has been a sudden spike in activity, in threat, that’s ratcheted up in the last few weeks. And it takes time to respond there.”Asked what the response should be, he said: “Firstly we need to try and de-escalate this. We’ve seen a ratcheting up of tensions in the Middle East.”The situation with the tanker was, he argued, “part of a wider geo-political challenge that Iran is facing with the west”.Ellwood said: “So our first and most important responsibility is to make sure we get a solution to the issue to do with the current ship, make sure that other British-flagged ships are safe to operate in these waters, and then look at the wider picture of having a working, proper, professional relationship with Iran.“But this is a hostile act, let’s not dodge away from that. This is a serious matter which Iran must recognise.”Asked if sanctions were possible, Ellwood said the government’s Cobra emergencies committee met on Saturday, “so we’re looking at the operational responsibilities from that but, yes, we are going to be looking at a series of options”.He called for more money to be invested in defence. “If we want to continue playing a role on the international stage – bearing in mind that threats are changing, all happening just beneath the threshold of all-out war – then we must invest more in our defence, including our Royal Navy.“Our Royal Navy is too small to manage our interests across the globe, if that’s our future intentions, and that’s something the next prime minister will need to recognise.”Asked if the US’s withdrawal from the nuclear deal played a role, Ellwood said: “There is a concern that we have a difference of opinion with the United States on the nuclear itself. France, Germany and ourselves believe that it has paid idends, has actually prevented nuclear weapons being developed in Iran.“We can’t deny that this tactical threat, and escalation of issues in the Strait of Hormuz, factors into this bigger picture.”Speaking later on the Sophy Ridge show, Labour’s shadow justice secretary, Richard Burgon, said it was important to avoid the UK being sucked into a wider US-led conflict, and to prevent a repeat of the “great tragedy of Iraq”.Burgon said: “What we want to ensure doesn’t happen is that the mistakes of the past are repeated. The mistakes of the past cost many, many lives. The mistakes of the past made things worse, and fuelled terrorism and hatred. And that’s what we don’t want. We don’t want to be a situation where things get out of control.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9f35d540c476f742ba1b508ade49ce05130ab309/680_1501_3548_2129/master/3548.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=beb1f55a2e1d2172ab8a85d768111398","title":"vince cable  unite for remain lib dem interview","story":"The outgoing Lib Dem leader talks about his party’s dramatic reversal of fortune and the decisions facing his successorEven in times of relative calm, British politics rarely allows party leaders to bow out on a high. Just a few months ago, it appeared that Sir Vince Cable’s tenure as Liberal Democrat leader would end in a similar whimper.Yet as he contemplates his party’s mixed fortunes, from the collapse in support after the coalition years to its recent recovery from the brink of the abyss, he is convinced it is now well placed to be part of a broader revival of liberal, mainstream politics that not so very long ago had seemingly gone out of fashion.“If you go back over the history of the 1920s and 30s, there was a slow death of liberal England,” Cable says, speaking to the Observer before his successor is announced this week. “You could perhaps have the slow rebirth through a series of stages. It probably won’t happen in just one general election. I can see a series of electoral events in which cracks emerge and develop in the existing structures and people get together in a different way.”Cable is keen that his replacement go much further in plotting a Remain alliance with like-minded parties – suggesting that it could be the catalyst for a major realignment of British politics. And while he is heading to the backbenches, he is ready and willing to help with the heavy lifting that will be needed.“People might not see me as a good figurehead, but I’m certainly willing to be part of it,” he says.The Lib Dems have already managed to negotiate an alliance with the Greens and Plaid Cymru in the Brecon and Radnorshire byelection next month to maximise the chances of victory for an unambiguously pro-Remain party. Now Cable is calling on his party to go “quite a long way” further in forging a national alliance. He is also holding out the possibility of working with some Tories and Labour, should it change course.“I’m genuinely interested in these attempts to get cross-party working, getting people working with us, unite for Remain,” he says. “I think there is a lot more to be done in that space. If I can help on that, I will.Cable believes it is possible for the Lib Dems to become the largest party at the next election, which he expects to happen in the spring at the latest. He says his successor faces a “major strategic choice” over whether to continue the party’s attempts to rebuild by narrowly targeting seats or to adopt a much more ambitious programme.“That’s the big choice that the leader and party conference in September will have to make,” he says. “My instincts are that we can’t and shouldn’t abandon the targeting. This idea of working at the grassroots and really building up a local base is absolutely fundamental to our success, to the extent that we’ve had it, and you can’t walk away from that. But there is a potential upside that we’ve got to imagine too.”The next Lib Dem leader will be revealed this week, with Jo Swinson the favourite to defeat Ed Davey. However, several sources have indicated that votes received so far suggest a 5050 split between the two candidates, meaning a surprise result is possible.Cable describes his experience as leader as “mixed”. He has been frustrated by some of the behind-the-scenes battles necessary to safeguard the party, which only months ago was fighting for its future before a major upturn in its electoral fortunes. However, he is happy to have met activists outside the “Westminster bubble”, something he describes as the top perk.He regrets being associated with an attempt to oust Nick Clegg as Lib Dem leader at the end of the coalition years (a “painful episode”, he says, though insisting he was not directly involved), and also believes he would have done a “good job” had he been able to run for leader in 2007.Had it been offered in the immediate aftermath of the referendum, he says he would have voted for a soft Brexit compromise. Now, he fears, there is no chance of such an agreement. The most likely outcome, in his view, is that Boris Johnson will slightly alter Theresa May’s Brexit deal, “the ‘lipstick on a pig’ kind of thing”, and win enough votes.He is seriously concerned about the looming risk of a recession and how powerless governments and central banks could be should it arrive. Given the plaudits he won for his economic warnings ahead of the great financial crisis of 2007-08, those concerns are worth listening to.“There are quite a lot of red flashing lights,” he says. “It’s a mug’s game to say there is going to be a recession, but recession risk is certainly pretty high right now. I think we should be worried, very worried.“What happened in the financial crisis was the economic equivalent of a heart attack. The patient was kept alive by having adrenaline pumped in through little wires. We’re still attached to the life-support system.“That is what is so odd and also so dangerous about it – governments have used up the conventional monetary policy. Levels of government debt to the economy are still historically very high. So the scope for traditional anti-recession measures has already been significantly used up. There are things lurking in the background.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9e082b2aa6f8fbbc5ba05467c26a5558e0138e45/0_58_1728_1037/master/1728.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ebec22de3d87bd41758a13cbfbecdbdf","title":"senior doctors call for crackdown on home genetic testing kits","story":"False results have told women they have mutations linked to breast and ovarian cancer Senior doctors have called for a crackdown on consumer genetic tests, following an influx of patients who have been wrongly told they are carrying dangerous mutations linked to cancer or other devastating conditions.Women have been incorrectly informed by companies that they have faulty BRCA genes, which convey a high risk of breast and ovarian cancers. One patient was scheduled for preventive breast-removal surgery after a consumer genetic test suggested she had a BRCA mutation. The surgery was called off at the last moment when an NHS laboratory revealed the result to be a false positive.Doctors warn that the issue is placing an increasing burden on GP surgeries and NHS genetics clinics, which are left to deal with the fallout when people receive alarming or confusing results.“I’m not saying ban these tests, but they need more regulating,” she said.A recent analysis of a genetic testing chip that has been used by direct-to-consumer companies, found that for typical disease-causing BRCA mutations, when the test gave a positive result it was far more likely than not to be wrong.Lucassen said she is personally aware of about 10 cases of patients being referred to genetics services after having tested positive for BRCA or bowel cancer mutations, which were later shown to be glitches when NHS labs conducted more rigorous tests. “I feel this is the tip of the iceberg,” she said.Consumer genetics tests, offering insights on health and ancestry, have had a surge in popularity in the past few years, with hundreds of thousands of people in the UK thought to have undergone testing. The major consumer genetics companies, such as 23andMe or AncestryDNA, typically offer just ancestry testing or health readouts restricted to a handful of conditions. However, consumers can download their raw genetic data and send it to third-party companies, which for as little as £20 provide results and analysis on thousands of genes.The problem is that the chip technology used by 23andMe and AncestryDNA is not designed to give accurate results for rare mutations, which secondary companies, such as Promethease and LiveWello, provide information about.Although these companies normally state that any findings should not be treated as a medical diagnosis, consumers – and even doctors – may be unaware of just how unreliable such results can be.Caroline Wright, a genomics researcher at Exeter University who led the analysis, said: “The findings are shockingly bad. At the point where they’re this bad, you have to think about not sharing the data. It can be so damaging to the inidual if they find out this completely erroneous information.”Wright said that the genotyping chips used by some companies might perform slightly better, but that the technology is fundamentally not designed to detect rare mutations.Lucassen described how one of her female patients had been scheduled for a double mastectomy on the basis of findings that were shown to be flawed when the genetic analysis was redone in NHS laboratories, which use more powerful genotyping techniques. When the repeat tests came back negative, Lucassen said the patient asked: “Can I have the surgery anyway just to be on the safe side?” Although she was ultimately dissuaded, “she wasn’t at all reassured by finding this was a false positive,” Lucassen said.Jan Cobben, a clinical genetics consultant at Northwick Park hospital in north-west London, said he had encountered two separate cases of parents who tested positive for mutations linked to deafness and thought the genes could be affecting their children. In one case, the family had a deaf child and thought they had found an explanation. A different set of parents had been dealing with the fairly common frustration that their child often seemed to ignore what they were saying, but the genetic result led them to fear that there could be a serious underlying medical condition.“They think: ‘Oh my God, it’s related,’” said Cobben. “There’s a gene for hearing where abnormalities are not very rare. We repeated the test and the supposed abnormality was just a normal variant.”Cobben said he would advise anyone considering private genetic screening: “Stay away, don’t do it.” “You shouldn’t do any medical testing without a reason,” he said. “It’s a basic medical principle.”In response to questions, Kwame Iwegbue, CEO of LiveWello, which carries out secondary analysis of DNA data, said the company does not alert customers to the risk of false positive or false negative results because these are “qualities of diagnostic tests”. “LiveWello does not provide any diagnostic testing,” he said.Iwegbue said it was “absolutely” reasonable for NHS clinics to cover the cost of interpreting and validating private genetic tests. “A direct consequence of access to third-party online tools like LiveWello and access to ubiquitous sources of online medical knowledge is that patients nowadays are empowered and informed,” he said. “At the very least the information they acquire from these sources provide talking points for a more rewarding doctor-patient encounter … If the information presented by the patient is in fact wrong, the doctor can use this opportunity to explain the reasons why, and then present the patient with what they consider to be the correct information.”Greg Lennon, a co-founder of Promethease, said: “When we can, we specifically warn our users of likely miscalls, and in addition, we remind people that reported associations depend on the accuracy of the data.”Lennon sent screenshots of example reports where a false positive is thought to be likely, which prominently alert the user to this possibility.A spokeswoman for 23andMe said: “There is a distinction between the validated variants we report on in our … reports and the raw, unvalidated data customers may choose to download on their own. We do not advise customers to utilise third-party interpretation services and note the risks of doing so very clearly on our website and within customers’ 23andMe accounts.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6652b9a30a1d4624bc6a3313f1d7cff745f7d8de/0_361_5366_3221/master/5366.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a692a9214a4e213d192b87ed1adc7f0c","title":"market harborough most liveable place in england  homes we can afford","story":"East Midlands town is unexpected winner in a search for the best places for affordability and quality of life. Its proud residents explain why they like it“We’ve still got a fishmonger. How many places still have that?” asked Kate Gander, listing the merits of her home, Market Harborough. In fact, she struggled to find anything negative at all to say about the Leicestershire town. “It’s got fantastic railway connections and it’s not too overrun by big businesses,” she said.Market Harborough today comes top in a league table of the most – and least – liveable places in England. Balancing the affordability of homes with factors that make a place desirable to live in, such as employment opportunities and the performance of local schools, Harborough, Hart in Hampshire, the Isles of Scilly and Chorley in Lancashire are at the top of the table. Hackney, in east London, Middlesbrough and Manchester languish at the bottom.Gander’s enthusiasm was echoed by stallholder Tina Horton. “I deliberately set up a business in Harborough. The market is just like a big family. All the little shops make it what it is.”House prices in the town are generally a little higher than the national average, but rents are a little lower – and above-average earnings of the town’s population (£33,700 compared with a national figure of £30,400) bolster its “affordability” score, one of the report’s key criteria. Nearly nine out of 10 locals are in work, and the area’s secondary schools score well. Residents can expect to live two years longer than most people in the UK.But it’s not just about statistics. Small independent retailers reign supreme in the quaint town centre, which is dominated by the medieval St Dionysius’ church and 17th-century timbered Old Grammar School, now a covered market and museum. Last week, colourful flower displays were standing up well to the pouring rain and there was a striking absence of empty shops.Next month, the town will host the Leicestershire County Show, featuring motorcycle stuntman Flyin’ Ryan, sheep shearing and donkey rides. The Harborough Theatre is screening the National Theatre’s production of Small Island, adapted from Andrea Levy’s novel, this weekend, and the Royal Shakespeare Company’s Measure for Measure at the end of the month. London is an hour away by train and there are direct services to Leicester, Nottingham and Sheffield.“Market Harborough is a beautiful market town, the villages surrounding it are beautiful, and there is such a strong sense of community. We’re thrilled to be recognised in such a positive light,” said Neil O’Brien, the local Conservative MP.The report, written by a former Treasury economist, Chris Walker, for Your Housing Group, aims to “create a more real-world and accurate picture of what affordability is, and where exactly more affordable new-build housing is most urgently needed”.It has given every local authority in England a score based on three metrics – affordability, opportunity and desirability – based on factors such as jobs, income, educational attainment, burglary rates, the number of empty homes and life expectancy.London fares badly in the resulting “liveability index”, mainly because of its unaffordability and average quality of life. Four out of the country’s 10 least-liveable places are in the capital – Hackney, Newham, Barking and Dagenham, and Enfield – and there is no London borough with above-average affordability.The East Midlands dominates the top of the table, with five of the top 10 most liveable places, and the south-west scores best overall.Brian Cronin, head of Your Housing Group, said: “The big ide in living standards this report exposes is a direct result of the private sector’s failure to build enough affordable homes in the right places, and we are calling for a much bigger role for housing associations to fill the gap. What we need, though, is the ability to access private as well as public finance and we will be publishing new ideas for this later this summer.”The report identified “where exactly we need more new homes that meet the needs of the majority of people on modest earnings”.Alex Cunningham, the shadow housing minister, said: “By looking at the cost of housing in its wider context – availability of jobs, average incomes, quality of schools, safety of an area – we get a much fuller picture of Britain’s dire housing crisis. This research shows that, from Stockton to Southampton, hard-working families are facing a crisis of liveability.”The country needed more affordable homes, investment in skills and education, and more money for our police, he added."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d5ed69872ebe1ce9df0d58d526bf7c609054b3d7/1106_724_2297_1379/master/2297.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=14bbcd187ece00a881376ea56ce81318","title":"andrea atzeni enable king george ascot frankie dettori defoe","story":"If there is to be a surprise outcome to the King George on Saturday, Andrea Atzeni will surely have something to do with it.Flat racing’s midsummer highlight will be billed as a clash between the dual Arc winner Enable and the doughty Crystal Ocean, but only the foolhardy will fail to consider the claims of Atzeni aboard one of this season’s surprise packages, Defoe.“He’s definitely improved,” the jockey says as we mull the grey’s prospects in the Newmarket weighing room. He praises the trainer Roger Varian and work rider Korrie Hall for the progress they have wrought from Defoe. But more will be needed if Atzeni is to get the better of Enable’s rider, his friend and compatriot Frankie Dettori.There is something approaching reverence in Atzeni’s voice when he discusses the older man, for all that they have been riding against each other for a dozen years. “I’ve been looking up to Frankie since I was a kid,” he says. “I still do it now.”This does not mean any quarter is given on the track. Dettori can seem to cast a spell over other riders, as in the Irish Oaks on Saturday, which was run in a way that suited only his horse. But perhaps Atzeni is as well placed as anyone to recognise Dettori’s tactics and counter them.In the buildup to this King George, part of the QIPCO British Champions Series, he can draw upon the happy memory of Postponed’s success in the race four years ago, when he held off a Dettori‑ridden favourite Eagle Top. Atzeni tracked the pace and got the rail in the straight his rival had to come around the field and was beaten an inch. “That was one of the best days of my life,” the 28-year-old says, grinning broadly.Evidently there is some sort of bond between the pair. Both were given whip-related suspensions of a few days for their efforts in that finish and spent the time on holiday at Dettori’s home in Sardinia.Three weeks ago both were in Siena to watch the latest running of the Palio, an ancient and dangerous race around the Tuscan city’s main square. Atzeni’s cousin, Giovanni, was the winning jockey.“I wouldn’t ride in it if you give me all the money in the world,” he says. “But it’s a great thing to go and watch. The atmosphere is unbelievable.”Though the jockeyship gene evidently runs in the family, Atzeni had no early connection to racing and had to beg his father, Giuliano, a Sardinian farmer, for four years before a pony was allowed on the premises. These days, Giuliano’s attitude towards the sport has softened.“He follows racing, 24-seven. On a Sunday they go for lunch with friends, he would bring his laptop so he can watch all my races. If you ask me how many winners I’ve ridden this year, I probably couldn’t tell you. My dad’ll tell you. It’s weird, because he was so anti horses.” Sheikh Mohammed Obaid, Atzeni’s main employer, has occasionally gifted horses to the jockey’s parents and they race in Italy in the colours of his mother, Rita.Win or lose on Saturday, Atzeni is very happy with his current situation but at some stage he would like to try basing himself in the US. “England is great, got the best racing in the world, the best horses, I’ve been lucky enough to ride all over the world and I couldn’t change England for anywhere else. But I do think, if I didn’t have the job I have and I wasn’t riding for Roger, I probably wouldn’t be here. The prize money’s terrible and we travel too much.“I could see myself one day finishing my career in America. I love American racing. I spent two months in Santa Anita in California and loved it. My weight is good, ’cos I’m quite small. It’s a very similar riding style. Money’s good, the life’s good. The only thing that puts me off at the moment is it’s too far away from my family. One day ...”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/18c5bfea7f9839168524e3f4b8453c9991554383/108_338_2985_1790/master/2985.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3e4d74a1820015cb0a8352344bccbf4e","title":"novak djokovic men women equal pay tennis womens world cup football","story":"If you wanted to put the popularity of women’s football into figures then the most impressive one is 11.7 million. That’s the number of people in the UK who watched England’s World Cup semi-final against the USA on TV. In these days of multi-channels and platforms that is properly large, suggesting that, at least at the international level, women’s football has captured not just the public’s attention but also its imagination.Of course, that is not to say that it is going to rival men’s football anytime soon, but it does say a few other things. From being viewed as a joke or a kind of pathetic imitation of the men’s game, women’s football has gradually gained respect among women and men. Having ranked as an obscure curiosity, it has established mainstream appeal. And from being subject to the casual and sometimes premeditated sexism that has dominated the sport, women’s football has forged a basis for equality.Not equality of pay or celebrity but in terms of performance. After all, the Women’s World Cup featured the same rules and regulations as any men’s football tournament. There was no lighter load or lesser demand. And that’s something from which a sport that has led the way in fighting the female cause could learn a lesson.Back in the dark days of sporting sexism, when women were seen primarily as genteel amateurs or competitors to be judged by their appearance, women’s tennis was the crucible of what was to be a long and largely victorious battle to gain parity with male players. This was the era of the so-called Battle of the Sexes, the name given to the 1973 televised exhibition matches between the 55-year-old former world No 1 Bobby Riggs and women’s champion Billie Jean King.As the recent Hollywood film based on the clash put it, Riggs intended to put the show back into chauvinism. “The best way to handle women is to keep them pregnant and barefoot,” he announced. In the event King won what was a bizarre spectacle, but perhaps more importantly she played a key role in helping to organise women’s players so they could achieve financial parity with the men’s game.Speed forward a few decades and at Wimbledon this year the winner of the men’s title Novak Djokovic earned £2.3m, while the winner of the women’s title Simona Halep got exactly the same amount. It has been a principle for a number of years now that there is no difference in men’s and women’s pay at the top of tennis. So normalised has it become that to question the policy is to immediately occupy the misogynistic position – and who but some unreconstructed neanderthal wants to do that?Well, here goes: there is something wrong about equal pay, at least in the four grand slam tournaments. The problem was exemplified in this year’s respective Wimbledon singles finals. Djokovic took four hours and 57 minutes to beat Roger Federer in an epic match that tested every aspect of the two competitors: skill, stamina, mental strength, you name it.Halep, by contrast, finished her match against Serena Williams in just 56 minutes. That is more than four hours less time than the men’s final. The Romanian played the match of her life and deserved to win. But still, 56 minutes? You don’t book Centre Court by the hour. One reason for the disparity is that in grand slam events, men play the best of five sets. But the women play the same as they do in any other tournament on the circuit: the best of three sets.The question is why? Do they lack the stamina to go five sets? As professional women’s tennis players are superb athletes, and women are perfectly capable of running marathons or playing 90 minutes plus injury time and extra time in football, then the answer has to be no. Three years ago Djokovic got into hot water when he protested that men should be paid more than women’s tennis players. Noting that it was a delicate subject, he began his argument by stating that he supported women’s fight for equal pay. “I applaud them for that, I honestly do. They fought for what they deserve and they got it.”But rather like those misleading moments on court when the Serb looks as if he’s about to collapse, Djokovic was not finished. “On the other hand, I think that our men’s tennis world, ATP world, should fight for more because the stats are showing that we have much more spectators on the men’s tennis matches,” he concluded.Twitter: follow us at @_sportFacebook: like our football and sport pagesInstagram: our favourite photos, films and storiesYouTube: subscribe to our football and sport channelsThat seems like a rather crude argument to me, and also one that could easily be reversed if a popular group of women players were to emerge and Federer, Nadal and co finally retire. So it was no surprise that Djokovic appeared as if he wanted to resurrect the old men-favouring status quo.However, whisper it softly, at the very top of the women’s game, less is required of the players and, as a consequence, it makes for less compelling competition. Now you can say many things about the women’s football World Cup but it certainly delivered in terms of human drama. There was the same kind of exertion and near exhaustion for the players as you see in the male version.Unless there is a global political revolution in the offing, then equal pay in football is about as likely as the Faroe Islands winning the World Cup (men’s or women’s). But at least you can make the argument in the abstract on the perfectly valid grounds that they are doing the same job. You can’t do that in tennis, not in the grand slam competitions that matter most. And that ill-serves the case for parity. Equal pay for equal work is a noble rallying cry. But it’s not one that can be used in good faith in tennis at the moment.Riggs, that clown prince of chauvinism, once identified what he saw as the trouble with the women’s game. “Those women think they’re men, and they go off hitting all over the place,” he said. “They’d be better off if they’d played like women.”The irony is that having beaten him, women’s tennis continues to take his advice."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/076833c0cf7fab52c40595cecb034a350e1e1e7a/0_357_5358_3215/master/5358.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3e938f7f4ea144bd6ada9100971acf5d","title":"the open fourth round live","story":"The crowd falls quiet, as they wonder whether the tide could be dramatically turning. On the par-five 12th, Fleetwood bashes a lovely drive down the middle. Lowry’s tee shot sails off to the right and disappears into the freak kale. Much may depend on how both players respond to this position. Can Fleetwood parlay this advantage into something meaningful on the scoreboard? Or will Lowry escape from a tight spot and refuse to give ground?News of Lee Westwood, who you’ll have noticed has slipped to -7. Bogeys at 11, 12 and now 13, and his week is beginning to unravel. Perhaps, having allowed himself to dream the unexpected dream, the will has now gone. After so many disappointments in the majors, you can kind of understand it. A little boost for Justin Rose, though. He’d bogeyed 3, 6, 8, 9 and 11 to tumble down the rankings, but he strokes in a 20-footer on 12 to rise to -4. Back with the final pairing. Lowry and Fleetwood are both on the green in regulation, but both have long putts for birdie. Fleetwood’s never looks like dropping, but he taps in for par. Lowry’s takes off as it leaves the face of his putter, though, and speeds eight feet past the hole. He’s left with a knee-knocker coming back. He pulls it left, perhaps his worst stroke of the week, and that’s his fourth bogey of the day, his third in the last four. The lead is down to five, which looks like a done deal, but when you’re chasing your first major, nothing is certain.Up on 18, Patrick Reed ends with a level-par 71. He’s -4 after his week’s work. His playing partner Justin Thomas signs for a 72 and he’s -3. Not looking too happy, either, after that triple on 17 cost him a few places. Henrik Stenson and Alex Noren take turns to bogey 14 they’re both -4. And a bogey for Danny Willett on 13, and he’s -7 again. With the wind up - and more rain heading this way, by all accounts - quite a few of the folk in the clubhouse will find themselves in very healthy positions come the end of play.Brooks Koepka struggles his way up 11. He nearly salvages the situation with a long par saver, but the ball stops a turn short. It’s his first bogey since that horror four-bogey start, and he slips back to -6. He’s having a shocker, though nothing compared to his playing partner JB Holmes, who at one point was spotted up the left of 11, his head barely poking out the top of the tall rough, squirting a wedge straight right and into the punters on the other side. He runs up a triple bogey, and clatters all the way down to -2.Lowry splits the fairway at 11. Fleetwood finds the semi-rough down the left. Meanwhile on 12, Westwood three-putts from distance, and he trudges off knowing all hopes of an unlikely fairytale are thoroughly extinguished now. Finau overshoots the green at the par-three 13th and it costs him a shot he’s -7 again. And a birdie for Willett, who snatches back the shot he’d dropped at 11.... pulls his par putt to the left. “It was almost classic match-play,” notes Laura Davies on Sky. She’s not wrong. Lowry looked in a little bother there, but sunk his putt and turned all the pressure onto his opponent. And suddenly there are six shots in it again! That could have been the moment that sealed the deal for Lowry. Neither Lowry nor Fleetwood can find the fairway at 10. And neither can find the green in regulation. Fleetwood bumps his third up from the front to four feet, and will have great chance of saving his par. Lowry gives himself a bit of work to do by chunking a chip from a tufty bank just over the back. He’s got a six-footer across a seriously sloping green. But in it goes! That’s a brilliant putt in the circumstances, and suddenly the pressure’s back on Fleetwood, who ...Tony Finau moves into fourth spot after birdie at 12. He’s -8 and on course for his second top-five finish in this year’s majors - he was tied fifth at Augusta - and consecutive top-ten finishes at the Open, having tied for ninth at Carnoustie last year. Danny Willett will soon join him, following bogey at 11 by nearly slam-dunking his approach into the cup at 12. He’ll tidy up for a bounce-back birdie.Tyrrell Hatton threatened to challenge at times this week, but never quite maintained the required consistency. He’s had a fine four rounds regardless, and signs today for a 69. He’s in the clubhouse at -5, alongside Bob MacIntyre, and the pair are currently looking good for an invite back next year. Meanwhile the 2016 champ Henrik Stenson, who had stumbled out in 39, has since birdied 10 and now 13. He’s -5.With some proper links weather having finally rocked up at this year’s Open, just in time, a few players are moving backwards. Bogey for Finau at 11 he’s -7. Willett follows bogey at 9 with another at 11 he’s -7 too. A double for Fowler at 10 he’s -7 and has just hooked his tee shot at 11 into green mince. And Thomas, who had been going along nicely, bogeys 13 then runs up a triple at 17 after losing a ball. He’s -3.Lowry gives his putt a little bit too much on the left. That’s back-to-back bogeys for the leader, and he turns in level-par 36. Fleetwood knocks in his par effort, and he turns in 37. Just (!) the five in it now. Meanwhile Westwood, who had birdied 10, hands the shot straight back at 11.Lowry demonstrates the importance of taking your medicine when you’re in the jungle. He arrows his third from 140 yards to 15 feet, straight at the flag. A decent chance to save his par. And he’ll want to make it, because Fleetwood clips a wedge up the big green and spins his ball to a halt a couple of feet from the flag. It should be a birdie. It should be.Lowry can only punch out from the rough. Fleetwood’s lie isn’t so bad, and he’s able to lash an iron towards the green, though the wind is so strong, covering the distance is beyond him. The rain has stopped again, so that’s something.Yet another bogey for JB Holmes, this time at 9. He’s -5. His partner Brooks Koepka bangs a long par saver into the cup, and walks off smiling broadly. Having turned in 38 after that opening four-bogey salvo, he’s out of this - he’s -7 - but you sense that he’s enjoying the challenge of these conditions. He’s a born competitor.Having missed a short putt on the last hole, Lowry sends an iron into the deep rough down the right side of 9. He looks a little rattled after that bogey hit him out of nowhere. But if you must feel rattled, best it happens when you’re six shots ahead. And it’s not as though Fleetwood is threatening to launch any sort of charge. He follows him into the same patch of rough. Meanwhile scrub that bit about the weather easing off. The rain’s suddenly back with a vengeance. The players clamber into their waterproofs en masse.Fleetwood’s approach at 8 is a good 15 feet short of the flag. He can’t save his par. But now it’s Lowry’s turn to let his opponent off with one, as he three-putts for a bogey of his own. Meanwhile up on 10, Westwood birdies, the reward for a lovely second guided in off the left-hand bank to eight feet. The weather’s eased off a little, by the way. Thank goodness.Shank! The next time it happens to you, please remember it can happen to the best of them. And on 9, having been forced to chip back onto the fairway after finding trouble off the tee, Justin Rose smacks one off the hosel. Straight right. The 2013 US Open champion ends up with double bogey. He’s -4, turning in five-over 41.A tempest is raging now. This is links golf! This is the Open! This is summer on these glorious isles! Good lord. Here’s hoping the greens don’t start collecting too much of this water.Fleetwood’s all over the show from the tee. He sends another wild one into mutant cabbage, this time to the left of 8. He’d just witnessed Lowry drive into a spot of trouble on the other side of the hole, so in his position that’s inexcusable really. He’s got little or no margin for error. Lowry, the pressure off, is able to whip an iron up towards the green ... and onto the front. A bit of a fortunate bounce left so he avoids some sand, but you earn your luck in this business. Then it’s Fleetwood’s turn, and all he can do is lash back out onto the fairway. So as things stand, he’s six shots plus 100 yards behind.Rickie Fowler rolls in a long par saver on 8, managing to get up and down from a bunker. Lee Westwood bogeys 9 to turn in 35. They’re both -9. Danny Willett - going round with Westwood, just as he did when he won the Masters - drops a shot at 9 too. He’s -8. Justin Rose sheds yet another shot, his third of the day, at 8. Coming after bogeys at 3 and 6, he’s -6.Fleetwood’s third into 7 bleeds off to the right and is snaffled by the bunker front right. The sand is thick and wet - it’s really pelting down now - and he can only get his ball out to ten feet. It’s a must-make, because Lowry has chipped up to a similar distance, and he’ll be putting for birdie. As the rain lashes around his lugs, he rolls in a brilliant par saver. But Lowry makes his as well, deserved reward for a hole played pretty much to perfection. Birdie, and suddenly he’s leading the Open by six strokes with just 11 holes to go. This isn’t over ... it’s never over on the last day of a major until the final putt drops ... but it really is nearly over. Shane Lowry, who threatened to wobble on the first two holes but was let off the hook by Tommy Fleetwood’s missed birdie putts, is in the middle of an imperial phase right now!G-Mac signs off with bogey. It’s a miserable closing 77, but the crowd care not a jot, and the 2010 US Open champion - the man who kick-started Northern Ireland’s astonishing run of major-championship success - is afforded the reception his career richly deserves. He looks emotional as he stares off into the middle distance. He ends the week at +4. Not ideal, but at least he made it through to the end. What Rory and Darren would give for a moment like this.Serious bother for Fleetwood at the par-five 7th. He flays his drive into the really thick oomska down the right. “Get a lie!” he shouts impotently. He’ll be happy enough to find his ball. Lowry meanwhile clacks his down the middle. Golf is a lot easier when you’ve got a five-shot lead, rather than trying to close one down, last round of the Open notwithstanding. Fleetwood manages to locate his ball, and does extremely well to bash back out onto the fairway. He needs a spark, and quick. Especially as Lowry is just off the front of the green in two.We last saw Portrush-born Graeme McDowell making birdie at 1. It’s been a bit of a miserable traipse around his home course since then. Bogeys at 8, 10, 11, 12 and 16. But now there’s a huge smile on his face as he walks up the last, his people giving their hero a stunning reception as he returns home after a long, arduous 72-hole journey. It’s a lovely moment, to file alongside the bittersweet reception Rory McIlroy received on Friday evening. Darren Clarke also, though is triple bogey slightly took the edge off that one.Birdies elsewhere to report. Justin Thomas - whose charge had seriously stalled with bogeys at 9 and 12 - picks one back up at 13. Alex Noren birdies 9 he turns in level-par 36 after bogey at 5. He’s -6. Birdie for Tony Finau at 7, who has otherwise parred every hole through 8 he’s -8. And the 2016 Masters champion Danny Willett’s renaissance continues he follows birdie at 2 with another at 7, and he’s -9, in a tie for fourth with Rickie Fowler.The rain is beginning to come down hard now. The wind’s whipping around as well. Lowry lags a putt through it all to three feet. He marks, struggles with his umbrella, watches Fleetwood stroke in the right-to-left slider that he simply had to make, then tidies up for his own par. That up-and-down might give Fleetwood a little succour ... because, my goodness, he needs it.This is beginning to look more and more like a cakewalk for Lowry. He finds the heart of 6 with yet another beautifully controlled iron. No heroics, just smart course management. Fleetwood, his nearest challenger, could be more than five adrift soon, because his tee shot at the par-three is weak, short and right. He chips up the big bank to eight feet, but he’ll have another testing putt to sink, and his flat stick has been resolutely tepid so far this afternoon.The young prospect and etiquette firebrand Bob MacIntyre sinks a long putt at 18, and that’s a fine closing round of 68. He’s -5, the new clubhouse leader. Kyle ‘Fore!’ Stanley has ended the week at +2, for the record. A fair chance the 22-year-old Scot will have earned himself an invite for Sandwich next year, because he’s currently tied for 12th. He only needs a couple of players above him to struggle coming home, and he’ll be in the top ten, exempt from qualifying. JB Holmes is certainly doing his best to oblige, dropping his latest shot at 6. He’s got two bogeys and a double to his name already, and has toppled down the standings to -6.Fleetwood can’t make his eagle putt, but the birdie takes him back to where he started the day.  In relation to par, anyway. In relation to the leader, he’s still one shot further behind, because Lowry matches his birdie with a calm chip up to eight feet and another ice-cool putt.We mentioned Sergio earlier, just because. He’s back home now, having shot 78. Oh dear. He ends the week +6, having clearly given up. Though I maintain the provisional he hit into 7, that didn’t count because he then found his first ball, was one of the shots of the week. Justin Thomas runs up a six at 12. He slips back to -6. Bogey for Rose at 7 and he’s -7, heading very much the wrong way. Fleetwood needs a response of his own. And so he nearly replicates Koepka’s tee shot on 5. He’ll be left with a 15-footer for eagle. Lowry’s tee shot lands soft and doesn’t reach the green. Once they’ve teed off, the players in the group ahead - who stand aside as the ones following play up - take their putts. Par for Holmes, but Koepka rolls in his eagle effort to climb back to -7. He’s started bogey-bogey-bogey-bogey-eagle. There’s a fair chance he’s never done that in his life before. What price going on a run like that in the final round of the Open Championship?!The momentum is back with Lowry now! Fleetwood rolls an excellent putt up to the cup on 4, but it stubbornly refuses to drop. It’s a thin line between success and failure. And Lowry doesn’t pass up his birdie chance. In it goes, up go the gallery, and suddenly the leader has a five-shot cushion!The cream always rises. And just after Brooks Koepka makes it a scarcely believable fourth bogey out of four holes, he whips an iron off the tee at the short par-four 5th. He sends his ball scampering into the green and turning towards the hole off the camber on the left. It’s a stunning shot of textbook links brilliance, and he’ll be left with a six-footer for eagle.Shane Lowry has definitely relocated his mojo. He sends a gentle draw into 4, sending his ball over the hillock guarding the pin and landing it eight feet short of the flag. That’s glorious. Fleetwood’s second is pin high, but a good 30 feet to the left. Here’s Simon McMahon, apropos nothing: “While we’re reminiscing, my first set of golf clubs had hickory shafts, and included a gold - at least my dad told me it was gold - Julius Boros putter. Like most of us, I used to imagine that the tricky 12-foot right-to-left breaker on the final green of the local nine-hole course was for the Open. And like most of us, I quickly realised that serious golf was best left to the professionals. Which is why I now spend 16 days of the year emailing the HBH.”Lowry looks to have settled after his shaky sorties up the first two holes. He creams a 3-wood down the middle of 4. The pressure’s suddenly on Fleetwood, who must be ruing those two missed birdie putts on 1 and 2. A chance to really put his shoe on Lowry’s neck. But the hunted escaped the hunter. Fleetwood does very well to follow Lowry down the fairway, avoiding the many bunkers in the road. Meanwhile on 5, birdie for Westwood, who like Fowler behind him has responded well to an opening-hole setback: birdies at 2, 3 and 5. He’s -10, five off Lowry’s lead and just one off Fleetwood in second.Two easy putts for Lowry to secure his par on 3. Fleetwood lobs up to six feet, a fine result from where he was, but he’s left with a tester for par. It’s straight, but the wind is whipping across the green. He sends it out left, and it’s never coming back. The gap at the top is four again. “Justin Rose recently pitched up in the promo for the unveiling of Chelsea’s new away strip for the coming season,” reports Ian Burch. “Along with Omid Djalili, Phil Daniels, Trevor Nelson and legendary Chelsea hard-man Ron ‘Chopper’ Harris, Justin has a brief cameo strolling along the King’s Rd. Oddly enough Chopper used to own and run a golf course in Swindon. It would be nice to think that Chopper brought his attitude to playing the beautiful game to his role of managing a provincial golf course.”Fleetwood pushes his tee shot at the par-three 3rd just off the right of the green. Lowry finds the dancefloor, though his ball briefly teases him, rolling dangerously close to the roll-off area that would funnel it down a massive bank. Meanwhile it’s three birdies in a row for Rickie Fowler, who rattles in a magical 15-footer on 4! He’s -9! This is quite something from the Californian, who must wonder what he has to do to win a major title, and will have really felt the blow as his opening tee shot sliced out of bounds. A response that gives him every chance should Lowry and Fleetwood stumble.No birdie for Lowry. And for the second hole in a row, Fleetwood spurns the chance of cranking up the pressure on his opponent, as he lets his another birdie effort slip by. Bogey for Rose at 3 he’s back to -8. Thomas’s charge stalls with bogey at 9. He’s still out in 33, but back to -7. And almost unbelievably, Koepka makes it three bogeys in the first three holes, and his chances are severely compromised now. He’s -6.When Darren Clarke won the Open at Sandwich in 2011, he benefited from a huge stroke of good fortune in the final round. On the 9th, he thinned his second shot from rough down the left towards some fairway bunkers. Real trouble there. But instead of plugging into the sand, his ball hit a small incline just in front, kicked up over the trap, and whistled its way to the green. He parred, and the rest is history. So could this be a sign on 2? His fellow Irishman Shane Lowry doesn’t connect well with his second shot from rough down the left towards a fairway bunker ... and it just clears. That allows him to wedge onto the green, from where he’ll take a look at birdie from 12 feet. His partner Fleetwood will be doing the same after powering out of tall grass and wedging on himself.Koepka lobs up marvellously and nearly hits the flagstick. But his ball bounds 12 feet on. Big par putt coming back. He can’t make it. Back-to-back bogeys for the major-championship specialist, and he’s -7, his hopes quickly going in the same direction as the wind: south. Par for Holmes, who stays at -8. Belated news of birdie for Danny Willett at 2 he’s -8. And another birdie for Rickie Fowler, the result of a glorious tee shot at 3 to ten feet! He’s repaired all the damage made by his opening drive! He’s -8 and simply refusing to buckle. You have got to love Rickie Fowler. To be fair, the Portrush punters certainly do.Koepka struggles his way up the par-five 2nd. He drives into sand, chips out, then sends an overly aggressive third through the green, down a bank, and into filth. Par will be a result from there. Back on the tee, neither Lowry nor Fleetwood can find the short grass, both going left, though Fleetwood is wilder. Already a sense that anything could happen this afternoon.Fleetwood hits a very tentative birdie putt, and it dies off to the right. He’ll be happy with par, though. Especially as Lowry has dropped a shot. The leader still punches the air, though, because that bogey putt was missable. The crowd try their best to boost their man with another guttural roar. Meanwhile Fowler rebounds from his double-bogey start with birdie at 2, so he’s back to -7 and fighting hard.Another shot goes for Jordan Spieth, this time at 4. He’s going backwards, and at -6 is most likely done. Meanwhile a very nervous Lowry leaves his long par putt eight feet short. You can sense the anxiety in the crowd. And in the player. He’ll be thinking about Oakmont right now, you can be sure of it. “The HBH is the only place we get references to Flann O’Brien (At Swim Two Birds?) and pro-celebrity golf,” writes Ewan Paton. “Also on the Irish theme, this brings back memories of a grumpy and probably hungover Alex Higgins hacking round Turnberry with Alliss, Tarby and Brucie.” Don’t forget Kenny Lynch.

Here’s your stage report – we’ll be back on Tuesday, after tomorrow’s rest day.Wiggins reckons Thomas is in position to win the thing from here, but also that Ineos need to sort their tactics out. Simon Yates gets his stage-winner’s medal. He looks pretty chuffed with life. Pinot is something, isn’t he? You could power a small town off his intensity. Thomas has taken 37 seconds out of Alaphilippe today, which isn’t bad. Thinking again, I think he might’ve gone earlier because he had something left at the end he can win from here, but it’ll take a colossal effort. Geraint Thomas says he felt better than yesterday and needed to pace it when it all kicked off. He says he got stuck behind Alaphilippe and had the legs to do more – he’s relieved there’s something in them. He agrees that Pinot is doing well and a danger, then notes that it’s a mental game – everyone’s tired, everyone’s suffering. He can’t decide if he should’ve gone earlier, but is looking forward to the rest day. And our overall top 10...So Alaphilippe retains the maillot jaune by how much is still to be confirmed. Alaphilippe rinses to the line, he’s absolutely devastated himself, and I think Thomas takes 30 seconds off him! There’s a lot to do here yet! Now here comes Thomas driving for the line!Pinot finishes 31 seconds or so behind Yates, Landa just behind him. That’s his second-ever stage win. Yates relaxes now, hands off the handlebars...Pinot can’t get to Yates! He’s nearly home!It’s caning it down with rain now, and Thomas bangs it out as Alaphilippe looks to fight back! 639m to go! Thomas powers past Alaphilippe! How much time can he put between them?Thomas goes! Can he get to Alaphilippe? 2.1km to go, the yellow jersey group 2.09 off the lead. Pinot is the only man who can stop Yates now, but there’s so much work to do and so little time in which to do it. Thomas’ tongue hangs out while Alaphilippe weaves from side to side! He is absolutely did. This climb at the end of the stage is sadistic genius. Pinot is going like the absolute clappers, while Yates calmly maintains, looking for his second stage victory. Now back to Pinot, who’s fighting to find Landa! Surely Thomas will go for it soon. He can’t fall further behind if he’s got plans to retain his title. 3.7km to go this is brilliant stuff, and Pinot keeps hammering away! Bernal doesn’t look to have much left! Landa is struggling to make an impression on Yates, who looks good for the stage win. Thomas still allows Alaphilippe to lead him, or does he have nothing left? Pinot digs again, but Bernal goes with him!Thomas holds on because he senses Alaphilippe doesn’t have much left. But then Alaphilippe goes again! This is hideous! Alaphilippe looks like he might extend his lead tonight, going with Pinot. Can Thomas find something? Pinot follows Bernal, and Alaphilippe can’t respond! Alaphilippe has found something alright! He’s beginning to look like champion! Landa is 1.06 down on Yates with 5.6km to go. Landa, 1.05 behind Yates, is about to catch Geschke! Yates looks really strong, though, so it’ll take a major effort to catch him. And Pinot goes! Alaphilippe goes too, moving past Thomas! David Guadu is setting a ferocious pace now, and it’s hurting pretty much everyone who isn’t him! 6.3km to go! Alaphilippe is suffering! Pinot looks in much better nick, and Thomas is looking a little stronger! Pinot is getting ready! Thomas is up with Alaphilippe! “Two things,” says Matt Dony. “First Back To The Future is clearly a wonderful film, but it’s no Grosse Point Blank. Second I think it was David Sedaris who did an excellent piece on people saying foreign words with an accent. He talked about how one of his lecturers would always ostentatiously pronounce Nicaragua as ‘Nee-Har-Rah-Wah’, and used that as a shorthand for other flamboyant attempts at accents. For example, some football commentators throw themselves into ‘Nee-Har-Rah-Wahn’ French when naming the clubs in Ligue Uuuuhn. Also, as a Welshman, obviously I look out for Geraint Thomas’ name in TdF coverage. In this regard, Thomas de Gent is a frustrating distraction that always catches the eye. Too many shared letters. Shouldn’t be allowed.”I do enjoy a good “Braseew.”The state of the kippers as they power up this climb. 8km to go, and Alaphilippe is still with the yellow jersey group. The leaders are 1.26 ahead of the pursuers, 2.33 ahead of the yellow jersey group, and EXCUSE ME WHILE I INTERRUPT MYSELF! Simon Yates goes! Landa is up with Quintana and passes him! 9.2km left!

And then some real batting, prodding forwards and blocking Shrubsole with a drop-dead gorgeous defence. Perhaps a moment for the purists. Sarah Bacon is banging her keyboard with some fury. What the ... ?!!! We’re STILL batting?! Ellyse Perry, famous for being a gal who has to be dragged kicking and screaming from doing batting practice in the nets, is not doing herself -- or Australia -- any favours here. And while knocking England out before close-of-play isn’t guaranteed, a shot at it is surely warranted, isn’t it? *Gnashes teeth*Yours in ... frustration, 44th over: Australia 145-4 ( Jonassen 19 , Perry 60) Elwiss dibble-dobbles on the tiddlewinks spot.I wouldn’t have minded five days of this fun! However, there’s no use crying over spilt milk, or spoiled schedules ... At least Perry has crossed 50 in her Test career, again! One hopes Australia declare ASAP, but we all know this will be a draw either ways. This was a spectacular contest with no definitive winner - most of Test cricket defined for you!Thanks OB. I’m not sure if I’d go as far as spectacular. More hard-fought? Determined? For me the captains “settled” a bit too much for it to be spectacular. Any thoughts?43rd over: Australia 144-4 ( Jonassen 18 , Perry 60) A better over from Shrubsole. The last ball leaps from nowhere off the pitch and hits Taylor behind the stumps - who rolls over with the impact. It’s hit somewhere near the left shoulder and she seems in quite a lot of pain - but she wriggles her fingers to the satisfaction of the physio and things seem to be ok. Katherine Brunt hasn’t come out after tea with a sore shoulder after that e at cover in the field. 42nd over: Australia 142-4 ( Jonassen 18 , Perry 59) Elwiss delivers five dots and a full toss which is treated with lofty distain and a big heave-ho by Jonassen through extra cover and over the rope. 41st over: Australia 138-4 ( Jonassen 14 , Perry 59) So no declaration and just 41 overs left of this Test. Will they declare? When will they declare? Kudos to England who still look very chirpy and have a big friendly huddle before the start. At last Shrubsole gets her mitts on the ball. The first delivery is short and wide and Perry cuts it for four. The over improves as Perry plays and misses and then treats the remaining balls with respect. Afternoon Tanya,I’m really quite disappointed Australia don’t want to make a proper game of this. There are people watching at the ground, more than there have been on the damp days, and they could just declare now and say ‘Have a go’. It’s a bit unfortunate they won’t.For the sake of the game, and the reputation of women’s cricket, I would love them to declare. But I can see why Lanning hasn’t. She doesn’t have to, she wins the Ashes with a draw, and crowd pleasing isn’t in the Baggy Green handbook, even post sandpapergate. Here we got then - the last session of the Ashes Test 2019 and Australia are .... batting.40th over: Australia 134-4 ( Jonassen 14 , Perry 55) Knight goes back to her winning hand - Laura Marsh, in what will probably be the last over before the tea break. Only one from it - but to be honest the ball is in Australia’s court now. England just watch, and wait. And bowl. And that is tea. The players wander off. Australia lead by 279 and there are a minimum of 44 overs left in the day. A declaration would leave England chasing 280 off 41 overs - a run-rate of over six. Something to ponder over a cup of tea and whatever is hiding in the larder. 39th over: Australia 133-4 ( Jonassen 14 , Perry 54)  Two off the over and we see the Australian balcony where arms are folded, in pockets or hidden. 38th over: Australia 131-4 ( Jonassen 13 , Perry 53) We tarry a while as the umpires replay a run-out call, a smart bit of work by the Ecclestone-Taylor combo, but Perry is just home. Then a slightly shorter ball from Brunt, and Perry leans back and dispatches a missive through backward point for another fifty! So in her last two Tests.... a double century, a century, and an unbeaten fifty. Not bad lass. Abhijato has a suggestion: “Give them 280 to chase off 40 overs, Australia ... It might produce one of the greatest finishes in Test match history across genders, after all!”You never know as Perry now has her fifty and it is nearly tea. What will Lanning do in the break?37th over: Australia 125-4 ( Jonassen 13 , Perry 47) A dabble past third man and Jonassen sends Ecclestone for a boundary..If Australia were to declare now, England would have to chase six an over. And hooray! An email arrives with a flourish into my inbox. Steve Waugh would have probably declared in this situation, eh?Surely Australia must back their bowlers on this pitch.. (okay, I admit I just want a last hour finish).Oooh I don’t know. Would he have applied enough mental disintegration?36th over: Australia 120-4 ( Jonassen 9 , Perry 46) Brunt drifts a fraction wide and Jonassen drives through the covers, with a low back knee, and it skims along the grass and over the boundary. Then again, slightly less prettily, an edge through gully for another four. 35th over: Australia 112-4 ( Jonassen 1, Perry 46) Sophie Ecclestone does like a sleeveless sweater. The skies at Taunton are less cornflower blue than murky ink. Short sleeves for the batters, sunglasses for the umpires. Just two from the over as Jonassen gets off the mark. Ah, now we have Katherine Brunt.34th over: Australia 110-4 ( Jonassen 0, Perry 45) Elwiss rattles through the balls, tick, tick, tick. Perry pulls her first ball for four, just another single from the over and the minutes and the overs and the day tock away. 33rd over: Australia 105-4 ( Jonnasen 0, Perry 40) Each time you see that catch, it looks a little better. A screamer! It was coming super hard too. Beaumont and Ecclestone are utterly thrilled.  A super catch by Tammy Beaumont at short leg, as Mooney goes to have a huge slog, she gathers it in the folds of her jumper at belly height. And England dismiss the enforcer!32nd over: Australia 103-3 ( Mooney 23, Perry 40) Just a couple off that Elwiss over. This is very true:31st over: Australia 100-3 ( Mooney 23, Perry 37) Beautiful shot by Mooney off Ecclestone - a simply delicious drive for four through the covers. Add a leg bye and a single and it is six off the over. Perry is definitely struggling, lamely jogging a single where normally she’s ease through - which of course will also be preying on Meg Lanning’s mind. A non-bowling Perry confuses the equation. Do email me if you want to chatmoanponder on tanya.aldred.freelance@the or tweet @tjaldred. 30th over: Australia 94-3 ( Mooney 18, Perry 37) Marsh gets a rest at last as Knight turns to Elwiss and whispers instructions in her ears. Elwiss scampers in briskly and Australia get just one from the over. We see Perry and the Australian coach bent over a pad of paper .....29th over: Australia 93-3 ( Mooney 18, Perry 36) A classy shot from Mooney outruns the fielders, through the covers and over the boundary. A little less class a little more arse later on, up and over slog-sweep for four through midwicket.Just watching some analysis on SKY which shows that Perry is struggling with her back leg. As she lunges forwards to muffle the spin, she’s actually struggling to get back up again. 28th over: Australia 82-3 ( Mooney 7, Perry 36) I like watching Marsh bowl, she’s on tiptoe in her delivery stride, long, elegant arms, almost balletic in her poise. Mooney knocks three from her. And we continue in this arms-length fencing period.27th over: Australia 80-3 ( Mooney 5, Perry 36) Gordon is flighting the ball nicely and Perry seems content to play her out. Mooney has an ugly swipe to the penultimate ball - she must be the enforcer of the two.26th over: Australia 78-3 ( Mooney 4, Perry 35) Yummy, yummy says Bel Mooney as a tasty full toss floats towards her from Laura Marsh. Bang, she gets down on one knee and hammers it to the midwicket boundary. She’s certainly happy to gee things along a bit. A session and a half to go... if Australia want to go for the win, they’ll need to pull the declaration from the horizon. Australian lead now 223. 25th over: Australia 73-3 ( Mooney 0, Perry 34) Gordon has a spring in her step now. Some great fielding by Brunt at cover prevents a Mooney boundary. Afterwards she looks accusingly at her elbow in the way you do when it really hurts and you’re hoping for gushing blood and sympathy, but all you get is a slight reddening. And that’s drinks!24th over: Australia 72-3 ( Mooney 0, Perry 32) Two wicket Marsh continues - her tenth over of the day. A Perryish drive through the covers is the scoring shot of the over. Incidentally, I’ve just come back from Old Trafford where a T20 game is about to start. The place is rammed, queues going into the ground, kids, mums, the works. The ECB fantasy writ large. 23rd over: Australia 67-3 ( Mooney 0, Perry 28) What a wicket! What a pancake delivery! Still they all count - and Gordon strikes in her first over. She has Lanning lunging forwards, front leg unsteadily overbalanced, and then pulling her through midwicket for four, before the breakthrough. Softly, softly, catchee monkey. An absolutely awful ball, pure Sunday evening dross, and Lanning pummels it away where it is caught by an alert Elwiss at cover. Huge breakthrough for England.22nd over: Australia 60-2 (Lanning 15, Perry 27) I love how Australian field chat addresses teammates as “girls” but English field chat says “ladies”. Lots of encouragement as Marsh bowls another maiden to Lanning.And lots of encouragement, I hope, as Tanya Aldred takes over from me. Thanks for your company, I’ll see you for the first Women’s Ashes T20 and then the men’s Tests.21st over: Australia 60-2 (Lanning 15, Perry 27) Steam Train Perry rolls on, tooting happily all the while. Neither umpire nor left-arm spinner will stop her. Ecclestone may be tiring a bit, giving width for Perry to drive through cover for four. Time for Kirstie Gordon? She was good in the first innings when she first came on.20th over: Australia 55-2 (Lanning 14, Perry 23) A quick single for Perry punching Marsh wide of mid-off. Lanning finally gets going when Marsh drags down, allowing the Australian captain to dip and swat a pull shot through long leg. 19th over: Australia 49-2 (Lanning 9, Perry 22) They’re playing two different games out there. Lanning blocks out another maiden from Ecclestone. 43 balls for 9. Perry has faced 38 for 22.18th over: Australia 49-2 (Lanning 9, Perry 22) Ellyse Perry pushes on, a lot more positive than Lanning at this stage. Flicks a couple off Marsh. 17th over: Australia 46-2 (Lanning 8, Perry 20) Huge lbw shout against Perry, not given! “Out,” say several people at once in the press box, and indeed it should have been. Ecclestone striking flush on the front pad as Perry defended. There was a bit of angle towards leg stump, so the umpire either decided there was a nick or the angle was going down. Neither was true on the replay. Should have been given, would certainly have been challenged by England if there were DRS. 16th over: Australia 44-2 (Lanning 8, Perry 18) Heather Knight the skipper is setting up at second slip on her knees, following the lead of Marcus Trescothick who has done this a bit here at Somerset. The thicker edges on this wicket can come low. A nice touch that Knight is doing this in front of the Trescothick Stand. Amazing that the big batsman is retiring this year after debuting in first-class cricket in 1993. No lack of bounce for Marsh though, who bowls another beauty through the gate of Lanning, but this time it bounces over her stumps. 15th over: Australia 44-2 (Lanning 8, Perry 18) Perry does it again, making her own length from Ecclestone. Looks so easy for her. Four driving the low full toss through midwicket. 14th over: Australia 40-2 (Lanning 8, Perry 14) Down the wicket, Perry, turning Marsh’s ball into a full toss and driving it straight for four. Nudges a single, then Lanning chops away behind point and belts back for two. Ellyse Perry’s live Test average is now over 70.13th over: Australia 33-2 (Lanning 6, Perry 9) Huge shout for Ecclestone against Lanning. The left-arm ortho stock ball, turning and beating the outside edge. The toe of the bat just clipped the ankle section of Lanning’s pad as the ball went past. Good umpiring from Martin Saggers. Another maiden. 12th over: Australia 33-2 (Lanning 6, Perry 9) Lanning steers Marsh away past slip for two runs. A bat-pad on either side of the wicket, plus a leg slip. Shrubsole in there I think? Unusual spot for an opening bowler. Good that England are attacking though. They stay in position for Perry. Got to get her early, but her defence is so solid. She isn’t drawn into anything she shouldn’t be.11th over: Australia 28-2 (Lanning 3, Perry 7) Four runs for Perry, glancing Ecclestone fine. What do the Australian pair do? Do they stay positive and push on, or play safe? They’re 173 in front.10th over: Australia 23-2 (Lanning 2, Perry 3) Maiden, maiden, maiden, then Perry and Lanning work four runs from Marsh here and there. 9th over: Australia 19-2 (Lanning 1, Perry 0) Eccles to Lanning, up for a huge lbw shout but the ball has struck her just outside the line of off stump. Another maiden. Australia feeling the heat.8th over: Australia 19-2 (Lanning 1, Perry 0) It’s all spin, all the time, so these will be some shorter updates. Marsh bowls another good over, but one ball bounces so erratically that it evades Taylor for four byes, despite Knight putting in every effort in sprinting after it from slip.7th over: Australia 15-2 (Lanning 1, Perry 0) A maiden from Ecclestone to Lanning. Perry is yet to face. Just hearing confirmation that Haynes opened the batting because Nicole Bolton has hurt her thumb.6th over: Australia 15-2 (Lanning 1) Of course, standing between England and bowling anyone out are Who will now probably just bat for five hours and kill the match. But get one of them early and things will start to get very interesting.2 for 2 from one over for Marsh in this innings, after batting so well to avert the follow-on. It’s the Summer of Marsh, I’ve been saying this for weeks.And another down, and another one down, another one bites the dust! Last ball of the over, Haynes stretches forward, Marsh straightens the ball down the line to the left-hander from around the wicket. Hits the pad bang in front! Forget declaration bowling, England are just going to bowl them out. (Eight wickets to go, granted.)What a delivery! What a piece of bowling! That’s her Ashley Giles to Damien Martyn in 2005, though with the other arm. Marsh bowls an off-break from around the wicket. Floats it across the right-hander with plenty of drift outside off. Draws Healy forward into a drive, then shreds the ball back in towards the stumps and through the gate. Lovely, lovely bowling.We’re back after lunch with Laura Marsh to bowl...I got an email from Dave Langlois wondering why Sarah Taylor wasn’t wearing keeping pads yesterday. The inside scoop is that they’re inside (scoop). Taylor wears smaller football-style pads inside her trouser legs. You can see the slight outer corner of one in the shot below. 5th over: Australia 13-0 (Haynes 0, Healy 13) The last over before lunch, Healy faces out Ecclestone, chopping away off her stumps at one stage. The final ball is a pie though, which is also what we’re enjoying in the pavilion. Healy drives it straight for four. Time for a meal, with tactical intrigue to follow. There are 76 overs remaining, and Australia lead by 158.4th over: Australia 9-0 (Haynes 0, Healy 9) It’s a bit of a conundrum for England. They’re ing around in the field, trying to be upbeat. They’ve got two slips and two gullies for Haynes after Healy takes a single from Brunt. But at the same time, they don’t really want to stop runs, because they need Australia to score quickly. And they don’t really want to take wickets, because if a few fall then the Australians will go defensive and try to grind. I guess you can take the positive view of trying to bowl Australia out, but that’s not likely to happen within the 30 overs or so that would leave England in the game. But, it’s worth trying, I guess. It’s good that England are trying something. 3rd over: Australia 8-0 (Haynes 0, Healy 8) If Haynes was sent out to boost the scoring, it hasn’t worked yet. Another maiden facing Ecclestone, with a couple of shots finding the field. Maybe she’s just there to stop Healy doing something reckless against spin.2nd over: Australia 8-0 (Haynes 0, Healy 8) Now we’re away. As is so often the case these days with Healy at the crease. She gets width from Brunt and threads the needle at point with a square drive for four, then glances a leg-stump ball just past Taylor’s attempted catch and down to fine leg for another.1st over: Australia 0-0 (Haynes 0, Healy 0) Here we go! Tactical innovations ahoy. Ecclestone is opening the bowling. Four catchers around the wicket! Yes, yes. Australia have sent Haynes out to open with Healy, and Haynes can go at a fast clip when she wants to. Is this to get the score moving or does Nicole Bolton have an injury issue? Eccles nearly gets Haynes immediately! Trying to pull, not short enough and hitting the pad but sliding down leg side. It’s chaotic in there, close fielders and exclamations ahoy. Questions asked each ball. And it’s one of the more eventful maidens you’ll ever see.107.1 overs: England 275-9 declared (Ecclestone 9) I’m not sure what the point of batting on was, because England have just cost themselves an extra over before the lunch break by facing one delivery from Jonassen that took a wicket. There are now 23 minutes till lunch, we’ll lose two overs for the changeover, and there will be a normal lunch break followed by two extended sessions to make up for the overs lost on day two.The situation is: 83 overs left in the day, and Australia 145 ahead. So, say Australia bat 25 overs, put on another 100+, set England something like 260 and leave themselves something like 56 overs to bowl England out. Are they game? Are both teams game? How will Australia bat? More shortly.Marsh, sweeps, misses, and now England declare."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c4031779406abef59f8a2bbb771005a2026494cd/0_223_3394_2036/master/3394.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d52e320704478b591c9b64f056f279f0","title":"hamlet richard iii review glasgow botanic gardens bard in the botanics","story":"Glasgow Botanic Gardens A superb Nicole Cooper plays Hamlet as a fiercely wronged daughter, while a stripped-down version of Richard reveals an impulsive gambler on a wild streakNicole Cooper’s Hamlet is putting the first player through his paces. Warming up for the performance that will catch the conscience of the king, the actor gives her an impassioned speech in praise of Hecuba. His pretence at emotion sends her into a reverie. “What’s Hecuba to him, or he to Hecuba, that he should weep for her?” she asks. “What would he do, had he the motive and the cue for passion that I have?” Her answer, that “he would drown the stage with tears”, is the key to her superb performance.In Gordon Barr’s outdoor staging for Bard in the Botanics, Cooper is emotionally exposed. She weeps in mourning as mother Helen Logan and uncle Alan Mirren tuck into their wedding feast. She sobs after meeting her father’s ghost, and fights back the tears on “to be or not to be”. Her eyes well up when Stephanie McGregor’s Ophelia returns her letters and she wails upon the death of Alan Steele’s Polonius.In silky grey skirt and black shirt, this Lady Hamlet is driven not by revenge or intergenerational aggression, but a deeply felt sense of bereavement and injustice. At least once, she has to shake her hands in front of her face just to keep her composure. This heightened emotional state explains her madness when the world makes no sense, where’s the advantage in thinking straight? It also fuels her anger at Mirren’s Claudius, a suave captain of industry with slicked-back hair and an air of confidence that makes him look unassailable. If she hesitates to act, it’s because his crime seems unpunishable.It’s not all tears, however. Cooper is an actor with tremendous range, hitting peaks of ferocity and lows of despair. She’s not morose nor introspective, as Hamlets can be, just an amiable woman caught off guard. Sometimes Barr’s actors yield to the pull of naturalism and talk to each other instead of singing out to the audience, but not Cooper, who never loses her hold over us. It is a performance of unassuming authority, her delivery clear, fresh and true.Meanwhile, indoors in the neighbouring Kibble Palace glasshouse, Jennifer Dick is staging a lean Richard III, stripped down to just four actors and delivered in a brisk and lucid two-and-a-bit hours. Robert Elkin’s Richard, one arm hitched pathetically into a belt around his chest, is a glass-half-empty kind of psychopath, more inclined to moan about his lot than relish the successes of his murderous enterprise. He’s like a gambler taking no pleasure in his wins save the opportunity to gamble again. Wild-eyed and impulsive, he grows from embittered to vitriolic as fate turns against him.His cynical wooing of the women he has bereaved, first Kirsty McDuff’s Lady Anne, then Vanessa Coffey’s Queen Elizabeth, relies on angry oratory more than charm, which makes their capitulation hard to credit, but both make fearsome adversaries. McDuff, in particular, has a bright confidence, standing her ground in the face of this malevolent force. Like Adam Donaldson playing the Duke of Buckingham as an obsequious politician, they speak with clarity and muscularity.With its modern-day setting, Dick’s production uses press conferences and one-way phone conversations to get around some of the elisions of her compact adaptation. If it necessarily loses a sense of Richard’s wider world and misses some tonal variety, it is nonetheless a vigorous and assured production.

Even if the pieces are uneven in quality, the sextet makes a coherent package proving that Durang is the most theatre-obsessed dramatist alive.The climactic title-work, dating from 1981, shows a nervy accountant (Stefan Menaul) thrust unprepared into a play that starts as Private Lives and ends as A Man For All Seasons: it’s a potent piece in that it taps into the universal nightmare that in life we all find ourselves in inexplicable situations where everyone but us knows the lines. Even more chilling is a sketch in which Meaghan Martin plays, with a marvellous mix of ingratiation and panic, a collapsing standup who pleadingly asks: “Do you find me funny or disturbing?” On a lighter note, Martin also appears to great effect as a Hollywood hustler meeting a dithering dramatist (Adrian Richards) to persuade him to write a movie about a rabbi who falls in love with a priest.Durang is good when he is specific about the fears and fantasies of showbusiness: less so when he generalises, as in a feeble satire on American drama which simply amounts to a series of name-checks. But I laughed most, in Lydia Parker’s breezy production, when Kate Sumpter appeared first as an audience member asserting that Greek tragedy produces “slight irritation” rather than pity and terror, and then as a classical Medea surrounded by a chorus claiming: “We are so upset we speak in unison.” Durang’s territory may be limited but he occupies it with a certain elan.

Huawei, which is subject to stringent oversight by the UK’s spy agency, GCHQ, denies the claim.The sources told the Observer that the telecoms supply chain review will not include any discussion of Huawei’s role in building new networks when it is unveiled by Jeremy Wright, secretary of state for digital, culture, media and sport, tomorrow.“Our view is that this means Huawei is in when it comes to building UK 5G networks,” one well-placed industry source said.The decision is likely to reopen isions over the company’s future. In April, the National Security Council, chaired by Theresa May, reportedly agreed to block Huawei from all critical parts of the 5G network, but allow it restricted access elsewhere. This was still a concern for some. Defence secretary Gavin Williamson had to resign after being accused of leaking the decision, a claim he denies.Allies of Boris Johnson, who is expected to replace May this week, are understood to have urged her to take a firm decision before stepping down. They worry that leaving the final say to Johnson would damage his chances of developing a trade deal with Donald Trump, who has been a staunch opponent of Huawei.However, the White House may be softening its position. A meeting tomorrow between senior Trump administration members and US technology firms could result in a lifting of the ban on them selling equipment to Huawei."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c880c40c31c9f7fc3316fb8947cdb08b0b939488/57_176_3731_2240/master/3731.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fbfb5a2e0f2e7fbdcb14a3e7cd9be5df","title":"yorkshire dales all electric classic vw campervan","story":"Kettle on, roof up … The world’s only all-electric vintage VW campervan for hire is perfect for pottering around the Dales‘It’s a bit like a Super Mario Kart,” the owner Kit had joked. And halfway up a steep hill, I got my chance to prove it. Flicking the thrilling “turbo” switch on the dashboard, I rocketed skyward.Well, perhaps not quite skyward, but what is claimed to be the world’s only all-electric classic VW campervan for hire made easy work of it. To be honest, that was out of character as it’s a vehicle that actively encourages pottering. Often I had the impression I was careering madly along an open road only to glance at the speedo and find I was not quite doing 30mph. But it was the most not-quite-doing-30 fun I think I’ve ever had.Kit had picked me up in his electric car at Knaresborough station and taken me the short distance to eDub HQ in the village of Farnham, North Yorkshire.“She’s called Indie,” he told me during an introductory tour of the jolly green-and-white van. “She was built in 1973 and came from a small town called Andrews in Indiana.”Inspired by his mother’s PhD on battery technology and “vehicle-to-grid stuff”, Kit converted the van to a right-hand drive, had a local cabinet maker fit it out (“getting every inch of space to work”), and changed the engine for a mighty battery that provides a range of 50 miles on a full charge. “But it’s an ongoing project,” he added, “constantly being tweaked and improved.”Meanwhile, Volkswagen has been doing some tweaking of its own, with plans to launch a new electric version of the classic campervan. The ID Buzz will stick close to the original design, with a new colour motif and style quirks.After a spin around the block to show me how Indie worked, Kit let me loose. Winding down the window (do you remember that? Our arms had motor skills in the old days) and slipping it into first – surprisingly, it’s a three-gear manual, but won’t ever stall – I set off on an adventure around the Yorkshire Dales.My eerily quiet carriage took me first to Ripley, where I stumbled upon the Harrogate Tipple gin and rum distillery. “The shop’s been open two weeks,” distiller Steve Green told me among bottles of blueberry, gooseberry and premium gins. He spoke so enthusiastically of the subtle qualities of various botanicals that I was disappointed to be driving and unable to try his samples.After a dip into Ripon and its cathedral, I headed for Masham to pick up some beer from the Black Sheep Brewery (for later consumption, you understand). With a double gas hob, sink, fridge, plentiful cupboard space and a back seat that converted into a comfortable double bed, the van had everything I could desire. Its huge steering wheel also made me feel as if I was driving a giant dodgem car. And just being inside it was a pleasure. Indie had me stopping to pop the kettle on and the top up on lonely moorlands and in obscure villages whose names only a Yorkshire tongue could love. Here’s to you, Grewelthorpe, Nidd and Wath. Even the showery weather couldn’t dampen my spirits, for as the wipers scraped doggedly back and forth, the rain infused the van with that wonderful “old car” smell which took me tumbling back to infancy and my grandmother’s faithful Austin 1100.One lunchtime, pootling along a back lane in the Nidderdale Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, I noticed a sign to the Himalayan Garden \u0026amp Sculpture Park and immediately swung off in pursuit. Set in a slender glaciated valley, the 45-acre garden was adorned with rhododendrons, magnolias, azaleas and plentiful flowers I’d never seen before. There was a particularly fetching Himalayan shepherd’s hut, constructed in the kath-khuni style without nails or mortar. And of the 70 outdoor sculptures, my favourite was by Indian artist Subodh Kerkar, who had satirised 14th-century traveller John Mandeville’s claim that he’d discovered a tree in India that bore “tiny lambs” as fruit. It had been the Englishman’s first brush with the cotton plant.I had my own brush with the lesser-known valley of Nidderdale, discovering Ramsgill’s church hidden behind an explosion of popcorn-pink cherry blossom. Reaching Middlesmoor, at the head of the dale, I jumped out for a walk on to In Moor, only to be assailed by hailstones. I took this as nature’s way of telling me to head for a campsite. And at Studfold – one of many sites where you can charge the van overnight for free – I found the owner Ian celebrating its 60th anniversary.“The creation of the campsite started by accident,” he said. “An angler turned up at what was then my grandfather’s farm and asked if he could pop his caravan in a corner of a field.” It was a spot well chosen, as it has cracking views of hills to the east. By contrast, the previous night I’d stayed at the Old Station caravan park outside Masham, whose reception – once a goods shed – is lined with black-and-white photos of the former branch line stop axed by Dr Beeching.On my final day I bimbled into Pateley Bridge for a stroll along River Nidd and a visit to the self-styled “oldest sweet shop in England”. Ten minutes later I was gnawing on a Pontefract cake at the local art group’s biannual exhibition. Feeling reckless, I bought tickets at the tombola stall and – boom! – snared a pack of pop-up cupcake boxes. Winners gonna win.It was only when getting back on the train that I discovered the one downside to my trip: my cheeks ached. But that’s what comes of spending 48 hours with a great big stupid grin on your face.• The trip was hosted by eDub (edubtrips) Indie can be hired for £149 a night (including campsite) for three- or four-night trips.

Why? And is it time captions became the norm?‘Subtitles aren’t just for deaf people,” read the tweet that started it all. “Lots of my hearing friends use them, too. If you’re hearing and using subtitles on Netflix and TV, and would quite like them at the cinema, please retweet to help normalise their presence!”This recent post by @deafgirly (AKA Deafinitely Girly) swiftly garnered close to 75,000 likes and a deluge of replies. “I was confused at first when I saw it had gone viral,” says the 30-year-old blogger and campaigner from London, who prefers to go by her Twitter name. “I was out for lunch with my mum and my phone started going crazy. I was really pleased though, because there was overwhelming global support from people of all ages for subtitles. Even the people who said they didn’t really like them at the cinema said they’d tolerate them if it meant deaf people could attend more screenings.” One woman even told DG she used subtitles when she was too stoned to listen to her favourite shows.As the tweet and its many replies made clear, it’s not just deaf people who rely on subtitles in 2019. What was once a question of accessibility and a mainstay of foreign-language broadcasts is becoming an inescapable part of visual media. In a piece for US site The Outline earlier this year, journalist Sean Neumann claimed that closed captioning saved his relationship with Game of Thrones, by allowing him to read and process the huge amounts of information in each episode. (“Wait, who’s Lord Mormont again? And he’s different than Ser Mormont?”)Elsewhere, TV memes with captioned dialogue have become the norm on social media No Context Twitter accounts – which orce a show’s script from its original meaning – are springing up.Among the many replies DG received were lots of teenagers and people in their early 20s who said they liked using subtitles because it allowed them to multitask. Besides, with TV shows often plagued with claims of unintelligible ambient sound (Shane Meadows’ The Virtues being the latest), it’s little wonder that subtitles seem to be all around.A startling Ofcom study from 2006 estimated that, of the 7.5 million UK TV viewers using subtitles, only 1.5 million had a hearing impairment. That figure may be 13 years old, but the regulator says: “Our understanding is that subtitle use has increased as the use of smartmobile devices has increased, as more and more people watch programmes or videos on commutes.”Intriguingly, it seems that subtitles seem to appeal particularly to children. Henry Warren is the co-founder of Tots, or Turn on the Subtitles, a new campaign urging programme-makers to add captions to shows aimed at primary school pupils. Inspired by research conducted by an Indian academic, Brij Kothari, Warren and his business partner Oli Barrett decided to see whether broadcasters would take note of stats linking subtitles to hugely increased levels of literacy.Warren sees Tots’ role as “joining the dots” between academic bodies such as the National Literacy Trust and big broadcasters, initially with the aim of making subtitling the norm for programmes aimed at children aged six to 10. “I think it will come to a point where we don’t think about it,” he says. “They will just be there.”But what do deaf people think? Anna Gryszkiewicz, who is 39 and lives in Östergötland in Sweden, was diagnosed with sensorineural hearing loss in her 20s and began using captions. Mostly, she sees the rise in captioning as a positive development: “It has been so much easier to find or to request captions today, compared to 15 years ago.” Deaf people, she adds, “have such an advantage living today”.The rise of big tech brings with it concerns over the quality of subtitling. YouTube uses often garbled, computer-made captions. “My main worry is the over-belief in technology, such as autocaptions,” says Gryszkiewicz. “I’m an engineer and love technology, but we cannot lose sight of the social aspects of hearing loss. Language, communication and social interactions are complex. The effect of having hearing loss or being deaf is different from what hearing people imagine it to be – and the impact on communication is often underestimated.“I understand that good captions and other accessibility features are expensive and it’s not unreasonable to look into technology to reduce costs, but I hope our opinions are taken seriously when we try to explain what kind of accessibility is helpful and what isn’t.”“I find my deafness incredibly isolating at times,” says DG. “You miss out on jokes on social media videos, viral clips don’t mean anything, and you can’t follow the latest news that’s being live tweeted. Subtitles being universal would change that massively.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7b82da624815c3263c64d8a2cb192778791fc2fe/0_192_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fd9151b6d24d4f2ab9606bfde048d217","title":"new hampshire poet laureate condoleezza rice","story":"New Hampshire governor Chris Sununu has abandoned his pick for state poet laureate, amid growing criticism of the man’s work and how he was selected.Daniel Thomas Moran, a retired dentist and former poet laureate of Suffolk county, New York, was never formally nominated for the New Hampshire post. But Sununu, a Republican, had chosen him.Even before the discovery of a sexually suggestive poem Moran wrote about former US secretary of state Condoleezza Rice, some said he was not qualified.On Friday, a spokesman for the governor said he would soon put a new name up for a vote.State law requires the directors of the Poetry Society of New Hampshire (PSNH) to submit to the governor “the name or names of persons whom they deem to be worthy” of being poet laureate. The governor is not required to follow the recommendations.Moran read a poem entitled New Hampshire at Sununu’s second inauguration in January. He was one of 12 poets whose names were given to the committee by the poets themselves or supporters.The PSNH selection committee recommended Jennifer Militello of Goffstown, an award-winning poet and founder of the New Hampshire Poetry Festival.Sununu put Moran’s name on a list of upcoming nominations in March but held off on asking for a vote by the executive council, which approves state contracts and nominations. In June, the governor met with PSNH members and asked for additional material on alternative candidates.Then on Thursday, an excerpt of Moran’s poem referencing Rice was published by Slate.According to Slate, the poem, entitled White on Rice, read in part:not the lucky ones,Happier than abarrel of nuns.we would have our funIn the lavatory“White on Rice,” Slate reported, “appears in The Book of Moran, a 2007 collection published by Asinine Poetry, whose website says it is devoted to ‘mostly kinda funny’ poetry.”The article linked to other Moran poems on the Asinine website: A Sonnet for Our Lesbians in Orbit, An Ode to Dame Edna and The Girls of Vancouver 2010, “a tribute to female Olympians”.Sununu’s spokesman said the governor was only recently made aware of the Rice poem and “finds it offensive”, but had chosen Moran based on the entirety of his work.“Governor Sununu nominated Daniel Thomas Moran, who has published 11 books, due to his extensive experience and impressive credentials, as well as to bring a fresh perspective to the role of poet laureate,” Benjamin Vihstadt said. Hours later, Vihstadt said Sununu would nominate someone else.Don Kimball, president of the PSNH, said the members urged Sununu to make a different choice during the June meeting.“We said: ‘We understand that you’re the governor and you have the right, but is it the right thing to do?’” Kimball said.Like Sununu, the committee was not aware of Moran’s poem when it vetted candidates, Kimball said. But Marie Harris, a former poet laureate who served on the committee, said Moran failed to rise into even the top half of the field based on his work, vision, connection to the poetry community and ability to serve as its ambassador.Harris, who called the Rice poem and several others “a travesty, really, of what poetry is meant to be”, said the controversy goes beyond the state. She noted New Hampshire has produced five national poet laureates.“We have a national reputation of being a fine place for poetry, and this makes a mockery of that,” she said. “And it also taints the process going forward because why would anyone put up a nominee if all the qualifications in the world didn’t count?”Both Harris and Kimball said their chief complaint was not with Moran, but with Sununu’s decision to circumvent a well-established process.This was not the first time, however, a governor bypassed the PSNH. In 1999, the society’s then-president criticized Democratic governor Jeanne Shaheen because she picked Harris instead of the group’s choice, saying she had broken a long tradition of keeping politics out of poetry.Harris said her case was different. That year, newcomers to the society put forward someone who was not qualified, she said.Shaheen nominated her after consulting with the state council on the arts, she said. And the controversy ultimately led to a revamping of the vetting process, including the creation of a committee that includes outsiders interested in writing and the arts and a detailed rubric for evaluating candidates.Moran did not respond to phone or email messages."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3ef8d0c64a48a817f08458796665c4000739390e/0_196_5714_3428/master/5714.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=03c52485d2da729b27c66ec319a927f6","title":"animal rights activists accuse latitude festival cruelty pink sheep stunt","story":"Animal rights organisations and activists have accused the Latitude festival organisers of cruelty for dyeing a flock of sheep pink as part of a marketing campaign.A promotional tweet posted on the opening day of the Suffolk event showed fuchsia-dyed sheep running across the festival grounds. Social media users quickly criticised the organisers for dyeing the sheep and demanded an explanation.Latitude defended the stunt, and tweeted that the animals had been “dip-dyed using natural, water-based dye which they are used to as part of their normal farm life for insecticides and parasites like itch-mite, blow-flies, ticks and lice”.But the animal rights organisation Peta UK condemned Latitude’s actions as a “thoughtless, attention-grabbing stunt”.“In 2019, only ignorant or cruel people still use animals as living toys, props and photo ops,” it said on Twitter. “We’ve learned enough about animals to know to respect and admire them for their ability to live in a world we’re fast destroying.”Peta said the dip-dyeing of the sheep “involves being completely submerged in liquid, their heads likely held down with a crook. And the abuse didn’t stop there. These gentle prey animals are easily stressed and would have been terrified of the loud music and rowdy, drunk festivalgoers.”The animal welfare charity RSPCA also expressed criticism, saying it was “very sad” to see sheep being treated in this way.A petition has been set up calling on Latitude to stop using the sheep as “party props” and to remove the animals from the festival grounds.Members of the public announced a boycott of Latitude and called on others to follow suit.East Suffolk council said on behalf of Latitude that it had “no concerns about the sheep this year or in the 14 years that this activity has taken place”.“We are entirely happy that the water-based dye is completely safe and that the festival organisers have taken all appropriate steps to ensure the animals are content, safe and well-looked after,” the council added.“As part of our wide-ranging licensing and environmental health responsibilities, the council takes the welfare of all animals very seriously and if we had encountered any issues or felt that the sheep were suffering distress of any kind we would not permit such an activity.”The festival in Henham Park, which this year featured headline sets from Lana Del Rey and Snow Patrol, is billed as a family festival with a broad cultural programme alongside activities such as lake swimming and wellness treatments.Latitude was named best major festival in 2017 and best family festival in 2018 at the UK Festival awards."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bac84d8c5aac2c5e7fe40207682ab20db7546e95/0_266_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7f297b480b8307095b3a1417af523d65","title":"jerusalem jaffa gate new imperial hotel final showdown","story":"Standing on a balcony at the New Imperial Hotel, overlooking Jaffa Gate in Jerusalem’s Old City, 75-year-old Walid Dajani last week declared a one-man war on Jewish settlers.Officials from Israel’s supreme court had served an eviction notice against Dajani following a ruling last month that the disputed 2005 sale of the historic 40-room hotel to a radical settler group was valid. The Jewish settlers’ organisation Ateret Cohanim immediately branded him “a squatter” and threatened to seize the building. Such a move would establish a strategically valuable settler presence just inside Jaffa Gate, the main entrance to the ancient city’s Christian Quarter.According to Dajani, the settlers – who seek to create a Jewish majority throughout the Old City which, along with East Jerusalem, was annexed by Israel in the Arab-Israeli war of 1967 – are enacting “the rape of Jaffa Gate”. His family has owned land on nearby Mount Zion for 800 years, and has run the New Imperial since 1949. “From this moment I am embarking on the fight of my life,” he said, calling on Christians, Muslims, Jews and world leaders to fall in behind him. “On my back, they will take me out.”So far his appeal for international support has been met mostly with silence. But earlier this month, local Christian leaders, terrified of the political and religious consequences of the settlers’ takeover, demonstrated inside Jaffa Gate.Archbishop Theodosius Attulah, spokesperson for the Greek Orthodox church, criticised the supreme court decision, saying the sale was fraudulent. “The Christian properties have been a target for 70 years, but this is the most dangerous so far. It is aimed at marginalising Palestinian influence and weakening the Christian presence in the Old City. It will not be tolerated.“Jerusalem is sacred to the three monotheistic religions, the purpose of the move is to transform the city into a place of hatred and struggle,” he said.The showdown is the culmination of a lengthy court wrangle dating back to a suspect secret sale of Greek Orthodox-owned properties to settlers, authorised by a now deposed Greek Patriarchate. Three properties were involved: the New Imperial Hotel and the Petra Hotel, both in the Jaffa Gate plaza, and a house in the Muslim Quarter.The Greek Orthodox church, the largest private landowner in Israel and the occupied territories, has often sold property in East Jerusalem to Jewish settlers who deploy dubious means to secure deals. The New Imperial Hotel was sold behind Dajani’s back, despite the fact that he is a protected tenant, and the $1.8m deal for the three properties was signed by a Greek official who has since disappeared.Michael Sfard, a leading Israeli human rights lawyer, said it was hard to believe the supreme court ruling would stand. “The price itself should have shown this was suspicious. It’s the cost of a two-bed flat in Tel Aviv,” he said.“The hotel is priceless,” said Dajani, whose protected tenancy was legally agreed with the previous Greek patriarch for three generations. “The furniture alone is worth half a million,” he added.The hotel boasts spacious dining areas, tea rooms where Black Forest gateau is served, hallways decorated with ornate early-Ottoman carvings and pictures of famous guests including Kaiser Wilhelm II who visited Jerusalem in 1898. In pride of place is a photograph of General Edmund Allenby who entered Jaffa Gate on foot in December 1917, after winning the Battle of Jerusalem and addressed crowds from the Imperial’s balcony.Dajani fears representatives of the settlers will seek entry to the hotel any day. He has been watching his security cameras and monitoring suspicious activity on hotel booking websites. He says he has learned that hotel “clients” linked to the settler group had taken rooms in the hotel through Booking and were already inside the property. He has closed the rooftop restaurant to prevent incursions from adjoining buildings.He invited the EU delegate in Jerusalem to book rooms at the hotel for each member country as a show of support and to prevent a takeover by “fake guests”, but received no reply. “They didn’t even drop by for a coffee to show support.”Since Donald Trump moved the US embassy to Jerusalem last year, recognising the city as Israel’s capital, European diplomats have floundered, unable to show alternative leadership. Meanwhile, the demoralised Palestinian community in the city is carved off by the imposing separation barrier from the Palestinian Authority based in Ramallah in the West Bank.On Friday, however, Dajani received news that an appeal to King Abdullah of Jordan may bear fruit. Feelers had also been put out to the Vatican, and a visiting official from Jeremy Corbyn’s office had dropped by with messages of support.Dajani was most cheered by support from Russian president Vladimir Putin, reportedly under pressure from the Russian Orthodox community to call for the sale to be annulled. This led to a former Israeli chief of staff, General Giora Eiland, to warn that a settler seizure of the properties “might create a crisis for relations between Israel and the Christian world and bring negative relations with the Russian president”.Even so, looking across from the Imperial’s roof to the Dome of the Rock, the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, and the city’s other sacred sites, Dajani’s shoulders slumped a little. “We have to do the impossible,” he said. “When I look at the walls opposite, I see them cry, asking: ‘Where are the people who love Jerusalem?’”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3962965.1563710624!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"first traffic free plaza trial at dublin s college green begins today","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tCollege Green has been closed to traffic and converted into a plaza today. Photograph: Nick BradshawThe More than 20 bus routes will be erted from the area to facilitate a range of family activities, including outdoor art classes organised by the Hugh Lane Gallery. Cars and taxis will also be banned from the junction of George’s Street to College Green.The board last November refused permission for Dublin City Council’s €10 million plaza scheme due to concerns about the “significantly negative impacts” it would have on bus transport, and traffic in the city. The plaza plan would have seen a ban on all traffic, including buses and taxis, from accessing Dame Street through College Green.The council plans to submit a fresh application to the board later this year, but has decided to close College Green to all traffic today and for the next two Sundays between 7am and 7pm, to test out the popularity of the plaza and iron out any logistical difficulties.Southbound buses which normally traverse College Green to head west on Dame Street will be erted down Westmoreland Street and onto the south quays. Northbound buses will be erted through the Christchurch area and down Winetavern Street to the north quays, a plan which Dublin Bus had described at “socially regressive” when the council made its last application for the plaza.Motorists heading east on Dame Street towards College Green, will be directed to take a right turn onto George’s Street, a manoeuvre which has been illegal for many years. Some buses will also use this right hand turn to reach the south of the city.The taxi ranks at Foster’s Place and at College Green will be closed, but a temporary extended taxi rank will be available on D’Olier Street. The Luas will operate normally.A temporary two-way cycle lane will be in operation on the southern side of College Green for the day. This cycle lane was part of the council’s plans for the plaza when it applied to the board in May 2017.Art classesThe council’s head of traffic management Brendan O’Brien has said the council is not planning to redesign the plaza when it makes its new submission to the board, but will instead provide more information on the traffic and transport implications of the scheme, particularly in relation to buses.Today artists from the gallery will hold sketching and drawing classes in College Green at noon, 1pm, 2pm and 3pm with no booking required and all material supplied. The event will also feature interactive street art, 3D pavement illusions and face-painters.On July 28th, the area will play host to a science-based event called Explore and Create including a range of science and technology attractions from the past, present and potential future with the opportunity to participate in interactive workshops.The first week of August is International Clown Week and to celebrate, the final event on August 4th will be a “city carnival”. In addition to performances from a number of inidual artists and groups, there will be an antique carousel, while face-painters, stilt-walkers, jugglers and mime artists will host workshops to give families the chance to try out some basic circus skills.Business group Dublin Chamber has welcomed the plaza trial. “We put the idea out to our members and about three quarter thought the trial was a good idea,” head of communications Graeme McQueen said. “It’s a good move and hopefully it will educate the process and educate the next stage of the plaza.”"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"DUP leaders says renewed effort to bring in same sex marriage likely to succeed\u0026lsquoCome on Shane\u0026rsquo the crowd roar as the Offaly man bids for gloryStrongly worded column says Donal Conway must quit for State funding to be restoredOperator says marsupial at risk of infection called Lumpy Jaw which can prove fatalThe animals are not native to Ireland but may have been introduced as petsT\u0026aacutenaiste says it is like saying \u0026lsquogive me what I want or I\u0026rsquom going to burn the house down\u0026rsquoCars, buses, taxis to be banned from junction of George\u0026rsquos Street to College GreenIf closure proceeds at Cork centre, others will follow, Solidarity TD Mick Barry tells marchTwo Dublin city stations closed to facilitate construction workIncident occurred at Lisacrue, near Killeagh, on the N25 between Cork and WaterfordSome 4,000 women invited to attend GP for precautionary repeat screening\u0026lsquoI didn\u0026rsquot do it\u0026rsquo was accused\u0026rsquos response to charge, court hearsIncident seen by air traffic controllers who confirmed seeing a flame-out of right engine\u0026lsquoClean air action\u0026rsquo taken to highlight need to address city\u0026rsquos levels of air pollutionJudge grants defendant legal aid before adjourning caseFormer president outlines three steps all can take to alter climate change directionTemperatures will reach the mid-20s in the greater Dublin region, north Leinster and east Ulster on MondayCady Coleman says moon mission will provide \u0026lsquostepping stone\u0026rsquo for 2030s Mars landingFigures in over-breeding report \u0026lsquobased on guesstimates, estimates and assumptions\u0026rsquo \u0026ndash IGB chiefMiche\u0026aacutel Martin said US president\u0026rsquos comments on four congresswomen were outrageous"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3963051.1563721038!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"british open how sport and shane lowry are uniting ireland","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Shane Lowry   hits from the rough on the final day of the British Open Golf Championship at Royal Portrush. Photograph: Facundo ArrizabalagaEPA   Out on the course at Royal Portrush, it feels like magic is in the making. The first British Open golf championship to be held on Irish soil in almost 70 years, and a potential Irish winner.As Shane Lowry tees off, the roar of the crowd is deafening. “Come on Shane,” they shout, phones held aloft to record the moment. The cheers reverberate around the course, as if tracking his progress from hole to hole. At the 18th, the Irish flag stands out.At 16 under par, Lowry started earlier on Sunday with a four-shot lead among those watching is Niall Morrissey from Co Kildare.“It was an unbelievable day yesterday,” he says. “We saw most of Lowry’s round - that 63 was incredible.“It puts a whole different spin on the day to have an Irish guy in the lead. I was at Carnoustie when Padraig Harrington won, and I’ve only been to the Open twice.”Might he bring Lowry luck? Morrissey laughs. “Well, he’s in good shape now. It would be incredible if he won.”Out on the course the Irish contingent are much in evidence. Along the ropes which mark out the course, tricolours are held aloft one man is dressed head to toe in a shamrock-patterned suit.“It has the feel of a home game here,” says Morrissey. “It’s Northern Ireland and it’s Ireland and it’s golf. Just the prospect of a home winner would make the weekend a whole better prospect.”‘No borders’Of the 200,000 spectators who have come to Portrush for the Open, more than half of ticket sales were to people from outside Northern Ireland. On the course, accents from all over Ireland mingle with Scottish, American and Australian tones if they have one thing in common, it is their insistence that talk of a border does not belong here. “There are no borders in golf,” is an oft-repeated phrase.“Golf is an all-Ireland sport,” explains Michael Callaghan, from Strabane, Co Tyrone.“Protestants and Catholics have always played golf together, and that’s the way it should be. It’s not a Protestant sport or a Catholic sport, it’s a universal sport, which unites people through their love of golf. Sport breaks down barriers.Not quite everybody. Two men wear jackets with the Northern Ireland football team logo “we’ll tell you what we think as long as we don’t have to give our names,” they tell The .“To be totally honest, it’s the first time in 70 years the Open’s been here and it’s a bit galling to see all the Tricolours out. I’ve a Red Hand of Ulster here in my bag, just in case,” he explains.Both stress that this is not meant in a sectarian way. “It’s just that it’s sort of Northern Ireland’s moment in the sun, and we won’t quite get it if Shane Lowry wins - though it would also be great if he won.“We’d just have loved to have seen Rory in the final.“But there’s been absolutely no aggression here - even McIlroy said he’ll play for Ireland in the Olympics and nobody thinks any less of him for that. There’s pretty much no ide any more.”‘Sense of unity’Stephen McGrath and his friends agree. In the wind and rain on the course, their Hawaiian shirts and sunhats are attracting plenty of attention.“Well somebody’s got to dress for the weather you want,” says McGrath.They are all from Belfast some see themselves as British, some as Irish. “We don’t think there’s any difference - it doesn’t come into it,” he explains. “Not for our generation anyway. It’s not what we’ve grown up with. We’re beyond that - nobody cares any more.”If Lowry wins, he has more than simply the Claret Jug coming to him. “We’re going to present him with one of our shirts.”Brian and Mary O’Higgins are just as confident. From Oranmore, Co Galway, they are queuing under a golf umbrella to get up to the stands for a better view.“Sport knows no boundaries, and there shouldn’t be any in politics,” says Mary. “It’s been fantastic - even travelling up here was so easy, and there’s just such a sense of friendship out here on the course.“To think that this is here in Northern Ireland after all the years of turmoil, it’s wonderful.“At one stage it all has to be left behind and we have to move on,” adds Brian. “There’s an all-Ireland rugby team, and Shane’s a sportsman at heart - of course his father was a great GAA man.“There’s a real sense of unity in sport. It unites Ireland. Fair play to the Open people for having the confidence to bring it to Northern Ireland.”Can Lowry do it? “I hope he can hold on. Is it too early to start saying there’ll be not a drop of work done next week?”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3963006.1563718934!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"fai president seeking re election is mind boggling says shane ross","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Minister for  Sport Shane Ross said that “if corporate kings or queens retain positions of power for too long, they can develop bad habits”. File photograph: Alan BetsonThe FAI president Donal Conway’s decision to seek re-election to the post is “mind-boggling”, Minister for Sport Shane Ross has said. Mr Ross accused Mr Conway of being part of “woeful” corporate governance by spending 14 years on the FAI board while also seeking to remain on it. In his strongest comments to date, Mr Ross said while Mr Conway “may have done a decent job in recent weeks” he had failed to see that he was part of the problem of the FAI and not the solution. Currently the Government, through its funding body the Irish Sports Council, has withdrawn all its funding from the FAI. The association has received almost €50 million from the State in the last 10 years. The Government, Mr Ross revealed, was “aghast” at corporate governance breaches within the association and the FAI “has gone walkabout”. He accused Mr Conway of reneging on a pledge that he made when he wrote to the Minister on April 16th saying that he and rest of the board would stand down at the annual general meeting (AGM) of the FAI. The AGM is due to take place in Trim next week and Mr Conway is unopposed for the role. Mr Conway said he changed his mind about stepping down after a corporate governance review recommended that up to two officers of the board should stay on for a further 12 months to help with the transition to a new board set-up.‘Bad habits’Mr Ross, in a column in the Sunday Independent, responded: “Last week he put this name forward for re-election as president of the FAI. I responded by asking him to withdraw his nomination and honour his promise. Apparently the FAI regard my demand that he keep his word as an interference! Pretty odd, as he himself publicly introduced the subject in his letter.”Mr Ross warned the FAI that the Government cannot offer financial support to the association while it continues to breach acceptable governance norms. He said: “The reason is obvious. If corporate kings or queens retain positions of power for too long, they can develop bad habits. “Accountability can go out the window. Vigilance can disappear. Pals keep pals on boards. Expenses become lax. Annual accounts are not produced in time for scheduled meetings. Numerous inquiries or forensic audits are required. All familiar sins in the FAI. Conway’s decision to stay on – even if unopposed – is mind-boggling.” He also accused Mr Conway of exhibiting an “instinctive hostility to reform” by appointing a former FAI employee, Noel Mooney, as the interim head of the organisation. He further criticised the imposition of a board quorum of just two people into the FAI’s new articles of association. “Even the corporate governance review did not recommend such a bizarre minimum number for board meetings to be quorate. “Paradoxically the rule books nominates six. Rule books are easier to change than constitutions.” Mr Ross welcomed the decision by FAI delegates to overwhelmingly pass changes recommended by the Sport IrelandFAI governance review group to improve corporate governance at the association. He said Mr Conway could have that as his legacy at the FAI if he did not put his name forward for election next week.

Photograph: Simon DawsonBloombergSenior figures in the Irish Government no longer wonder about whether they will be faced with Boris Johnson or Jeremy Hunt as the next British prime minister. Barring a political earthquake of monumental proportions, they accept that it will be Johnson.However, they do wonder about which Johnson they will get. Irish diplomats have combed through his speeches and articles. They have gathered information, views, opinions and the countless perspectives on him that exist.The Irish Embassy in London has an exceptionally wide and effective network for taking soundings throughout the political and media world in Westminster and beyond, and they have been funnelling reports back to Dublin. Still, the view in Dublin is: we’ll wait and see what he says. The subtext: we have no idea what he’ll do. The wait-and-see stance rests upon a remarkable fact that for a politician about to reach the high office in his land: nobody appears to trust a word he says.Perhaps that’s not surprising. He has promised, repeatedly, to take the UK out of the EU by October 31st, “do-or-die”, with or without a deal. Though he has also said that once the EU sees that the UK is serious about leaving with no deal, it will consent to changes to the backstop, which would enable an orderly Brexit to happen on the agreed October date.Another Irish official puts it slightly differently: are we going to get mayor of London Boris, or foreign secretary Boris?In the mayor’s office, Johnson had strong deputies and gave them the powers to do the work he wanted done. As foreign secretary, he was disorganised, directionless, ineffectual (he eventually resigned from the cabinet over Theresa May’s Brexit policy, having repeatedly endorsed it). Even Johnson’s supporters seldom refer to his time as the UK’s diplomatic and foreign policy supremo. Throughout the campaign for the leadership, he has hardly mentioned it.Warning light here: being prime minister is an infinitely more difficult job than being either mayor of London or foreign secretary. And the stakes – for Ireland and the UK – are a lot higher. The decisions Johnson makes in the coming weeks and months will have a direct bearing on the lives of people throughout Britain and Ireland for decades to come.Brexiteer blusterIn Dublin, Ministers and officials say they are conscious of the need not to let Brexit dominate the business of government to the exclusion of all else, in the way that it has done in the UK.And yet they confess that nothing approaches the issue in importance. That will become clear once Johnson becomes prime minister and the recent otiose phase of Theresa May’s lame-duck period gives way to three months of deal-or-no-deal decision time.Dublin half-expects a visit from Johnson soon after he becomes prime minister, possibly even next week. Then there will be no extended August break for senior politicians and officials: they’ll all be back at their desks by the middle of the month, trying to figure out: which Boris?Patrick Maguire, political correspondent with the New Statesman magazine in London, says that Boris will want to be both Borises – the brash Brexiteer in order to get a new deal from Brussels, and the pragmatic centrist who can govern, and win an election, as a one-Nation Tory.Blair Horan, a retired trade union chief who researches and writes on Brexit issues for the Institute of International and European Affairs think tank, sees this possibility, too, and worries it will end up stumbling into a no-deal.If this is the Johnson plan it hinges on one very questionable assumption: that Brussels and Dublin will be sufficiently impressedintimidated by Brexiteer bluster that they will consent to a change in the backstop arrangements contained in the withdrawal agreement.That might turn out to be the case. But at present there is little evidence that it will. And there is a lot of evidence that it will not. For a start, there is a series of frequent and repeated statements from Irish and EU leaders. There is the fact that it is clearly against the EU’s interests to do so. And there is the fact, attested to by Irish and EU sources, that many people in Dublin and Brussels believe that (a) Johnson is bluffing about a no-deal and (b) even if he isn’t bluffing, parliament will stop him.Their belief in the latter – prompted by contacts with British ministers – has been bolstered by the result of Thursday’s vote in the House of Commons, which seeks to block the suspension of parliament. Even though it is not clear that parliament can effectively prevent a no-deal outcome, it is certainly clear that it will try. Having already endured the fiasco of dealing with a prime minister who could not control her parliament, this will not encourage the EU to negotiate with Johnson.‘Spoilt child’Some sources in Dublin, London and Brussels say that Johnson’s only hope of progress is to approach the EU with a realistic proposal and a conciliatory mood. The EU is not going to tear up the backstop and Johnson knows that. But a change, centring mostly on the political declaration (which charts the direction for the future trade deal) but perhaps involving tweaks to the backstop, might be a different matter. It would at least be more difficult to reject. On Thursday, the Taoiseach suggested that the backstop could be changed from an arrangement which covers the whole of the UK, to one which just related to Northern Ireland. This would, after all, mean reopening the withdrawal agreement. But it is far from clear that Johnson has either the desire or political capacity for such a nuanced approach.And whatever he says about Dublin, Johnson will be dealing not just with Leo Varadkar but with the EU, whose remarkable cohesion on the question shows no sign of slipping.And in Brussels, they think he is simply a liar and a charlatan. Having been subjected to Johnson’s malicious and frequently mendacious journalism, and having watched his championing of Brexit with growing horror, the EU is disinclined to give Johnson the benefit of the doubt.A “spoilt child of a man, who lies like a toddler and has only the vaguest of political convictions” was the description a former EU spokesman, Jean Quatremer. And yet, Quatremer reflected, “a pragmatic buffoon might be better than a fanatic”.“Many in Brussels believe he is capable of any move, even backtracking and shelving Brexit if he thinks it could be turned to his personal advantage,” he wrote.It is this personal and political unpredictability that make the forthcoming Johnson premiership, its Brexit policy and its ultimate direction so uncertain. Everyone will wait and see. But the range of possible outcomes is dizzyingly wide.“I doubt if he is sitting around talking to serious people,” says McDonagh. “My sense is that he acts instinctively . . . He will smell the air and decide where political advantage lies.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches. See more here.

Photograph: iStockHe’s right, this angry old man in melting bronzer shouting in the July heat: Those of us who don’t like what’s going on in this country should get the hell out. “Go back,” as he said, to the “crime-infested places from which they came.” A fine idea.For me, as with more than 30 million other Americans with my hyphenate, that’s tiny Ireland, the country once so infested with crime, famine, disease and assorted horrors of foreignness that its British overlords said a merciful God was doing a favour by killing off the starving masses.So back I went to have a look. This, mind you, was just before president Donald Trump’s suggestion to his fellow citizens to get out. And also, generations after someone on my father’s side made the choice to flee for life itself, rather than fall into the cold Irish ground through the bottom of a reusable coffin.What I found on that island where typhus once took entire families as they shivered on floors of mud, where, by one medical estimate, 50 per cent of the children in Dublin once died before their first birthday, is now a land of universal health care.Health care for all residents: It’s still a surprise to someone from a nation where the number of uninsured Americans has gone up by 7 million under Trump. I had left a place where nearly 1 in 7 people are left to fend for themselves when sick, to a fully covered country, the norm in most of the industrialised world.What I found in that place where barefooted, Gaelic-speaking hordes once could not read an English sign are colleges nearly free to its citizens – good colleges, at that. Imagine, a family not having to bankrupt itself to help a child off to a better life.What I found is a republic where nearly 1 in 8 people were born abroad, nearly as high a percentage as the foreign-born population of the United States. The prime minister, Leo Varadkar, is himself a son of an Indian immigrant. His father was born in Mumbai, while his mother hails from County Waterford, the home also of my mother’s distant family.That 19th-century hellhole has become a 21st-century heaven. The Irish have become us – what we wanted and aspired to. They are living our national narrative, a country open to those fleeing oppressors and lack of opportunity. Its prime minister would never gloat over a “send her back” chant at a hatefest directed at new members of the republic.Back home in America, the unimaginable is the new norm: a fully blossoming fascism. We’re stuck in a hideous loop of hate. But it’s also an idiocy loop. Why are we arguing about something any second grader has already settled after looking around the classroom and realising that nearly every other child is a descendant of someone from a foreign land? Read the resolution the House of Representatives passed on Tuesday, citing Ronald Reagan, John F Kennedy and Benjamin Franklin, and quoting Franklin Roosevelt’s call to “remember always, that all of us, and you and I especially, are descended from immigrants and revolutionists.” It’s the kind of immigrants-make-a-nation-stronger boilerplate that would normally pass the House with unanimous consent, but it drew only four Republican votes.SludgeThis is how low Trump has taken us. We are a debased nation fighting over the scraps of our former principles. Should someone offer a resolution saluting the “purple mountain majesties” of the United States, every Republican would vote against it if Trump tweeted against a colour that is not orange. Senator Mitch McConnell, whose immigrant wife is indirectly a target of this sludge, would say, as he did about the “send-her-back chants,” that the president is “on to something.”I’m against the dismissal of others with the preemptive pejorative of “white privilege.” It closes minds and ends conversations. But this is one case where white privilege applies. For Trump’s tweet wasn’t aimed at me. Nor was it directed at his vice president, the cipher and coward Mike Pence, himself an Irish-American.Trump’s hate blast was directed solely at people of colour. His tweet was the textbook definition of racism. And I should add in the interest of full transparency, I disagree with much of the policy initiatives of the four left-wing congresswomen targeted by Trump. It was wrong and incorrect for them to make Nancy Pelosi’s disagreement with them about race. That episode was another textbook illustration of why the far left has trouble winning a majority.But let’s leave that discussion for another day. Back in the country from which I came, the Irish appear genuinely perplexed at this American vomiting of principle. Writing in The , Oliver Sears, a British-born resident of Ireland and son of a Polish holocaust survivor, wondered how any immigrant could ever vote for Trump.I heard a similar thing when I went back: How could Irish-Americans vote for this awful man without becoming traitors to their heritage? For this Ireland has become what America used to be. If only America could be more like this Ireland.

The fourth duke used to put on plays in the orangery and invite people to watch.Part of the audience is in the open air, which means they are able to hear the birds sing and feel the heat of the sun, in the same way people would have done hundreds of years ago.Steam trains could be forced off the tracks by new tougher safety rules, heritage railway boss warnsIran latest: Iain Duncan Smith accuses Government of \u0026#39major failure\u0026#39 after failing to take up US assets Comment: The Conservative Party must now reject the vacuous centrism of Rory Stewart\u0026#39Garish\u0026#39 new water fountains in London criticised for failing to emulate classic Victorian originalsComment: The next Chancellor could spark an economic revolution with a radical, tax-cutting budgetHong Kong protests take to streets for seventh weekend in a rowComment: Ditching the licence fee could be the salvation of our pompous, anti-intellectual BBC Jeremy Vine struggles to have \u0026#39direct\u0026#39 conversations with his teenage daughters Philip Hammond confirms he will resign on Wednesday as he cannot accept Boris\u0026#39s no-dealComment: What I\u0026#39ll miss about drawing Mrs MayComment: Holidays reinforce my love affair with all things European - except its UnionComment: Let’s make teenage girls tougher, not Instagram tamerKeeping Faith star Eve Myles: \u0026#39I\u0026#39m proud to be a working-class actress\u0026#39 Homeowners face pulling down extensions in Grenfell building inspection crisisComment: Remainer MPs make no-deal more likely with their desperate efforts to block itDivisions deepen in Pakistan as Imran Khan reaches one year in officeSummer getaway chaos: Airlines must allow passengers to switch flights for freeComment: When it comes to leadership, gullible goodwill is no match for cunning cynicismWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/06/13/09/maireadcolour-1.jpg","title":"dating relationships matchmaking romance berkeley international","story":"IM Subscribe NowIM Subscribe NowCreated with Sketch.IM  Subscribe NowIM  Subscribe NowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Try Independent Minds free for 1 monthSee the optionsCreated with Sketch.View from the Top: The\u0026nbspBerkeley International founder still believes in\u0026nbsppersonal contact, romance and good old-fashioned manners. She\u0026nbspalso believes in charging upwards of £10k for her\u0026nbspservicesClick to followThe IndependentIt wasn’t long ago that using a dating agency could mark you as an undesirable, perhaps even a weirdo. But with the rise of the internet, using a third party to find love has become a commonplace, even preferred, method of finding a partner.\u0026nbspThis rush to find love online has, some argue, reduced the dating process to a superficial transaction. For some, the romance and ritual of dating has been lost and there is at least one introduction agency that still believes in personal contact, romance and good old-fashioned manners. It also believes in charging upwards of £10k for its services.Berkeley International was set up by Mairead Molloy in 2003 to provide a high-end, personal introduction service for the wealthy.\u0026nbspAnd although she welcomes the normalisation of finding love in this way, she does seem to hanker after a pre-social media world where, she believes, people were just… nicer.“The first couple of years of operating were easier than they are now because people were nicer, more mannerly, easier to deal with and more respectful. People were more tolerant and less bitchy,” she says.\u0026nbspWhile it might be easy to dismiss Molloy and Berkeley International as a throwback to the days of submitting dating profiles via VHS cassette, the company has grown from one office in 2003 to a global network across 13 countries turning over £1m annually.\u0026nbspSo, there’s clearly a market for its services and, according to Molloy, it’s not the preserve of “the twin pearls set” with clients on her books as young as 22 and as mature as 88 years old. They are a mix of entrepreneurs, inherited wealth, self-starters and celebrities.\u0026nbspA demanding clientele for sure but one that Mairead seems to revel in managing.Growing up in County Wexford in Ireland, she studied hotel management before setting up and ultimately selling a software company before, on a whim, buying a hotel in Cannes, where she still lives. That venture lasted four and half years before she once again sold up and accepted the role of global director at a fledgling Berkeley International.What’s it like to work as a matchmaker?It was while setting up Berkeley International that she took a degree in psychology and a masters in criminology, redefining herself as a relationship psychologist along the way.\u0026nbspIt’s not clear whether she is a natural people person, or if the psychology training has given her the skills, but she is able to disarm and engage the person in front of her effortlessly. She is a jumble of relaxed and intense, measured and flippant, confident and vulnerable. It’s an unusual mix, but it seems to work with a demanding client base.\u0026nbspShe happily concedes that the scope for complaint in her line of work is 100 per cent, which is why she believes that the one-on-one interaction her agency provides is so important. “When someone comes in, you have to paint an absolutely honest version of reality. All we can do is give you advice, introduce you to the best possible people that we can and, by process of elimination, and through your feedback, try and pinpoint the best person for you.”\u0026nbspWhich sounds straightforward enough but when people have shelled out tens of thousands of pounds and not met their match, they tend to turn to the supplier for recompense.This business is all about humour and personality and being able to laugh at yourself – if you can do that, you’re going to meet someoneA 2018 court case involving premium dating agency\u0026nbspSeventy Thirty\u0026nbspshows just how wrong it can go. The agency was ordered by the courts to refund Tereza Burki’s £13,000 membership fee after she was unable to find a suitable match through their services. Ms Burki was in turn told to pay Seventy Thirty £5,000 in libel damages for posting an online review describing the company a scam. All very messy and undignified. So how does Molly ensure that Berkeley does not find itself dragged into a similarly unseemly situation?“I don’t think the ruling against Seventy Thirty was justified – I think it was brutally unfair,” she says.\u0026nbsp“These people come into introduction agencies and pay money and they have this idea in their head that they are going to meet their prince or princess charming – they are deluded.“What you should do is come in with an open mind and treat the people who are looking after you with respect and accept the dates that are arranged based on the criteria you have provided. This business is all about humour and personality and being able to laugh at yourself – if you can do that, you’re going to meet someone.”She says that over the last 16 years, Berkeley has had about 5,000 people on its books and that the success rate, defined as a relationship lasting longer than six months, is high, depending on the age group.\u0026nbsp“If you are between 22-38, the success rate can be as high as 70 per cent. That success rate decreases the older you get but once people go beyond the childbearing years, it goes back up. For older people it is really high, about 80 per cent, but they’re more willing to accept reality.”Man sues elite matchmaker after spending $426,000 on six datesBerkeley has three options for the lovelorn – membership that provides access to the UK client base, an equivalent that broadens the search across Europe and further afield, and a bespoke service where matches are “headhunted” on behalf of a client.\u0026nbspTravelling around the world, headhunting that elusive inidual to complete the life of a wealthy inidual (“never an English person, always European or international and generally a man in his early 50s or woman in her mid-to late 30s”), must mean Molloy has had to leave her Wexford roots behind and join a global elite.“I live in a simple world,” she insists.\u0026nbsp“I don’t live in a fancy house or drive a fancy car. I like a fried egg sandwich, watching Coronation Street on the phone to my mother. The world of wealth and fame doesn’t bother me. It’s not me, it’s what I do.”\u0026nbspThis is reflected in her desires for the future. Aside from desperately wanting to appear on the Graham Norton Show, “I just want to go to India and not give a sh*t about anything.” She quickly admits that she couldn’t do that forever. She needs to be doing something.\u0026nbspAnd for now, that something is continuing to kick against the transactional approach to dating that chafes so much and bring romance, personality and love back to the world of dating.

He also wants new powers to allow him to introduce a temporary cap on rents while the commission is doing its work to establish a longer-term system.Polls suggest that around two-thirds of Londoners favour rent controls which are in place in cities such as Berlin and New York.“It is high time for private renting in London to be transformed. Londoners need fundamental change that is long overdue,”\u0026nbspMr Khan said.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.UK Housing Crisis: in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Members of ‘generation rent’, as the younger generation is often known, are finding it far more difficult to get on the housing market than previous generationsThen chancellor George Osborne visits a Help to Buy housing development in Lewisham in 2014.

That’s why this landmark report sets out a detailed blueprint of what the government must do to overhaul tenancy laws, and what powers City Hall needs from them to bring rents down.”The proportion of people renting from private landlords in the capital has risen from 11 per cent in 1990 to 26 per cent last year.Research published last week by PricewaterhouseCoopers found that private rents are now unaffordable for workers on the median wage in London, the southeast, southwest and east of England, effectively pricing out many key workers such as nurses and primary school teachers.The problem is particularly acute in London where rents take up 42 per cent of the average pre-tax wage. Separate research by housing charity Shelter found that rents in several London boroughs are among the least affordable anywhere in the UK.\u0026nbspKensington and Chelsea is the least affordable borough, with average rents equivalent to 127 per cent of a low-earning family’s\u0026nbsppay, followed by Westminster at 111 per cent and Camden at 92 per cent.\u0026nbspLower-income working families in two-thirds\u0026nbspof England need to spend more than 30 per cent of their income to rent a two-bed home.Housing crisis: Nurses and teachers priced out of UK regions by risingThe mayor’s plans require a new bill to be approved by parliament handing him extra powers. Any new legislation is likely to come up against stiff resistance from the government which has previously stated its opposition to rent controls.A spokesperson for the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said the government had already taken “unprecedented action to transform the private rental market and protect the millions of tenants who live in rented accommodation”.Rent controls are controversial with some studies showing that in certain\u0026nbspforms they can benefit particular\u0026nbspgroups over others.A 2017 paper by researchers at Stanford University found that rent controls introduced in San Francisco led to some landlords converting\u0026nbsptheir properties into expensive apartments because these were classed as new builds which were exempt from the rules.The study found that the amount saved by people in rent-controlled properties was roughly cancelled out by more expensive rents for tenants in non-rent-controlled homes.Mr Khan’s report proposes additional measures, some of which the government has already said it wants to introduce, including introducing open-ended tenancies, and ending no-fault evictions. The mayor also says he wants to scrap break clauses and\u0026nbspimprove dispute resolution services for landlords and tenants.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

And you’d have this incredible shot of green plants against a red background,” he said.SpaceX could land on the moon by 2021, Elon Musk claims (SpaceX)“My goal was simply to get the public excited, which would then get Congress excited so that they would appropriate more money and increase Nasa’s budget.”With the increasing success of SpaceX, Mr Musk has since extended his ambitions for the firm.

Now, the\u0026nbspspace agency is looking to put the first woman\u0026nbspand the next man on the lunar surface in 2024.“Being able to write that next chapter, knowing what has come before through Apollo and the shuttle programme, and knowing we are writing that next story is amazing.\u0026nbspIt is humbling to think about what they were able to do... especially considering they didn’t have the computing power we do,” she says. “That we are even in the same conversation... is incredible.”Spellman should know what the Apollo missions took, she works with veterans of that programme and while Nasa has had to build on that expertise over the past five decades the principles of that era-defining trip underpin\u0026nbspeverything she does.\u0026nbspThe current mission, called Artemis,\u0026nbspthe sister of Apollo, is daunting in itself. Having been set the task of returning to the moon in 2028, Donald Trump’s administration has\u0026nbspaccelerated that timeline. Vice-president Mike Pence said back in March that the later deadline was “just not good enough” and that “urgency must be our watch word”.While that may have something to do with that date being\u0026nbspthe end of a notional second term for Trump, the non-partisan Nasa is taking it in its stride.\u0026nbsp“It gets me really excited. I’m\u0026nbspexcited that we now have this really clear goal of boots on the moon by 2024...

A veteran of the 1960s effort, Poimboeuf said earlier this month: “This place is history in the making and it’s not over yet.”“It is not going to happen overnight... but it is comforting to know we are going through some of the same growing pains,” she adds.NasaEPA)Launch Pad 39B at the Kennedy space centre in Florida has seen its fair share of history beyond Apollo, having also been used in the space shuttle programme from 1981 to 2011 – but its latest guise is unprecedented. It will now accommodate Nasa’s heavy-duty Space Launch System (SLS), which will power the crew-carrying Orion capsule into the heavens.\u0026nbspAs an example of the sheer magnitude of the changes, more than 1.3 million feet of copper\u0026nbspwiring used in the Apollo era has\u0026nbsphad to be switched to fibre optics.\u0026nbsp“It is a pivotal time for us – we are now testing the mobile launchpad and the launcher together so we are building up the system... we are getting really close to that first mission.” An unmanned test flight of Orion is due next year, with a crewed test to follow in 2022.What happened as astronauts headed towards the MoonApollo 11 launch video shows immense power of Saturn V rocketEverything you need to know about the Apollo 11 Moon landingLast remaining moon landing video tapes up for auctionBeyond Florida and the Nasa centres across the US, the elements around the mission are fraught. Some members of congress, who have to sign off the budget for Artemis, are wary of the costs and the few details provided so far.\u0026nbsp“We have a White House directive to land humans on the Moon in five years, but no plan, and no budget details on how to do so,” Kendra Horn,\u0026nbspchair of the House subcommittee on space and aeronautics, said back in May just before a 2020 budget was announced. That budget called for an extra $1.6bn\u0026nbspto fund Artemis for that fiscal year, on top of the $21bn\u0026nbspthe president already requested for Nasa.Costs for the following years are yet to be established but will rise, with estimates that Artemis could cost $20bn\u0026nbspto $30bn or more in total.\u0026nbsp“You are sort of asking congress to put a down payment on a car, but you don’t know what you are buying and you don’t know how much it will cost,” says Dr Mary Lynne Dittmar, who has decades of experience in the space field and is part of the Users’ Advisory Group of the National Space Council – the body reestablished by Trump under the direction of\u0026nbspPence to help guide policy.Nasa\u0026nbspadministrator Jim Bridenstine\u0026nbsptold a Senate panel\u0026nbspon Wednesday that a budget impasse and subsequent spending freeze later this year would be devastating for the chances of the Artemis mission.However,\u0026nbspwith the mission looking to set down roots for “national capability for decades” rather than just two or three trips to the moon,\u0026nbspDittmar believes it is a “different ball game” to the “war footing” of the 1960s space race. Later space missions in the 1970s and 1980s were “trying to apply a model that was specific to that one point in time... now it is a much different landscape”. More infrastructure and more countries are involved – which means the conversations over how missions will take place and what is needed will take longer.Dittmar does not doubt the political will to put humans back on the moon, but the pressure of the deadline means that things have to happen relatively quickly. Recent staff changes at the top of Nasa, initiated by those within the agency, may indicate that the urgency created by the White House is having an effect.In his speech in March, Pence raised the prospect of the use of commercial rockets to keep the mission on schedule. “If commercial rockets are the only way to get American astronauts to the moon in the next five years, then commercial rockets it will be,” he said. There are certainly advocates who believe this is the right strategy and it could reduce costs.\u0026nbspCharles Miller, who was part of the Trump administration’s transition team for Nasa in 2017 and was senior adviser for commercial space at Nasa from 2009 to 2012, believes that such partnerships between Nasa and outside companies are “fundamental”.\u0026nbsp“Artemis is an opportunity to have a complete break with the failed space policies of the last couple of decades... to open up the solar system in a way that is completely affordable and could be transformational,” he says.Why some people still believe that we never went to the Moon“If we go back to the moon in the way Trump wants and the way Obama did before him, by leveraging commercial partnerships, it can also be much faster and be of much more benefit to the world,” he adds. Miller, who is a serial space entrepreneur, says that if billionaires such as Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk are putting up capital and so “have skin in the game” it is a win-win, even if there have been some failures in the past.I think the overall strategy the Nasa administration wants to execute will succeed, the only question is when... The old model of the ‘big costs and aerospace needs’ is on the verge of collapse,” he says.Dittmar, who is also chief executive\u0026nbspfor the Coalition for Deep Space Exploration, a trade group of more than 65 companies, sees things differently. She believes the space market needs to be at a tipping point where investors and company shareholders see the potential for returns and we might not be there yet.\u0026nbsp“I think public-private partnerships have a place, yes. Do I think it is a panacea? No,” she says,\u0026nbspalthough it is more likely the market may be in shape by the time Nasa is looking at heading to Mars once the Artemis mission is complete.\u0026nbspFor Dittmar, who was involved with work on the International Space Station (ISS), the implications of the Artemis mission are beyond business or even the limited scope that the Trump White House is projecting.\u0026nbspShe is looking for American leadership in space and being able to “keep the door open for others”. More than 100 countries have been involved in the various facets of the ISS mission both on the ground and in space and such cooperation will be crucial to make the most of the moon mission and beyond.Nasa\u0027s next great mission to the moonDittmar remembers the 1969 landing and says that it represents “one of the shining moments in humanity on par with figuring out the Magna Carta”. But the full impact may not be felt for generations and it is the same with the new mission.\u0026nbsp“I do believe that other nations are going to be watching and thinking ‘what does this mean for us?’” she says. “Inspiration is not just public inspiration its inspiration in engineering, in technology development.”“We are also going to learn about ourselves as human beings – being challenged by new environments,” Dittmar adds.Inspiration for the next generation is a key motive for Spellman, who has a young son.\u0026nbsp“We want this reality of working in maths and science to hit kids all over the world,” she says. “Now there is so much access to what we are doing – can you imagine the live feed coming from the moon and kids watching that? It will put it at the fingertips of children across the world and make it real to them that they could do something like this.”In fact, Spellman hopes the Artemis mission will provide a cultural touchstone for everyone.\u0026nbsp“I hope the mission brings us all together, for at least\u0026nbspa moment,” she says.

They\u0027ll be joined by Bryan\u0026nbspTyree Henry, Kumail Nanjiani,\u0026nbspSalma Hayek\u0026nbspand deaf actor Lauren Ridloff, who plays Connie in The Walking Dead. The Rider filmmaker Chloe Zhao directs.Shang-Chi\u0026nbsphas found its lead starAfter months of speculation, it\u0027ll be Simu Liu who\u0027ll play the MCU\u0027s first Asian lead in Shang-Chi: And the Legend of the Ten Rings. The superhero is a martial arts expert who discovers that the father he knew had ulterior motives – which propels him on a collision course with the film\u0027s villain, who\u0027ll be played by Tony Leung. Awkwafina is also set to appear in an undisclosed role.\u0026nbspCaptain Marvel character\u0026nbspto appear in WandaVisionThe Disney+ TV show reuniting Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) and Vision (Paul Bettany) will also feature a character\u0026nbsppreviously seen in Captain Marvel: a grown up version of Monica Rambeau who\u0027ll be played by\u0026nbspTeyonah Parris (Dear White People).Created with Sketch. Show all 27Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The Loki TV show will clear up one big mysteryYou thought Tom Hiddleston was done with Loki? Think again. The British actor attended Comic-Con where it was revealed that his\u0026nbspforthcoming standalone TV show\u0026nbspwill explore what happened to him after he\u0026nbspabsconded with the Tesseract in Avengers: Endgame.Doctor Strange 2 will be scariest Marvel film yetAlongside the revelation that Elizabeth Olsen will play Scarlet Witch in sequel Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness,\u0026nbspit was announced by director Scott Derrickson that this will be Marvel\u0027s first true scary outing. It\u0027ll also be the first\u0026nbspfilm to\u0026nbspdelve into the multiverse, which was most recently\u0026nbspaddressed\u0026nbspin Spider-Man: Far From Home.While no official word was given on future Avengers projects, it certainly seems that Marvel is lining a Young Avengers film for its fifth or even sixth phase. Why? Well, because the character of Kate Bishop will appear in Hawkeye\u0027s standalone TV show. Comic book readers will know bishop to be a character most associated with a group of younger superheroes who is guided by Hawkeye.\u0026nbspNatalie Portman to become goddess of thunderThe most exciting news of the panel came with the announcement that Natalie Portman will be promoted from being Thor\u0027s love interest to becoming the goddess of thunder in Taika Waititi\u0027s sequel Thor: Love and Thunder. The actor posed for photographs holding Thor\u0027s hammer in the air.Fantastic Four and X-Men are joining the MCUFollowing the many announcements, Marvel boss Kevin Feige teased projects that will be released beyond 2020, also. We didn’t even mention that we’re making Black Panther 2,\u0026nbsphe said. “We didn’t even say\u0026nbspthat\u0026nbsps of the Galaxy\u0026nbspVol 3\u0026nbspis coming. We didn’t have time to talk about Captain Marvel 2. Then things got interesting as Feige added: “I didn’t even have time to talk about the Fantastic Four. And there’s no time left to talk about mutants and how mutants come into the MCU.”This was all but confirmation that plans to introduce X-Men\u0026nbspinto the MCU are indeed underway.Created with Sketch.Marvel films – ranked worst to best Show all 23Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.23. Iron Man 2 barely holds together. Rather than act as a straight sequel to the surprisingly successful Iron Man, Marvel Studios decided to overstuff the film with universe-building references (Black Widow, Nick Fury and SHIELD’s Agent Coulson all make appearances) and two-dimensional villains (played by Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke). The result is a film without any direction that serves as a Trojan horse set-up for the Avengers.22. When the Thor franchise lost its director Kenneth Branagh between the first and second films, it also had to kiss goodbye to the Shakespearean theatrics that had lent it a sense of goofy charm. Directed by Game of Thrones’s Alan Taylor, The Dark World prioritises its VFX effects above all else. It’s a dull affair: Christopher Eccleston’s Malekith is (by far) Marvel’s worst villain, being a pile of prosthetics with zero personality, while Chris Hemsworth’s Thor completes one of the most unrealistic London Tube journeys in all of cinematic history.21. Edward Norton’s version of the smashing Hulk often gets forgotten by Marvel fans – and for good reason. Whereas Mark Ruffalo’s bumbling interpretation of the character has a gravitational charm, Norton’s moping monster is void of any charisma. With Liv Tyler phoning in her performance as love interest, Betty Ross, the film falls emotionally flat and serves only as a by-the-numbers origins story.423 Avengers: Age of Ultron20. Just in case we’d forgotten that the Disney corporation is an all-consuming titan that owns half of Hollywood, the sequel to 2012’s Avengers decided to sneak in a little corporate synergy: when Iron Man accidentally creates a sentient robot (voiced by James Spader) who decides the earth’s only salvation is through the destruction of humanity, he announces his grim plans with accompaniment of a little citation of the classic “I’ve Got No Strings” from 1940’s Pinocchio. It’s a moment that exemplifies how Ultron feels like a cold, calculated operation from Marvel Studios. It’s merely tick list of obligations to move us on to the next chapter of the MCU.19. Although Kenneth Branagh’s introductory outing for Marvel’s God of Thunder fared perfectly well on release, it’s suffered massively from the MCU’s dramatic sense of progression over the years. Certainly, Tom Hiddleston’s Loki is a strong, well-crafted character right out of the gate, and his plot against his adoptive father (Anthony Hopkins) is delightfully heightened. Yet, it arguably took until Thor: Ragnarok for Chris Hemsworth’s hero to develop much sense of character beyond the initial “fish out of water” trope.18. A self-centred wealthy white man ventures to a distant land and realises his superhero potential – sound familiar? That’s because Doctor Strange and Iron Man are basically the same story, except one uses magic and the other explosives. Benedict Cumberbatch’s Marveldebut impresses with kaleidoscope visuals but lacks the heart of Robert Downey Jr’s hero, leading to a film that wastes the talents of both Tilda Swinton and Mads Mikkelsen. 723 s of the Galaxy Vol 217. The first s of the Galaxy was a risky Star Wars-inspired romp through space, following a bunch of a-holes who form an unlikely familiar bond. For the second film, James Gunn decided to turn everything up to 11, cramming half a dozen interweaving storylines, leading to Chris Pratt’s gaunt Star Lord getting side-lined. The sequel did, however, introduce the now beloved line “I’m Mary Poppins, y’all”, shouted by Yondu as he gracefully falls from the sky. A wonderfully comedic moment in a film that misses on another half-dozen punches.16. Marvel’s first crossover film was an unparalleled cinematic event – one that arguably changed Hollywood filmmaking forever, now that every major studio seems to be attempting the “shared universe” approach to franchises. Although the MCU has refined the template since, The Avengers still established the focus on humour, character, and heart that would come to define the success story of Marvel Studios. It’s a blockbuster that feels large on all fronts, delivering thrills not only in the “Battle of New York” finale, but in the creation of a team of characters that feel perfectly balanced and complementary.15. Despite Captain America: Civil War (AKA Avengers 2.5) featuring Iron Man, Black Widow, and Ant-Man (as well as introducing Black Panther and Spider-Man), the film remains first and foremost about Captain America. And that’s perhaps why the stuffed blockbuster works – were it not for a central focus, Civil War could have fallen into the trappings of other Marvel sequels in being too convoluted. The Russo Brothers also direct one of the best actions scenes in Marvel history so far, the airport scene, which looks as if it leapt straight out of a comic book.1023 Ant-Man and the Wasp14. While the first Ant Man was a mirror image of its star Paul Rudd, essentially delivering a studio comedy dressed in dex, the second found a new trick up its sleeve in the form of Evangeline Lilly’s Hope van Dyne – a smart, capable female hero who didn’t simply exist to serve as a caretaker for the male characters.13. What comes after the end? It’s the question that was hanging over the Marvel Cinematic Universe ever since the release of Avengers: Endgame was sold to us as the ultimate, cumulative chapter in a series of 22 interconnected films. And yet, while Far From Home is distinctly mid-level Marvel fare, there’s a lot to be said for the fact it isn’t crushed under the weight of its own ambitions. It feels comfortably like the end of a chapter, the beginning of a new one, an epilogue, and a palate cleanser all at once. It also works perfectly well as a film about Spider-Man.12. Ant-Man should not have worked as a film. Just look at the title! Ridiculous to think a movie about a man with ant powers should work – let alone be a blockbuster success and part of the biggest cinematic universe going. Yet, despite production problems (Edgar Wright was initially meant to helm the film), Peyton Reed directs this hilarious heist film with aplomb, taking the Marvel world a little less seriously than others. 11. Marvel redefined cinematic narratives once more in 2018, creating a single culmination to a decade’s worth of films. While it plays as total nonsense to anyone who’s a newcomer to the franchise (if that’s possible), it was, for fans, an unmatched emotional release. The Russo brothers faced the monumental task of making each crossover – from the s of the Galaxy to the kingdom of Wakanda – work in a way that feels natural, while also ushering the MCU’s biggest villain, Thanos, into centre stage. Epic both in its sense of scale and stakes, Infinity War also stages one of the most memorable finales in blockbuster history.10. With or without the beard, Steve Rogers aka Captain America has now become the brooding centre of the Avengers, but there was once a time when he was all about the old-fashioned heroics. Director Joe Johnston stayed true to the film’s 1940s setting in a film that embraces that pulpiness of early comic book history, as Steve punches Nazis and romances military officer Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell), although her character is thankfully never relegated to the role of damsel in distress.9. Despite centring on a super-powered American nationalist, the Captain America trilogy has the most consistent quality in the MCU. Its crowning moment comes with The Winter Soldier – an adrenaline-fuelled conspiracy thriller that features a spectacular twist and provokes questions regarding modern day surveillance. However, given The Russo Brothers root the rest of the movie in realism, the bombastic CGI-heavy ending is a little ridiculous. 8. Brie Larson gives a superpowered performance as Carol Danvers, the actor playing a hero that\u0027s both relatable and aspirational, strong but vulnerable. While Captain Marvel may not revolutionise the studio’s formula, the superhero\u0027s debut outing provides a platform to show off her Thanos-annihilating powers.  Thanks to a smart script, it also offers some of the very best character development in the MCU.7. While Spider-Man’s miraculous arrival in the MCU came with Captain America: Civil War, it was not until Homecoming that we truly got to know Peter Parker. Tom Holland’s incarnation swings past Andrew Garfield’s version, thanks to the film’s lower-stakes high school story allowing for intimate moments with the character. Along with including some great comic performances (Jacob Batalon as Ned stands out), Michael Keaton’s Vulture makes for a terrifying villain, and the twist is superbly done.6. While isive among Marvel fans, Shane Black’s superhero outing – with the writerdirector’s sharp, stinging dialogue – brings Tony Stark\u0027s story arc to an end (or what should have been its end) with humour and heart aplenty. As Robert Downey Jr’s genius, billionaire philanthropist deals with PTSD and struggles with his robotic creations, we see an actor giving his all. While Civil War and the Avengers films dragged him back into action, fingers are crossed Avengers: Endgame will give the character a similar emotionally satisfying send-off.5. It’s a film that’s hard to place within the MCU canon, simply because the majority of its emotional pay-offs only work due to the groundwork laid by over a decade of filmmaking. Avengers: Endgame is less about inidual storytelling and so much more about the collective experience of cinema itself. This exists to be consumed in the dark, surrounded by loved ones, as  you all cheer, gasp, and cry in unison. The fan service at work may, at times, feel a little outrageous in just how bold it feels, but Endgame earns the right to indulge. This, above all, is a celebration of these movies and their impact on the world. 4. Completely transforming the Thor franchise in a single, effortless move, director Taika Waititi injected new energy into the MCU. Ragnarok is perfectly balanced both as a standard Marvel movie, with all the right heroics and world-building intact, and as a work belonging exclusively to Waititi, filled with the humour and charm he’d previously displayed in What We Do in the Shadows and Hunt for the Wilderpeople. By finding a way to incorporate inidual voices into its massive franchise machine, Marvel found the secret to true long-term success.3. Where it all started. Iron Man subverted expectations by not only reintroducing Robert Downey Jr to the world, but by showing that a relatively unknown B-character could be at the centre of a blockbuster. Other cinematic universes fail because they attempt to introduce too much (a mistake made in Iron Man 2). The first Iron Man, though, had a self-contained story that only hinted at a bigger world – a world that would eventually become a multi-billion-dollar franchise. 2223 s of the Galaxy 2. Blasting the Marvel universe into space for an adventure with a truly ragtag group of heroes, including both a talking racoon and a sentient tree-creature, s of the Galaxy is arguably the biggest risk the franchise ever took. And it paid off in spectacular fashion, with director James Gunn giving the superhero genre a light coat of B-movie glee. It also transformed Parks and Recreation star Chris Pratt into the major box office draw he is today.1. Although Black Panther still dutifully fulfils all the requirements of a Marvel film, providing a bridge to films both past and future plus ending in a cinematic battle filled with CGI trickery, Ryan Coogler’s achievement as a director is to use a familiar framework to tell a radical story within mainstream filmmaking. In the strife between Chadwick Boseman’s T’Challa, the ruler of Wakanda, and Michael B Jordan’s Killmonger, he provided a nuanced, layered commentary on colonialism and black identity. It’s a film that triumphs both within its genre, bringing new perspectives to the superhero story, and outside of it, satisfying purely as a piece of narrative drama.23. Iron Man 2 barely holds together. Rather than act as a straight sequel to the surprisingly successful Iron Man, Marvel Studios decided to overstuff the film with universe-building references (Black Widow, Nick Fury and SHIELD’s Agent Coulson all make appearances) and two-dimensional villains (played by Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke).

He also wants new powers to allow him to introduce a temporary cap on rents while the commission is doing its work to establish a longer-term system.Polls suggest that around two-thirds of Londoners favour rent controls which are in place in cities such as Berlin and New York.“It is high time for private renting in London to be transformed. Londoners need fundamental change that is long overdue,”\u0026nbspMr Khan said.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.UK Housing Crisis: in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Members of ‘generation rent’, as the younger generation is often known, are finding it far more difficult to get on the housing market than previous generationsThen chancellor George Osborne visits a Help to Buy housing development in Lewisham in 2014.

It held numerous government construction and maintenance contracts, for many of which the future is still uncertain“Unlike other mayors around the world, I have no powers over the private rented sector. That’s why this landmark report sets out a detailed blueprint of what the government must do to overhaul tenancy laws, and what powers City Hall needs from them to bring rents down.”The proportion of people renting from private landlords in the capital has risen from 11 per cent in 1990 to 26 per cent last year.Research published last week by PricewaterhouseCoopers found that private rents are now unaffordable for workers on the median wage in London, the southeast, southwest and east of England, effectively pricing out many key workers such as nurses and primary school teachers.The problem is particularly acute in London where rents take up 42 per cent of the average pre-tax wage. Separate research by housing charity Shelter found that rents in several London boroughs are among the least affordable anywhere in the UK.\u0026nbspKensington and Chelsea is the least affordable borough, with average rents equivalent to 127 per cent of a low-earning family’s\u0026nbsppay, followed by Westminster at 111 per cent and Camden at 92 per cent.\u0026nbspLower-income working families in two-thirds\u0026nbspof England need to spend more than 30 per cent of their income to rent a two-bed home.Housing crisis: Nurses and teachers priced out of UK regions by risingThe mayor’s plans require a new bill to be approved by parliament handing him extra powers. Any new legislation is likely to come up against stiff resistance from the government which has previously stated its opposition to rent controls.A spokesperson for the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said the government had already taken “unprecedented action to transform the private rental market and protect the millions of tenants who live in rented accommodation”.Rent controls are controversial with some studies showing that in certain\u0026nbspforms they can benefit particular\u0026nbspgroups over others.A 2017 paper by researchers at Stanford University found that rent controls introduced in San Francisco led to some landlords converting\u0026nbsptheir properties into expensive apartments because these were classed as new builds which were exempt from the rules.The study found that the amount saved by people in rent-controlled properties was roughly cancelled out by more expensive rents for tenants in non-rent-controlled homes.Mr Khan’s report proposes additional measures, some of which the government has already said it wants to introduce, including introducing open-ended tenancies, and ending no-fault evictions. The mayor also says he wants to scrap break clauses and\u0026nbspimprove dispute resolution services for landlords and tenants.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Mr Hammond not only abstained on the vote but he actively\u0026nbspwanted people to know he had done so.Hammond-led plot to sink no deal could kill off Johnson’s Brexit plansHe\u0026nbsptweeted:\u0026nbsp“It should not be controversial to believe that parliament be allowed to sit, and have a say, during a key period in our country’s history.”Mr Hammond seems to be at the head of an unlikely bunch of Tory rebels, a gaggle of sensible ministers who cannot get behind Mr Johnson’s demand to keep no deal on the table.Pro-EU ministers Greg Clark, the business secretary, Rory Stewart, the international development secretary, and justice secretary David Gauke\u0026nbspalso abstained, which suggests they know they are on their way out as well.It has been suggested that Mr Hammond played a key role in organising the rebellion, sending encouraging text messages to Tory ministers and urging them to abstain.\u0026nbspThe defeat is a taste of what prime minister\u0026nbspJohnson faces over the coming months.Ms May had a tough\u0026nbsptime trying to contend with the Brexiteers snapping at her heels, but Mr Johnson will have to go up against a\u0026nbspbunch of radicalised former cabinet ministers, who command the respect of plenty of Tory MPs.Mr Hammond has even suggested he might be prepared to bring down the government should the new PM push for a no-deal Brexit. Dominic Grieve and former chancellor Ken Clarke have also said they would consider such a move.If the Tories lose a by-election on Wales next month, the government’s working majority would be reduced to three – leaving Mr Johnson with almost no room for manoeuvre.If Mr Hammond becomes a “nightmare on the backbenches”, as he joked at a Treasury party earlier this month, then\u0026nbspMr Johnson may find delivering Brexit as difficult as his predecessor.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This\u0026nbspsuggests\u0026nbspremediation efforts have stalled.More than 50,000 people are estimated to still be living in buildings that have been deemed as unsafe.The latest revelation came after the government admitted that the scale of the cladding crisis is much bigger than first thought.It had long been known that ACM panels were unsafe for use on highrise buildings, but on Thursday ministers announced that a second type of cladding had also been found to be highly flammable.It is not known how many blocks are covered in the second type of panel, called high-pressure laminate (HPL), but hundreds more buildings are likely to be affected.Advice issued by the government\u0026nbspsaid that “action to remediate unsafe HPL systems should be carried out as soon as possible”.Created with Sketch.Grenfell fire remembered two years on: In pictures Show all 12Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Campaign group Grenfell United project a message

anniversary of the Grenfell fire Further suspect types of cladding have yet to be tested, suggesting the problem could be greater still.Ministers announced this week that they wanted to see ACM cladding removed from all social sector buildings by December 2019 and all private sector buildings by June 2020.Currently just 1.25 private sector residential blocks on average are having ACM cladding removed each month, compared to an average of 3.5 for social sector blocks.This suggests that, at the current rate, the social sector work will only be completed in December 2021, and the private sector work not until May 2030.Facing pressure to do more to speed up the removal of dangerous materials, the government announced a £200m fund earlier this year to help private building owners remove ACM cladding, but critics said the money would not go far enough.As well as setting the new targets, James Brokenshire, the housing secretary, has said the government is considering punishing private block owners who are still refusing to take the cladding down after the end of this year.Labour said private blocks should be “confiscated” if owners refuse to comply and called on the government to do more to support owners who are struggling to cover the costs of removing the materials.Grenfell victimsSarah Jones, the party’s shadow housing minister, said: “The government has at long last set a deadline to remove ACM cladding, but at the current pace of work they will miss that target by a whole decade.“Ministers need to step in and help councils who are struggling to get this work done promptly. And they must clarify what enforcement action they will take against private block owners who fail to make their buildings safe. Labour has been clear that sanctions should include confiscation of blocks where necessary.“We now know that ACM is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the cladding scandal. Now the government has admitted HPL cladding is deadly, we urgently need answers on how many more buildings are covered in flammable materials and how quickly it will be removed.”Health chiefs ‘showed troubling lack of urgency over Grenfell cough’ Huge crowd marches in silence on second anniversary of Grenfell blazeSafety fears at scorched Barking flats ‘first raised after Grenfell’Matt Wrack,\u0026nbspgeneral secretary of the FBU, said:\u0026nbsp“The glacial speed of progress removing the very same flammable cladding as was on Grenfell Tower is simply shameful. To see so little progress removing dangerous cladding over the last month sums up the government’s half-hearted approach to public safety.“Despite the government’s own tests proving that high-pressure laminate cladding is not safe, they have made no commitment to remediation work. It’s as though they are waiting to see another tragic loss of life before they will protect the thousands at risk from other forms of flammable cladding.”A spokesperson for the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said: “We expect all building owners, unless there are exceptional circumstances, to complete remediation within six months of agreeing a plan – by June 2020 – or they will face enforcement action.“Owners are responsible for the safety of their buildings and it’s unacceptable if they are not moving quickly to remedy this problem – which is why the government has made £600m\u0026nbspavailable to pay for remediation and remove cost as a barrier to progress.“Ensuring the safety of residents still living in buildings with unsafe ACM cladding is a priority.”The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

These two things can co-exist.”Now, as ReTuna approaches its fifth year, it seems the world is paying attention.World leaders defy Trump’s demand to water down G20 climate commitmentMounds of rotting seaweed spoil pristine beaches in Mexico Anger as May says holidays inspired her to ‘lead’ on climate changeEurope is cooking. Our attempts to outrun climate change are futileA centre modelled on it is to open in Hamar in Norway early next year while local authorities from Germany, Japan and Switzerland have all sent representatives here over the last 18 months to consider the viability of doing something similar.Significantly, what Anna calls “a handful” of businesses, entrepreneurs and charity officials, though no councils, have also been in touch from the UK, apparently with a view to opening such a centre here.“I cannot say more, because these things are confidential,” she says. “But I am sure this will happen in Britain within two or three years. I think people are beginning to understand it is important: if you are not sustainable in the future – I mean either as a community or business – you will not survive.”ReTuna, it is worth making clear, remains a relatively small-scale experiment.There are just 12 shops, here while visitor numbers have stayed stubbornly plateaued at about 255,000 a year since it first opened in August 2015. Total sales are good – some £2.8m worth of goods have been bought since day one – but still fall slightly short of what was hoped for. A plan to expand the centre to more than 5,000 square metres remains on hold until those figures pick up.“It’s a difficult retail environment competing against the convenience of online, and we feel that as much as any other mall,” says Anna.All the same, visiting ReTuna is undoubtedly an experience.Bergström, manager of ReTunaSet opposite a nature reserve in a repurposed DHL building 10 minutes from Eskilstuna’s town centre, its high sliding doors reveal an inside that is all glass, polished concrete and exposed industrial piping. An art installations and communal seating (all made of repurposed materials, of course) welcome visitors, while a glass roof and mezzanine upper floor means natural light floods through the mall. Perfume fills the air. The café does a mean baked potato with salad.“People in Sweden love the idea of sustainability, but they sometimes associate second-hand shopping with flea markets,” says Anna, who has more than 15 years\u0027 experience managing shopping centres. “We wanted to get as far from that image as possible. This is about making pre-loved high-end and desirable.”She mentions the Mall of Scandinavia, a 171-store, 42-restaurant megaplex, which opened an hour away in Stockholm just three months after ReTuna.“But I think we’re the real Mall of Scandinavia,” the mother-of-four says. “That’s just a big version of any other shopping centre in the world. This is an attempt to show the world a new way.”Spenders here today, it seems, agree.One I speak to, Drew Nissen, is an American tourist who has popped in while visiting family in the area.“It’s an incredible place,” the 33-year-old photographer from Atlanta says. “It’s all so visually enticing. It makes you want to spend money. I’d love to see something like it in the States. Second-hand shops there are so depressing. Change that image, emphasise the green credentials, and I think you have a success story waiting to happen.”Logistically, ReTuna – named because the town’s nickname is Tuna – is an ode to Swedish efficiency.Based next door to one of two municipal recycling centres, townsfolk are encouraged to sort and dispose of their rubbish at that facility before bringing items which might be resold or reused to a drop off point at the back of the mall.There, in a vast warehouse space, a specialist team sorts these donated goods so that the centre’s shop owners – who all run their stores as independent businesses – can come along and choose what they can fix, convert, refine and, ultimately, put up for sale.“So, all these items are given a new lease of life,” explains Anna, as we walk through this backstage storage space, a veritable Santa’s grotto of indoor and outdoor furniture, electronics, clothes, games, pictures, plant pots, lamps, lights, books, bags, crockery and pottery.Some items here are all but antiques – there’s a stunning Seventies record player nestled next to a Nineties Sega Mega Drive – but others are, quite literally, brand new. I see a mirror still in original packaging and point it out. “I’m afraid some Swedes do have a habit of throwing out very quickly,” winces Anna. “We\u0027ll get TVs from the last year. Laptops also. Or settees that just need a reupholster. But this is good for our shops because it means they get a reputation for stocking high-quality goods.”Why don’t people sell such stuff online instead of donating it here, I ask?\u0026nbsp“Some will, of course, says Anna. But giving it to the centre like this is good for the community. It keeps money here, helps local people and businesses, boosts our economy. And what is good for a community is, in the end, good for the inidual too. This is what we say.Perhaps the best items received so far has been a brooch dating back to 1848. “This we have not put on sale yet,” says Anna. “We think we will get it valued first.”The whole idea was the brainchild of a local Green Party councillor back in the early Noughties. “Perhaps he was what you call a hippy,” says Anna. “But he was a hippy\u0026nbspwho was very good at lobbying, and he made the municipality see the value of this, both as a waste management strategy and a commercial enterprise.”Plans for the mall and next door\u0027s recycling centre became a flagship strand in a raft of environmentally friendly proposals – including running local buses on biogas and giving residents seven different bins – designed to make the former steel town’s economy one of the greenest in Sweden.The idea was then rubber-stamped in 2012 and the building converted with a £1.6m subsidy from the council, which is led by the country\u0027s Social Democrats. Three aims were identified and remain key today: increasing local sustainability, job creation (a dozen people work here, along with roughly 30 shop owners and staff), and offering environmental education.That latter one is fulfilled by an onsite classroom and conference facilities. An oil company was one recent organisation to hire both out for a senior staff away day. “Kind of ironic,” nods Anna.She, herself, came on board as manager just before opening.To take what she says is her dream job, she rented a flat in the town, while her family continue to live 50 miles away in Nyköping. “Almost my whole apartment is furnished with things I bought from the mall,” she says. “I love it. My only problem is making sure I don’t spend all my wages here.”Shop owners are just as enthusiastic about the project – although keen to emphasise it has not been easy to establish their stores.Eva Meden quit a high-flying job as a prison boss to set up ReModa, a chic homeware store, with sister Anita Patterssun.“Which was harder work?” the 55-year-old ponders, stood among candles, cake-stands and teacups. “I think dealing with prisoners is easy compared to running your own business. But this is so rewarding. You take things, you are creative, fix them up, try and improve them, then sell them on. This is a lovely way to make a living.”Their sales curve, the pair say, is on the “right trajectory”: they moved into a bigger unit in April after more than two years here. “I think some people in Sweden still need persuading that second-hand can be beautiful, but we say \u0027Come to our shop and see\u0027,” says 51-year-old Anita.A little way along the mezzanine floor is Amjad Al Chamaa, manager of Re:Compute:IT.Here, in a Steptoe’s Yard of electronics, he stocks everything from battered guitar amps and VHS video recorders (popular with people wanting to watch mum and dad’s old wedding footage, apparently) to state-of-the-art laptops and smart TVs. One, currently on sale at £1,200, is a 2018 Philips model.“Nice TV,” nods the 35-year-old. “Although the funny things is people come here looking for something as new as possible but they see the older stuff, see how great it looks and that it still works – things was built to last back then – and end up buying that instead.”He shrugs. “A Seventies TV - you don’t find this in a regular mall.”His shop, he adds, is especially popular with Eskilstuna’s 5,000-strong immigrant population. “I’m from Syria myself so I know this,” he says. “When you’re new to a place, you need bargains.”Bargains, indeed, are something ReTuna, as a whole, is hoping will keep attracting shoppers.Events such as a semi-regular Crazy Monday, when all prices are reduced, opening hours increased and entertainment put on, have attracted thousands through the doors.Yet more perhaps does still need to be done to prove this concept can become a long-term success.Back on the roof terrace with Anna, she reveals she is looking to have a supermarket onsite as an anchor tenant.“Obviously you can’t sell pre-loved food,” she smiles. “But there’s no reason you couldn’t strike a deal with Aldi, for instance, to have a supermarket here specialising in sustainable goods. For them, it is an experiment of something they might do more widely in the future. For us, it brings people onto\u0026nbspsite.”A salon and an ethical shoe shop are also tenants she is specifically aiming for next. “The key is to keep being imaginative and thinking big,” she says.Talking of which, I ask her about that possible speaking engagement for the International Council of Shopping Centers. Will she do it, I wonder?“Well, of course, it would mean speaking in English, which is not always easy,” she says in near-perfect English. “But I think it would be worthwhile. This is not just about ReTuna. It is about spreading this idea and this concept everywhere.”International Council of Shopping Centers\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The British boozer is in crisis.More than a quarter of all pubs have closed in the past two decades, from , in  to ,, according to the Office for National Statistics. We are losing three pubs a day. At this rate we will see the end of the British pub within our letime.So I got together with two friends who, like me, had never been in the licensed trade, to rescue this wonderful, warm, welcoming, Grade II listed building so everyone can continue to enjoy it. And I am not alone.I know of whole communities that have got together through crowd funding to save their local, with £.million being raised through internet donations for ious establishments last year.People are coming to realise that we can’t afford to lose these treasured spaces. There is no social network that can beat the pub, particularly in a world so insular where people have their noses in a mobile phone the whole time.It is so important people sit up and have a good chat, whether it is with a stranger at the bar or one of the staff. Workers come in after grafting and want to speak to the barmaid about what a hard day they’ve had, about the van breaking down or the tractor engine blowing up.Pubs often have football teams, darts, dominoes, quiz nights and are a venue where many great bands played their first gigs. In other places you will find a small shop at the local, because the village one has closed.At The Half Moon we sponsor the village cricket team, have Women’s Institute meetings with tea and cake in the morning, charity events and people come to celebrate weddings, birthdays and anniversaries.And no, nanny state meddlers, this isn’t about encouraging drinking, it’s about popping down to the local for a pint once or twice a week, which isn’t going to do any harm.The pub is now a place that families visit and I want everyone to treat it as their home.  My mum is in the garden, my dad helps out and my son Indio comes in to ask our head barman: “Can I have the usual please” — by which he means an apple juice and a packet of crisps.I had noticed pubs closing, but I hadn’t realised the reason until I became a landlady myself. Someone needs to give this industry a break. Landlords and land–ladies can only make tiny margins on the beer they sell, due to the high taxes they have to pay.That’s why I got involved with the Long Live The Local campaign last year to help pressure the Government into freezing beer duty. Everything is trying to kill this incredible part of British culture, whether it’s business rates, beer tax or sugar tax.Our rates are three times the European average and we pay almost  per cent of all beer duty across the EU, while drinking only  per cent of the beer. But the industry employs around , — many of them young people — and puts £BILLION into the economy.I can’t thank The Sun enough for its support in helping our campaign. I don’t think we would have received as many signatures without the help of you, the readers. Thankfully, the Chancellor listened to our case, agreeing in the last budget not to raise duty on beer.Sin taxes are high enough already and I hope the next Prime Minister will give us a break. It was an honour to be named  Beer Drinker Of The Year by the All-Party Parliamentary Beer Group, which promotes the unique role of the pub in our society.Certainly there is hope that this great institution can survive by changing with the times and adapting to new tastes.  It is amazing seeing all the microbreweries and gin distilleries starting up, with a new generation enthusiastic about real ingredients.The gastro pub movement also offers customers the quality food they desire. We were proud that our restaurant received two AA rosettes for culinary excellence in the first six months.But there is also a need for a pub to be a pub, where customers can come in with their wellies or work boots. At The Half Moon we have good dining on one side and an old-fashioned fireplace that drinkers can gather round on the other.For the first year I was there all the time, but now it’s wiping its own nose, so I go in two or three times a week — it’s my other jobs that pay the mortgage. It’s a great place to wind down, particularly on a Sunday, and it brings me a lot of joy.When I got the lease for the pub, a friend advised me to make sure I stood back once in a while to peer through the windows to see people having a good time. That’s why Britain’s pubs have to be saved.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

So will Ireland’s and the continent’s. Jobs will be lost.But what alternative is therethe EU and the Irish PM refuse to confront reality and make the deal palatable And taking as gospel the official forecast of a year-long recession costing £billion neglects three crucial things:That will need a dynamic new Chancellor. The existing one, Philip Hammond, is too busy shamefully betraying his own Government and scorching the earth for the incoming regime.If No Deal IS a disaster, his miserable defeatism will be partly to blame.THE BBC’s betrayal of old folk becomes yet more sickening.Not content with stripping them of their free licence while paying millions to the likes of Gary Lineker, it intends to send out enforcers to demand the cash.These goons hammering on the doors of traumatised and confused OAPs are absurdly described as an “outreach team” carrying out a “support visit”.But the BBC’s self-harm doesn’t stop there. It turns out its breach of the funding deal with the Government will trigger a stampede of pension credit claims to qualy for an exemption from the fee.Cost to taxpayers . . . £.billion.This PM has given up.

I got up first to leave home at am. I gave her a kiss on the lips.She was half asleep and mumbled, ‘I love you’. I’m so pleased I did that.“She messaged me at .am, joking, ‘How about less of the ­early-morning kisses on the lips ’ I had no idea that would be her last message to me.I called her a bit later that morning to find out how the check-up went but I got no response to WhatsApp or calls, which was unlike her.“When I called the clinic and they said she’d not turned up to her appointment, I started to panic.“I called her family, we called AE departments and the police but no one had heard from her.“I got on my bike and headed back towards our flat. On the way I saw the accident and all the roads blocked off. I had a sinking feeling.“I asked a policemanit was a woman called Emily on a scooter andthey were seriously injured.“He said he would send two senior policeman to see me.“They started walking towards me and time just seemed to stop. I kind of knew. Then they said, ‘It’s not good news. I’m just going to say it. I’m afraid she’s dead’.”Emily, a campaigner on mental health issues and YouTube influencer who had , Instagram followers, died at .am after colliding with a lorry.The machines are illegal on public roads and pavements.Jake, , says Emily “knew the risks” about riding the battery-powered device, which had a top speed of mph.He said: “It was a ­terrible accident which has left a hole in our lives.“Emily was the most beautul person I’ve ever met.“We had just moved in together and were planning a family. I’m heartbroken she has gone. I initially bought her a standard scooter for her birthday but it was on her wish-list to have an electric one, so I got it for her.“She was so excited about it and loved using it. But she was always safe, wore a helmet and was ­conscientious on the roads.“We didn’t know they couldn’t be used on the roads, as police would go past all the time and not stop her.“People have told me I’m to blame because I bought it for her, but I can’t think that.“Her family have told me I’m not. I don’t think they should be banned for adults, as they are electric, go a maximum of mph and don’t do any harm to the environment. They’re not that dferent to bicycles.“What’s needed is a move to make drivers more aware these things are on the roads. Kids should not be allowed on them. They are not toys. Losing my beautul Emily — the woman I wanted to spend my le with — is proof of that.”Jake, Emily’s sisters and her close friends are determined to ­continue her work raising awareness of mental health issues via social media and by running groups for sufferers in her memory.Jake said: “Since her death I’ve had thousands of people contact me to say what a dference she made to mental health sufferers by encouraging them to talk about it.“We’re determined to keep that going. My le was Emily and that’s not going to change.”Jake met Emily when he started working at the gym she used in Farringdon, North London, in April .He said: “It was my first day. This beautul woman strolled up to me and said, ‘Who’s this new person ’ We hit it off straight away.“We have both suffered from mental health issues and we really opened up to each other.“Emily had an amazing ability to put you at ease. She never judged you, and made things that might be taboo feel normal.“We loved the same things — the cinema, eating food out, exercise and going on holidays.“I’ll never forget our first holiday to Mexico, when she told me for the first time that she loved me. It will stay with me forever.“She always talked about our relationship in our YouTube videos.“Followers of them will know we were planning to have a baby and she was getting her eggs frozen.“It was typical of Emily. She really knew what she wanted.”Around , Brits own electric scooters, including Olympic er Tom Daley, .They typically cost between £ and £ and can travel at speeds of more than mph.Just days after Emily’s death, a -year-old boy from Beckenham, South East London, was left in a critical condition after a scooter crash on a busy road.Since then, some people have called for a ban.Jake surprised Emily on her birthday with the electric scooter that she had wanted for months.He said: “I couldn’t say no. I bought her a Xiaomi scooter because it was one of the most reliable.“She got a gold helmet to use with it on her commute to work, which was only  minutes. She even posted a video of me, her and the scooter on YouTube. She was proud of it.”Jake — a motorbike enthusiast who does not own a scooter — said his relationship with Emily had never been stronger than when they moved in together on July .He said: “Looking back, I’m so pleased we got those special last days together.“With us trying for a baby and living together, it felt like everything was going right.“In the last days she got me hooked on Love Island.“I don’t think I’ll ever watch it again.”Emily died in Battersea, South London, less than a mile from the home they shared.Police told Jake a fellow road user had caught the incident on his GoPro camera. It showed Emily riding in the cycle lane before appearing to hit a bump in the road and being jolted into the path of the passing lorry.Her gold helmet, which she had been ­wearing, was found at the scene.Jake said: “The police were incredible. The ambulance crews were there in four minutes and I don’t blame the truck driver at all.“It was an awful accident and Emily knew the risks she was ­taking. I went to stay with her parents and her sisters, who were devastated but so supportive.“I told them I had bought the scooter for her.“They said I shouldn’t feel guilty and it wasn’t my fault.”One small comfort for Jake and her family is that so much of Emily’s le was documented on social media.He said: “I did get a few ­messages on Instagram from trolls telling me it was my fault, which is not nice but that’s what you get online. I have been blown away by the people who have been in touch telling me what an inspiration Emily was to them.“People were saying things like, ‘Your girlfriend saved my le’, because of the way she talked about issues such as depression and anxiety.“Emily’s message was to talk, talk, talk about things that may have a stigma. We are going to carry on her work.“She created a thing called Brain Buddies, a safe group space for people to talk about their problems.“We are getting it an Instagram page and going to take it on in her name.“She was such a kind, considerate, effortless person — it would be an honour to carry on her work.“We want to make sure she is remembered as someone who broke down the stigma around mental health, rather than the first person to die on a scooter on our roads.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

She would now be aged .Yu, who disappeared from Futian, Shenzhen, on May   was rescued from his abductors after Chinese cops used technology to predict what he may look like now.They then used facial recognition software over two months to identy a “candidate” considered the highest match.Student Yu, now , had no idea he was a kidnap victim - which could be the case with Maddie because of the young age she was taken - until forensic tests matched his DNA to his biological parents.The McCann source said: “There appears to be new age-progression technology out there of an accuracy that has never been seen before which produced incredible results. It’s an exciting prospect.”FaceApp has been taking social media by storm with many people, including stars, sharing images of themselves as they may look in decades.After Yu, whose surname was changed to Li, was found, investigator Zheng Zhenhai said: “We opened the case the day after the incident and we never gave up. Technology was limited at the time. We checked surveillance footage but there were simply too many people coming in and out of the area.”Forensic scientists in America have warned that Madeleine could now be “unrecognisable” from the last computer-generated image released of her as a girl of nine in May .They suggest that pictures of missing kids should be produced every two years as their appearance can change drastically particularly through adolescence.The McCann pal said: “If and when the politan Police advise Kate and Gerry that new images of Madeleine as a mid teenager could aid their investigation they will strongly consider going through the process again. But they have been hesitant because the procedure is y, costly and emotionally draining.“They’ve been reminded by experts in the US that new pictures really should be drawn up. If she’s out there, and her family hope and pray she is, there’s a chance she could have changed so much from the last image put out seven years ago.“Maybe the type of technology used to find the Chinese boy could be used in her case.”State-of-the-art age advancement digital techniques, used by the FBI, mimic features of child and teen photos of a missing youngster’s parents to establish how they may now look in computer generated images.Maddie is remembered around the globe as an angel-faced fair-haired toddler wearing a scarlet dress in an iconic snap of her.It was a favourite image first released to the media by her frantic parents when she vanished from the family’s Algarve apartment while they were dining nearby with friends.They also shared the last ever known photo of their daughter - who was days away form her fourth birthday - clutching tennis balls during a lesson on court on her doomed holiday and grinning beneath the brim of her favourite coloured bright pink sunhat.Family spokesperson Clarence Mitchell said: “Those two pictures of Madeleine are etched on everyone’s minds. Some people are still searching for that cute little girl dressed in red or with her arms wrapped around tennis balls. At times whenever there are potential sightings they are conjured up of a young Madeleine. It’s astime’s stood still.”He added: “Twelve years is a long time when a child goes from being a toddler to a mid teenager and her features could have changed.The only real tell tale sign is the distinctive blemish in her right eye. Kate and Gerry will heed the advise of the police, who they remain extremely grateful to, and will consider new imagesneeded.“No one ever thought she would be missing for so long.Heart doctor Gerry and GP turned medical worker Kate, both , of Rothley, Leics, said four years ago: “We will consider updating pictures of Madeleine in another year or two,she is still missing.”Two years after Maddie vanished US TV show queen Oprah Winfrey produced an artists impression of how the missing girl may look in then and now digitally enhanced images.Shocked mum Kate sobbed as saw first-hand the haunting image of her daughter, created by the National Centre for Missing and Exploited Children in Virginia, saying: “I don’t know who that little girl is.Forensic artist Teri Blythe drew up the last and most recent image of Maddie which was unveiled by Scotland Yard.The Sun Online revealed this week that Maddie’s parents are asking holidaymakers in the UK to take posters and luggage tags of their daughter abroad to put up in public.To try and keep Madeleines disappearance in the global spotlight during the summer holidays there are printed pictures to choose from in  dferent languages.Last month the Home Office agreed to grant Scotland Yard another £, to keep their investigation into Madeleines disappearance going until next March.The eight-year investigation, codenamed Operation Grange, has so far cost £.million. But cops have yet to unearth any signicant clues. Not one piece of forensic evidence linked to the youngster has been found.A Scotland Yard spokesperson declined to discuss the possibility of new age progression images, saying: “We cannot give a running commentary on this active investigation.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We have a good idea who it will be. But either way, we know their first priority will be looking after their rich friends and wealthy supporters. For the past four weeks the two contenders have been conducting an increasingly absurd debate about who will give another £ billion-plus tax break to the richest in society. They’re talking about a dferent country to the one I live in. Nine years of Tory and Lib Dem governments have left us one of the most ided in Europe. A short walk around almost any town or city should make that clear. Homeless people sleeping rough, begging for change to pay for their next meal, while the wealthiest drive by in expensive cars. Teachers stressed out, desperately trying to keep their school going without sufficient funds. Young people either unable to leave the parental home or paying exorbitant rents in the private rented sector, unable to save, feeling trapped. Parents worrying about their children’s future, while graduates start their working lives with debts of £,. The closed libraries, swimming pools and youth centres all tell their own story. This is the toxic legacy of Theresa May.  Under pressure, the Tory leadership candidates have acknowledged that schools, hospitals, social care and the police don’t have enough money – asthe last nine years in government had nothing to do with them. So the first test for the next Prime Minister must be to do what Theresa May promised, but failed to deliver: end austerity. But on the campaign trail the candidates have been more interested in trying to prove their virility by threatening a No Deal exit from the EU. That is reckless. No Deal would trash our industries – from car manufacturing to farming. It would raise food prices and cause medicine shortages in the NHS.  The reality is they want a sweetheart deal with Donald Trump as the basis of for our future trade. But the US administration’s priority is well known to all: it’s America First. When Theresa May invited Trump to dine with the Queen, he named his price: the opening up of our NHS for takeover by American corporations. So the second test for whoever becomes the next Prime Minister is: do they have the confidence to put No Deal, or any damaging Tory deal, to a public vote  The third test is whether they’re prepared to take the necessary action to tackle the climate emergency.  I know what Labour will do: we will kick start a Green Industrial Revolution to deliver new jobs in green industries that will help us halt the slide into climate breakdown. At the current rate of progress, this government’s pledge to get to net zero carbon emissions won’t be met until  – more than fty years too late. We cannot wait that long. The science is clear and indisputable – we need to reduce our emissions now and fast. Air pollution is right now killing , people a year in the UK. At a time of climate crisis, investment in renewables is actually falling. The Tories scrapped the solar feed-in tarf, virtually banned onshore wind, and they failed to invest in the Swansea tidal lagoon. Instead they back fracking – you really couldn’t make it up.

Robin, , who did not want to reveal his identity, said the stereotype of aposFlat Earthersapos being reclusive conspiracy theorists is a misconception.He wants to trigger a mass awakening but said he has concerns that being linked to the Flat Earth theory will cause problems for himself, his family and business. I worry very much that something might happen to me, he said.Robin, a grandfather, told Bristol Live he blames deep programming for brainwashing society into believing in a globe and ridiculing Flat Earthers.He runs a group of around  Flat Earthers in Bristol.    Flat Earthers have become more prevalent over recent years, thanks in part to a YouTube community. Conferences in America have been known to attract hundreds of people. He said: I first came across the subject when my daughter came home from work one day in . Someone at work had told her the Earth was flat. I chuckled and said, aposDonapost be silly. What about the photos of Earth from space apos My daughter shrugged and told me, aposIaposm just telling you what they saidapos. But Robin couldnapost rid himself of the idea, and began watching YouTube videos on the subject. I watched half a dozen videos, and the things I thought would stand up in my own mind soon fell apart, he said. It took me two weeks to get past my programming. It was pretty devastating. You realise you have been lied to. Robinaposs ultimate goal is to change the education system. At the moment, the shape of the planet is taught in a partisan way, which is a breach of the Education Act, he said. They should teach dferent theories with balance. Robin has images of what he believes is the Earthaposs wonderfully designed system - a flat surface under a dome which also contains a local sun and a local moon. According to his theory, the sun is not millions of miles away but just a few thousand, and a much smaller size than Earth.  He says this is supported by light appearing to be local when it shines through clouds.    He believes day and night are explained by the sun moving over dferent points of the Earth and leaving others dark - the sun moves but the Earth does not - and described gravity as a magical, mythical force while things fall simply because of buoyancy and density. Other theories include that NASA uses CGI and Photoshop to copy and paste clouds onto pictures of Earth from space, and footage of astronauts walking in space really shows them moving through water. He believes there are huge amounts of natural resources like gas, oil and uranium hidden in land beyond the perimeter of Antartica. Banking families or the powerbrokers control governments to perpetuate the myth of a globe, so they can access the resources without accountability.   I worry very much that something might happen to me, he said. But I have made myself visible in the community. If I suddenly vanished, it would be a bit obvious. Robin is careful about who he discusses the subject with.  I have a successful business, he said. I donapost want clients knowing about it. They might think aposhis headaposs in the cloudsapos.  I maybe test them to see how receptive they are with a slightly dferent subject like G or chemtrails.  However, he can often be found handing out Flat Earth leaflets and putting up banners in Broadmead.  He said: It is common for people to laugh. That is a programmed response. Iaposm not a bad salesman, but itaposs not always possible to persuade people. The programming is deep. He claims to have converted dozens of people through his activism, and his group of Flat Earthers meets each month at the Punchbowl pub in Old Market Street. Robin said: We get lots of dferent people. We had a young Cardf University student a couple of weeks ago. Some very intelligent people are into this.

Mum Rachel Carrieaposs kill list in the past year includes four deer,  ducks, about  pheasants and partridges and more than  wood pigeons. The -year-old, from Yorkshire, said she rarely makes trips to the meat counter because her family eats only what they hunt - her teenage son has been eating her kills since he was four. The game hunter - who has shot for Britain in the Commonwealth Games - said she is an animal lover, and claims vegetarians and vegans should see her as an ally.  The Daily Mirror has called for an end to the barbaric practice of trophy hunting in a campaign backed by politicians, celebrities and activists. It has also called for an end to canned hunting – confining wild animals on small reserves just so they can be shot dead for a price. But Rachel told The Sunday Times: “Vegetarians and vegans, shooters and hunters need to be educated. We are not the enemy. We have common ground.” She claimed vegetarians may unwittingly cause the displacement or killing of wildle, asking how much land occupied by wild game has been converted to grow crops, and how many animals have been killed by farmers protecting their fields.    The professional shooter said she was vegetarian between the ages of seven and  after discovering the realities of factory farming, and she held many of the same objections to meat. Rachel, now an environmental impact assessor, became conflicted when her father took her out to hunt rabbits with a Harris’s hawk. She was happy to eat an animal after seeing where it had lived in the wild.  Her view was also shaped by going out deer stalking, saying: You place a clean shot straight through the heart and that animal never knew you were there. It didn’t suffer, it wasn’t scared. It didn’t get transported miles and miles to an abattoir.” Hunting is the most ethical option, she argued, and it allows her to eat meat without the guilt.  She will present her argument in a debate at The Game Fair, the UKaposs biggest gathering of hunters and shooters, next Sunday in Hatfield House, Hertfordshire. Rachel said she hunts game with the consent of farmers and other landowners. Her Instagram page is filled with photos of her carrying a shotgun on hunts, plucking feathers from dead birds in her kitchen, and butchering her kills.  One photo shows her holding a deeraposs heart in her blood-covered hand after cutting the organ out of the animal. She wrote in the caption: I feel itaposs important to show this - people often ask aposwhat do you feel immediately after you pull the triggerapos remorse  Joy  Thrill  For me none of those - I feel concern, obligation and responsibility. Iaposm concerned until I can be absolutely certain the shot placement is good, the end quick, clean and the animal has not suffered and itaposs my obligation and responsibility to this animal to immediately follow up a shot.

The Duchess of Sussex has been watching the game being played from the windows of Frogmore Cottage , and even made a visit to the Royal Household Bowling Club next door to her home to speak to players.According to The Sunday Express, one observer said Meghan stopped to talk to two female players and told them she had been watching from her upstairs window. One source said: Meghan remarked to the two players how elegant the game looked.  Meghan is far from the only royal admirer of the game. Six years ago, the Queen was a surprise spectator when the royal club played the Brimfield and Little Hereford Bowling Club. She told players she had been watching The Ashes on television but decided she needed some air and had spotted the game from her Land Rover. She spent half an hour watching and posed for photographs with players, with one spectator saying she gave a fist pump when informed Englandaposs cricketers had won the game. At the time, Brimfield player David Evans said: It was a total surprise to the team. She told us she had taken some fresh air and askedit was OK for her to watch the game. She watched us play for around  minutes in all, there was quite a lot of pressure on us to perform in front of her. It is an amazing coincidence she turned up, I heard she has only been to the bowls green around four times in the last  years. Princess Diana was also a fan of bowls, and was photographed several times playing the game, including on a tour of Indonesia in . She also opened indoor bowl centres in Charnwood and Luton. Tony Allcock, , chief executive of Bowls England, said his organisationaposs , members will be very excitedMeghan takes up the game. Itaposs fair to say that predominantly our members are of an older level, who find the game a wonderful way to keep fit and active and a way to keep being involved in local communities. But we do encourage all ages, and we are finding that those in their s and s are attracted to the sport, which has no barriers and now has a relaxed dress code - shorts are encouraged in the summer.

Helen Dixon, , from Leeds, was diagnosed with terminal cervical cancer in , seven months after she says medics misdiagnosed her symptoms as a miscarriage .With two older daughters, Helen was desperate to have a son with husband Paul. Although she was told by doctors she had just months to live and would miscarryshe attempted to get pregnant again, Helen decided to stick two fingers up to that.    Last year, cleaner Helen was given the amazing news that her cancer was no longer growing, and the couple were searching for a surrogate mother when Helen woke up one morning and said she just knew she was pregnant.  In a bizarre twist of fate, the scar tissue from her cancer made her cervix stronger and helped support the pregnancy. The happy couple have now welcomed perfect baby son Harvey George, who was allowed home this week after being born early via an emergency caesarean section, weighing just lb oz. Helen said: It was really strange. One day I woke up and I said aposI feel really pregnantapos. I was scared, excited and nervous at the same time. I was rushed for an emergency scan and found out I was three and a half weeks gone. The doctors were shocked because theyaposd told me it couldnapost happen. They called him a little miracle. They didnapost even expect me to last this long. In , they gave me months. I was really nervous until I reached  weeks. The doctors saidI reached  weeks, they would be happy because of the success rates. I was hoping for a boy. Iaposve got two girls and the thought of raising him and watching him grow has given us something to look forward to. Especially because of what my girls missed out on when I was ill. Heaposs made the family complete.  We were determined to have another child, thataposs why we were looking for a surrogate. I wanted to give Paul a son because he didnapost have any of his own. In , Helen was told her symptoms were just her body recovering from a miscarriage, but a smear test revealed she had cancer. She was given months to live. She has been told her cancer canapost currently be detected by doctors, but it will eventually come back. However, the new mum has insisted she feels perfect. Landscape gardener and new dad Paul said Helenaposs positivity is keeping the cancer at bay. The proud husband said: Harvey really is our little miracle baby, there have been ups and downs but heaposs gorgeous and really well behaved. Itaposs so much to get our heads around. Weaposd begun looking for a surrogate and were going through interviews, then the next thing we know Helen was pregnant. The doctors were just as shocked as we were. The cancer did us a favour in a way. Helenaposs cervix doesnapost work but the cancer was acting as a cervix, itaposs bizarre. There was lots of scar tissue from the cancer that which kept the pregnancy going by making her cervix stronger. He added: Weaposre just enjoying le, but we know the cancer will come back.

Phillip Herron, , was trying to feed and clothe his family while out of work, falling behind with rent and trying to repay £, debts — including payday loans of over , per cent interest. He applied for government help but the month-long wait for Universal Credit drove him deeper into debt. “That was the final nail in his coffin,” said his grieving mum Sheena Derbyshire, . Phillip’s final act as he sat in his car on a quiet country lane on March  was to upload a picture of himself crying to social media. Minutes later he was dead. Have you got a story about struggling with Universal Credit  Email webnews@mirror  “In his suicide note he said his family would be better offhe wasn’t there any more,” Sheena added. “He was a single dad. He was responsible. He always had money before and the kids had the best of everything. “But Phillip had quit his job as a factory worker recently to look after his young kids and he got in to debt, which must have been dficult for him. “To suddenly have no money for them must have been very hard. He was waiting for Universal Credit and had just £. when he died. “When people turn to the Government for help they’re already desperate. To make them wait so long for payments is dangerous. “There’s no reason it should take so long. Phillip already had problems but I think this was the final straw.” Universal Credit – brought in by the Coalition Government  and rolled out nationwide since – was meant to replace a series of benefits with just one. But it is paid monthly in arrears, meaning an average wait of five weeks for the first payment. Labour claims the delay drives families into debt, poverty and eviction and aims to reform it.  Like many people, Phillip Herron was deeply in debt when, without telling his family, he applied for Universal Credit. “His death came as a complete shock,” Sheena said. “I couldn’t understand why he’d do this.” It was only later that Sheena pieced together what had happened. Papers in his home showed he owed around £, to banks, utility firms and payday lenders with, Sheena said, “, per cent interest rates”. She also found an eviction notice sent to him by the Bernicia Homes housing association. And she discovered from his children that things got so bad at Christmas “Santa had not come”. But worse was to come when, after weeks of trying, she worked out the code to unlock his phone. Mum-of-six Sheena trawled through emails and listened to months of calls he had recorded. “I was trying to knit his le together,” she said. “You could hear him changing so much over those final months. “He used to be very quietly spoken but in his recent calls and messages he was often screaming. “He loved his kids but he started shouting at them. And you can hear him sobbing in calls. I heard him talking about suicide to other people. “I wish he’d told us how he was feeling but we never knew. “Listening to those last few months of calls I started asking myself, ‘Who is this person ’ He’d changed so much so very quickly. “If we didn’t have his phone and his computer we wouldn’t have known what had been going on for him. It was like walking back­wards through his le. It’s the most heart-wrenching thing I’ve ever done.” Sheena has been haunted by guilt since Phillip’s death. “I’ll never be OK,” she said. “There’s not a second in the day I don’t miss him. “Every morning I wake up and wish I didn’t have to face another day without him, but I keep going for the kids. “His youngest daughter is totally lost. She misses her dad so much. “She had a dream the other night that he came to her. She said, ‘I asked him not to leave again. But when I woke up he wasn’t there’. “They haven’t even been offered counselling,” Sheena added.  The system failed Phillip – now it’s failing his ex-partner and their ­children too.” Sheena hopes the evidence she found will be used at a full inquest into Phillip’s death, at Sacriston, Co Durham, and expose the failings of Universal Credit. She believes talking about his suicide and its impact on his family can help others too. Sheena said: “You don’t just go out one day and take your own le. There’s a build-up. “So please, please talk to someone. Don’t let another family go through this. If you can’t talk to family or friends, there are people like Samaritans.” Last night a Department for Work and Pensions spokesperson said: “Our thoughts are with Mr Herron’s family. “Suicide is a very complex issue, so it would be wrong to link it solely to someone’s benefit claim. “We are committed to safeguarding vulnerable claimants and keep guidance under constant review to provide the highest standard of protection.” A Bernicia spokesperson said when tenants face dficulties “our approach is to seek to work with them to help overcome these. “A small number of cases could ultimately end in residents losing their home but this is a long process and we see this as a last resort. “Help and support is available at every stage. We extend our deepest sympathies to Mr Herron’s family.” "},{"url":null,"title":"tense exchange between royal navy","story":"NewsTense radio exchange between Royal Navy and Iran before tanker was seizedThe recording obtained by a British maritime security firm features repeat warning from both sides, with the Navy telling Iran what they were about to do \"violated international law\"ShareCommentsByEd McConnell:,  JUL Updated:,  JUL Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news video tense-exchange-between-royal-navy-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true\"\"Get the biggest politics stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA newly-released recording has revealed the tense exchange between the Royal Navy and Iranian military in the run-up to the seizure of a British oil tanker. In the clip recorded during Fridayaposs incident an Iranian vessel can be heard repeatedly warning the British-flagged Stena Impero to change course, saying: If you obey you will be safe. HMS Montrose can then be heard telling the tanker: As you are conducting transit passage in a recognised international strait, under international law your passage must not be impaired, impeded, obstructed or hampered. It then informs Iran any attempt to board the Impero would be a violation of international law, during the three-minute clip obtained by maritime security firm Dryad Global. Speed boats would later surround the vessel and balaclava-clad Iranian troops abseil on to its deck, with footage of the dramatic scenes released by Iranaposs Fars news agency yesterday. It has since been reported the Impero may have been sent spoof coordinates by Russian spy technology.  The Iranian Revolutionary Guard seized the Impero in the Strait of Hormuz, the most important shipping route for the oil industry, claiming it was violating international maritime rules. HMS Montrose raced to assist the Impero but was too late. Foreign Secretary and Tory leadership hopeful Jeremy Hunt has rubbished Iranaposs claims the vessel was in the wrong, saying Iranaposs actions were a clear contravention of international law. Stena Bulk, which owns the tanker, said it had been in international waters at the time of the seizure. The Imperoaposs crew, who are Filipino, Russian, Latvian and Indian, were this morning said to be in good health in the port of Bander Abbas by an Iranian official. Mr Hunt says Iran views the seizure as a legitimate response to the Royal Marines helping capture an Iranian tanker off Gibraltar earlier this month. It was believed the Grace  was carrying oil to Syria in contravention of EU sanctions but Iran denied that and described the seizure as an act of piracy. But Fridayaposs action was yesterday formally reported by Britain to the United Nations as illegal interference. Mr Hunt wrote on Twitter: Just spoke to Iranian Foreign Affairs Minister Mohammad Javad Zar and expressed extreme disappointment that having assured me last Saturday that Iran wanted to deescalate situation they have behaved in the opposite way. Now it is thought the UK may begin stationing Marines on UK ships travelling through the Strait to discourage future confrontations. HMS Duncan has already been sent to join Montrose in the Gulf.    Defence Minister Tobias Ellwood this morning denied the UK had taken its eye off the ball and said the government was looking at a series of options. Asked during his appearance on Skyaposs Sophy Ridge on Sunday whether the UK had taken its eye off the ball, he replied: No, not at all. Mr Ellwood said the UK had vessels going through  nautical miles of waterway every day, adding: It is impossible simply to escort each inidual vessel. Askedsanctions were off the table, Mr Ellwood said: Cobra was taking place yesterday, so weaposre looking at the operational responsibilities from that but, yes, we are going to be looking at a series of options. Tensions between Iran and the US and UK have been simmering ever since Donald Trump pulled out of a nuclear deal struck in . The US has been tightening sanctions against the gulf state since April and blames Tehran for attacks on tankers over the past two months. Last week Trump said the US military had shot a drone out of the sky while last month footage emerged which purported to show Iranaposs Revolutionary Guard covertly removing an unexploded mine from the side of a recently attacked Japanese tanker in the Gulf of Oman. But after Trump withdrew from the deal the UK remained committed, however the capture of the Grace I on July  led to warnings of retaliation from Iranian cleric Mohammad Ali Mousavi Jazayeri.    Fridayaposs escalation has been condemned by numerous global players. The White House National Security Council described it as the second time in recent weeks the UK had been the target of Iranian violence, referring to a July  incident when HMS Montrose had to move between a BP-owned tanker it was shadowing and two Iranian boats. Iran denied any attempted seizure. Trump has said Iran is in big trouble now. A third tanker, the Liberian-flagged MV Mesdar, was also boarded by armed men on Friday and communication was lost with Glasgow-based owner Norbulk Shipping UK, however five hours later it had been left to continue on its voyage. The US has also deployed troops to Saudi Arabia in response to what the Pentagon called emergent credible threats in the regioin. Meanwhile France, Germany and the EU expressed concern and called for the Imperoaposs immediate release. While the Impero is British-flagged it is Swedish-owned and it is not thought any of the  crew members are British, however the presence of the flag is symbolic and politically and historically means the UK has responsibility for ensuring the vessel is safe. Itaposs feared a continuing escalation will cause issues for the oil industry — a third of the worldaposs oil is shipped through the relatively narrow Strait making it something of a bottle neck.

Where is safe to go and where should you avoid travelling to  What precautions should you take while travelling  Here we take a look at the UK Government’s travel advice for destinations across the globe. Australia  Terrorists are “likely” to try to carry out attacks in Australia, the Foreign and Commonwealth Officesays. The current national terrorism level is ‘probable’. The FCO says: “Over , British nationals visit Australia every year. Most visits are trouble-free. “Attacks could be indiscriminate, including in places visited by foreigners. “You should be vigilant and take sensible precautions.” There is a wider risk of tropical cyclones which occur, mainly in Queensland, Northern Territory and Western Australia between November and April. Australia is prone to seasonal natural disasters including tropical cyclones, flash flooding, dust storms and bush fires Bahamas  UK health authorities have classied the Bahamas as having a risk of Zika virus transmission. Cases of Chikungunya virus have been confirmed, with visitors advised to take steps to avoid being bitten by mosquitoes. The hurricane season in the Bahamas normally runs from June to November. There have been incidents of violent crime including robbery. The FCO says that although there’s no recent history of terrorism in the Bahamas, attacks can’t be ruled out. Almost , British nationals visited the Bahamas in . Belgium There are often demonstrations taking place in Brussels, particularly around transport hubs and the Schuman area. There can be isolated incidents and people are urged to remain vigilant. Terrorists are “very likely” to try to carry out attacks in Belgium. Attacks could happen anywhere, including on public transport and transport hubs and in other places visited by tourists.    The FCO says: “Security operations are likely to be carried out at short notice. “You should remain vigilant and follow the instructions of the Belgian authorities. “Police have asked the public not to comment on police operations on social media.” Cape Verde There is no recent history of terrorism in Cape Verde. However, while the risk of terrorism is low, attacks can’t be ruled out. UK health authorities have classied Cape Verde as having a moderate risk of Zika virus transmissions. There is also a low risk of malaria in the capital city, Praia. Dominican Republic Cases of chikungunya virus and dengue fever have been confirmed. Travellers should take steps to avoid being bitten by mosquitoes. The hurricane season normally runs from June to November. Visitors are urged to take extra care travelling between Haiti and the Dominica  Republic by road. There are have been armed robberies on roads close to the border with Haiti.

There have been armed robberies in the Dominican Republic on roads near the border with Haiti. Egypt British Airways has suspended flights to Cairo for a week over unspecied security concerns. A spokesperson said on Saturday: We constantly review our security arrangements at all our airports around the world, and have suspended flights to Cairo for seven days as a precaution to allow for further assessment. The safety and security of our customers and crew is always our priority, and we would never operate an aircraft unless it was safe to do so. Terrorists are “very likely” to try and carry out attacks in Egypt, the Foreign Office warns. Current FCO advice on travel to Egypt warns against all travel to certain parts of the country.  But Cairo is part of a safer region, where the FCO only suggests reviewing its advice before visiting. Current advice warns against all but essential travel by air to Sharm el-Sheikh. That advice followed the bombing of a Russian airline which was brought down in  shortly after leaving the Red Sea resort, killing  people. The FCO also advises against all travel to the Governorate of North Sinai, due to the signicant increase in criminal activity and continued terrorist attacks on police and security forces that have resulted in deaths The FCO advise against all but essential travel to the Governorate of South Sinai, with the exception of the area within the Sharm el Sheikh perimeter barrier, which includes the airport and the areas of Sharm el Maya, Hadaba, Naama Bay, Sharks Bay and Nabq. Tourists are also warned off the area west of the Nile Valley and Nile Delta regions, excluding the coastal areas between the Nile Delta and Marsa Matruh .  Travellers should be vigilant at all times and follow the advice of the Egyptian authorities and your travel company,you have one. The FCO says: “There have been threats to western nationals, institutions and businesses posted on websites and social media. “The main threat to foreigners is from extremists linked to Daesh-Sinai. There is a heightened threat of terrorist attacks targeting Coptic Christians from extremists linked to Daesh-Sinai in Egypt.” You should avoid crowded places and gatherings, including in or around religious sties and during religious festivals, such as the month of Ramadan and the Christmas period when terrorist groups have sometimes called for attacks. Take extra care over local holiday weekends, as some terrorist attacks have occurred during these times. Religious sites have been targeted by terrorist groups: • On November , , terrorists killed over  civilians at a North Sinai mosque during Friday prayers.• On April ,  a group of militants opened fire on a security checkpoint near Saint Catherine’s Monastery at Mount Sinai killing a police officer. Daesh has claimed responsibility for this attack.• On December , , a church next to the Orthodox Cathedral in Abbaseya, Cairo, was attacked by a Daesh-linked suicide bomber killing  people. Other attacks have included: • On October , , several policemen and militants were killed during a shoot-out following a raid on a terrorist group in Bahariya Oasis in Egypt’s Western Desert, according to Egyptian authorities. • On October , , a flight from Sharm el Sheikh to St Petersburg crashed in North Sinai resulting in the deaths of  people, most tourists. Egyptian and Russian authorities are conducting an investigation. The investigation hasn’t yet formally concluded, but on November ,  Russian authorities stated that the crash was caused by an explosive device on board the flight. • On December ,  there was an IED attack targeting a checkpoint on Pyramid Road in Giza, killing at least six police officers. Harakat Hasm, a violent terrorist group, claimed responsibility. France  The FCO says terrorists are “very likely” to carry out attacks in France. Due to ongoing threats to France by Islamist terrorist groups and recent French military intervention against Isis, the French Government has warned the public to be especially vigilant and has reinforced its security measures. Protests linked to the yellow vestmovement continue across France, generally taking place on Saturdays. A number of previous demonstrations have led to violence and extensive damage to property in Paris and in other cities across the country. There remains some migrants around Calais, who may seek to enter the UK illegally.

on the night and - on aggregate.Dons boss McInnes hailed the composure and calmness of his teenage midfielders Campbell, , and Lewis Ferguson, . And Aberdonian Campbell was thrilled to mark his first start in Europe with a win.He said: “It is a dream come true to play in a European competition and to play my part in a win in my first start which takes us through to the next round is fantastic.“I really appreciate the gaffer’s trust in me by putting me into a game like that.“It’s down to me after that to prove why he shows the faith in me and as long as he keeps doing that I have to keep working hard and do as best as I can when I get the opportunity.”Campbell was given the chance to play due to Craig Bryson missing the first round with an ankle injury.With Bryson due to resume training on Sunday and new signing Funso Ojo also joining the squad for next week’s second qualying round tie at Chikhura Sachkhere of Georgia, Campbell faces a fight to keep his place in the side. But he will use team-mate Ferguson’s success in holding down a regular place in the team as inspiration.]He said: “I’m comfortable in this team and feel I can cope with first-team games and European games. I just have to keep working as hard as I can and the manager will keep his faith in me.“Fergie had a terric season last year and will only kick on. He’s a fantastic young player and I enjoy playing alongside him so hopefully this is a partnership which we can develop.”Campbell, a product of the club’s youth system, has grown up watching the first team try to reach the group stages of the competition. This campaign, the sixth in a row under manager Derek McInnes, represents as good an opportunity as any.The importance for the club and the team in making it to the group stages has not been lost on the teenager.Huge clubs such as Premier League Arsenal and Manchester United as well as Italian side Roma lie in wait.The Aberdonian, a lelong Dons fan, is living his dream in being involved in European competition with his home city side.He said: “It’s always been an ambition, even as a little kid, to play in a European competition.“To get my first start is brilliant.I’ve watched the Real Sociedad games, the Groningen games as a fan so to be part of it is great.“All Aberdeen fans know of the glory days against Real Madrid and Bayern Munich but times have changed due to the money in the game now.“We’ve just got to do all we can to get to the group stages and that starts with the next round in Georgia.“It would be absolutely brilliant to get there.“That’s our aim every time we go into this competition and to get through would be fantastic for the players and financially for the club. It’s huge. I want to test myself against the best competition that is out there.“European competition is the cream at the top of the game.”The last time Aberdeen played in the group stages was during Jimmy Calderwood’s reign. The Dons reached the last  of the Uefa Cup in  before being eliminated - on aggregate by German giants Bayern Munich.Campbell was still at primary school during that run but the memories remain vivid today.He said: “I was a season ticket in the South Stand. I used to sit next to the away fans and I loved it. I was at the Bayern game in  and I remember that one and the Copenhagen game.“I would have been seven years old watching games like that so it’s great to be here  years later.“Hopefully I can kick on.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/07/2.36711087-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/07/2.36711087-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/07/2.36711087-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/07/2.36711087-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"mcinnes started homework early","story":"Aberdeen boss Derek McInnes began preparation for the Europa League clash with FC Chikhura Sachkere on the flight back to Scotland after defeating RoPS Rovaniemi in Finland.McInnes studied scouting reports of the Georgians’ two games against CS Fola Esch of Luxembourg in the previous round on the flight which touched down early yesterday morning.He will also study extensive footage of Sachkere who the Dons face at the Boris Paichadze Dinamo Arena, Tbilisi, on Thursday .McInnes said: “We had match reports to read on the Georgians on the plane on the way home and will start to get a grip on them over the next few days.“We had our scouts out for both their games against Fola Esch.

It reframes the story of Scotch whisky and suggests new layers of complexity in Scotland’s urban history.” vw, px\"  Dr Hawes said: “All references to aquavite or whisky from this period are signicant because its early development is largely unrecorded.“This could signicantly change our understanding of the origins of our national drink.”City archivist Phil Astley added: “This incredible find illustrates what an amazing resource the UNESCO-recognised Aberdeen Burgh Registers are for the study of Scottish urban history.“The detailed picture of late-medieval society that emerges from these records is one of a developing social structure increasingly influenced by the cultural, scientic and educational forces of the Renaissance period.”Researchers have now been awarded £, by Chivas Brothers to fund research into the still.Head of heritage and education Alex Robertson said: “This is a truly signicant and exciting discovery for Scotch whisky.“Given Chivas Brothers’ historical ties with Aberdeen, we did not hesitate to lend our support to the furtherance of this important research.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/07/2.36711087-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/07/2.36711087-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/07/2.36711087-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/07/2.36711087-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"student ready to take on great aberdeen run","story":"Student Lisa Hollstein is completing an internship at Aberdeen University and will be taking part in the k before heading home to Germany where she studies nutritional science in Potsdam.“I arrived last November and was only supposed to stay until the end of February,” said Lisa, .“But I really like my le in Aberdeen and decided to stay until the end of August.”Lisa – who works in a city pub when she’s not writing her thesis – has found time to go out running with Aberdeen’s Hash House Harriers.“I’m someone who can’t stay at home doing nothing, and I’ve really enjoyed my runs with them – I’ve done more than  now and I’ve rarely met people who are so open-hearted and kind.”Lisa took part in a recent k run at Aberdeen beach, organised byAberdeen running club.“It took me  minutes – I just hope I can repeat this at the Great Aberdeen Run!”"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column june 7 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsIt is disappointing that Michael Matheson was unable to attend his second A task force meeting in a row.

These should ensure everyone receives #joined up# care, that they are asked how they are feeling as part of every diabetes appointment and that a mental health professional with knowledge of diabetes is part of every diabetes care team.To sign our petition, go to diabetes.org.uk missingAngela Mitchell, National Director of Diabetes Scotland.Sir,I#m asking residents in the Highlands and Islands to give their views on Conservative proposals for tackling serious crime.In order to provide Scotland with an alternative to Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP in , we are keen to gain feedback from as many people to our policy proposals to make them as relevant as possible to the needs and aspirations of everyone in Scotland.Too many people in Scotland are affected by the behaviour of serious criminals. This needs to be properly addressed and my colleague Liam Kerr MSP, shadow Justice Secretary, has outlined key policy proposals in a member#s bill in the Scottish Parliament to tackle this scourge.It would give Scottish judges the power to impose whole le sentences to those convicted of the most serious violent and sexual crimes including the murder of a police officer.The courts would still have discretion to impose the appropriate sentence based on all the facts of each case, as they do in England and Wales where such a provision already exists.The proposed Whole Le CustodyBill will not mean the perpetrators of a particular crime will always receive a whole le sentence, but rather that the courts will have the power to impose one where there is sufficient justication.We have started the consultation and experts and members of the public are invited to register their views.Email me at donald.cameron.msp@parliament.scot or write to me at Donald Cameron MSP,  George Street, Oban, PA NT, with your views.MSP Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands.Sir,The SNP has warned Scotland’s NHS is under threat from a Tory-Trump trade deal that could leave the Scottish Government without a veto over a post-Brexit deal that sells Scotland out.This stark warning follows the revelations from Donald Trump that in terms of trade deals, everything, including the NHS, would be on the table.At Prime Ministers Questions, SNP Deputy Westminster Leader Kirsty Blackman MP said Donald Trump and the Tories could not be trusted on the NHS and criticised the UK government for plotting to take powers away from the Scottish Parliament that would allow it to safeguard Scotland’s NHS.The threats to Scotland#s NHS are growing under the prospect of a hard-right Tory-Trump Brexit trade deal. Those threats could undermine the integrity and independence of our Scottish NHS.The UK Tories will block any potential veto by the Scottish Government over such a damaging deal.The SNP government will fight to the end to defend Scotland#s public services from this unprecedented Tory Brexit danger. Our NHS must remain in public hands. It is not, and should never be, up for sale.Scotland has been completely ignored throughout the Brexit process and Tory plans to grab powers from the Scottish Parliament will leave us even more exposed.It is clearer than ever that the only way to properly protect Scotland#s interests, and keep our NHS in public hands, is with the full powers of independence.MP Brendan O#Hara, Argyll and Bute."},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures week 25","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowFiona McCuish of Ardrishaig captured the VIC puffer wending its way up the Crinan Canal.Fiona used her camera phone as the vessel passed through West Bank, Ardrishaig."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column june 28 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWhat is it with recruiting #professionals# to Argyll We seem to be a distinctly unattractive prospect, as witnessed by the problems with recruiting a dentist in Lochgilphead.What people fail to appreciate is that they stand to gain so much more than they would lose by coming to Argyll.The scenery is unrivalled the pace of le is civilised we are not that far from the central belt and a sense of community remains.Just turn to our front page story for proof.Disappointment at losing out on council grant funding has turned into joy in Tarbert.But only because the people of the village have such big hearts, as they have demonstrated in the past.The council may argue that this vindicates its decision to refuse funding.

Peter O#Neil was up to the task and would take the overall, with Penrice a deserved second and  Damian Carter would third.The four stroke class was enthralling, with Sam Sibbald thundering around the Kilmartin track, big Andy Malloch and his Armstrong chasing him all the way to the flag and winning the final race but not the overall. Sam would be the victor followed by Andy and a consistent Keith Stanford third.For the youth class it was a day of mixed fortunes and consistency would be the key, with Jordan Graham coming out on top ahead of James Forrest and picking up a superb third overall was Rhys Brown.Pre- action would see committee man and track builder Grant McClure and his Maico, with three decades of riding under his belt, become the overall winner ahead of Callum Wilson on the superbly prepared Honda.The Twinshock under cc event would be a three race win for the flying Calum Kilgour and his cc Yamaha ahead of Jim Grieve, who would have some bike issues but would bring home his Honda in second fighting off a very persistent David Lawson and Gordon Peterson but it would be Gordon that would hold the third place trophy with some consistent riding.The Twinshock open class event would be a spectacular sight as cc Hondas and Maicos battled their way around the bracken.In race one there was a very small gap between first and second place and a similarly small gap between third. Brian Alexander would take the win from Craig ‘Smitch’ Smith, and John Crawford would come home in third with a notable mention to the very unlucky Paul Chiappa who had his fair share of misfortunes throughout the day, as his seat was torn from his bike at the top of one of the steep climbs. The overall would end up the same as the first race with Brian, taking the win from Craig Smith and John Crawford bringing the big Honda home in third.In the over s class it was a triumphant day for John Lamont with three resounding victories. Johnny Rutherford was second, a great result for the club sponsor, with David Watson bringing home the Honda with some consistent rides.For the group three races Robert Bell took the honours from Allan Shields and Bryan Colligan, all of these riders deserving a notable mention and with some very similar lap times and some quick racing in trying conditions.The clubman class was great to watch, with some fast up-and-coming riders such as Peter Rennie, Callum Laird and Stuart Wilson all angling for the win. Rennie would take the overall from Laird in second and  Wilson in third.The evolution class was again the Paul and Tom show. In what must have been the fastest racing all day, it would be Paul #PJ# Johnston who would take overall honours with three wins and Tom Grant would take the runner-up slot followed home ably by a consistent Roy Potts taking the third place.In the final block of racing it would be a win apiece for Jordan McDonald, Shaun Robertson, and John Kenny, but it would be the ever improving Shaun Robertson, ing from injury, who would take overall honours from a rapidly improving John Kenny in second and #Mr Consistent# Karl Livingstone in third.Results:Group Pre- class:  Grant McClure  Callum Wilson.

The beds are trimmed neatly with green paths of grass and only the odd weed or two can be seen to peer through the burgeoning beetroot and beans.Often yoursquoll also come across one of the volunteers, the gardener oryoursquore very lucky, one or more of the children who help to tend the plants.The Edible Garden is a community garden nestled in the beautul Tweed Valley at Innerleithen and run by a steering group and volunteers.Its aim is to inspire, motivate and build confidence in adults and children of all ages and abilities to learn how to grow their own food to promote a healthy lestyle, to encourage the community to prevent food waste, reuse recycle to reduce landfill and to reduce their carbon footprint.The St Ronanites are horticulturists turned eco warriors, providing a range of workshops for the community in how to grow, harvest and recycle.Lessons include guidance on composting, propagating, soil preparation, solar power for growing, food preservation, seasonal planting, and bugs pests in the garden, carbon footprint and food waste recycling.The vibrant goings-on have recently stepped up a gear with the efforts of the steering group of Shirley Spence, Lisa Kurowski Leslie and Alex Smithson to win a share of the Tweeddale Localities Bid funding.This has secured the future of the garden for years to come and means that the sht of responsibility from the climate change group lsquoYou Can Cookrsquo to the independent body known as lsquoThe Edible Gardenrsquo is now complete.Shirley Spence said the support of the public and the staff and children of St Ronanrsquos Primary School have been crucial to this success.ldquoIt will allow the steering group to provide a part-time gardener, Alex Smithson, serve the schoolrsquos Eco Group with practical experience of environmental issues and fund the supply of equipment, compost and building materials for the foreseeable future.However, for those of you who have yet to find the garden, perhaps it would be helpful to whet your appetite with some details of what the project has accomplished so far.Firstly, as well as offering expert gardening advice to the supporters, Alex plans and prepares the crops and liaises with school staff to provide classes for the children to teach them about their environment and carbon footprint.The classes look at areas from recycling and horticulture to microbes and ecology. This educational programme and the informal weekly gardening clubs allow both adults and children to experience a connection to nature in a supported environment and take home some of the produce theyrsquove grown too.Shirley explained: ldquoAll of the children at the school benefit from the fruit and vegetables grown in the enclosed garden but also from the orchard and the fruit bushes at the schools entrance. They can pick their own five-a day where the food hasnrsquot ever met a plastic tray or a supermarket checkout.The gardenrsquos outreach doesnrsquot stop at the food though. There are a number of initiatives that the group hope will compliment the ethos of environmental action.bull Innerleithen, Walkerburn and Traquair Rotary Club ndash The Rotary Club has sponsored The Edible Garden which has enabled them to get leaflets, brochures and posters to help promote their bid for the Localities Fund. They have agreed to continue to sponsor the Edible Garden to ensure that it thrives in the future.bull The Allotment ndash The Edible Garden, Innerleithen, will now be working with The Allotment, Innerleithen, who are sponsors.

The day after the crash, Superintendent Jim Guy of Strathclyde Police said there had been no evidence from the crew of any problems before the tragedy.He said the evidence available suggested an accident rather than terrorist attack. The scene of the crash was sealed off almost immediately and an air exclusion zone was imposed.Although most of the wreckage was left for accident investigators to examine, it is understood Royal Ulster Constabulary Special Branch officers removed boxes and cases containing secret papers on Friday morning.On Saturday,  personnel from RAF Machrihanish were drafted in to help find and catalogue debris from the crash.FIFTY YEARS AGOKintyre could be surfers# MeccaKintyre could become the major centre in Britain for surfingthe enthusiasm of two young men gets the encouragement it deserves.One of them, George Raynes, of Bishopbriggs in Lanarkshire, is secretary of the Scottish Surf Club, and with his treasurer, James Short of Glasgow, has just completed a preliminary survey of several of the Kintyre beaches with a view to exploiting them for the sport of surfing.George has surfed on beaches all over Britain and also in the Channel Isles and in Europe and he thinks that the beaches at Machrihanish and Southend could become the Mecca for British surfers and the venue for the British Championships.He was particularly impressed with the waves at Machrihanish but thinks Southend has great potential as well.He told the Courier: #The possibilities here are tremendous. These beaches are essentially accessible from the central belt of Scotland, in fact from all over Britain when one considers the air service, and the weather records show that there is plenty of sunshine and the water is warm compared to the waters off the east coast of England, for example.#In fact, I#ve been told that Kintyre topped the sunshine league in Britain last year.#The water is so warm, comparatively speaking, that the sport could become an all-year-round activity in this area. In the winter one would have to wear a wetsuit, of course, but the conditions are ideal and the wave forms have great potential # after all, they are coming straight in from the Atlantic over the north of Ireland.#What I#d like to see is a surf club established in Campbeltown. It could become a great asset from a tourist and amenity point of view.#And any Kintyre people who really took up the sport would have a great advantage over other surfers when it comes to competition because they have the benefit of readily available beaches all year round.#If this club gets going, the chances are that the British surf champions in the years to come will be Kintyre people.#ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOOrr Ewing CupFootballers were favoured with beautul weather last Saturday and the games played on Kinloch Park in the Orr Ewing Cup competition brought together very large gatherings of spectators.The match in the afternoon was brought to a sudden termination by an unfortunate dispute over the award of a goal. The opposing teams were Kintyre and HMS Thames.Kintyre opened strongly and after  minutes# play had scored twice. The dispute arose over the award of the second goal, which Thames claimed to be offside.The referee, Mr Duncan McCallum, an old Hearts player, was of a dferent opinion, and on his allowing Kintyre the goal, the naval team without more do walked off the field.It is understood that the Thames team intimated to the league at the weekly meeting on Monday night their withdrawal from the competition.The teams were: Kintyre # Jas McKinlay: James Black and Archd Sharp: M Muir, A McCrank and T Cameron: R McGeachy and D Brown: Dan McNaughton: N Scally and J Donaldson.HMS Thames # Meese: Jesseman and Love: McCloud, Hirst and Fernie: Dunnell and Weekes: McGeachy: Slynn and Segrott.Referee # Mr D McCallum.In the evening, the opposing teams were Campbeltown and Kilbrannan. A week previously Kilbrannan had inflicted a - win over a naval team: against Campbeltown on Saturday they found the tables turned on themselves, and with the same score repeated they had to suffer the chagrin of a five-goal margin.It was hard game, but high scoring seldom adds to the vim or interest of any match and so it was here.Campbeltown from the kick-off may be fairly said to have had the measure of their opponents, but while they were the better , on play there was nothing like a - goal margin between the teams.Campbeltown owed their comfortable lead mainly to the masterly play of their centre forward, Archd O#May. This young footballer was home on furlough from the Rhine Army, and his display was undoubtedly the feature of the game. He is a fearless player with a rare turn of speed and a most deadly shot.At least three of six goals came from his foot, and were beautully taken, while he was the means of a fourth which he gave the right wing the honour of finishing.Kilbrannan#s solitary goal was well taken by Brown after a clever break through and an inidual run.Kilbrannan has material for the making of a team that should get much better results than they have so far achieved.The players are keen and inidually have a lot of football in them, but an almost entire absence of method both in attack and defence spoils their chances.The teams were: Campbeltown # A McCallum: G Quigley and Chas McKinven: D Kelly, J McDonald and John Martin: Chas Black and Arch Black: Arch O#May: W McKillop and James Martin.Kilbrannan # John McIntyre: D Bannatyne and Wm Gilchrist: J Short, N McKenzie and James Boyce: D Gilchrist and M Brodie: C Kelly: D Mathieson and J Brown.Referee # Mr W Mustarde."},{"url":null,"title":"letter open letter to dog owners","story":"While responsible dog owners take care to ensure their dogs are under control at all times, there are still a number who do not # and seem unaware of the potential consequences of their actions.There has been a disturbing rise in the number of sheep and other livestock attacks, and we are hoping to enlist your help in raising awareness of dog #worrying# which will, in turn, assist the authorities, farmers and land-users.If a dog worries livestock on any agricultural land the owner, or person in charge of the animal at the time, is guilty of a criminal offence.Section  of the DogsAct  defines #worrying# as:Such incidents cause distress to the animals and often lead to them being injured and or killed.

We are all engaging more online, but the conversations are getting shorter and colder.ldquoThese conversations would be more positive and productivewe could host them in a social context.ldquoWhatrsquos needed is a lsquoFaceFaceBookrsquo where the digital world is used to increase the physical interaction.They have suggested that a large screen cover the back of the building behind the stage that could act as a cinema screen, a digital backdrop to a theatre show and a space for presentations and gaming competitions.Although it is only in the very early stages of planning, the concept was well received by the community council, with member Ferhan Ashiq saying that he was ldquovery impressed with the bold and innovative idea.The community council has the option to either lease or buy the Town Hall from East Lothian Council, and this decision has not been officially made yet but will be the next step that is taken, discussing a business plan and the terms of the transfer with the local authority.The approach is laid out in the strategy, which states that the community council will ldquoreview the best practice from where and arrange research visits to similar facilities.

Then we use the success of the venue to fundraise for improvements and enhancements to the structure of the building to renovate the interior.Brian Weddell, chair of the community council, said: ldquoI was delighted that the feedback from community council members was  per cent positive.ldquoIt is an exciting and imaginative use of a grossly under-used community asset that could help kickstart the revitalisation of Prestonpans High Street.The Town Hall was identied as one of the six viable properties across the county suitable for a CAT, offering local organisations the chance to lease or buy them."},{"url":null,"title":"preview-3-harbours-festival","story":"Residents and visitors alike can enjoy art galleries, live music events, family afternoons with pebble decorating and ukulele orchestras, open houses, cooking demonstrations and workshops over the course of the festival, which runs from Saturday to next Sunday .The festival, which was started more than  years ago, is going from strength to strength, expanding and becoming more erse, with something for everyone in its programme.For the live music fans out there, there is a chance to see the Tom Fairnie Band play their famous Americana music supported by Paul Brown, then Andy Brown, Dropkick and Fuzzystar for the Indie lovers, Alex Hodgson and Rhys Heaven for the folk fans, and to get an eclectic mix all in one sitting, there are the Live on the Lawn sessions, an afternoon of music in the majestic Cockenzie House and Gardens .To keep the young ones and old ones entertained all at once, this year will see a Harbour Family Afternoon added to the programme.

History is the way we view and see things that happened in the past. That view is limited by a number of factors. The availability of surviving records and evidence is one.The vast majority of what happened in the past is inevitably lost to us. This is true even for our own personal memories. So history is the small tip of the iceberg of events and times gone by, brought to the surface by the survival of some accounts more than others.And these records are never unbiased. Often historical records and evidence are purposely partial, influenced by ideology and personal allegiances. But all are biased in some way, as the limited viewpoint and interests of those recording events is based on their experience or motives.As a result, we can only see historical events through a narrow keyhole, with most characters and goings on out of view. Itrsquos the common people who are most always invisible in history. Our own ideological preference and belief in what is important will then affect how we interpret the limited evidence we have.This is why history is often subject to furious debate, and rightly so. Irsquod say itrsquos almost impossible not to allow our own perspectives, interests and values to influence the way we interpret the broader meaning of historical events and their signicance for contemporary society.Such a debate is being had in East Lothian just now, as to the name of the new town to be built on the Blindwells site, between Prestonpans and Longniddry and just to the north of Gladsmuir and Tranent.The name can be romantically translated to mean lsquohidden springsrsquo and it was across this once-marshy ground that the Jacobites crept stealthily at night to mount a surprise attack on the Redcoats on September , . That famous battle lasted  minutes and was a victory for the Jacobites, and the launchpad of Bonnie Prince Charliersquos march into England.Consequently, the Scottish Battlefields Trust has submitted a petition, as reported in the Courier last week, to name the new community Charlestoun and build a statue of Charles.When I was at school, he seemed a dashing and heroic figure. The songs and stories about him are infectious and I totally understand how the stories told about him have created a romantic and thrilling image.But then I studied the topic in more depth, at both university and afterwards. The period has suffered from the romantic treatment but there are fascinating stories of loyalty and sacrice to a man who, in reality, saw the common people chiefly as cannon fodder for his personal and family ambitions.It is for this reason I feel there are enough name places and statues to aristocratic and powerful men whose main historical role was to make and wage war, evenhe has a famous and romantic reputation.This is not to say we shouldnrsquot remember the fascinating history of the area, including that fateful day of battle when the Jacobites crossed the land.But itrsquos how we commemorate it and who we include. What makes the Jacobite period truly fascinating is the tapestry of stories of the many people involved, on both sides. It was a brutal time, in which there was certainly deep loyalty on both sides, but there were many other reasons why people found themselves on one side or the other. It was a brutal civil war, brought on by the aspirations of the exiled Stuarts.Do we commemorate the memory of the man who caused that war or do we commemorate those who were caught up in it  Is it really the case thatwe do the former we do the latter  Irsquom not convinced.There are other stories to consider of course for the site. There was coal mining there for generations. The lives of mining families, men, women and children who toiled in horric conditions, still remains mostly unheralded by history. Maybe itrsquos not lsquoromanticrsquo enough. Likewise with farming, which was a constant economic activity in the area for generations.There was also another unusual underground activity on the site after the early mine closed. Smugglers made an illegal whisky still deep down in the mine shaft once it was disused. It took a while for the customs men to realise East Lothian had an illicit whisky-making enterprise deep below ground in the old mine workings. When they finally raided the mine, they found the still, but no sign of the makers of the whisky. It kind of gives new meaning to the name lsquohidden springsrsquo!It is suggested the children in schools should have the final say in the new name, which is a great idea. But let our children be introduced to all aspects of our local history and allow them to understand how the way history is taught influences what we believe is important in contemporary society as well, and that there is no lsquocorrectrsquo view on this.Irsquod love to be part of that discussion and debate."},{"url":null,"title":"woman-found-nearly-three-times-drink-driving-limit","story":"Jacqueline Johnstone, of St Germains Terrace, was caught drink-driving at Gilbert Avenue in North Berwick.Johnstone, , was found to have mg of alcohol in ml of breath during the incident ndash the legal limit is mg.She appeared at Edinburgh Sherf Court, where she pleaded guilty to the offence, which took place on May .Sherf Pamela Bowman banned Johnstone from driving for  months and fined her pound.She was allowed to take part in a drink-driving rehabilitation scheme which could reduce her ban by a quarter."},{"url":null,"title":"north-berwick-high-school-roll-set-top-1-000-extension-planned","story":"The school, which welcomes pupils from the surrounding villages as well as North Berwick, currently has a school roll of .However, that figure is expected to increase, with the town continuing to grow and the school set to become the fourth secondary school in the county with more than , pupils.Three extensions ndash in ,  and  ndash have already been carried out on the school to accommodate the growth of the town.Now, the proposed extension would cater for a school roll of up to ,.Plans submitted to East Lothian Council note: ldquoThe completed building will provide state-of-the-art teaching and social space facilities in line with the clientrsquos brief as well as promoting energy efficiency and offering facilities which signal the high value placed on learning at North Berwick High School.ldquoThe project is to reflect the standards commensurate with a modern school facility and provide a high-quality environment that will inspire both staff and young people to achieve their full potential.The proposed extension would occupy an area to the south-west of the existing buildings, bordered by the synthetic pitch and the site boundary with the schoolrsquos neighbours Law Primary School.The document states: ldquoThe location of the proposed extension will offer views out over the sports pitches and towards North Berwick Law.The ground floor of the three-storey extension will become home to the home economics department, with a shared social and exhibition space.Social sciences will be based on the first floor, with the languages department on the second floor and ldquolarge shared breakout spaces at the heart of the floorplan.The plans from Innovate East Lothian Ltd, which is acting on behalf of East Lothian Council, could go before the local authorityrsquos planning committee later this year.Currently, Dunbar Grammar School , Musselburgh Grammar Schooland Ross High Schoolin Tranent all have more than , pupils."},{"url":null,"title":"council-remove-recycling-wheelie-bins-contamination","story":"East Lothian Council is one of the few local authorities in Scotland to retain recycling boxes for most of its households and has a  per cent recycling rate ndash higher than the national average.However, Tom Reid, the councilrsquos head of infrastructure, revealed that it had rolled out , communal recycling bins in small communities and densely populated streets.But, he said, the result had been a much higher contamination level in the recycled waste which suggested thatbins were rolled out across the county it could cost the council up to poundmillion.

But gradually, as Ros wrote the words down, she became introduced to Agnes and Elizabeth.There were accounts of others too, but she was particularly taken with the account of these two women, the language used to describe them, and the cruel punishments they suffered.In the account, Agnesrsquos name is spelt in three dferent ways, but was likely Blake or Black.Here is the transcription Ros made:January Agnes Blaik Indweller in Haddington born in the parish of Boulton and Elizabeth Golight, daughter to William Golight, born in this parish being both accused and imprisoned as guilty of lewdness and uncleanliness with many dferent persons. Elizabeth Golight confesses that since Michaelmas last she has been guilty of uncleanliness with several persons and Agnes Blaikie confesses she was formerly convict of uncleanliness and that she was a bad woman ndash But not of late. But acknowledges she lives in a house alone and that there has been dragoons with her in the house. Which being considered by the Magistrates they find Elizabeth Golight is a vicious strumpet and to their certain information Agnes Blaik is a vicious lewd woman. And therefore they ordain both the said Elizabeth Golight and Agnes Blaik be taken to the cross Friday next with the officers and Hangman and there to stand sometime with a paper or sack of theirhellip donating their crime and thereafter be conveyed tohellip with beat of the drum and to be banished forever out of the borough with certicationever they or either one of themto or be seen in this burgh they shall be whipped by the hangman.Signed Andrew Dixon, George Cunningham, Bailies.But it seems the harsh punishment did not prevent them from ing to the town, for Ros came across another two entries:th May Appeared with Janet Golight her mother Elizabeth for repeating acts of lewdness and stealing from Robina Mucklersquos shop. Both found guilty and sent to the House of Correction in Edinburgh to be kept at hard work for  years. Should be whipped by the hangman and burnt on the cheek.th June Agnes Black ed to buy a gown for herself and so was sentenced to be whipped through the town and banished.Ros later sent me her transcriptions, saying: ldquoI love the way Agnes confessed she lsquowas a bad woman ndash but not of latersquo. It rings out over the centuries. And I have a definite dislike for the bailies pronouncing on the lsquovicious strumpetrsquo and the lsquovicious lewd womanrsquo, particularly as there is no mention of any man being named, despite the men being lsquoto their certain informationrsquo!Ros had emailed me the transcription in January  and wrote to me: ldquoI thought it was a tale worth telling and you could weave your magic on it and perhaps find a happy ending.To my regret, I only came across this email last week, as it had somehow remained unopened in my inbox for over two years. I admit to being technically useless on computer matters!But a happy ending  Itrsquos clear both Agnes and Elizabeth had very harsh lives, and on the surface there seems little scope for a truly happy ending.The description of them is misogynistic and full of double standards, as Ros pointed out.So what were these women really like  The writer tries to paint a picture of awful human beings, but the image of poor Agnes secretly creeping back into town, no doubt in a state of desperation, to ldquobuy herself a gown and then being whipped as a punishment gives a dferent story. The punishments for both women are barbaric and utterly unjust.Then I realised that there was a happy ending. That happy ending was in late , when Ros walked into the John Gray Centre and found out about Agnes and Elizabeth. She read the account with human understanding and saw through the prejudice to glimpse at the women themselves and understand just how wrongly they had been treated and judged. And so she spoke up for them and gave them a place in history, while turning the judgment on their accusers.Thatrsquos a happy ending I know Ros would have liked."},{"url":null,"title":"east-lothian-surfer-features-new-advert-carling","story":"The five surfers ndash aged between  and  ndash took on the waves for a national advertising campaign for the beer giant called lsquoMade Localrsquo.Retired roofer Ian McKay, from Whitekirk, was joined by Jason Burnett, Douglas Brown and Dee Ripol, all from Edinburgh, with filming taking place over two days nearly two years ago.

The current law around surrogacy is outdated and doesnrsquot reflect modern medical advances or changes in social attitudes. Surrogacy is a particularly sensitive and emotionally demanding process for everyone involved so we welcome anything which simplies or modernises the legislation. A draft report is anticipated, followed by draft legislation by  but their proposals offer a clear indication about the recommended direction of travel, she says.Parental ordersCurrently, the surrogate, and her spouse ndash she has one ndash are the legal parents of the child at birth and their names are noted on the birth certicate. The intended parents must make an application to the court for a parental order to be recognised as the childrsquos parents, with the legal rights and responsibilities this entails. This can take around six months to process which she points out can pose several potential problems. The first is that while the intended parents are socially and psychologically the parents, that doesnrsquot match the legal position, which can cause identity problems. On the flip side, the surrogate doesnrsquot normally view herself as the childrsquos mother, but the law does. Secondly,the child needs medical care during the first six months of their le the intended parents will likely not have any legal standing to take medical decisions about the young child in their care, which is not on any view a good situation for the child.ldquoAt the moment there is a considerable gap between peoplersquos expectations and the law and signicant potential for misunderstandings. This is not a positive environment in which to welcome a child and we are pleased to see this being tackled as part of the review, says Maciver.She explains that the Law Commissionsrsquo lsquonew pathwayrsquo will have several positive outcomes: it will allow intended parents to become the legal parents from birth in some cases remove of the need for a genetic link between the intended parents and the child in some cases establish a new regulator for surrogacy create a register to allow those born of surrogacy arrangements to access information and for international surrogacy arrangements help those who have a child abroad to bring their child back to the UK with less red tape.The new framework, she says will set out proactive measures including ndashintroducing pre-conception safeguards that are built in before the baby is conceived to help to avoid problems later in the process. ldquoThe proposal is that before the child is conceived there must be a written agreement between the surrogate and the parent, an independent assessment of the childrsquos welfare, the intended parents and the surrogate are all bound to take independent legal advice so that they understand the process, they are all medically screened and criminal checks are carried out, she explains.The intended parents and the surrogate are also required to go to implications counselling to help establish the foundation for an appropriate and positive relationship.Which all sounds like an onerous process ndashbut itrsquos one which Maciver believes will actually signicantly enhance the current situation. ldquoItrsquos more proactive and sees the introduction of meaningful safeguards ndashwhich will hopefully reduce the problems that can sometimes arise after the birth of a child and provide clarity for those entering into a surrogacy arrangement exactly whatrsquos expected of them.The overseas optionOwing to the restrictions on commercial surrogacy in the UK and the dficulty in finding willing surrogates some people choose to go to countries where commercial surrogacy is legally possible ndashwhich often leads to further complications when trying to bring the baby back to the UK.Overseas situations, she says, account for approximately half of surrogacies and they will still have to apply for a parental order, which is also getting an overhaul. For example, currently the intended parents have to apply for that within six months of the child being born, which is a relatively narrow window. The proposal is remove that time limit. They are also proposing changes to make it easier and quicker to get a passport or visa to bring the child to live with them in Scotland. Unlike other areas of family law in Scotland, , surrogacy is an area that has seen cultural attitudes change faster than legislation and Maciver believes that the Law Commissionsrsquo proposals are welcome, though not perfect.While commercial surrogacy is banned, reasonable payments are allowed, which leads to grey areas which the proposals donrsquot yet address, for example, what is reasonable and what strays into lsquopaymentrsquo ldquoThe law in this instance is very dficult to apply, says Maciver. If the payment is higher than reasonably anticipated what options does the court have  There has so far been no refusal of a parental order based on the level of payment but itrsquos probably the most contentious area in the consultation. Itrsquos one in which people hold strong opposing views and so the Law Commissions have canvassed opinion about how these limitations should be set and enforced.Single parentsIn the meantime, though she is encouraged by the fact that in January the law was changed following a challenge to the Human Rights Act  meaning that single parents can now apply for a parental order. ldquoThis was the single most urgent issue: previously only married couples, civil partners, cohabitants or people in other enduring relationships could apply.And the future  Maciver says that there are dfering views about the best route forward ndashand of course the proposed changes are still at consultation stage. But she believes that the new pathwayis long overdue and will have very positive effect, improving the way that surrogacy works and better protecting the interests of surrogates, intended parents and ultimately the children involved.Which is a community whose numbers are fast increasing.Jenner Maciver, is head of family law at law firm Gillespie Macandrew, whocombine specialist, practical advice with a responsive, supportive and discrete service.For more information abour how Gillespie Macandrew can help please visitwww.gillespiemacandrew"},{"url":null,"title":"first-look-haddingtons-newly-refurbished-swimming-pool","story":"Work got under way at the pool and health suite within the townrsquos Aubigny Sports Centre in April and ndash after a delay ndash the pool is due to re-open on Monday.Essential maintenance and interior deacutecor works have been carried out at the sports centre, off Mill Wynd, over several weeks.During the work, the two pools were drained, with a new light, bright ceiling covering the outdated wood cladding.New lighting has also been installed while the locker rooms have also been given a facelt and tiles have been given a thorough clean.The new-look pool was revealed to enjoyleisure members and politicians on Friday afternoon.The facility is one of East Lothianrsquos original sports centres and originally opened its doors as Haddington Swimming Pool in September .The much-loved site consists of a four-lane swimming pool and East Lothianrsquos only dedicated infant pool.Before the temporary closure, the facility welcomed about , bathers to the pool each week for swimming lessons, AquaFit classes, swimming club training, school and public use."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.comource srcset=/resources/images/9867299.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"gerry-cinnamon-announces-second-glasgow-hydro-gig-popular-demand","story":"The Castlemilk singer recently told how he is to play the SSE Hydro on December  following his insane TRNSMT set.This morning the venue confirmed a second leg of his Glasgow show the next night for December .EXTRA DATE ANNOUNCED FOR @GerryCinnamon!! #Tickets for  +  December are on sale NOW... https:t.co JVHyTY pic yXRWuCIimPosting on social media the Hydro wrote: \"EXTRA DATE ANNOUNCED FORGerry Cinnamon.\"Tickets for  +  December are on sale NOW...\"We told previously howCinnamon, , told fans they had \"lost it\"they didnt think hed soon play in Glasgow and his latest output confirmed two December gigs for lucky punters to get excited about.He will also play Aberdeen in November."},{"url":null,"title":"watch-incredible-moment-karaoke-singer-stuns-hamilton-pub-nessun-dorma-performance","story":"William Boyle had the usually rowdy crowd at Bar West at a hushed silence as he bellowed through Paottis famous tune.The clip was posted on social media by user Ann Robertson who hailed the performer.:Watch boy, , belt out Bohemian Rhapsody on Central Station pianoShe said: \"I love all music but my absolute fave song in the whole world is Nessun Dorma by Luciano Paotti.\"I hope I dont embarass this gentleman but he nailed this in Bar West tonight n should be proud.

But populism has nothing to do with the social origins of its leaders. Nigel Farage used to be an investment banker. Donald Trump is a billionaire. It is about the people they seek to represent ndash often dismissively labelled the ldquoleft behinds, often non-graduates in low-paying jobs in non-metropolitan areas. The force that gave us Brexit.By its very nature, populism is not a coherent political philosophy. It is more visceral ndash the inarticulate fury of people who feel they the plaything of remote forces beyond their control. Its origins lay in the disruption that followed the  financial crisis, in which bankers were bailed out but not the people. They suffered insecurity, economic uncertainty and the longest pay freeze since the Napoleonic Wars.Populists linked arms with the more traditional, reactionary nationalist politicians against the globalist, liberal-democratic ldquoestablishment, that has dominated the media and politics for the last three decades. Think of Brown, Clegg and Cameron standing in line in the  election: three identikit, pro-European, neoliberal suits. Think of the leaders of the European Union. That is the establishment against which populists believe they are revolting.:Boris Johnson is asked what furniture he would need inside Number In France, the Gilet Jaunes protest continues, after nine months of street demonstrations, violent confrontations and petition-signing. It is inchoate, unpredictable and largely leaderless. But as anyone visiting France this summer will testy ndash it is everywhere. And it is overwhelmingly white. The repressive measures used against them by President Macron would be a national scandal were they used here.As Donald Trump demonstrated last week, populism has a strong racialist strand, though it is not simply a fascist movement as many on the left claim. Donald Trump is not an ideological white supremacist . He is above all an opportunist, ready to use whatever comes to hand to promote his personal popularity. With him, ratings mean more than political conviction.But that doesnt mean he can plead innocence after his genuinely shocking attacks on the democratic ldquowomen of colour last week . This began as crude electoral politics. He was trolling the Democrat Party, and the media, by singling out the radical ldquosquad of Democrat congresswomen, as theyre known. He wants the Democrats to be indelibly associated in the public mind with its multicultural Left, the better to win over white middle Americans and moderate Latinos. But he unleashed something deeply worrying.As the chants of ldquosend them home erupted at his rally Trumps trademark smirk seemed at first to nodding along. But even he now seems uneasy about the genie he has uncorked. Not since the s has racism been a factor in US presidential politics ndash at least not overtly. Barak Obama avoided playing the race card. Trump has now placed it firmly on the table, and it isnt going to go away.Donald Trumps flirtation with racism could actually lose him the next election, because many middle Americans are appalled at his behaviour. The United States prides itself, after all, on being the most multi-cultural, multi-racial society in the world ndash one which used to welcome ldquothe huddled masses of immigrants with open arms.Iain Macwhirter: Why Irsquom secretly looking forward to seeing Boris Johnson in Number TenBut liberals shouldnt get their hopes up. There is no rule that says racism cant help win elections. These are troubled times, and politicians need to exercise responsibility so as not to conjure forces they cannot control.Boris Johnson is also often called a racist, and a homophobe. This is largely because of his describing burqa-wearing Muslims as ldquobank-robbers and ldquoletter boxes. The future PM is not himself racist, as anyone who knows him can testy, but that doesnt mean he is immune to its compelling force.As London Mayor, Boris Johnson made great efforts to win the support of Muslims in that multi-racial city. He included many non-whites in his cabinet. When he takes over this week we can expect him to make great play of his progressive liberal credentials. He will remind voters that the infamousarticle argued against banning the burqa.However, there is no doubt that his signature politics of Brexit, while not racist in itself, arises at least in part from resentment at immigration. Many of Johnsons supporters are the kind of people you might find at Donald Trump rallies. His first test as Prime Minister should be to create clear multicultural water between himself and the American President ndash his equivocation last week about labelling Trumps remarks ldquoracist does not augur well.Johnson desperately needs the White House to deliver some kind of free trade deal that will show Europe that Brexit Britain means business. His first foreign visit as Prime Minister will be to the Trump Residence to plead his case for special treatment on trade. If Mr Johnson has any integrity, he will also make clear his concern at Trumps racist rhetoric ndash but I wouldnt hold my breath.Its an open secret that Johnson is looking to an early election to capitalise on Labours internal problems, which are to do with allegations of another kind of racialism: anti-Semitism. However, Westminster is now a four party political system with Nigel Farages Brexit Party and the revived Liberal Democrats challenging hard. Boris Johnson may have to seek the support of the Faragiste MPs to form a government.

But populism has nothing to do with the social origins of its leaders. Nigel Farage used to be an investment banker. Donald Trump is a billionaire. It is about the people they seek to represent ndash often dismissively labelled the ldquoleft behinds, often non-graduates in low-paying jobs in non-metropolitan areas. The force that gave us Brexit.By its very nature, populism is not a coherent political philosophy. It is more visceral ndash the inarticulate fury of people who feel they the plaything of remote forces beyond their control. Its origins lay in the disruption that followed the  financial crisis, in which bankers were bailed out but not the people. They suffered insecurity, economic uncertainty and the longest pay freeze since the Napoleonic Wars.Populists linked arms with the more traditional, reactionary nationalist politicians against the globalist, liberal-democratic ldquoestablishment, that has dominated the media and politics for the last three decades. Think of Brown, Clegg and Cameron standing in line in the  election: three identikit, pro-European, neoliberal suits. Think of the leaders of the European Union. That is the establishment against which populists believe they are revolting.:Boris Johnson is asked what furniture he would need inside Number In France, the Gilet Jaunes protest continues, after nine months of street demonstrations, violent confrontations and petition-signing. It is inchoate, unpredictable and largely leaderless. But as anyone visiting France this summer will testy ndash it is everywhere. And it is overwhelmingly white. The repressive measures used against them by President Macron would be a national scandal were they used here.As Donald Trump demonstrated last week, populism has a strong racialist strand, though it is not simply a fascist movement as many on the left claim. Donald Trump is not an ideological white supremacist . He is above all an opportunist, ready to use whatever comes to hand to promote his personal popularity. With him, ratings mean more than political conviction.But that doesnt mean he can plead innocence after his genuinely shocking attacks on the democratic ldquowomen of colour last week . This began as crude electoral politics. He was trolling the Democrat Party, and the media, by singling out the radical ldquosquad of Democrat congresswomen, as theyre known. He wants the Democrats to be indelibly associated in the public mind with its multicultural Left, the better to win over white middle Americans and moderate Latinos. But he unleashed something deeply worrying.As the chants of ldquosend them home erupted at his rally Trumps trademark smirk seemed at first to nodding along. But even he now seems uneasy about the genie he has uncorked. Not since the s has racism been a factor in US presidential politics ndash at least not overtly. Barak Obama avoided playing the race card. Trump has now placed it firmly on the table, and it isnt going to go away.Donald Trumps flirtation with racism could actually lose him the next election, because many middle Americans are appalled at his behaviour. The United States prides itself, after all, on being the most multi-cultural, multi-racial society in the world ndash one which used to welcome ldquothe huddled masses of immigrants with open arms.Iain Macwhirter: Why Irsquom secretly looking forward to seeing Boris Johnson in Number TenBut liberals shouldnt get their hopes up. There is no rule that says racism cant help win elections. These are troubled times, and politicians need to exercise responsibility so as not to conjure forces they cannot control.Boris Johnson is also often called a racist, and a homophobe. This is largely because of his describing burqa-wearing Muslims as ldquobank-robbers and ldquoletter boxes. The future PM is not himself racist, as anyone who knows him can testy, but that doesnt mean he is immune to its compelling force.As London Mayor, Boris Johnson made great efforts to win the support of Muslims in that multi-racial city. He included many non-whites in his cabinet. When he takes over this week we can expect him to make great play of his progressive liberal credentials. He will remind voters that the infamousarticle argued against banning the burqa.However, there is no doubt that his signature politics of Brexit, while not racist in itself, arises at least in part from resentment at immigration. Many of Johnsons supporters are the kind of people you might find at Donald Trump rallies. His first test as Prime Minister should be to create clear multicultural water between himself and the American President ndash his equivocation last week about labelling Trumps remarks ldquoracist does not augur well.Johnson desperately needs the White House to deliver some kind of free trade deal that will show Europe that Brexit Britain means business. His first foreign visit as Prime Minister will be to the Trump Residence to plead his case for special treatment on trade. If Mr Johnson has any integrity, he will also make clear his concern at Trumps racist rhetoric ndash but I wouldnt hold my breath.Its an open secret that Johnson is looking to an early election to capitalise on Labours internal problems, which are to do with allegations of another kind of racialism: anti-Semitism. However, Westminster is now a four party political system with Nigel Farages Brexit Party and the revived Liberal Democrats challenging hard. Boris Johnson may have to seek the support of the Faragiste MPs to form a government. That could sht British politics further to the populist right.Nigel Farages party is not an overtly racist party either, though his former vehicle, Ukip, has recently been showing clear signs of becoming one.

All the wonderful senses that we enjoy here on our planet, the sound of rain and distant thunder the sound of birds singing the smell of flowers and the sound of wind through the trees, all conspicuously absent in space.

But we havenrsquot built a diesel campervan in two years.While an all-electric campervan would certainly tick a few ldquogreen boxes, issues such as finding a recharging spot in the middle of nowhere make their practicality tough for even the toughest of camper.Instead, Mr Hayes claims to have pioneered the next best thing ndash the worldrsquos first fully hybrid and ldquotribrid four-wheel-drive fully independent campervans, powered by low-emission petrol engines and a hybrid battery that also powers white appliances.The design removes the need for gas fuel and a V hook-up for power. The result, he says, is a ldquogame-changer. in the modern campervan market ndash and perhaps some peace of mind for the environmentally-conscious camper.ldquoElectric vehicle range isnrsquot there, he says. ldquoThe point with a campervan is you want to get to places where yoursquore quite far away from home. Yoursquore not going to park up and find somewhere to charge your vehicle.ldquoThe hybrid petrol and electric system is designed to use electric around town and, when yoursquore out on the road, you use petrol.ldquoItrsquos self-charging ndash so when yoursquore driving on the petrol engine, every time you slow down or brake, you recharge the battery.His design for an LPG -fuelled van is even greener, emitting fewer toxic gases than petrol or diesel ndash and itrsquos cheaper.Eco-Campers, which has received backing from Scottish Enterprise, has positioned itself as an innovator in hybrid technologies and has worked hand-in-hand with researchers at leading universities to develop new energy sources and improved hybrid batteries for its vans.Such is demand that the business anticipates seeing its turnover rise by % over the next five years, while there are plans to expand the technology to markets in Canada, Australia and America.However, a boost in green credentials is unlikely to be much comfort to islanders and rural communities struggling to cope with the influx of large vehicles on narrow roads.For Western Isles residents and businesses hoping to squeeze on to ferries, campervans and motorhomes have added to the pressure: while just  took the Ullapool-to-Stornaway ferry in -, an estimated , used it  years later.Over the same period, the figure for Uig to Tarbert in Harris jumped from  to ,, while Oban to Castlebrae rose from  to .The roll-out of the Road Equivalent Tarfin the Western Isles, which has reduced fares, is thought to have encouraged many on to roads.Meanwhile just getting anywhere with your campervan is becoming a challenge in itself: the pick of campsites on key routes regularly display lsquono vacanciesrsquo signs, while earlier this year campervan tickets for the th Tiree Music Festival sold out within  minutes of going on sale.ldquoIn terms of scenery, the Western Isles plays host to some of the most spectacular landscapes and habitats in the world, and it is not surprising that RET has led to a large increase in the number of campervans travelling to the islands to experience this, says Alasdair Allan, MSP.ldquoTourism has taken on an increasing importance to the economy of the islands in recent years, says MSP Alasdair Allan. ldquoFor it to be sustainable, it is vitally important we have the right infrastructure in place and that the effects of tourism are not felt to be in conflict with island communities.ldquoThat means making sure there are sufficient waste disposal units, enough parking berths and available advice for driving on island roads.ldquoIt also means finding ways to ensure islanders donrsquot suffer as a result of the large demand for deck spaces on ferries.ldquoTo this end, I very much welcome the recent moves by the Scottish Government in looking to pilot a scheme that would keep some car space held back for islanders who need to travel at short notice."},{"url":null,"title":"kevin-mackenna-glasgow-39-s-miles-worse-time-snp-can-39-t-blame-tories","story":"And yet it must be true, mustnrsquot it  All those lestyle surveys telling us that wersquore the friendliest, rock n roll city on the planet: best for nightle top for student experience best UK retail emporiums outside of London cool restaurants around every corner and some of them vegan too.

According to Invest Glasgow, the cityrsquos inward investment team, ldquoGlasgow is at the centre of one the UKrsquos largest and most successful city regions.

Presumably, respondents all had a job and a roof over their heads.Even in the most jocund fun factories there always lurks a wandering Jeremiah. Earlier this month, Gary Smith, secretary of the GMB Union in Scotland, expressed a rather less ecstatic tone. In an interview in The Herald on Sunday he said: ldquoIt feels like a city that is in decline. Wersquove got public buildings in a state of decay ndash the Mitchell Library, the problems with the Peoplersquos Palace ndash the streets are absolutely filthy and wersquove got an epidemic of rats in large parts of the city. Too often the politicians are happy to hide behind this bluff and bluster about lsquopeople make Glasgowrsquo. The people of Glasgow deserve better than they are getting.Mr Smith cited public spending cuts and stealth privatisation as factors in many of Glasgowrsquos challenges. ldquoAll of this leaves the city in a state that feels unkempt, unloved and, in a lot of areas, actually really filthy. It is a city that is in economic and political decline.Those of us who have spent most of our lives living and working in Glasgow know which version of Glasgow is the authentic one. Lestyle surveys never extend to the sprawling neighbourhoods that lie to the north and east of the city. In these places multi-deprivation and health inequality remain among the worst in Europe, as they have been for more than a century. Many of Mr Smithrsquos union members live in these places. Until now the social challenges faced by these communities could be camouflaged in the breathless optimism of economic brochures selling an inward investment Xanadu to their fabled blue-chip companies.If they are proclaiming more than , businessesare located in the Glasgow city region and that they support more than , jobsthen they inadvertently paint a bleak picture. Why do so many Glaswegian families remain locked out of this economic Klondyke  No matter how spectacular a cityrsquos economic growth might be no matter how optimistic its long-term projections, these are shallow and meaninglesstens of thousands of people in the same old communities are unable to share in the bounty. Real growth and not this sham facsimile of it would trickle down into these places instead of accumulating in the bank accounts of the same few.Affluence and success can make you blind to the fact that Glaswegian men can lose  years of their le expectancy on a seven-mile stretch of the M from east to west. But when backdoor privatisation results in truncated essential services and a non-union workforce, the signs of decline begin to encroach on the city centre and the leafier neighbourhoods. Ultimately, tenants will pay more for additional services like bin collections. Rather than investing in these services they outsource to private firms, the least of whose concerns is the welfare of their workers and the cost to tenants. This is always how privatisation works.Meanwhile, the meter on Glasgowrsquos equal pay scandal is still running. The entire fabric of the city has been mortgaged to meet the bill, but this extends only to . The city will have to find more cash to pay those women who have been working since then at an unequal rate.Meanwhile, the sht and concentration of economic and political power to boutique Edinburgh continues. What sort of country permits a much smaller city to operate twice as many flights and trains to London as the larger one in terms of population and business  Why does Glasgow Airport, which still resembles a brick port-a-cabin in places, still lack a rail link We learned too this week that Scotland has now become the worst country for drug deaths. This must surely be fake news. How can this be so when Glasgow, its biggest city, is so happy and cheery and friendly all the time  As surely as a broken tumbler follows a dirty look, the supporters of the Scottish Government blamed the Tories for not giving them the powers to address this. The worst rates of drug addiction are in Scotlandrsquos poorest neighbourhoods and form part of the pattern of deprivation and disadvantage in these places. We have devolved power in this area. You canrsquot begin to deal with drugs until you first address the chronic health inequalities in these communities.Scotlandrsquos future economic prosperity rests on the performance of its biggest and most important city.

But that is not expected to take long.Malcolm Leslie, director of country house sales in Strutt  Parkerrsquos Edinburgh office, said: ldquoFundamentally, demand outstrips supply and buyers are frustrated at the lack of properties on the market.\"As a result, prime properties which do come to the market are met with exceptional demand, particularly rural family homes within striking distance of urban centres.\"One property recently marketed had more than  viewings in two weeks and attracted several offers at a closing date. It is now under offer.Further north, a sporting estate in one of the most remote locations on the Scottish mainland is being sold for more than pound million. Straddling the western end of Loch Monar in Ross-shire, ,-acre Pait and West Monar Estate is mostly only accessible by boat stis in the shadow of three Munros Sgurr a Chaorachain, Sgurr Choinnich, and Lurg Mhor.But buyers should beware - the main property on the estate, a Victorian hunting lodge, only received electricity in  and is mostly still lit with oil lamps.For househunters whose dream home would boast more environmentally-friendly measures, a specially-constructed four-bedroom family dwelling in Stirlingshire ticks all the right boxes.Muir Estate, near Thornhill, was designed by the Swedish architect Maumlrtha Wachtmeister and the current owner Jimmi Enevoldsen and is now on sale for offers over pound. million.Surrounded by a Christmas tree farm, the lodge was built on the site of a ruin with some of the old stone used in the construction, and is heated through a ground-sourced system while the insulation has been built made  per cent thicker than standard.:From Bigfoot to mermaids and Mars attacks - how hoaxes have fooled the worldMr Enevoldsen said: ldquoWe have enjoyed the secluded nature of the estate and the peace, quiet and wildle that comes with that.

A farmer discovered the remains of a local Bronze Age woman, the Queen of the Inch, in the s. She lay in a stone cist wearing a black lignite necklace and carrying a flint dagger.The remains form part of an exhibition in the Natural History Museum in Rothesay. An archaeological project commissioned by the current owner uncovered ious artefacts including carved stones and the largest collection of slate in the British Isles, important because of its implications for monastic schooling. The excavated remains point to the existence of an early Christian centre of some importance.The eighth century saw the island fall prey to Viking raids and it is believed victims of the th century Battle of Largs between Norway and Scotland were buried on the island. Additionally, Inchmarnock is rumoured to have been popular with smugglers, its woodland and craggy shoreline an ideal hiding place for contraband.Meanwhile in the th century, legend has it that an alcoholic from Bute was banished alone to Inchmarnock to overcome her addiction.More recently, the island was used as a training ground for D-Day preparations in World War Two and bomb craters are still evident.Inchmarnock was once home to  residents but the final permanent resident, a Bute farming tenant, left the island in .But it is not only windswept moors, Lochside retreats and isolated islands which are being rated as the most desirable property purchases in Scotland. Townhouses and chic urban dwellings also make the list, especially in Edinburgh, Scotlands fastest-growing property market for a number of years.Estate agents have flagged up Northhumberland Street , a six-bedroom full townhouse with private garden in the heart of the capitals Georgian New Town as an example of the type of prime property changing hands with asking prices in the millions.The dwelling, priced at offers over poundmillion, is spread over two storeys and sits close to exclusive schools such as the Edinburgh Academy, Fettes College, St Georges School for Girls.Andrew Riddell, senior associate director in Strutt  Parkerrsquos Edinburgh office, said: ldquoFamily homes in Edinburgh are very, very popular and competition is fierce when prime properties come to the market. The most sought after are in New Town, Stockbridge, the West End, Murrayfield, Morningside, Bruntsfield and the Grange.\"I have recently marketed several family homes which have attracted stf competition and either gone under offer within days of coming to the market or gone to a closing date.

Nevertheless, setting out his resignation timetable on The Andrew Marr Show was still remarkable.There was a giddy, ldquoschoolrsquosout air across all the Sunday shows. If British politics was a bog standard comprehensive there would be a sports day to mark end of term, maybe a trip to the cinema. Instead, Westminster will unveil the new Liberal Democrat leader today and the new head of the Conservative Party and Prime Minister of the UK tomorrow. Parliament then rises for the summer on Thursday. Brexit crisis, what Brexit crisis : Hammond set to resignMr Hammond will resign after Theresa May finishes her final Prime Ministerrsquos Questions on Wednesday, and before she makes that last lonely trip to Buckingham Palace.It was almost asthe Chancellor had given a lot of pleasurable thought to how he could spoil the new PMrsquos first day.Several of the Sunday papers had photos of Mr Hammond putting suitcases into the boot of his car as though his evacuation of Number  had already begun.Sorry to disappoint, he told Marr, but he was only doing what he did every week, heading home with a suitcase , and he would be heading back with the same one come Monday morning. It was a big case for a few bits and bobs. One of the advantages of being on the backbenches, Mr Hammond will discover in time, is that no-one will ever again find his luggage interesting.Though he was shortly to be out of the job of Chancellor, Mr Hammond was as chipper as any man who has a few million quid in the bank and does not need to worry about his next mortgage payment. The Chancellorrsquos mood set fair, Marr tried a joke. Known to date by the nickname of ldquoSpreadsheet Phil, did Mr Hammond fancy changing to something racier to go with his future as a backbench rebel  How about Phil Guea, Marr suggested  Mmm. Wisely, the Scot stopped there before he could go on to propose Phil Trotsky or Phil Danton.After the resignation announcement, the rest of the interview was about Phil-ing time, although there was one moment when Marr askedMr Hammond would go against the Government in a no confidence vote. He did not rule it out, but he did not rule it in either. Mr Johnson might call this a have cake and eat it position the rest of us would say it was a politician being a politician.: No deal Brexit trouble for everyoneMarr had by far the best line-up yesterday, with Ridge on Sunday reduced to talking to Adam Price, the Plaid Cymru leader, about the alliance between Remain parties in the Brecon and Radnorshire by-election. The most memorable takeaway from the encounter was the chilling notion that sideburns are still considered fashionable in Wales.Otherwise, Sophy Ridgersquos guests included Richard Burgon, the Shadow Justice Secretary. The two got into a spat over whether she had read a speech in full. She had, she informed him, looking rather mfed. As well she might. Since Andrew Neil and Boris Johnsonrsquos tussle over paragraphs b and c in GATT politicians and presenters have taken to trying to trip each other up on details. It will end in tears, but they will not be those of Ms Ridge, who does her homework.Elsewhere, the Sunday shows were all about jobs. Not the possible , that could be lost in Ireland should there be a no deal Brexit, according to Simon Coveney, the Irish deputy PM and guest on Marr, but the vacancies in the Liberal Democrats and the Conservatives.: SNP beacon of hopeIain Duncan Smith was introduced on Marr as the man being tipped as deputy PM to Boris Johnson. IDS insisted he had bid for nothing, asked for nothing, andhe got nothing he would still be a happy man. On Sunday Politics Scotland, Jo Swinson was similarly sunny, smiling gamely when presenter Gordon Brewer said she had been seen as a shoo-in for LibDem leader but some reports on postal votes suggested the contest with Sir Ed Davey was closer than expected. No votes had yet been counted, she said, she remained hopeful, but was not taking anything for granted. Would this outbreak of optimism never end The SNPrsquos Westminster leader was up next and he was in a good mood, too. Ian Blackford may have given the impression a few weeks ago that all was lost on blocking a no deal Brexit, but yesterday his tail was up ndash actually make that two tails ndash about the prospect. Something to do, perhaps, with the unexpectedly large majority last week against proroguing parliament. Now, Mr Blackford was ldquopretty convinced something could be done to take no deal off the table, even though it might only have a few days to get the job done. That was enough time, he said.With that it was cheerio from Sunday Politics Scotland, which after a special show on Wednesday, will be back on September . Marr willon September . By which time everything will have been sorted out.

Commenting, Mr McDonald said: “I have written to Andrew Jarvis, Managing Director at Stagecoach Bluebird to advise him of the challenges my constituents face with the review of this service. It is essential that public transport is available for patients to get to the health centre in Dyce, and this service must be reinstated as soon as possible.“I urge Stagecoach to review this decision in order that a transport link is in place for those needing access to local healthcare”.The residents of Newmachar also have local councillor Martin Ford on their side.Cllr Ford first wrote to Stagecoach Bluebird in October asking the company to reconsider its decision to cease running buses via Dyce Asda.The bus stop at Asda is very close to Dyce Health Centre in Altonrae Gardens so many Newmachar residents used the buses via Asda to visit their doctor and dentist.The change in bus routing in Dyce was discussed at the October meeting of New Machar Community Council, and again at last week’s meeting. On both occasions, concerned residents were in attendance. At the November meeting, Mr William Manius, operations director with Stagecoach Bluebird, also attended, at the Community Council’s request.As well as inidual letters of complaint to Stagecoach Bluebird, a petition has been signed by nearly  people unhappy at the route change. Stagecoach Bluebird have now said they will review the requests received for buses via Dyce Asda and look at use patterns.Meanwhile, Cllr Ford has written again to Stagecoach Bluebird managing director Andrew Jarvis.In his letter to Mr Jarvis, Cllr Ford says: “Taking all the representations made into account, I hope Stagecoach Bluebird will agree to find a way to again provide direct bus services for Newmachar residents to and from Dyce Asda shopping centre.”data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"\"  Forget Neil and Buzz, meet Scotland’s coosmonaut BuzzBò! viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Commenting, Cllr Ford said: “The buses via Asda provided an important service for Newmachar residents needing to access health and other facilities.”Cllr Ford has also written to Bains Coaches who operate a limited service between Oldmeldrum, Newmachar and Aberdeen to seethey will route some of their buses via Dyce ASDA."},{"url":null,"title":"annie celebrates 100th birthday","story":"A Blackburn woman celebrated her th birthday last week.Annie Paterson reached the special milestone on Tuesday, August .She was born in Parkhill near Dyce and married her husband in .They have four sons - Sanders, George, Raymond and Brian.Annie moved to Fechnie Brae House in  and has lived there since.She is pictured above with singer Fiona Kennedy, who was there representing the Lord Lieutenant.data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"This is what , can fetch you across the UK\"  This is what you can rent for £, per month across the UK viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\""},{"url":null,"title":"forget neil and buzz meet scotland s coosmonaut buzzbo","story":"Fty years ago tonight, Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin landed on the surface of the moon .But that’s old news – Scotland has its very own space hero to celebrate!

Mr Lyon said HIAL is fully prepared for three days of industrial action, which will see six of its airports closed due to strike action by air traffic controllers.Kirkwall Airport will be shut to all traffic next Monday, July .The strikes were called following the rejection of HIAL’s latest offer on July . The offer rejected by Air Traffic Controllerscomprised a retention allowance that would have seen ATCOs benefit from an additional £, over a five-year period.Prospect presented a counter offer that signicantly exceeds the flexibility and affordability of a publicly owned organisation.HIAL says that, throughout this process, it has been committed to resolving this dispute and has submitted a number of proposals that have been rejected outright by the union.Inglis Lyon, HIAL’s Managing Director said: “We deeply regret the inconvenience and upset to hundreds of passengers affected by the strike action.  We wish to find a resolution to this dispute as soon as possible and would urge Prospect to sit down with us once again to find some common ground on which we can arrive at a negotiated settlement.“Our position has been consistent throughout. We can only deliver an affordable settlement within the terms of Public Sector Pay Policy.

The schemes are designed to protect electricity consumers in the North of Scotland from high costs of distribution in their area. In   this was done by providing an annual assistance amount of £ million to consumers in the area, which Ofgem estimates is worth around £ per household.Mr McArthur said: “It is simply unfair for islanders to be surcharged when so many households in our island communities already experience the highest levels of fuel poverty anywhere in the country.“If these plans are implemented, it will be good news for consumers across the highlands and islands.

Users include people with profound and multiple learning disabilities and people with a range of other disabilities including Cerebral Palsy, Motor Neurone disease, Multiple Sclerosis, stroke, some older people and other specic disabilities.The requirements are set out in British Standards, and include:The new toilets are already open on deck six of MV Hjaltland and MV Hrossey, and will be available on board MV Hamnavoe by the end of the year.“This investment is another sign of our commitment to making our facilities as welcoming as possible to everyone in the community,# said Stuart Garrett, managing director at Serco NorthLink Ferries.#It will open up opportunities for many people with disabilities and their familes to visit some of the most beautul parts of Scotland. It also supports those living on the islands when travelling to and from the mainland for leisure and essential healthcare.”The move is the latest in a series of measures aimed at improving journeys for all travelers. Earlier this month the company became the first Scottish transport operator to introduce the pioneering Neatebox support service. This followed improvements to the NorthLink website, disability awareness training for staff, and a new partnership with a sign language interpreting agency.Mum and carer Jenny Whinnet, who helped to start the PAMIS campaign  years ago, said: #This is an exciting development for families and carers.#It permits people who need these facilities to travel further afield confidently and with dignity. This is very dferent to the early years of this campaign, when it was so dficult for me to travel with my son Craig because there were no Changing Places toilets available.”Jenny Miller, Chief Executive Officer of PAMIS added: “We’ve been very impressed with the commitment and consideration shown by Serco NorthLink Ferries in developing changing places toilets on their ferries.#They have really listened to the stories from the families and people we work with and who feel excluded from so many activities that we all take for granted. We’re delighted that the Orkney and Shetland ferries will be the first in the country, and possibly the world, to have a Changing Places toilet.”Paul Wheelhouse, minister for energy, connectivity and the islands is pleased to see the new facilities up and running.He said: #This type of improvement is exactly why we set up the Ferries Accessibility Fund.#We know accessible travel not only enables people to enjoy equal access to our beautul country, but it also enables people to fully participate in society and improve the quality of their lives, so we want to continue to identy and remove any disabling barriers which prevent people from making journeys or lead to them having an unpleasant time on board.#It’s very important that Scotland’s ferry services are fully accessible, offering the best passenger experience possible to everyone and this targeted investment marks very welcome progress on that journey.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

NorthLink Ferries’ two freight vessels, Helliar and Hildasay, were instrumental in the product development and field testing.Ian Livingstone, managing director of Ankaa, said: “The maritime community has always been challenged with effectively managing, sharing and ensuring validity of seafarer’s data. This has become more dficult with tightening data privacy legislation globally. The maritime world has been slow to adopt digital solutions and reluctant to embrace collaboration. We were very frustrated with the products available on the market being unable to offer a user-friendly but complete approach to industry-wide problems. Ankaa Marine was specically designed by seafarers for seafarers to offer the sector a simple solution.”Stuart Garrett, Serco’s managing director for NorthLink Ferries, added: “We never stand still and are always looking for ways to improve our operations. Usually this is for the benefit of our customers. But on this occasion, we’re pleased to be doing something directly for our staff, ensuring that we keep up with technology and bring the benefits of digital services to our unique workplace.

There are  seats in the upper house ndash which does not choose the prime minister ndash about half of which are elected every three years.Mr Abe welcomed the result, saying it reflects a public mandate for his policies.He said ldquoI believe the people chose political stability, urging us to pursue our policies and carry out diplomacy to protect Japanrsquos national interests. -- vw,vw,px, px\"Shinzo Abe celebrates--The results appeared to match or even exceed pre-election polls that indicated Mr Abersquos ruling bloc was to keep ground in the upper house, with most voters considering it a safer choice over an opposition with an uncertain track record. To reach the two-thirds majority, or  seats, Mr Abe needs  more seats by his ruling bloc and supporters of a charter change.Opposition parties have focused on concerns over household finances, such as the impact from an upcoming % sales tax increase and strains on the public pension system amid Japanrsquos ageing population.Mr Abe has led his Liberal Democratic Party to five consecutive parliamentary election victories since . -- vw,vw,px, px\"Vote-counting in Tokyo--He has prioritised revitalising Japanrsquos economy and has steadily bolstered the countryrsquos defences in the backdrop of North Korearsquos missile and nuclear threats and Chinarsquos growing military presence. He has also showcased his diplomatic skills by cultivating warm ties with US President Donald Trump.Mr Abe was hoping to gain enough upper house seats to boost his chances for constitutional revision, his long-cherished goal before his term ends in . Mr Abe needs approval by a two-thirds majority in both houses to propose a revision and seek a national referendum. His ruling bloc already has a two-thirds majority in the more powerful lower house.But Mr Abe and his conservative backers face challenges because voters seem more concerned about their jobs, the economy and social security. -- vw,vw,px, px\"Yukio Edano, leader of the opposition Constitutional Democratic Party--The main opposition Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan and three other liberal-leaning parties teamed up in some districts. They stressed support for gender equality and LGBT issues mdash areas Mr Abersquos ultra-conservative legislators are reluctant to back.At a polling station in Tokyorsquos Chuo district on Sunday, voters were ided over Mr Abersquos six-and-a-half-year rule.A voter who identied himself only as a company worker in his s said he chose a candidate and a party that have demonstrated an ability to get things done, suggesting he voted for Mr Abersquos ruling party and its candidate, as ldquothere is no point in casting my vote for a party or a politician who has no such abilities.Another voter, Katsunori Takeuchi, a -year-old fish market worker, said it was time to change the dominance of Mr Abe and his ultra-conservative policies.ldquoI think the ruling party has been dominating politics for far too long and it is causing damage, he said.copy -.

During their whistle stop tours of the land, much of the talk has, naturally, been about Brexit, our relationship with the United States and promises of tax cuts for iniduals and businesses.While these issues may capture the imagination of the , Tory party members, who are deciding who will be our next PM, there are plenty of other pressing matters that the next resident of No  Downing Street will need to keep in mind. Ensuring that everybody has access to a good workplace pension is one of them.As it stands, there are more people saving in a pension than at any time in our history. This is down to the success of auto-enrolment pensions – a policy that has welcomed some  million new pensions savers since .It has been a genuine success. So far. But there is more to do. Contributions from inidual workers and their employers have gradually been rising from a low base, reaching eight per cent of salary in April of this year.Monitoring how employees have responded to the April increase is crucial before any further tweaks are made to auto-enrolment policy.Westminster itself recognises the need for improvement. The  Auto Enrolment Review endorsed the case for making pensions contributions count from the first pound of salary, rather than anything after £,. This would have a material effect on the prospects of lower and middle-income workers building up a decent sized pot for retirement. But no timetable has yet emerged for implementation.Politics is in flux of course and commitments can fall by the wayside. But this delay is sensible. Auto-enrolment has worked so far because it has been evidence-based. It would also be important to stage gradually the implementation of a “contributions from the first pound earned” policy because of its greater impact on lower earners.More immediately, the government should consider measures to bring the benefits of auto-enrolment pension saving to more women.Women make up only around a third of those auto-enrolled so far. Reducing the “enrolment trigger” from £, a year from one job to the primary National Insurance threshold level – £, – would bring the benefits of auto-enrolment to another half a million people, three-quarters of whom would be women.This would help auto-enrolment play its full role in tackling the gender pensions gap. As things stand the average woman retires with a pension income £, less than her male counterpart. Women more often take a break from full-time work to raise a family, with a long-term knock on effect on their pension savings. More affordable and accessible childcare would help the four in  women who have said they would like to work more hourschildcare was more accessible.One bright idea is to encourage childcare businesses to open in town centres – a move which would help both Messrs Hunt and Johnson achieve their stated aim of “saving the High Street”.While I don’t believe for one second that either candidate will spend the coming days discussing the vagaries of auto-enrolment pensions, they will do well to remember that people really do need a guiding hand when it comes to securing their future.Gregg McClymont is head of policy at The People’s Pension and former shadow pensions minister.

But Pamela Nash, chief executive of Scotland in Union, said Theresa May’s successor must take a strong line on the constitution.“Whatever your views on the new Prime Minister, the last thing Scotland needs is another isive independence referendum and more constitutional chaos,” she said.“Nicola Sturgeon will use this moment to launch a major new drive to ide us, capitalising on the ongoing uncertainty over Brexit. This is a time for cool heads and rational response, and the PM must not rise to the SNP’s desperate grievance tactics or stoop to the nationalists’ level.”Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie also called for the referendum issue to be parked and for greater focus on Scottish public services.“The SNP laid out a blueprint for an independent Scotland in  and the public said no.

This industry produces more green house gases than the all of transportation. In fact, it is several times greater than transportation. The catch  scenario is this industry has had no regulation or legislation is regard to reducing greenhouse gases, infact, due to population growth, the pollution created by agriculture is vastly on the increase. Technology has played its part, but it is a situation where reducing pollution is very, very dficult to achieve given the nature of the industry itself. As the population increases, this will become more relevant in terms of the overall pollution created, and no doubt, something will have to be done. Whether sea based farming of certain foods may reduce the pollution, but much of agriculture is still based on land and the production of meat will still create problems related to greenhouse gases in terms of land used for meat production and or crop production as well. It is a dilemma which will become more relevant as the population increases.I can assure you these bairns weren#t pushed into anything. They were toldthey wanted to go they had to complete a form. One of mine wanted to go, the other didn#t. One asked a question at the Town Hall and I am very proud # not that she had to protest # but that she had the courage to do so, and silence many there.Well done young folk # out of the mouths of babes as they say.It hardly takes any courage to join a protest, especially one being encouraged and congratulated onby so many folk! The courage comes from not following the crowd herd and forming an independent and educated view. Jumping headlong onto the bandwagon is easy, understanding the science and striving to do something about it the hard bit. Joining a not fully educated and scientically ignorant caucus is just so stupid.Especially a meaningless strike from school, what child would not love a day off among mates  No doubt the pig ignorant and stupid will be so impressed. A bit like supergluing yourself tp a bus or train, outstanding!!!I didnt say it took courage to join a protest, I said it takes courage to speak at the Town Hall. Andit was about time off school, they all would have gone. Please have more respect for our bairns and young folk.And these bairns are, for your information, studying the stem subjects at school.It is not a case of having respect for the bairns, Johan Adamson. It is just a case of having absolutely no respect whatsoever for those who politicise them and drive them like sheep. Primary children used in a political strike!! Repulsive behaviour, you should be ashamed, so socialist, child exploitation is the words that come to mind.They had to complete a form, primary children! What next, form a political Union and become militant  Little Orwellian sheep bleating for the Pigs.These were AHS pupils Ian, not primary pupils, and no one has politicised them.Educated them yes, but then I forgot you have the monopoly on climate change education and stem subjects.The organisers were I think over , so young adults.The fact is I will always criticise revolting behaviourand ignorance and I am not referring to the children.Yes I do believe sixth year pupils are capable of organising thisWhy do you assume Ian that these bairns are not studying stem subjects and that only you know about climate change then Ian Infantile comments  Pot kettle springs to mind.Now just who printed these forms the children had to fill in  Which teachers OKed the strike and arrange for Brae and Aith schools also took part, as well as bairns from the Sound Primary School and organised and paid for transport  I do not believe that was AHS sixteen-year-olds for one second.Whether by accident or design this provides a very convenient fig leaf for the council#s lamentable performance on child poverty.Much was made of the #children#s march# at the SIC#s education committee meeting today however in a news report about the part of the same meeting that dealt with the council#s child poverty action report, it was clear that the council have done next to nothing since the Shetland Inequalities Commission reported in March .know. All these admirable young citizens are guilty of is taking a stand based on commonly accepted information. I could ask what special knowledge does Ian think he has that allows him to lord it over them# but nerves fail me.On Ian’s earlier point, it is self-evident thatwe need some people with a high level of competence in STEM subjects who can take critical stand on matters scientic. Gaining some depth in the Arts and Humanities, however, increases the likelihood of developing sensitivity and compassion, concern for humanity and the future of our planet, self-awareness and insight into common human foibles, hubris and self-aggrandisement included! Learners on this path can also become alert to common logical fallacies. Even those who like Ian, with a preference for physical sciences, can benefit. Happily don’t need to be much of a scholar to spot an ad hominem attack. With all due respect for Ian’s past achievements in the physical sciences, it would be nicehe could make his points without belittling others #kids included. That’s a normal standard “of decency and tolerance” btw.I so agree with these word #gaining some depth in the Arts and Humanities, however, increases the likelihood of developing sensitivity and compassion, concern for humanity and the future of our planet, self-awareness and insight into common human foibles, hubris and self-aggrandisement included!#. You do so hold yourself in such regard high Peter, now go glue yourself to a train or bus to prove your point!But just at that moment, as though at a signal, all the sheep burst out into a tremendous bleating of- #Four legs good, two legs better! Four legs good, two legs better! Four legs good, two legs better!# It went on for five minutes without stopping. And by the time the sheep had quieted down, the chance to utter any protest had passed, for the pigs had marched back into the farmhouse ”.And what are you doing Ian to save the planet And what would you suggest the AHS and the SIC do Ad Hominem attacks # playing the man not the ball # are often used by those who don’t have much of an argument to begin with. Instead of dealing with whether the young people have a point or not, generous-spirited Ian opted to have a go instead.Logical fallacies show lazy thinking, masking an absence of creativity and independent thought. Ian’s trollswipe above looks Ad Hominem in approach st first, but he is also using the Tu Quoque Fallacy. This is where you accuse the opponent of hypocrisy to avoid answering their charge. Self-effacing Ian thus avoids addressing the possibility of his own hubris or lack of self-knowledge.Should I have made things easier for him and asked what his actual beef with the climate protestors was  He says “Joining a not fully educated and scientically ignorant caucus is just so stupid”and demands that everyone should be able to answer “how does today’s Global Warming compare with the Global Warming scientically after and during the Second Ice Age ” before taking a view. Perhaps he will educate us by answering his own question # sticking to terms that demonstrate tolerance and decency of course. Nuclear Free Council, Declair Climate emergency,climate justice what a load of utter bunkum. Especially stop allowing political activists to exploit our children.I put forward the question : Is nuclear power the only solution to stop greenhouse gas emissions and the only way to stop climate change progressing further  It may be the worse case scenario in terms of our power demand solution, but what are the alternatives to our demand for energy without causing further environmental and ecological damage to the planet by in using fossil fuels or cleaner alternatives like wind or solar   It has been suggested the Sahara Desert could be used for solar energy to power Europe, but how much land would be required and could this be expanded  The alternatives to fossil fuels may be cleaner, but how would this affect global weather patterns or the depletion of species due to the destruction of natural habitats being replaced for energy production Very sadly the SG SNP has committed to wind energy with its catastrophic environmental damage and only intermittent supply, but that is the policy of the scientically ignorant and utterly stupid.Thank you for your comments, Ian. I fear humanity will have no choice but to go nuclear for its energy production in the future.Alternative resources, like wind or solar, may be the short term answer, but as mentioned, the downside to this is the large amount of land which will be required with the ability to vastly expand as demand increases. What would be the environmental damage and the destabilization of le on the planet have in the long term with such technologies  There is also the issue of economics dictating progress on future energy production, and would this be counter-productive due profits taking priority over progress and the reduction of the pollution into the environment  I agree with your comments Ian, in regard to nuclear based energy production. However, like many issues to do with progress, something catastrophic will have to take place before we realize we should have acted sooner.There it is again, the abusive and arguably ignorant use of that word “stupid”. Having reread all contributions above it seems Ali denies there’s a problem by saying there are dangerously low CO levels, John distracts by arguing the council should care more for child poverty, and Ian disparages, disparages and disparages again. Are all three attempting to harmonise from the same alt-right reactionary hymn-sheet Ian’s singular approach is getting between him and his key message.

If he could but answer his own Ice Age question to Brian , his motive might become a little clearer. And apologies in advance to Ianhe has already made his point and I’ve missed it, but it wasn’t me who thought it smart to surround it with invective. Wouldn’t it be just lovelyIan could contribute tolerantly without using putdowns  It’s almost as though he needs them to build himself up# Oh. Hold on# Eureka!#Are all three attempting to harmonise from the same alt-right reactionary hymn-sheet # What a plonker, Peter, just cannot resist going political. Is thisLabour or SNP talking, he often points in both directions or is he now Green Maybe the characters on here who hate the idea of young people protesting about climate change should head down to the school and start shouting some of this stuff over the wall.But, then again, that might make them see . . . well . . . insane.Folk writing to the paper to have a go at the protesters is one of the most depressing contributions to local public debate imaginable.Hopefully, though, the usual naysayerswill only encourage them to do it more.There#s nothing wrong with anyone, of any age, having an opinion on whatever they like, and expressing it. But in their own time, only.The problem with this is that participation in this protest was permitted and facilitated,not encouraged by the education authority, which by default is an endorsement of the opinion being expressed in the protest and the timing method by which the protest was made, by the education authority.Education authorities and schools are supposed to be impartial, by granting #authorised absence# status to a politically motivated protest, that impartiality is now seriously called in to question and a dangerous precedent has been set.There was no reason other than a cynical publicity stunt for this protest to take place during the school day. If those still at school feel strongly enough to organise a protest like adults do, that#s fine, let them, but also like adults, it#ll have to happen in their own time, or they suffer the consequences of #unauthorised absence#, for it to be taken seriously.If they want to play in the big bad world, they play by the big bad world#s rules, not by special favours like this was.Only a few nutters are #impartial# about climate change these days.Do you mean that civil disobedience would have been better Well said Mark! The evident concern trollingis intended to deligitimise the voice of young people who, lets remember, are meant by right to have a say in matters that concern them. Scotland’s national curriculum intends younger learners become active and responsible global citizens. Therefore no one involved in supporting the reported protest has done any wrong, other than in the eyes of seemingly knee-jerk reactionaries who may well be hiding their true motives. Artfully comparing these identiable young people to Orwell’s unthinking farm animals, in order to subvert their point# well it more than lacks sensitivity and compassion. It is desperate, pitul and contemptible in equal measure. It may well also fall foul of observing normal standards of decency and tolerance that contributors to these pagesare meant to adhere to. Those joining the protest were not “stupid”, as has been claimed above. The overuse of that intolerant word may be though. I note you mention #Scotland’s national curriculum intends younger learners become active and responsible global citizens.# now could you explain how taking time off school and striking for the declaration of aclimate emergency makes the child an active and responsible global citizen  I rather feel they are being played by our Greeny ignoramuses and SNP political propagandists!

I also asked is that a bit too deep for you to understand  # So it seems to be!!Well done Ian, you answered the question! There was a lot of unnecessary waffling and needless aggression but you got there. So, in the incredibly unlikely event of a, totally safe, nuclear power plant being built in Shetland you’d still want it as far away from where you live as possible. Fair dos.Instead of nuclear power or gas have you ever put any thought into wind power  I’ve heard that they don’t cause any carbon pollution at all, so they’d be ideal. They’re very pretty too and scientic. Like an actual windmill, I’m a big fan.Sadly Ray, you are being misled. take Viking for example.

I just dispute the best way to combat it.Deft footwork here from Ian. His, and his hero Farage’s position # not that he cares to own up to it # is not that there is no climate change. Obviously the climate changes over time. What he is conveniently avoiding are the questions around cause and appropriate response.Please do not make up speculative little stories porkies Peter. Farage is not my hero, however, I find him infinitely preferable to Corbyn and Salmond, however, here is not the place to digress further.Will Hell freeze over before Ian tells us what he presumes the protestors are ignorant of  Answering the question he posed Brian is not too mammoth a task for him surely. I suspect he is trying to dodge it for a reason.Read and weep Peter. If your intellect stretches that far. !! In the most simple of Science, It is set out below. The protestors are ignorant of the very most basic understanding of carbon capture and the prevention of climate change. Trees!! Only the very most utterly stupid, like yourself cannot see the wood for them!It is not clear the protest had a position on biomass, however Ian has firmly stated the need for those taking any position to be able to answer #how does today’s Global Warming compare with the Global Warming scientically after and during the Second Ice Age #Ian has thus far excitedly cited three articles, none of which reference any ice age. The first: #Tree planting ‘has mind-blowing potential’ to tackle climate crisis#, has Professor Crowther emphasising #it remains vital to reverse the current trends of rising greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel burning and forest destruction, and bring them down to zero# this is needed to stop the climate crisis becoming even worse and because the forest restoration envisaged would take - years to have its full effect##Reafforestation, necessary as it is, isn#t no silver bullet, nor a speedy enough solution, though many on the protest would likely love to plant some trees.The second and third articles focus on biomass, which is contested.To help Ian make his point, does he mean the Cryogenian, the second last ice age or the Little Ice Age  Again, other than to spread scorn and belittle, what is Ian#s actual point Sorrymy point is beyond you Peter. My question # “how does today’s Global Warming compare with the Global Warming scientically after and during the Second Ice Age ”That would require a thesis at post-graduate level to answer. Hardly space here! My point was that these children simple to not have the science to have a considered and informed opinion based on knowledge. The science is actually simple, I suggest you look it up and read it.Lest anyone thinking of studying the sciences, physical or social, be put off, Ian’s approach to advancing a scientic argument is far from typical. Thomas Kuhn made a very useful contribution by proposing that as a science advances some innaccurate claims will inevitably be made and indeed built on, but will later be corrected as sufficient contrary evidence emerges. Hawkins himself corrected some of his own foundational work. A settled consensus generally emerges over time through reasonable and reasoned dialogue and argument in which peer reviewed sources, research evidence and the thinking they provoke are made apparent.This is perhaps one reason why the Shetland Times asks contributors to observe normal standards of decency and tolerance for the opinions of others. It helps to bring forth the truth.It is, however, more than unusual for anyone taking themselves seriously to make a strong central scientic claim then refuse to back it up, clary it’s meaning or intent# unless of course Ian is proposing rhetoric, cant and distracting insult are now sciences, in which case top marks are due to the happy fellow.What a load of pretentious twaddle. You have outdone yourself here Peter. The word Science simply means knowledge, no more no less. It is just as simple as that.Whilst he remains intent on running away from clarying and substantiating his own point, here is an easier question for Ian: Why does he call Greens lunatics  There must be some point of disagreement between him and them, in his own head at least.That would be self-evident Peter. Read up the following. Bio-Fuels, palm oil plantation. Diesel fuel promotions, particulates. Germany non-nuclearpolicy,brown coal burning. Shetland exports clean gas imports polluting wood chip. Tree planting reverses CO build up, wood chip more polluting than coal burning and deforests huge areas. The EU % of renewable, Biomass .Greenies promote non-nuclear. more people killed in wind farm accidents in Uk than nuclear ever has. All the above would indicate a somewhat lunatic approach from the Greens. Now we have, using helicopters to survey Viking Energy sites as peat too unstable for tracked vehicles to reach, unbelievable!!! I hate to say the cult of #Greta Thunberg#,depression, eating disorders, and anxiety attacks,Asperger’s syndrome, high-ing autism, and OCD. She also suffers from selective mutism and self-harm. The sacricial lamb of the Greens across Europe. The inspiration behind the school strikes!!!!! Nowthat#s not lunatic, what is Ian’s position on global warming is either well grounded or is, well, hot air. He knows how this goes. Either he has a reputable theorist publishing an article in a reputable journal, or even a weblink to a news story referencing such, or he doesn’t. Because some vested interests have bought and paid for their own pet scientiststhere may be dferent opinions regarding whatever his as yet unclear point was with his unnamed and undated second ice age. If he really wants to be taken seriously he should put up or# consider his alternative.C’mon Ian, one reference to one reputable scientist backing up whatever it is you so obviously don’t want to say. You know you can do it.I am would be intrigued to opinions relating to climate change due to agriculture and what would be the answer to providing food but reducing or stopping climate change due to agriculture. I may be wrong but I believe agriculture produces  times more greenhouse gases than all of transportation put together, but this has, conveniently, been avoided by the media and scientic community. There is a terrible dilemma between producing food to this of attempting to reduce green houses gases and the progressive climate change taking place Both Ian and Greta Thunberg are right tho. We are not taking climate change seriously enough and we are confused.One minute providing grants to preserve Shetland#s peat carbon store, and the next proposing digging acres of it up, releasing all that carbon, to build Viking.Giving out paper straws in McDonalds with juice in a plastic cup .I mind askingabout planting trees on my croft. They said #oh we dont want these clumps of trees any more, not our landscape#, when I had always thought tree planting was good.Such a mixed message. Why dont we have a green rating system like we have for our washing machines. You could rate biomass, nuclear, windfarms from construction to operation in terms of green to red, so we would know where we are in the scale with our choices.Any way, still have a patch of high hill that would be great for a mini woodsI referenced Greta with a very heavy heart, a truly exploited child whose background would fire concern with any child specialist in the UK, psychologist or Social worker.Sorry, Johan, who isn#t #taking climate change seriously# Theresa May and the Tories are taking it very seriously, indeed, passing Mrs May#s unilateral # net zero# plan into law. The Treasury says it will cost over £ trillion , enough to fund the salaries of , nurses for  years.Too little for Greta Thunberg and her #Extinction Rebellion pals, apparently.This will find its way on to consumers# electricity bills, including those in fuel poverty, a clear majority of homes in Shetland #  percent, before the recent price hikes.The Shetland Labour Party that I grew up with was concerned with alleviating poverty, not creating it. They were not interested inwinning #Green Blue Peter Badges# for futile, bourgeois bagatelles like#tackling climate change#, without any hope of success.Britain, far less, Shetland, can achieve nothing alone.The only candidate to exhibit concern for Shetland#s poor is Ian Scott.Im confused. You state that the Tories are proposing  net zero and then you say Labour creating poverty.I am very seriously concerned about fuel poverty everywhere and especially in Shetland. I hope that there are no price hikes in our fuel bills, this is something we need to resist, and I also hope more help is forthcoming for retrofitting better heating systems and more insulation to improve housing quality.Please do not try to tell me what I believe.Johan, I don’t recall you ever mentioning fuel poverty before. Do you support or oppose “ net zero”, which was done in knee-jerk response to the campaigns of Greta Thunberg and her pals “Extinction Rebellion” Only, you have been supporting Ms Thunberg’s “climate emergency” campaign at local level, have you not Mrs May’s , nurses salaries for  years isn’t “emergency” enough for them, they want more.You can huff and puff as much as you like, the cost will find its way to the fuel poor, increasing their number.I put it to you that you cannot simultaneously support Greta Thunberg AND the fuel poor, whom you have now mentioned for the first time.Mr Scott has been arguing for Shetland’s poor since long before he became a councillor.No John I have not been supporting Greta#s campaign locally and yes I have mentioned fuel poverty before and I think I can support greener politics and the poor. It is an important point tho, how we are going to pay for it all. I heard somewhere the Tories are going to pay for it from the proceeds of G.Johan, I responded to your comment above that Greta Thunberg is right .You have also defended the Shetland schools strike “climate emergency” demonstration in this self, same thread.I quote: “Both Ian and Greta Thunberg are right tho. We are not taking climate change seriously enough#..etc..”That sounds awful like you think Mrs May committing  years’ worth of , nurses salaries isn’t “taking climate change seriously enough” If you are now saying that you do not support Greta Thunberg and do wish to tackle Shetland’s lamentable fuel poverty, will you be making a clear, prominent statement to that effect in your campaign literature Including your and Shetland Labour’s proposals for solving the fuel poverty The twisting of my words is really uncalled for, and completely ignoring the main point of my post which is that we need a green rating system to stop you all arguing about what is green and what is not # but then you enjoy the fight too much and would poo poo any system anyway I suppose.Strange move of support from Wir Shetland to Ian Scott  You#re scraping the barrel, now, Johan, getting personal. After your Up Helly-Aa performance, your comment about #enjoying the fight# is, frankly,a bit rich.It appears you are not prepared to make the campaign commitment I suggested. That#s ok.I#m not supporting anyone yet as I haven#t heard from all the candidates. I merely pointed out that Mr Scott is the only one so far to have shown any real concern for Shetland#s poor. He needs to say more about that. Under the present arrangements #climate emergency# will dump on the fuel poor. They have votes, too, of course # more than  percent of the electorate.Good luck with your campaign.Given his concern for the fuel poor John Tulloch will presumably be supporting whichever candidate puts the cancellation of Brexit first and foremost in their manesto  The largest driver of upward pressure on heating bills over the past two years is the devaluation of the pound following the Brexit vote. Greta Thunberg had nothing to do with it. In the event of further declines in the value of the pound post prime minister Johnson increased hard Brexit probability, the suffering of the fuel poor will continue to worsen as the wholesale price of gas becomes relatively more expensive when purchased in pounds sterling.The  dilemma that John Tulloch posed to Johan Adamson could equally well be phrased thus: I put it to you that you cannot simultaneously support Brexit AND the fuel poor.I apologiseI have gotten personal. Be as naesty as du wants, I just cant fathom why you need to be so  Breakfast TV only this morning were talking about how the market is not working, people not changing utility supplier and these people paying more as a consequence.Its surely not fairyour contract runs out that they are able to leave you on a higher rate Action on fuel poverty needs to include tackling the inequalities in the market as well as action to make our houses warmer.Ok, Johan. I’ve made my points about fuel poverty and there’snothing I want to add.So forgive meI don’t digress into bickering about who has or hasn’t been “naesty”. Readers may judge.Good luck with your campaign.Yes, Ian can answer a question when he chooses to. And there is sense in some of what he says. Wind farms on peat, for example, happen when commercial interests chase subsidies, so it is up to governments to get the correct approach. Not all that blame goes at the Green’s door, and they are either correct to claim there is a climate emergency or they are not.On the climate emergency Ian’s thoughts can only be guessed at. They have something to do with an ice-age, which is appropriate as progress towards getting him to answer his own question is, as yet, glacial.A big problem inside these debates stems from some people get beguiled by fake scientic claims. This is why genuine people making genuine scientic claims are generally happy to back them up by referencing the work of the real scientists involved. This offers folk who may or may not be less expert than Dr. Ian Tinklersome protection from charlatans with an axe to grind. Again,Ian is serious, rather than just being a contraryIan, he will reveal his ice-age source s. Or would doing so would reveal his actual movitation  C’mon Ian, youknowyouwantto.I actually sent them to the Times. They failed to print them as perhaps regarded as irrelevant pertaining to the school strike. I will do so again so Peter can untwist his knickers.The book you really should read, Mr T., is The Uninhabitable Earth by David Wallace Wells. Things are far more precarious than you think.David Wallace Wells. I would rather believe scientic specialists in ious fields than blindly take the word of a Journalist, Brian. He appears to hold no scientic qualication of any type. Writing for theis not reliable science training any more than writing for the Mail..Try reading it.IFLAS is a global hub of inquiry, teaching, and dialogue on enabling the transition to more fair and sustainable societies.All that is pure Mikey Mouse to a true Scientist!!!Abruptclimate change , at younger dryasfor years also because of meteorite strike in Greenland. We still haven#t founda proper way of storing spent nuclear fuel, i can seethe repository at Sellafield being under miles of snow through the many ice ages to come before it issafe again.The nuclear nonsensewas never about cheap and safe electricity it was of course about weapons grade plutonium tons,produced here in Scotland alone,why that amount when a few tons could polish off the entire planet does anyone know Do we trust Boris and fruitcake farm with this ,aye right- their record speaks for itself! Maybe the bairns protesting about climate change holds a candle of hope up - -we are all going to need it.Graham Fleming, Thorium breakdown isotopes have short half-lives. Long term storage is nor an issue. Ask a standard grader that is beyond your understanding.Incidentally, the global stockpile of separated plutonium is about  tonnes. That is  tonnes too much, however Thorium reactors produce none at all. Sad you cannot get your facts straight Graham Flemming, so very SNP.Having read these pages for a long time Peter, it should be apparent by now that Ian is a dental surgeon by training and therefore qualies for Dr status.No need to have a PhDor any other bits of paper !Ok, well thanks to Ian, andthe Times did withhold the links as irrelevant to the school strike they maybe had a point. It was Ian that insisted to Brian Smith way back when that this issue was relevant, for whatever reason.I#m still not clear what Ian draws from these articles though, or why anyone would have to have this knowledge to take a view on the current level of threat, but I get that global warming isn#t about to lead to another ice age. I don#t recall the protest saying it would# It#s a welcome change to have Ian express himself without resort to petty insult though. Long may that continue. On his earlier point on science, however, I#m not sure most scientists would agree science means knowledge only, as Ian proposed, without including the search for it by using scientic methods.But here is the big unanswered question # whatever it is Ian take from these links # does he, or does he not, think we are facing a climate crisis  If we are then surely the kids are right to be concerned, especially as some government sponsored action on climate change is potentially green-wash.Slight problem with the colour test Johan.About % of men have problems when distinguishingbetween red and green . For women it is only .%. As for shades of green —- no chance for men !Maybe that’s one of the reasons why some of themcan’t resist verbal battles.Green for GO and they can’t stop . 🔴Thanks to Brian for those interesting links. The second, albeit straight from a professor in the field, might also not pass Ian’s test, but both seem to provide plenty of evidence it is more than reasonable for the kids to be concerned.  If we can agree this as a reliable source it might then be possible to make more progress on whether the kids actually are right, and or have a right, to be concerned.The clue to where their bias lies is in the name #statutory Committee for Climate Change# not climate science or climate research but climate#change#I have never claimed the children have no right to feel concerned, just that school strikes are a pointless, stupid action endorsed but fools and the politically motivated, that is my opinion no more no less..."},{"url":null,"title":"amaryllis takes top prize at shetland race first leg reception ","story":"The prizes for the Bergen to Lerwick leg of the Pantaenius Shetland Race were handed out at a civic reception at Mareel on Friday evening..

But now he’s keen to get together with the band of Ballymena lads he joined up all those years ago. This week Ronnie tells his story and hopes that he can link up with his old buddies for a good chinwag back in Ballymena.ON August , , I, along with five other Ballymena lads, joined the East Anglian Regiment which later became the Royal Anglian Regiment.The other boys were Stanley Campbell, Ivan Campbell , Sean McInally, Jim McFarland and Davy Conway. We chose the Anglians because of the good reports we’d received from Sean’s brother, Hughie, who’d already passed through his training.He told us they were a ‘good mob’ and that was recommendation enough!After a period of intense training, we were posted to Aden, a British Protectorate in South Arabia, where the British army was engaged in a long-running counter-insurgency operation against rebels who aimed to overthrow the pro-British local government.On arrival at RAF Khermaksar we immediately knew that our tour was going to be defined by extremes of heat. We got off the plane wearing shirts and ties and it wasn’t long until they were off!Having joined our platoons we were assigned ot ious duties which consisted of observation patrols, counter-insurgency operations or simply mounting guard on public buldings or military premises. Every night there was a curfew in Crater, the main town which sat in the middle of an extinct volcano. It was during the hours of darkness that the rebels would be most active so we basically had to detain anyone who was out in the streets without military permission after pm.I remember taking them down to the barbed wire enclosures at the police station.In , attacks on ourselves were made mostly with hand grenades or rocket launchers. More often than not, all they achieved was a lot of noise and dust but one such attack stands out in my memory. We were in Sheik Othman, a little desert town, when the police station came under attack from rebels armed with RPGs. One of our boys, the radio operator, Pte. Jenner Elba Porter was very badly injured. Despite his wounds, he stayed on the communications net and summoned help. He received the MBE for bravery.The first time I came under direct fire was ‘up country’ near the Yemeni border which was real bandit territory ... a change of underwear was very much in order that day!N.I. taxi driver is smashed in face with gun and robbed - man arrested after burger van break-in Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BALL | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BALL | Article Teaser\"One of the duties we were tasked with was security detail at Fort Morbitt which housed captured insurgents who were being interrogated by the SIB.. the army intelligence unit.

He said it was his governments view it was not the right time for a poll - or to be calling for such a vote.The ambassador pointed out a border poll was provided for in the Good Friday Agreement andthe Secretary of State thought it would result in a vote for unication it would be an \"entirely legitimate exercise for whenever that would occur\".\"The view of the Irish government is that now is not the time to be pressing for or campaigning for such a border poll,\" he said.The SDLP has said a border poll should happen but after Brexit has been settled.Sinn Fein president Mary Lou McDonald once said a border poll should not be held during the Brexit uncertainty. In August  she said she would prefer not to hold a border poll in the context of a “crash or very hard Brexit”, arguing it would be the wrong “climate” for such a debate.However, she later insisted her party wanted a poll \"as soon as possible\" and it has called for a poll on a number of occasions since.Ambassador ONeill said the view of his government was that finding agreement with Brexit should not be \"conflated\" with the constitutional position of Northern Ireland.Irish Ambassador to the UK Adrian O’Neill says an Irish border poll would degrade the prospects of finding a way through on Brexit#WeekinWestminster[tap to expand] pic uOyfFiCU— BBC PoliticsJuly , Irish Ambassador to the UK Adrian O’Neill says any attempts to blame Ireland for the impact of a no-deal Brexit would not be credible#WeekinWestminster[tap to expand] pic wEmPpAq— BBC PoliticsJuly , \"We think that would actually only perhaps degrade the prospects of finding a way through on Brexit, and perhaps also inhibit our chances of getting the devolved institutions of Northern Ireland back up and running,\" he told the BBC.\"That is the priority of the government - getting those devolved institutions up and running and we are really hopeful we can make a break through there.\"Read More, Northern Ireland jobs at risk in no-deal Brexit, say Stormont officialsMr ONeill said a no-deal Brexit was a \"signicant risk\" which they had to prepare for it.

Which by definition made it dficult to actually find a solution to avoiding a hard border.“And it was the British parliament that has declined to approve the agreement that was negotiated by the British Government with the European Union.“Soyou take all of those three circumstances together, it seems to be a rather odd conclusion that it’s the EU that’s to blame.”"},{"url":null,"title":"michael gove tipped for northern ireland job promotion","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsThe TwelfthThe OpenNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

We need to take it more seriously and that can’t come fast enough.”The EPA report found that the levels of nitrogen dioxide in the air in Dublin represents a possible public health risk and may be exceeding the annual limits deemed safe by the European Union.Ms Hourigan said the group will continue to hold protests until measures to combat air pollution are introduced.Urgent action is required...

Parliament  be updated Mon— Jeremy HuntJuly , On Saturday, Mr Hunt said Iran’s actions raised “very serious questions” about the security of British and international shipping in the Strait of Hormuz.The Foreign Secretary told reporters inside the Foreign and Commonwealth Office that, having spoken to his Iranian counterpart Mohammad Javad Zar, Tehran saw the situation as a “tit for tat” following the detention of Grace  in Gibraltar.“Nothing could be further from the truth,” he said.Mr Hunt said MPs would be updated about what “further measures” the Government will take on Monday, adding that the threat level had been raised to three.“Our priority continues to be to find a way to de-escalate the situation.“That’s why I reached out to the Iranian foreign minister, that’s why due process in Gibraltar continues.“We need to see due process happening in Iran as well, we need to see the illegal seizing of a British flagged vessel reversed, we need that ship released, and we continue to be very concerned about the safety and welfare of the  crew members.”The Foreign Office earlier summoned the Iranian charge d’affaires, Mohsen Omidzamani, following the incident.Iran has directly linked the seizure of the vessel with Britain’s role in detaining a tanker carrying Iranian oil earlier this month.A spokesman for Iran’sCouncil was quoted as saying “the rule of reciprocal action is well known in international law” and that Tehran made the right decision in the face of an “illegitimate economic war and seizure of oil tankers”.The explanation, which contrasts with a suggestion on Friday night that the Stena Impero was “violating international maritime rules” and had collided with a fishing boat, came as the UK Government warned British ships to stay away from the Strait of Hormuz.HMS Montrose, which is patrolling the Persian Gulf to protect shipping, and earlier this month intercepted Iranian patrol boats surrounding another UK-flagged tanker, reportedly arrived minutes too late to prevent the latest incident.A second oil tanker, the Liberian-flagged Mesdar, which is managed by Norbulk Shipping UK, veered off course towards the Iranian coast after it was boarded by armed guards at about .pm on Friday.Communication with the ship was later re-established and the crew were unharmed. The tanker was reportedly allowed to resume navigation.France and Germany joined condemnation of Iran’s actions, which have triggered concerns that it will lead to further oil price hikes amid heightened tensions in the Gulf involving Iran, the US and UK."},{"url":null,"title":"it happened on this day","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsThe TwelfthThe OpenNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Mr Hammond was a permanent fixture in David Cameron’s shadow frontbench team and Cabinet throughout his time as leader, but was rarely mentioned as a possible successor – and that was probably the way he liked it. Nor when Mrs May announced her intention to stand down did Mr Hammond’s name enter the fray.The Treasury had always been his goal, and he is understood to have been disappointed to miss out on the number two job there in  when the necessities of coalition gave the Liberal Democrats the Chief Secretary’s post – a role he had shadowed for three years in opposition. “I’m going to resign” The

for Transport, he was swtly moved on to Defence in the aftermath of the exit of Liam Fox amid a public furore over his special adviser.With a reputation forged in the shadow Treasury team as the

hailed by Eurosceptics, who detected signs of a fellow spirit in comments which appeared to suggest he was ready to contemplate withdrawal from the EUthe Government was unable to negotiate a better deal.But when the referendum came, he remained true to his practice of never rocking the boat, loyally backing Mr Cameron’s renegotiation and backing the Remain side during the campaign.After the result came in, Mr Hammond, , did not demur from Mrs May’s insistence that “Brexit means Brexit” – but left little doubt that he thought voters had handed the new Prime Minister a thankless task, warning that the process of leaving the EU could take six years.As foreign secretary, he played a key role in the  agreement for Iran to give up its military nuclear ambitions.And he was the minister who tabled the fateful European Union Referendum Bill in the House of Commons.But as Mrs May embarked on her mission to secure an agreement, Mr Hammond repeatedly warned against a no-deal Brexit, and ultimately said he would resign because he could not serve under a Boris Johnson government pursuing such an outcome. \" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Philip Hammond at the State Banquet at

At one stage, it was expected to be introduced in  but had to be pushed back until .In  then Roads Minister Danny Kennedy gave assurances that, “in the absence of signicant objections”, the scheme would be in place no later than Spring .However, this week, after a consultation ended last April and a further information session was held in November, a spokesperson for the Department explained that the proposed Rossville Street Residents’ parking scheme received a large number of objections from the residents.Of the  responses received, there were  objections to the scheme.It would be the first such scheme for the City and involves over  residential properties mainly in the Rossville Street, Fahan Street, Little Diamond, Creggan Street and Chamberlain Street areas.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh"},{"url":null,"title":"derry city cemetery series minister revitalised burt presbyterian church","story":"Robert William Ross was born in Co Cavan in  and upon completion of his training in the Presbyterian Church he was made a licentiate of the Derry Presbytery in  and was ordained at Burt on Christmas Eve .Reverend Ross’ immediate challenge was to oversee the much needed repairs to the church building. The Committee then asked architect William Barker to estimate the cost of the renovations to the old building as well as the cost of a plain new place of worship.Mr Barker’s financial quote for the construction project said that the revamp of the old church would cost £ and a new church would be £,. To put the overall estimate into perspective, today the combined  figure of just over £, would be worth over £,.The records of Burt Presbyterian Church show that a Committee meeting on February ,  it was decided upon the casting vote of Rev Ross to abandon the renovation scheme and the idea of building a new church was then put before the congregation at a meeting on February , .The go-ahead for the new building was dependent upon the congregation subscribing an additional £ more than they had already promised. When that was agreed by the congregation, plans to construct the new church were given the green light for the year .Financial pressure on the project was immediately eased when Lord Templemore subscribed the entire £, but further collections were made in Derry, Newtoncunningham, Crossroads, Raphoe, Strabane, St Johnston and Carrigans, Knowhead, Fahan and Inch.Rev Ross himself reported back that he had gathered another £ in Belfast and Lisburn.With the money in place, William Barker was tasked to prepare plans for a meeting house that could accommodate  people, to have a plain roof, double windows, buttressed walls finished with cement dashing and windows with cement plaster. The church pews were to be pitch pine with walnut top rails.The location of the new church, it was decided, was to be in the upper corner of the ground filled by the old building with the entrance door facing the present gateway in line with the entrance of the old meeting house. Two Porrett stoves sunk in each aisle were to provide the heating.The lineage of Presbyterianism in Burt is one that stretches back over three-and-half centuries. But, as the city of Derry began to grow after the Plantation of Ulster, the Presbyterians of Burt travelled there. In the city at this time, Episcopacy, or the governance of the church by a clerical hierarchy was established by law. But, services were conducted at St Columb’s Cathedral and St Augustine’s Church on the walls to suit the views of Presbyterians.Back in , a Presbyterian minister in Derry was deposed for failing to conform to the views of the Episcopacy and another  fled from the city to avoid being imprisoned.By , the Presbyterian Congregation in Derry was still languishing when attempts were begun to bring preachers over from Scotland.As evidence of the persecution of those of the Presbyterian tradition, a William Hampton, who had been brought into the city by Presbyterians such as Campsie, Burnside and Early was implicated for preaching at a large meeting house which they had built within the city’s walls and just a few yards away from the mansion of the established church’s Bishop.This ‘affront’ to the Anglican tradition could no longer apparently be tolerated by the church authorities.On Sunday, September , , the Bishop decided to take action and with the Mayor, a judge, the city’s Sherrf and other officers they visited the meeting house where they found the Presbyterian congregation praying with William Hampton.It was recorded that they were: “Praying and preaching openly, and not according to the established Liturgy and order of the Church of Ireland.”A “riotous” confrontation took place, the leaders arrested and the church was promptly shut down. This situation continued until August ,  when devoid of anyone to lead them in prayer, the Derry Presbyterians asked for Hampton’s services until another preacher could be appointed.In , Rev Robert Rule of Kirkcaldy in Scotland accepted a call to minister in Derry and was installed that year.Some  years before Rev Ross set foot in Burt and application was made to the Presbytery of Laggan by an Alderman of Derry, John Craigie and a merchant, Mr John Fisher together with William Cunningham of Burt to ide the Parish of Templemore into two congregations. This came about in  and the previously pilloried Rev William Hampton ed from Scotland and was ordained at Carnamaddy on October  that year.Another  odd years later, there was a dispute over parish boundaries within the Presbytery of Derry when in  the people of Elagh, Coshquin and Ballynagalliagh refused to belong to Derry. But, it took until January , for the Synod to order “that the liberties of the City on that side of the water wherein the City standeth should be the bounds of the Congregation.”It seems the Burt people weren’t happy with that decision and appealed it, but without success.Another point of interest about Presbyterianism in Burt is that in  the worshippers from Inch who had attended Burt since  formed their own congregation under the Derry Presbytery. The mode of transport to Burt from Inch Island had always been boats. It’s said that on Sunday’s someone sat at a window in the Gallery of Burt church watching the tide and when it was just right, the person stood up and announced that ‘the Inch folk may go now.’During the -year ministry of Rev Robert Graythe old church had fallen into a state of disrepair. There were no pews and the aisles were covered by cold flagstones. But, previous to that there was only an earthen floor and no heating at all.In , the church had a new roof and ceiling installed. Prior to that it was recorded that it was a common thing for the rain to pour down on the heads of the congregation.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshNevertheless, the Presbyterian denomination in the district was flourishing. In , the Parish of Burt had , Presbyterians,  people belonging to the Church of Ireland and , Catholics.When it came time to finalise the plans for the new church under the watch of Rev Ross in , the final estimate of William Barker was £, and tenders for the construction project were advertised on April .Three bids were received. One came from R Colhoun in Derry who bid £, for the church and £ for its boundary wall. Another came from Joseph Colhoun, also from Derry who bid £, for the church and £ for the boundary wall. The final tender came from Matthew McClelland from the city who tendered £, for the church and £ for the wall, who having made the lowest bid won the contract.It was agreed that contractor was bound to have the house roofed, the outside of the walls finished and the windows installed by September ,  and ready for opening by March , .In the presence of shirt industry magnate, William Tillie, the High Sherrf of County Derry and many members of the congregation and people from the surrounding area, the foundation stone was laid on July , .The builder, Joseph Colhoun presented Mr Tillie with an inscribed silver trowel to lay the stone and a sealed bottle acted as a time capsule which inside were placed copies of the Derry Standard, the Derry Journal, Londonderry Sentinel, Northern Whig, Missionary Herald, Christian Banner, a photo of the old church and some coins. Lunch was provided for the dignitaries in the lecture room which was highly decorated with flowers and plants.The contract deadline was narrowly missed and the church opened in early May, .The opening services on Sunday, May ,  were conducted by the then Moderator of the General Assembly, Rev Dr G Buick from Cullybackey and the following week by Rev William Colquhoun of Fitzroy Avenue, Belfast. The minister’s room and toilet in the church as well as the pulpit and choir  were provided as gts by Mrs JB Mullin of Buncrana who was the sister of Rev Ross and the we of John Brice Mullin the Deputy Lieutenant of County Donegal.Fundraising events for the upkeep of the church were however still of course necessary. In , it was reported that Rev Ross organised a very successful Sale of Work and Summer Fete which were held on July ,  and  that year.The events took place in the Lecture Hall and a marquee in the church grounds and began at .pm each day. The proceedings were opened on July  by Mrs McMaster of College Avenue in Derry and the Mayor of Derry, Alderman JP Thompson oversaw the events.There was an Empire Work Stall, a Shamrock Work Stall, a Provision stall, a Sweet Stall, a Children’s Stall and Refreshment Stall. The Amusement Committee organised a large number of competitions that included shooting events. On the nights of the  and  July, a iety concert took place in the Lecture Hall. Over the three days, a firm called Neely’s operated a sidecar service ferrying people from Bridgend Railyway Station to the church and back again. The combined rail and admission ticket cost d and a specially laid on train took people back to Derry from Bridgend each night at .pm.The funds raised in July,  helped to renovate the Lecture Hall and other church buildings and to properly lay out the church grounds.As with many other congregations of all denominations across Ireland, the First World War impacted upon Burt Presbyterian Church. To reflect this, in August of  the Church Committee proposed to obtain an organ and a Memorial Tablet at the entrance of the church.Three of the congregation, John Buchanan, Stewart Buchanan and Joseph Downey were killed between -. And, in October  it was reported that £ had been collected for the organ and the memorial. The tablet was unveiled on Sunday, January ,  by Mrs Bowen, we of Colonel William Bowen DSO and the preacher on this occasion was Captain Rev WP Hall and a Guard of Honour travelled to Burt from Ebrington Barracks in Derry for the event. The tablet also remembered  more men and women from Burt congregation who had served in WWI.After the Great War and the partition of Ireland in , many of the working-class families connected to Burt Church moved into Derry city and other part of the North and many more who had served in the war had not ed to the area as work was scarce in this era. The drop in numbers within the congregation was reflected by the names recorded in the Communion Roll Book between -.Rev R W Ross resigned from active duty as Minister of Burt Presbyterian Church on July ,  and he died aged  at the City and County Infirmary in Derry on Sunday, July  after a long illness. The Church Session and Committee met later that day and paid tribute to the long and diligent service that had he had given.A deputation from the church was due to travel to Belfast the next day to meet with the Presbyterian Union Commission and they went ahead with the plans despite Mr Ross’ death as there would not an opportunity for another meeting for at least another two months.The Union Commission was proposing that Burt and Netwoncunningham congregations should be amalgamated under one minister, but the Session and Committee of Burt flatly rejected the suggestion.In June of  the Committee looked at the issue of enquiring at the price of a memorial for the late Rev Ross and a stained glass window and in February of  a Mr Haslett submitted sketches for a memorial tablet and his proposals were accepted. The memorial tablet was unveiled by Rev Ross’ widow Bessie on Sunday, June , .Rev Robert William Ross had married Bessie in  and in his will left a total of £ s d. He was buried in Derry City Cemetery.Upon her husband’s passing Bessie lived firstly at Castlehill Road, Belfast and later at Bognor Regis and then Pallant, Chichester. Following her death on July ,  she was buried there. Bessie bequeathed a total of £, s d to her two sons, Leslie Norman Ross and Arthur Gordon Ross, who were both doctors.A third son, George Harold Ross was born on May ,  in Derry. George was educated at Campbell College in Belfast and began a career in banking after emigrating. He enlisted in the th Canadian Battalion at the rank of Liuetenant on November ,  and later transferred to the th Canadian Battalion.  He saw action at the Somme in July,  and in April,  at Vimy Ridge where he was wounded and suffered injuries to his left femur and left foot. He was demobilised in July,  and ed to Canada where he became a farmer.CAPTION: The Reverend Robert William Ross."},{"url":null,"title":"derry university group says opportunity lifetime north west must seized","story":"The Derry University Group say that civic society has a responsibility to future generations to seize this opportunity to build a new, dedicated university in the North West.A spokesperson for the group told the Derry News: “This is the opportunity of a letime.

We have an opportunity here to create a legacy that will endure for centuries.”The spokesperson added that the North West must immediately begin revising its current ‘tenuous’ development plans so as to accommodate a new university.“It is a matter of great concern that so much of this region’s future planning centres on promises made by Ulster University, an institution controlled in Belfast and Coleraine, which has consistently failed Derry and northwest Ireland – and has broken promise after promise to this city - over the past six decades.“As regards the long-term planning of the region, it is not acceptable that we do build and deliver our own alternative. Derry and the North West have the capability, the determination and the vision to deliver a better future for ourselves.“It is reckless and perilous to remain entirely dependent on outside institutions that will always, by necessity, serve their own interests and those of their friends first. Why should we continue to acquiesce to those who have failed us, misled us and ultimately alienated us over six dferent decades ”The spokesperson added that a new Derry-centred institution, with a cross-border element under the auspices of the National University of Ireland, could help militate against the impact of Brexit.“Derry Strabane Council needs, as its first priority, to re-draft its City Deal to ensure that it can include a new independent university as its new anchor partner.“Council also needs to engage pro-actively with the Dublin and London governments to enact supporting legislation, and to secure resources, funding other support and accreditation for this new dedicated institution for the North West.“The positive momentum is there.

The committee was headed by Lockwood, who was an English academic. He produced a report on a second university for Northern Ireland he recommended not Londonderry but Coleraine.“Runner-up to Coleraine was the city of Armagh. It was not a sectarian decision it was made by an impartial English academic. It is slanderous to suggest that he was sectarian.”However, alluding to successive decades of underinvestment Mr Adonis yesterday told the Derry News: “No matter what the motives behind these decisions were, the result is that Derry has unfairly lost out and its young people deserve better.“The past should not govern the future. Yet the situation is getting worse not better.”Figures gathered by the Derry News under Freedom of Information legislation, and published last month, show that student numbers in the city actually fell from , in   to , in  .This comes at the same time UU created a new and much larger campus in Belfast city centre at a cost of £-m. The university has attributed a reduction in student numbers and “expansion challenges” in Derry to higher education budget cuts.At Monday’s debate, Baroness OLoan defended Ulster University’s position insisting that the building infrastructure at Jordanstown was not capable of being sustained leaving it with no option but to relocate.UU’s decisionWhile, Lord Empey, a former leader of the UUP, and Minister responsible for further and higher education who dealt with Ulster University at somesaid he supported the proposition of a medical school in Derry.However, he added that the decision of where to invest was down to the university alone and UU “made very clear to us what it wanted to do. It said: we want to rebuild our Jordanstown campus and put it in the centre of Belfast. Will you support us or not “It was not a question of Londonderry versus Belfast—that option was not open. It had made its decision.”Meaningful change can be brought about as a result of this report which, Mr Adonis says, is a signicant first step towards increasing student numbers in Northern Ireland and the establishment of a new university with its principal campus in Derry - \"I hope action will follow,” he added.“It is realistic to believe that Derry can have a standalone university since it is the norm for cities the size of Derry across the UK to have universities of their own. Derry is unusual only in being so acutely disadvantaged. It is scandalous that this issue was not addressed years ago.”Askedhe will continue to advocate on Derry’s behalf, he added: “Absolutely! I will follow the government’s report in September closely and continue to push for Derry to have a university with its principal campus in the city.

But, that short daily journey must have taken as least twice as long as it would have taken anyone  simply because almost everyone he passed knew him, stopped him and engaged in conversation with him.On the th anniversary of the school’s opening in  I was asked to help compile a book to mark the occasion. When I sat down to write a list of those who would have to be interviewed, John Dunne was the first name on the top of the pile.When I started to transcribe John’s interview it began like this: “In this era of media created ‘stars’, famous for nothing more than seeking fame-or infamy, in many cases-the tag of legend is one that is all too easily doled out.“Most people in their formative years can point to a mentor who influenced them greatly and provided knowledge and encouragement when these vital commodities were often all too scarce. More often than not, these people are unassuming and go about their lives in the same manner.“These people are society’s real legends and in the history of St Joseph’s, fewany, earned that accolade more than John Dunne.”That chapter of the book on St Joseph’s was entitled ‘One of nature’s gentlemen’, and there’s absolutely no reason to change that title for the purposes of this appreciation of John Dunne’s le because in my opinion its accuracy cannot be upgraded in any way.‘Big John’ as he was affectionately known to all former pupils of the school, made a positive mark on thousands of young lives in his four decades at St Joseph’s. It would be hard to find anyone that would disagree that the word big when applied to John Dunne not only represented his physical stature but also his intelligence and patience.By , the Dunne family had lived at Brandywell Road, Burnfoot and then back to Derry and more specically the newly developing Creggan estate.John Dunne began his career at St Columb’s College in  in the company of contemporaries such as Nobel laureates John Hume, Seamus Heaney.In  he told me: “I enjoyed the time at St Columb’s without really realising or wondering what le was about. There were people then who went back up to the College at six o’clock and studied until nine o’clock.“But, I and another man, Bill Smyth, who also ended up teaching at St Joseph’s, instead of going to the school, followed a great interest we had discovered-greyhounds. That was our main pursuit. Strangely, we both also ended up training as teachers at St Joseph’s College in Belfast which was linked to Queen’s University but separate in that it awarded its own accreditation.”It was at training college that John Dunne encountered a dilemma. Already well-known for his ability as a footballer, his lelong passion, he had to make the choice of whether he would pursue as a career as PE teacher.“I had distinct limitations, because when I was very young, I nearly died twice. When I was six months old and again when I was five, I caught pneumonia. I remember the second time and having to lie from about December to April before I came around.“I was in a sort of comatose state for a long time, but my mother God rest her, battled away and I survived. But, it left me severely limited in terms of stamina. In terms of pace, I was very quick off the mark, but I couldn’t sustain it. And, the further up you went in football, the more of a problem it became. I loved reserve football, but the full senior game was just too fast for me,” he said.In September  John began his teaching career at the newly opened St Joseph’s Secondary School in Creggan for the princely sum of £ per month. It was here that he spent the entire span of his professional le.The new school with its emphasis educating those who had not successfully navigated the old  plus exam, it was a ready-made home for John Dunne and many of his contemporaries alike. Like many of his era, John benefitted from easier access to grammar school system because of post-war changes to British education policy. But, also like many of his generation, John spoke candidly about his reservations on it. His words also revealed why he preferred the non-selective route through school.“The thing about going to St Columb’s is that we weren’t completely accepted. We were dferent somehow. The boarders who stayed there were the ‘real’ St Columb’s boys as far as the clergy were concerned.“There are things now that are still etched in my memory. Where I lived, there was a protest after a child lost a leg having been hit by a bus. The people were worried about the safety of their children so they weren’t prepared to let the bus keep travelling that route.“Anyhow, the protest could be seen from the College. A priest, who shall remain nameless said, ‘well, what would you expect from people like that ’“We took great umbrage at that. I had been through a kind of elitist system at St Columb’s, where you had to prove yourself in the first place by getting so many marks in an  plus exam, in English and Maths-and they weren’t easy. They were quite dficult examinations. I went to the Christian Brothers at they drilled us kept us on in the afternoon for an hour, got us up on Saturday mornings and drilled us and drilled us.“When I went to teach in a secondary school it was very dferent. You had children there that for one reason or another had fallen through the system. They hadn’t perhaps done themselves justice in the system that surrounded them. In my time at St Joseph’s there were children who should not have been there because they could not get anything out of the system at all, no matter how much we tried or how much sympathy we had for their position. But we did try.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh“I had been through a system where I met good teachers, people who had made a good impact on my le. So, what I did when I saw what they were doing was imitate them. I wove all the goodness in other people into a fabric that I could use myself, and I found that it worked,” said John.At the end of John Dunne’s first decade as a teacher, the Troubles erupted on the streets of his native city. St Joseph’s geographical location meant that major disturbances often encroached upon the school itself. It befell people like John Dunne to provide a calm backdrop to the mayhem outside the gates of St Joseph’s.In  he said: “It was a very, very strange environment to be working in, because all hell could have broken loose in the immediate vicinity of the school at any time. There were teachers out on the streets, acting as buffers, trying tom keep a lid on things.“In practical terms, I found it very hard because in summer time it was very hot and you had to open the windows to let a bit of air in. But, there were helicopters flying about and the noise was unbearable and the youngsters couldn’t hear you. A lot of young people became involved and some of them lost their lives as a consequence.”Apart from a very quick but understated wit, John Dunne was blessed with a fantastic voice, full of dramatic intonation, that would have been the envy of many stage actors.As a teacher of the English language John had the ability the bring the most boring text to le and kept his students enthralled. He could have been reading the contents of the back of a cereal box aloud, but when he spoke people listened.The ability to relate a story, complete with an array of accents when required, was one that he credited his grandfather John Downey with.“He was a great storyteller. I remember as a young boy he used to take me early in the morning for his pension. We used to go to Mass about seven or eight o’clock and then go to the train station on the Strand Road and out to Bridgend for his pension and then visit people in the area.“But when we were walking, he always told me stories about haunted houses, about what kind of flowers were at the side of the road.“There seemed to be no end to his knowledge and then he could deviate and tell me another yarn. I just thrived on his stories.“I think also it was the way I was taught at the Christian Brothers. They were very precise about language. It’s become too loose now. People are very loose, especially when using mobile phones.“I’ve even read about the use of the apostrophe being lost. I was taught these things were important when you wrote something. I stuck to it and I tried to instil it into youngsters without being overly heavy about it.”John Dunne’s dulcet tones were employed again when Derry City FC re-entered senior football in  and for many years after he commentated on many of the games played by his beloved Candystripes.This interview with John Dunne was conducted in  at Pilot’s Row community centre. At this stage he had been retired from teaching for almost two decades. But, the huge capacity that he had to retain swathes of information was still very much evident.Asto prove that very thing, in the later stages of this conversation a young boy, no more than ten or eleven years old walked past and said cheerily, ‘hello John!’Without blinking an eye, John Dunne recounted the boy’s family history and how many of his relatives attended St Joseph’s. That was proof that you could take the man away from St Joe’s, but not St Joe’s away from the man.The interview with John Dunne ended with him speaking about the five decades since the school opened.He said: “It’s been some fty years, especially for somebody like me who has finished up living in the Bogside. When I got here, I was a little bit apprehensive about being someone who worked in St Joseph’s and being accepted into the local community. But, it’s no bother. I am on first name terms with people.“I was walking over to Mailey’s pub one night in the summer about .. It was a beautul night. There was a group of young men sitting in a garden. I was walking in the middle of the road and one of them came out and addressed me by my name.“He said, ‘John, there are not many teachers that could do what you are doing and walked through this area untouched.“That’s good to know I said.”CAPTION: The late John Dunne."},{"url":"https://img.resized.co/derrynow/eyJkYXRhIjoie1widXJsXCI6XCJodHRwczpcXFwvXFxcL3MzLWV1LXdlc3QtMS5hbWF6b25hd3MuY29tXFxcL3N0b3JhZ2UucHVibGlzaGVycGx1cy5pZVxcXC9tZWRpYS5yaXZlcm1lZGlhLmllXFxcL3VwbG9hZHNcXFwvMjAxOVxcXC8wN1xcXC8xOTE1NTE1N1xcXC9PZmZsZWFkLTEtcGljLTEwMjR4NzY4LnBuZ1wiLFwid2lkdGhcIjo2NDcsXCJoZWlnaHRcIjozNDAsXCJkZWZhdWx0XCI6XCJodHRwczpcXFwvXFxcL2NhY2hlLnJlc2l6ZWQuY29cXFwvbm8taW1hZ2UucG5nXCIsXCJvcHRpb25zXCI6W119IiwiaGFzaCI6IjMyN2UwOTU4ZjdmMDJhNzUzYmRkMDJmYWZiY2ZiZTRjNDY2ZjhmZjUifQ==/offlead-1-pic-1024x768.png","title":"rare breed star cahir launches annual agricultural show","story":"A young boy from Dungiven has helped to launch this weekend’s Co Londonderry and Limavady Agricultural Show.Young Cahir McGilligan, who found fame on the recent series of UTV’s Rare Breed, was on hand to launch the show which takes place tomorrow, Saturday, July .Avid farmer Cahir was delighted to be able to help out and is looking forward to participating himself.The annual show, which will be held at Aghanloo, Limavady, will see a number of events taking place throughout the day.These include horse and pony showing and jumping working hunter classes.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshLivestock showingand a fencing competition will also take place.Other attractions include home industries, crafts, vegetables and flowers, fun and games and numerous trade stands and young farmers tug of war.Updates can be found on their Facebook page.Cahir McGilligan is pictured above with the Chairman Mr Alwyn McFarlane and Mr Stanley Warnock who want to encourage everyone to attend the show for a great family day out.  "},{"url":null,"title":"springtown camp monument officially unveiled next month","story":"A monument commemorating the Springtown Camp in Derry will be officially unveiled next month at a ceremony near the entrance to the former site it has been announced.The unveiling will take place on Thursday, August  adjacent to the North West Regional College Training Centre at  noon and will be followed by a Civic reception at the Guildhall at pm.The art installation will take the form of a Nissan hut in which the inhabitants of the camp were forced to live in deplorable conditions because of a policy of housing discrimination in operation at the time against the Catholic community.Springtown Camp was originally a Second World War United States military installation which was vacated after the end of the conflict in the mid-s. Over  families once inhabited Springtown Camp and occupied it around  because of over-crowded living conditions in Derry.The decision to squat in the former military huts, despite the fact there was no electricity, running water or means of heating, came after many families evaluated that these conditions were actually better than they were enduring.The camp became a focal point of the early civil rights agitation in Derry.Willie Deery, who grew up in the camp, said: “This monument is vital because the camp symbolises the precursor to the civil rights marches.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh“It’s also somewhat ironic because  years after our mother’s were evicted from the Guildhall for protesting against the conditions at the camp there will now be a civic reception for us there.“This will be a recognition for our parents who had to raise their children in shocking circumstances. It will be an emotional day for us all. It’s not just about me, there were many hundreds of families with stories to tell but maybe I told mine a bit more forcefully.”In the coming days a crane will lt the one-third scale replica of a Nissan hut into place which were originally constructed out of iron welded together and covered in corrugated tin sheets.In , over  residents from the camp marched on the city’s Guildhall to lodge their complaints about their living conditions with the leaders of the old Londonderry Corporation as part of a long running battle with the former local authority.Willie Deery continued: “There is a famous Derry Journal photograph from November  when women from the camp marched on the Guildhall in protest after a fire. The mother’s in that picture are all gone but we are going to recreate that photo with their daughter’s standing in the same formation as the original picture.”CAPTION: An artists impression of what the monument to Springtown camp will look like after its installed."},{"url":null,"title":"statistics reveal missed targets department concedes ambulance service currently resourced","story":"The department of health has conceded that the current level of demand on the ambulance service exceeds available resources.The ambulance service has been dealing with a surge in emergency calls over recent years.Newly published Department of Healthstatistics reveal that between   and  , the number of emergency calls received by the NIAS increased by , from , to ,.In   the Western Local Commissioning Groupalone, which takes in Derry, received , calls – almost  a day.Aside from the Belfast LCG, the ambulance service in the Western area received the highest number of calls in the past year based on per ,-population.Category A calls are immediately le threatening and receive the NIAS’s highest priority with a performance target of arriving at .% of these calls within  minutes.During the last five years in NI, the percentage of Category A calls responded to within  minutesdecreased from .% in   to .% in  In   all LCGs fell well below this target, with the Western Trust the second-best performer at just .%.From December  to March  the performance across Northern Ireland has deteriorated. Most LCGs recorded percentages below  while the Western Trust consistently registered a score below % during that period, something that hadnt happened in the eight months prior.Category B are serious but not le-threatening calls and require a response within  minutes and category C calls are neither le threatening or serious and require a response within  minutes.Over the past year % of journeys in the Western area were deemed emergencies while the rest were non-emergencies.‘Competing priorities’In response to claims that the ambulance cover in Derry is insufficient and the service in general is facing serious funding pressures, the department of health said it looks to the NIAS to ensure that sufficient ambulance cover is provided throughout NI.A spokeswoman explained: \"The Department recognises that demand for ambulance services is currently outstripping the available resources.\"We are currently considering the outcome of a public consultation by NIAS on a new clinical response model whichintroduced will ensure that that the most ill patients requiring an ambulance will be seen quickly as well as improving the overall efficiency of response times.”She continued: \"This new service model will require signicant investment which will have to be found within the Department’s budget against other competing priorities for investment in health and social care services.\"Ahead of decisions to be taken on the new service model later this year the Department has committed to putting more paramedics on the ground and is funding  training places from its transformation fund.\"googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh"},{"url":null,"title":"sunrise sunset powys county times camera club members","story":"They#re still hungry, records Martin Jones.\" Sunrise to sunset... out and aboutGrasses on the Dyfnant Rainbow Walks at Llangadfan from Toni Mannell.\" Sunrise to sunset... out and aboutHoping for some food...

He crossed the finish line in ., in sixth place overall, but first U-, a real eye-catching performance out of  finishersMeanwhile, Dee was not letting the side down as he again proved best in his age group, clocking yet another sub  time, his clocking of . was also good enough for overall seventh out of the  finishers.Ford kNewcastle was the venue for a nearer home race on Friday night and several East Down men and women took advantage of the opportunity to warm up for the action in Delamont the next day.Gordy Graham took third place overall in . a mere  seconds behind winner, Newcastlersquos David OrsquoFlaherty, while Catherine OrsquoConnor was second female in . to Gordyrsquos cousin, Laura Graham, who won in ..

It was great to see also that several relative newcomers to the club, Gillian and Gerard Grant, Donal Smith, Michael Morrissey and Alison Graham are happy to get involved with some of the older hands and the younger ones to enjoy the delights that a team relay can bring.Performances of the day have to be shared by Gavin Hynds whose third leg run for the EDAC male B team, which effectively hauled them up from last place to th.His time of . for the leg was only bettered by runners from the top two teams on the day, and by Neil Curran, the anchor leg runner for the EDAC A team.His final leg of . only put paid to the battling St Peterrsquos AC quintet during the final lap. The Lurgan team, which had held the lead from the start were understandably disappointed, but the EDAC squad deserved their win.Track and fieldOn to Sunday and it was our juvenile members who had to make the long journey to Tullamore in Co Offally to take part in the All Ireland T F Championships.Spread over two weekends, it therefore means that, for some, there are two journeys to the heart of Ireland on consecutive weekends.Thank you to all the parents for driving all these miles. Your efforts are greatly appreciated by everyone in the club and especially by the athletes themselvesNevertheless, it proved a great day at Tullamore at the first of three days of action with the sun shining for a nice change.East Down had four athletes taking part all in the m, but in two dferent age groups. In the U- race Anna Gardiner and Lucy Foster both ran in separate heats with both finishing in sixth position.The top three in each heat qualied automatically for the final later in the day along with the fastest two finishers outside the top six.Unfortunately, both EDAC girls missed out on qualication, but they ran super races with Lucy gaining a PB of .. and Anna running ...Lauren Madine and Kirsti Foster both competed in the U- race with both winning their heats and automatically qualying for the final later in the day.A last minute change of time table meant the final was brought forward by an hour so that meant quick warm-ups and back on the track was not the ideal preparation that would normally take place before an All-Ireland final.Nonetheless, the two girls put their minds to it and gave it their best shot. Having two out of eight from one club in an All-Ireland final is an achievement in itself.Kirsti came fourth overall in .., just missing a medal by tenths of a second. Lauren had to settle for seventh in . as she was hampered by ankle issues which had developed after her heat.Well done to all four for their efforts.

Ballynahinch is used as a gateway by visitors to Newcastle and the wider Mournes area in particular and we need to see work on the bypass starting as soon as possible, he said.Cllr Walker argued that the current congestion is hampering new retail and commercial investment in Ballynahinch and believes the provision of the new bypass represents a ldquowin win for everyone..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Down close in on last four  ","story":"DOWN camogs took another step towards qualication for the semi-finals when they blitzed Carlow at Pairc Esler on Saturday afternoon.The home side started in a hurry and stormed into a - to - interval lead, Carlowrsquos only scores coming from two pointed frees.Down were strong in all departments, but they had the star of the show in Portaferryrsquos Niamh Mallon, who helped herself to -, with only three points coming from frees.Mallon received great support from Castlewellanrsquos Sorcha McCartan who helped set Down on their way with a cracking goal in the th minute to put her side - to - clear.Mallon grabbed Downrsquos second goal just after the break and a double from Catherine McGourty was the icing on the cake as the Downmanagement team emptied their bench.The only negative on the day came when Sara Louise Carr had to leave the action in the first half with what appeared to be a calf injury and she must now be a serious doubt for the big game with Derrry on July .Down sit top of their group alongside Tipperary with Derry only a point behind and a win against their Ulster rivals would surely secure a place in the last four.Down -Carlow -ALL-IRELAND ICC.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C July 17%2C 1979  ","story":"CASTLEWELLAN mdash Stormont officials were keeping tight-lipped this week about the prospect of finding new employment for  workers who have been dramatically paid off at two textile factories in the Castlewellan area.Redundancy notices went sent out last week to employees of the Moss Lane Spinning Company in Castlewellan and Standard Mills of Annsborough mdash but there is a chance they may be re-employedmoves to attract a new company to the vacated premises are successful.The official receiver, Mr Noel Stewart, who is the man heading the search for a new owner, said the two factories mdash operating as a joint company mdash had been plagued by ldquocatastrophic losses during the last  months.He stressed that he was optimistic that a new owner will be found and said the Department of Commerce had indicated that it will give every assistance to get the factories open again.A spokesman for the Department would only say that efforts were being made to get factories re-opened, but would not state the level of success.ldquoWe are trying to get another company to move into the premises at Castlewellan and Annsborough, but I am not prepared to say more than that at the moment, he said.Castlewellan councillor, Mr Eamonn OrsquoNeill, slammed the decision to close the factories and said it was a disaster for the area.Mr OrsquoNeill said he wanted immediate action to cope with the grim unemployment problem facing the people of Castlewellan and Annsborough.ldquoThe overall situation was poor before this dramatic turn of affairs, but the close of these two factories makes the situation disastrous, he said.ldquoThere is now no worthwhile employment opportunity on any reasonable scale in the area. This is a situation which calls for immediate action by all relevant government departments, public bodies and interested parties to encourage, promote and attract new employment to the area, he added.BRYANSFORD mdash On a day when there were ten separate attacks on Post Office property throughout the province, Bryansford Post Office was the target for a terrorist bomb and several post office cables in the area were cut.Last Tuesday the telephone operator received an anonymous callfrom a male at .am warning that a bomb had been planted at the post office.Local police went to the scene where they found that a booby-trap bomb had been left in a waste paper basket outside. An Army technical officer later arrived and the bomb was successfully defused.Around the same time Post Office cables were cut at Dromara Road and Castlewellan Road in Clough.NEWCASTLE mdash Fears that Newcastle would be overwhelmed by a wave of crime and vice during the holiday period proved unfounded, with the resort enjoying an ldquoextremely quiet period.The RUC said before the Twelfth holidays began that they would be swamping the provincersquos major holiday resorts, including Newcastle, in a bid to crack down on the growing problems of teenage drinking and drug-taking.Newcastle had no major incidents or arrests, except for four Belfast youths who are helping police with their inquiries into shoplting at the Gt House of Mourne on July .A police spokesman stressed, however, that patrols were stepped up during the holiday period, especially during weekends, chiefly because the population of the resort doubled during the summer months.Police said violence was the most common side effect of teenage drinking and they had asked publicans, off licence owners and hotels to be extra vigilant.The spokesman added that the police determination to crack down could only succeed with the help of the people who sold the drink.KILLYLEAGH mdash The Dunmore Hotel in Killyleagh changed hands over the holiday period and it may also be changing its name. The new owners are Mr Paul Green and his we Nancy, from Killinchy, and they have taken over the hotel from Mr Harry Briggs.The hotel was sold for an undisclosed sum of money, but it is believed to be in six figures. The new owners intend to extend and renovate the hotel, but hope that all work can be carried out without closing down the hotel.The short term plans include adding nine new bedrooms at the rear and extensively renovating the present accommodation.The owners intend to keep the present name for the time being, but they are contemplating reverting to the original name of the hotel, lsquoThe Treesrsquo.STRANGFORD mdash Shore sports proved every bit as popular as the sailing events at Strangford Regatta last week.Hundreds of holidaymakers flocked to the village to watch people of all age groups taking part in a host of events in the hot summer sun.The wide spectrum of events made it a day of fierce competition and fun for competitors and spectators alike and the organisers say they were amazed at the success of the sporting programme.Events included a fancy dress competition, round the houses race, rowing race and races for married men and women. Amusements were also provided for the children.PORTAFERRY mdash The Strangford to Portaferry swim was one of the highlights of Portaferry Gala Week, which began on Sunday and continues through until Saturday.The swim against the current, which is believed to be one of the fastest in Europe, took the most out of all eight competitors, who ranged in age from  to .But for Jacqui McIntyre, of Bangor Swimming Club, the swim proved comparatively easy. With her time of  minutes and  seconds, she won the ladiesrsquo section and also recorded the fastest time overall.The gala began on Sunday with a fun run and boat sea angling competition. It concludes this Saturday with the final of the talent competition and an open air dance.MOURNES mdash The Mourne Mountains are alive to the sound of music mdash music with a message which is about building bridges across the world.The area was the cockpit for an international roadshow arranged and rehearsed at break-neck speed around camp fires.

including the potential for further violence - during a meeting with local groups and political representatives in Armagh.In July, Sinn Fein president Mary Lou McDonald urged the Irish Government to start preparing for a border poll as the risk of a disorderly Brexit increased.Ms McDonald said a referendum on Irish unity could happen “very quickly”the UK crashed out of the EU at the end of October.Doug Beattie: Once again we urge the DUP to stop the HIU legacy scandal Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch  TrendingTributes paid to Northern Ireland road racer Darren Keys following fatal crash at WalderstownThe th Open Championship -

I also had the pleasure of meeting campaigners from across the UK as part of the Extinction Rebellion protests in Parliament.And I recently bumped into some students from Stanwell School who have been taking part in the climate strike movement and standing up for action on climate change and the climate emergency. I was glad to help get their and other constituentsrsquo voices heard on this in Parliament, because itrsquos not being debated enough - itrsquos getting lost behind other things.So whether itrsquos local action we can take on recycling and packaging, or global action on climate change and carbon emissions, we all need to do more to deal with an emergency thatrsquos going to affect us all for generations to come.I was out and about again in Penarth this weekend, along with a team of our fantastic Labour town and Vale councillors, talking to people about the forthcoming European elections. There was a lot of support for our clear Welsh Labour position backing a final say in a peoplersquos vote for the public on any Brexit deal.Following the mixed results in the local elections in England and Northern Ireland last week, there was much talk about Labour lsquobailing outrsquo the government. Let me be crystal clear on this ndash I will never lsquobail outrsquo the disastrous Tories on Brexit, and neither will the overwhelming majority of Labour MPs.We can resolve the situation, but not by any backroom stitch-up that would risk letting down both those who voted Leave and Remain. The only way forward out of this mess is to let the people have the final say on any deal. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

And under my leadership, a Conservative administration will proudly put the people of the Vale of Glamorgan first.ldquoNaturally, we are open to working with other councillors who share those ideals.ldquoOthers - including those who resigned from the Conservative party - will have to explain to voters where they stand on these issues - and I would urge them to back us, rather than propping up a Labour administration that was rejected by the Vale at the last election.Cllr Bailey said he had a six-point plan for the Vale.He pledged to deliver the Dinas Powys bypass stop inflation-busting council tax rises scrap proposed parking charges review the local development planto curb inappropriate development protect rural schools and oppose the Barry Biomass plant.Cllr Bailey said that he was also keen to improve engagement with the public, after a series of hugely unpopular decisions taken by the existing cabinet.He said: ldquoDuring the elections in , we promised to build a stronger relationship with local residents by consulting them on key decisions.ldquoUnfortunately, too many people feel that their views are simply being ignored and that Vale consultations are just tick box exercises. Take the proposals around car parking charges, or the closure of Llancarfan School. I donrsquot think anyone outside of the Civic Offices believes that those decisions werenrsquot already done deals, and thatrsquos simply unacceptable.ldquoAnother good example is the councilrsquos failure to listen to the public over Penarthrsquos original Victorian lamp posts.ldquoIrsquove been criticised for wanting to listen to the people who elected me, and I make no apologies for that. Under my leadership, thatrsquos exactly what would happen and whilst I do accept that there are dficult decisions to be taken, we have to take the public with us - not ignore their legitimate concerns. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Although a relative newcomer to the site, having previously taught in Newport, it is clear he is immensely proud of the students and staff.ldquoVisitors to the school often comment on the warm, friendly and purposeful environment that exists at Stanwell and, despite its size, they see how the school cares about the inidual child and their progress, he said.ldquoThe schoolrsquos Mission Statement is summarised as lsquoLearning to Excelrsquo and this is the vision for every child, whatever their starting points, interests or talents. The school thrives because we have a fantastic team of teachers, teaching assistants, support staff, parents and governors who help make this vision a reality.ldquoThis is what makes the school so successful because everybody gives so much.Wandering through a theatre the school uses to put on assemblies and biannual productions, Mrs Kynaston pointed out a section of floor that moved away to create an orchestral pit. The production value afforded to every department ndash theatre, maths, sports, English ndash was astounding.ldquoWe try to give our pupils the very best, said Mrs Kynaston. ldquoWe want them to truly reach their potential. To excel.Mr Brown agreed. ldquoOur amazing staff believe in every young personrsquos potential to succeed and really do go the lsquoextra milersquo for pupils, he said. ldquoOur pupils flourish academically but also as well rounded, confident young people ready to contribute to society.The extra-curricular provision at the school is broad and this really helps to develop our students confidence and skills beyond the classroom setting.That extra-curricular provision is a key focus for the school.Lessons finish at .pm, earlier in the day than most other schools, but that affords pupils plenty of time to take on other pursuits.The school offers a huge number of activities, ranging from the expected - rugby, football, hockey, theatre and orchestra - to the esoteric, like German Film Club or Cipher Club.School trips in recent years have taken students to such exotic destinations as Costa Rica, Iceland, Borneo, Morocco, Spain, Germany, France, and Italy, allowing students to soak in culture both at home and abroad.Clearly, a huge pupil base allows for a huge number of options.The schoolrsquos ability to bring such a population to the table, and keep them focussed, has produced excellent results.In the last fty years alone, it has produced Olympians, rugby internationals, Members of Parliament and television presenters.It has ties to Nasa, and men who walked on the moon have visited the school for talks.Its most curious claim to fame comes in the form of a mascot painted on a wall.Emma Davies, a former pupil of the school, had a design chosen as the official Welsh Wenlock ndash the Olympic mascot for the London  games.But Stanwell flourishes academically, as well.In its  GCSE results,  per cent of Stanwell pupils achieved at least their expected grades, compared to  per cent of the rest of Wales. The same story went for maths, with  per cent again hitting their expected target or better, against  per cent of Wales.       ,params: .pushAt A level,  per cent of all grades were A* or A, with  per cent of the year group achieving A* to C overall.A level results put Stanwell students amongst the top performers in Wales, with many iniduals securing exceptional grades.  of themachieved the equivalent of three A grades or better.Three of its pupils went to Oxford University last year, while another earned a place at Cambridge University.Mr Brown said: ldquoWe place a large emphasis on listening to our learners and and our pupils make a dference as leaders in the school, whether itrsquos through well established groups such as our school council, eco-committee or charity committee, or in aspects of teaching and learning where we have subject prefects and learner voice groups.ldquoThey help us evaluate our work as a school and plan for the future.ldquoWhat always comes through is how proud they are of their school.Rightly so. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log        ,params: .push-- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The renaming of our on-air studio to ldquoThe John Wilce Studio was a popular choice to recognise his outstanding dedication.ldquoJune  wouldrsquove been Johnrsquos th birthday, so this we felt really was a fitting tribute and a lovely memorial to all those who knew him, as a constant reminder of his contribution to Radio Glamorgan.Mr Wilce regularly presented on Sunday evenings, often dedicating features to listeners. Without fail he played a Beatles track every time he was on air.When Mr Wilce was off-air, he oversaw and maintained broadcast equipment, actively engaged in fundraising and stood as a trustee, assisting with the day-to-day running of the station.Jamie added: ldquoI speak on behalf of everyone at RG to say it was a privilege to know John, not only as a fellow volunteer but as a friend. He always put everyone  first and his patience was beyond words. His music knowledge was phenomenal and the impact he had on everyone he met, not just at Radio Glamorgan has really come to light since his passing.Michelle Fowler, volunteer services manager at Cardf and Vale University Health Board, said: ldquoItrsquos such a wonderful tribute to rename the studio after John. He really made an impact on our wards and with our patients who listened to his shows.ldquoItrsquos such a lovely way to mark not only Johnrsquos birthday but also to mark the contribution he made as a volunteer during Volunteersrsquo Week. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has also cast doubt on the future of the proposed Dinas Powys bypass, and say he believes the Barry Incinerator will be required to draw up an environmental impact assessment ndash which campaigners have been calling for.Cllr Moore and the councilrsquos new deputy leader Lis Burnett gained control of the authority in May.Their priorities include balancing the councilrsquos budget and preserving vital services for the most vulnerable in the face of a need to make pound million of savings over the next two years, as well as regeneration and building more homes, and improving school buildings.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWersquore going to be open and transparent and be prepared to work with people.

We believe it is important that all families feel welcome in the school. Education is a partnership between home and school with a shared responsibility based on trust and mutual understanding and the co-operation and participation of parents with our school in the education of their child is positively encouraged.ldquoA good relationship between school and home builds a childrsquos confidence, aids their learning and helps them to fulfil their potential in all areas.They stressed that the children had an equal say in their education, through the use of techniques like lsquoImmersion Daysrsquo ndash where pupils have a multi-sensory experience of any given topic.These learning opportunities have ied from using LEGO in building new robot designs and solving problems, to visits from STEM experts. businesses and education experts.The pupils develop a basis from these experiences from which to draw questions and interests, while the staff ask for pupilsrsquo ideas about how they would like to learn further.ldquoWe recently we had an Immersion Day on the topic of volcanoes, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoA few of the pupils mentioned ways they would like to learn more about the subject. When we followed their suggestions a few weeks later, they were incredibly enthused ndash it really focuses them, develops their engagement.These pioneering techniques of giving the children an equal say in their education have a proven record.Albert Primary featured in Estynrsquos lsquoRecognising excellence in education and trainingrsquo publication for its innovative approach.The publication said: ldquoThe school provides pupils with an excellent range of high quality learning experiences.Mr Gilbert said: ldquoMost importantly the inspection report captures the ethos of our school and, in particular, it confirmed that we are achieving our aim to make the school a happy and secure place in which pupils grow in confidence and independence.Albert Primary also earned an award for being the top performing primary school in Wales in recognition of their implementation of the Renaissance Reading programme, and the impact it has on their childrenrsquos reading progress.The staff were experienced and enthusiastic. During the tour, I was treated to a brief rehearsal of the schoolrsquos summer production ndash The Lion King. The youngsters performing looked genuinely thrilled to be involved, and were remarkably talented singers.There is plenty of sport provision, with the deceptively spacious grounds playing host to several open tarmac areas and courts. Football, basketball, rounders, cycling and more were on offer, along with chess, drama and music clubs. For those looking to go off school site, Belle Vue Park is feet away from the front entrance, and often works with the school.This year, Albert Primary has been awarded the prestigious Platinum Flag Award after previously gaining three Green Flag Awards thanks to the environmental education programme, Eco-Schools.But no school is without its problems.A major concern for Albert Primary is having to balance a large deficit budget. In order to do so the school has lost a number of agency learning support staff, with the deputy head taking on a greater teaching commitment next year to make up for the shortfall.Another blow came after four years of saving and planning to convert a disused toilet block into a teaching and community centre.The funds, totalling pound,, had to be used to offset the deficit budget instead. The proposal was to refurbish the existing outbuilding to provide a new classroom facility for the oversubscribed main school to use, alongside the community.The governors are currently creating a task group of stakeholders to address future funding sources.But the spirits of the pupils and staff have not been dampened by financial dficulties.ldquoI believe that we are extremely fortunate in Albert Primary to have created such a positive and vibrant environment in which our children can learn, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoIt is the dedication and commitment of its staff and everyone associated with the school that makes Albert Primary the school that it is today ndash successful, happy and continually improving.Albert Primary was founded in  to accommodate all ages of children up to school leaving age.Much of its original character has been preserved and it now holds Grade  listed status. The school has some unusual Victorian artwork by Norton Nante and parts of the school were designed by highly respected Victorian architect J Coates Carter.A Victorian mural on the front of the building shows several children hard at work. One of them is holding a pet mouse on a lead.It is clear that this quirky attitude to learning has been present and successful in the school for a long time.Long may it last. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This, coupled with the feedback from the schoolchildren we work with through our community outreach programme, was enough for us to want to do something about it.ldquoWhatrsquos a girl to do follows Ellie as she sets out on her quest to be an engineer ndash but the road isnrsquot easy. Her classmates think shersquos odd, her best friend, Flo, doesnrsquot understand, her brother says she canrsquot, and her grandad is behaving strangely. Ellie doesnrsquot want to give up on her dream and the book seesshe can make it in a world that can be so negative.Penarth author Alison Powell has been involved from the projectrsquos beginning and helped bring Ellie and her family and friends to le.Ms Powell said: ldquoWhen I was approached I was delighted ndash as a mother of two children, I know how important it is to re-enforce positivity through all aspects of le, to challenge stereotypes and ensure they know they can strive for any career they choose, regardless of gender, race or orientation.Evan, a year two Rhws Primary pupil, said: ldquoI loved the bit in the story where Ellie got a job. People didnrsquot think she could be an engineer, but she proved them wrong.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

There are  seats in the upper house ndash which does not choose the prime minister ndash about half of which are elected every three years.Mr Abe welcomed the result, saying it reflects a public mandate for his policies.He said ldquoI believe the people chose political stability, urging us to pursue our policies and carry out diplomacy to protect Japanrsquos national interests. -- vw,vw,px, px\"Shinzo Abe celebrates  --The results appeared to match or even exceed pre-election polls that indicated Mr Abersquos ruling bloc was to keep ground in the upper house, with most voters considering it a safer choice over an opposition with an uncertain track record. To reach the two-thirds majority, or  seats, Mr Abe needs  more seats by his ruling bloc and supporters of a charter change.Opposition parties have focused on concerns over household finances, such as the impact from an upcoming % sales tax increase and strains on the public pension system amid Japanrsquos ageing population.Mr Abe has led his Liberal Democratic Party to five consecutive parliamentary election victories since . -- vw,vw,px, px\"Vote-counting in Tokyo  --He has prioritised revitalising Japanrsquos economy and has steadily bolstered the countryrsquos defences in the backdrop of North Korearsquos missile and nuclear threats and Chinarsquos growing military presence. He has also showcased his diplomatic skills by cultivating warm ties with US President Donald Trump.Mr Abe was hoping to gain enough upper house seats to boost his chances for constitutional revision, his long-cherished goal before his term ends in . Mr Abe needs approval by a two-thirds majority in both houses to propose a revision and seek a national referendum. His ruling bloc already has a two-thirds majority in the more powerful lower house.But Mr Abe and his conservative backers face challenges because voters seem more concerned about their jobs, the economy and social security. -- vw,vw,px, px\"Yukio Edano, leader of the opposition Constitutional Democratic Party  --The main opposition Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan and three other liberal-leaning parties teamed up in some districts. They stressed support for gender equality and LGBT issues mdash areas Mr Abersquos ultra-conservative legislators are reluctant to back.At a polling station in Tokyorsquos Chuo district on Sunday, voters were ided over Mr Abersquos six-and-a-half-year rule.A voter who identied himself only as a company worker in his s said he chose a candidate and a party that have demonstrated an ability to get things done, suggesting he voted for Mr Abersquos ruling party and its candidate, as ldquothere is no point in casting my vote for a party or a politician who has no such abilities.Another voter, Katsunori Takeuchi, a -year-old fish market worker, said it was time to change the dominance of Mr Abe and his ultra-conservative policies.ldquoI think the ruling party has been dominating politics for far too long and it is causing damage, he said..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: Japan us ruling coalition secures upper house majority article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

I prefer to get my sessions out of the way at the start of the day as I just couldn’t face the gym in the evening..amI normally start my day at our offices in Holywood with a quick meeting with our head of finance and head of production.

Ulster Business speaks to director Clare Kelly about a burgeoning firm which is leading the way in more than just business, but connectivity, co-working and wellness for its members Eighteen years ago and in its early stages of infancy, Glandore began its le in one building at Fitzwilliam Square in Dublin – capable of hosting just  members.Fast forward to the present day and it’s an all-island business with an -strong workforce across nine locations in Belfast, Dublin and Cork – playing host to as many as , people. And it’s very much a family-owned and run business, led by founder Michael Kelly with daughters Clare, Fiona and Rebecca each as directors within the company.Glandore’s high-end flexible working spaces have been up-and-running in Belfast for  years – with capacity for  members across its two locations here. However, the family’s connection to the city dates back to , when Michael first bought - Arthur Street, now Arthur Place.It’s been at the forefront of attracting some of the leading international foreign direct investmentto Belfast, working closely alongside Invest NI to bring in cyber-security and technology firms from the US and beyond – first setting up here in . Glandore offers its members a wide iety of flexible office space, co-working and hot-desking – designed so companies can grow organically. But it’s also focused on bringing its members together, connecting indigenous and international firms, while also considering wellness in the workplace, and improving its green credentials. Clare Kelly is a director of the family business – a qualied occupational therapist and Trinity College graduate, who joined Glandore in .She’s now tasked with focusing on the key marketing and business development elements of the burgeoning company – attracting and retaining members, and ensuring there remains a strong pipeline of clients.“We offer our members a erse range of services,” Clare tells Ulster Business. That includes short-term hot-desking for small businesses with just a handful of employees, to providing flexible high-end office space for companies with dozens, or hundreds of workers.”And while the flexibility allows firms to scale from small numbers to a larger workforce – taking short-term space for as little as just three months – Clare says many of the companies stay for several years, orto Glandore further down the line in their own business journey.“We also host a range of events, and can bring everyone together through the network of our members. That has allowed us to cater from very early start-ups, right through to the largest multi-national company, or scaling FDI business,” Clare says.“The dference with Glandore is the flexibility. A company may wish to bring in one or two people, and then concentrate on recruitment – but they can then scale with their growth, from say  to  people. “That flexibility and scale is key. In terms of Glandore, we are offering high quality space, but also offering a range of business services to our members.”Across its two Belfast city centre flexible workspace buildings, Glandore’s expanding network means it can now host around  members – with locations at Arthur House and the nearby Arthur Place.It has six locations in Dublin, including the Silicon Docks and Central Business District, and has boasted a long list of foreign direct investment firms, including Facebook, Twitter, Dropbox and Smartbox, and has also opened its newest office space building in Cork city.Glandore has forged strong relationships with Invest NI – helping provide high-end working environments for rapidly expanding FDI businesses – along with Belfast City Council, the Belfast Chamber and Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry.Some of its high profile international current, or former members, include cyber-security experts Rapid , digital marketing firm Bazaarvoice and global payments giant Cayan – a company which has now expanded into its Belfast headquarters at City Quays.The quality and bespoke nature of the offices are part of what helps Glandore stand out from the crowd. Clare says firms are able to specy exactly what they want, with a top-end design and fit-out team on hand to develop a specic working environment for each business.“When Glandore was set up by Michael in , he always focused on a high quality working environment,” Clare says. “We take premium office space in premium locations, and there is no expense spared in fit-out.“We provide a bespoke set up – whether they need a co-working space or a virtual office, for example. We can tailor that for each business. It’s not a cookie-cutter approach.”And while she says design and the aesthetics are important, behind the decor is the IT and security infrastructure to ensure that guests have the very best available to them.“We have always invested heavily in our network, and have our own on-site IT. We have an IT director, manager and team – so there is support even before day one. All of these things are important to firms of all sizes.”For Glandore, it’s not simply about putting guests on seats – there’s much more to the offering. “We have such a erse mixture of companies in the network and community, and we are able to mix the indigenous firms with the international companies, and actively, facilitate connections between our members.”That includes an alumni programme, which sees members past and present ing to celebrate their successful partnerships.“We bring back customers from the last  years, and representatives from Invest NI and Belfast City Council. It’s about making the connections between the current scaling members and those which have come before,” Clare says.“That support is invaluable. It can be very isolating in the those days when you are setting up, so it’s great to have someone you can bounce ideas off.”Glandore goes further still, with the introduction of both the Glandore Wellness Programme and Glandore Green Initiative – the latter focused on creating a greener and more sustainable office space.“We have been working with these companies for several years, and we get a bird’s-eye view,” Clare says. “One thing we have been very mindful of is the need for us to support from a wellness perspective.“We offer a complimentary wellness programme, which started in , long before it became a buzzword. It offers a way for our members to connect with each other, and help in retaining talent.”And while almost every business has experienced some Brexit-related impact, Clare says Glandore has reached its highest occupancy rate in its history – rising to % in Belfast.“It has been a very uncertain time and that has impacted businesses across Northern Ireland. There have been some delays in regards to FDI, but our hats go off to Invest NI which still attracting businesses into Northern Ireland.”And while there’s also scope for further growth in Belfast, there’s potential for that demand to move outside Belfast, with a potential to grow into the North West.“The hope is to continue our expansion as an all-island business, having operated on both sides of the border for  years, with capacity to grow the businesses in Belfast.“With the likes of Derry, that would be something on the agenda for Invest NI as part of its remit to win investment for outside Belfast. We will take the lead from the councils and from Invest NI, and we will look to see where we can add. If there isn’t space for a business to land, people will go where.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/nstreet1.jpg","title":"belfasts north street arcade to be redeveloped","story":"Posted on Tuesday  June  by John Mulgrew A former Belfast shopping arcade left derelict after being gutted in a blaze more than a decade ago could be brought back to le amid fresh development plans.

It’s been sitting empty for  years, but once played host to a range of popular Belfast stores, including DJ and local punk pioneer Terri Hooley’s record shop, Good Vibrations. The plans to redevelop the arcade are included in a revised scheme called Tribeca Belfast – formerly Royal Exchange. UK developer Castlebrooke is planning to redevelop much of the north side of the city centre as part of a £m scheme. It’s made a number of amendments and changes to the development, most notably revising back from a formerly retail-led scheme to one with fewer shops. Tribeca Belfast includes development around Royal Avenue, Donegall Street, North Street, Garfield Street and High Street. Castlebrooke Investments says it is now committed to bringing North Street Arcade back into use in a new format, with space designed for independent retailers. It has also been announced that architectural design firm Squire  Partners has been appointed to work on the amended proposals. The team from Squire  Partners will work alongside conservation architects from Belfast-based Consarc Design Group. Neil Young, chief executive of Castlebrooke Investments, said: “We are very pleased to be able to reveal our proposed amendments to our outline planning application for Tribeca Belfast, changes which we feel demonstrate that we have listened to feedback from the city. “We will continue to listen and today we have launched a voluntary public consultation process into these planned changes ahead of the submission of our application. Our community exhibition will provide an opportunity for anyone interested to see the new plans and we will be revealing more information about this in the coming weeks.” Murray Levinson, partner at Squire  Partners, said: “The mix of uses across the site – designed to attract a iety of retail, restaurant, cultural and workplace tenants – and the creation of new public realm, will ensure this part of Belfast will be active throughout the day and into the evening. Providing a large number of residential apartments with shared gardens, as well as a hotel, will create a new opportunity for people to live in the city centre.” And Graeme Moore, specialist conservation architect at Consarc Design Group, said: “Consarc Design Group is delighted that we continue to be involved with the proposals for Tribeca Belfast to offer our expertise in building conservation. As with the previous proposals, all of the listed buildings within this phase are to be retained, restored and adapted for a sustainable ongoing use within the masterplan, rooting the new development in the unique historical character of this part of the city centre.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/droad_1.jpg","title":"major new apartment building planned for dublin road","story":"Posted on Friday  June  by John Mulgrew The Dublin Road in Belfast A new serviced apartment building could be developed along Belfast’s so-called ‘Golden Mile’ on the Dublin Road, it can be revealed.
